The overall aim of the CASA study is to investigate the role of PLD as adjuvant chemotherapy for older postmenopausal women for whom chemotherapy is indicated, but standard regimens, derived from trials in younger women, are assumed to be too toxic or inconvenient. Some investigators are likely to choose no adjuvant cytotoxic therapy as a standard for frail patients at advanced age, while others will prefer to offer SOME treatment for all patients with endocrine nonresponsive disease. In order to take into consideration both attitudes towards the same problem, the IBCSG has designed two individual complementary randomized options in order to investigate the role of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy for postmenopausal women at advanced age with endocrine nonresponsive early breast cancer.
Option 1 (designed for patients who, according to the treating physician and/or to the patient's preferences, are candidates to receive no adjuvant therapy):
a. PLD
b. No treatment
Option 2 (designed for patients who, according to the treating physician and/or to the patient's preferences, should receive some adjuvant treatment):

b. low dose metronomic cyclophosphamide and methotrexate (CM)
Note: Caelyx® (Doxil®), a PLD, is the experimental treatment.

Larger operable and locally advanced tumours are associated with a poorer prognosis and a high risk of micrometastatic disease and require aggressive multimodality therapy. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy remains the core of most pre or postoperative chemotherapy regimens for early or locally advanced breast cancer unless contraindicated.

These patients may or may not proceed to a liver resection. The treating doctor will monitor each patients progress and determine if the patient is medically stable to undergo such an invasive procedure, once chemotherapy treatment has ceased. The patients who proceed to liver resection are given the opportunity to take part in stage two of this study. Chemotherapy would most likely be 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). Dose and mode are dependant on the patients treatment as deemed appropriate by the oncologist. Duration: Approximately 9 months

·Stage two involves comparing patients who have had chemotherapy treatment with patients who have not had chemotherapy for their colorectal liver metastases. This stage is designed to see how quickly the liver regenerates after chemotherapy and surgery compared to patients who have not undergone chemotherapy. Patients from stage one who are able to have liver resection surgery will be given the opportunity to join stage two of the study.

ACTRN12607000096459,ANZ 8613: A Phase III trial to evaluate additional versus substitution endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer,"ANZ 8613 is a phase III study evaluating the subsitution versus addition of endocrine therapy at the point of disease progression in patients with advanced breast cancer.

Eligible patients are randomised to one of two treatment arms:
Arm A: Continue tamoxifen + MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)
Arm B: Stop tamoxifen + begin MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)

In Arm A, tamoxifen is administered in oral tablet form, at the same dose and schedule the patient is receiving at baseline (ie at the time of progressive disease).
In both Arm A and Arm B, MPA is administered orally in a daily dose of 500 mg, commencing on the day of randomisation.

Patients randomised to Arm B should stop (non-protocol) tamoxifen prior to commencing protocol therapy with MPA.

For both Arms, patients should remain on only the randomised treatment for a minimum of four (4) weeks before any progressive disease is confirmed or new treatment introduced.

scan should be carried out as medically indicated to rule out metastatic disease.
Bilateral mammogram performed within 12 months prior to randomisation unless the
initial surgery was a total mastectomy in which case a unilateral mammogram may be
performed. A mammogram is not required if the patient has had a bilateral mastectomy.
Bone health must be evaluated prior to randomisation and be deemed clinically as
adequate. A Bone Mineral Density Scan (DXA Scan) of hip, femoral neck, or lumbar
spine must be performed within 12 months prior to randomisation and the T-score must be greater than or equal to minus 4.0. (Note: Spinal x-rays to assess for low trauma vertebral fractures are also
strongly recommended).

The workbook was based on cognitive-behavioural strategies and emotional-expression, and encouraged women to actively process and engage in issues of relevance to them.  It contained sections on (i) maintaining the medical partnership, (ii) physical well-being, (iii) feeling alone, (iv) family and friends, (v) emotional recovery, (vi) spirituality, (vii) seeking closure, (viii) moving forward, (ix) living the life you want, and (x) local and national resources.

For patients recieving less than or equal to 6 weeks of Imatinib will be classified as either exon 9/WT or exon 11. Patients will initially receive 400mg/day of imatinib (also known as Glivec) administered orally in tablet form. Patients will then receive an escalated dose up to 800mg/day imatinib. The timing of dose escalation will depend on the patient KIT mutational status (exon 9/WT or exon 11) and their early response to treatment. For patients who have received more than 6 weeks of imatinib they will continue on at a dose of 400mg/day until RECIST-defined progression where the dose will be escalated up to 800mg/day depending on the patient's response to treatment.

delivery by specialist Psychology staff) 

Patients in the CB coping with BR condition will individually attend the clinic approximately 3-5 days prior to their first scheduled chemotherapy session, for a 90-minute CB coping session. The session will incorporate a tour of the clinic and information on the sequence of events that will transpire when the patient comes in for their first chemotherapy session, including the relaxation protocol. The patient and their family will be shown a short video of a coping model undergoing chemotherapy. The Psychologist will be involved in assisting the patient to implement the strategies outlined in the video within the context of a CB coping framework. They will be encouraged to ask questions, liaise with their GP for support and will be given information on how to cope with specific side-effects. At each of the 5 chemotherapy sessions, up to 30 minutes will be spent review reviewing the CB coping session will be discussed and any questions or issues will be discussed within a CB model. In addition, at the patients first chemotherapy session, the BR protocol  (a relaxation session of up to 30 minutes) will also be implemented as described below.


Intervention Group 2: Behavioural relaxation (BR) only: (Can be delivered by nursing and allied health
staff)

Participants in the BR only condition will individually attend the clinic approximately 3-5 days prior to their first scheduled chemotherapy session, for a 30-minute teaching session on progressive relaxation and a tour of the clinic. During the first chemotherapy session, the patient will be guided through the progressive relaxation, followed by a guided imagery exercise to encourage a deeper state of relaxation. This process will take approximately 30 minutes. During the guided imagery phase a nurse will begin the drug infusion. After chemotherapy, the relaxation session will be brought to a close and the postchemotherapy dependent measures will be administered. The patient will be asked to practice the relaxation session at home. The second and third chemotherapy sessions will be identical to the first. During the fourth and fifth sessions, the patient will be instructed to self-administer the relaxation and guided imagery procedures. Patients performance in this condition is of interest due to its greater applicability and ease of implementation by staff (e.g., nurses). 
Chemotherapy occurs in ""cycles"" and varies somewhat between patients. Cycles generally include at least six separate attendances (""sessions"") that may take between six and eighteen weeks to complete, depending on the individual's chemotherapy regime. i.e. some subjects will be attending chemotherapy weekly, whilst others may attend fortnightly or three-weekly. Thus the duration of the overall intervention will be between six and eighteen weeks.
Finally it is important to note that the chemotherapy component of each session (attendance) can take between 30 minutes and five hours, depending on their regime. The CB and/or BR components each occupy 30 minutes during the early part of he chemotherapy session. When the BR or combined CB/BR intervention has concluded, subjects will be invited to continue to apply the coping techniques as and when required during any remaining time of their chemotherapy session.",CODE: Other interventions,Individuals undergoing outpatient chemotherapy for cancer for first time.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging modality using radiopharmaceuticals labelled with positron emitting isotopes (such as fluorine-18), aimed at imaging various metabolic processes in vivo. Newer PET scanners are always combined with a computed tomography scanner (PET/CT), allowing  combination of PET images with anatomical CT images in order to localize precisely any PET abnormality. 18F-fluorocholine (FCH) is a PET radiopharmaceutical for imaging the metabolism of choline, a precursor of cell membranes, which is increased in tumoural cells with high cell membrane turnover, such as prostate cancer cells.  The participant is given an injection of FCH prior to PET/CT scanning.
Participants will receive between 1 and 3 trial scans (CT+WBBS and/or FCH-PET/CT), as first and second-line imaging modalities.  Then 6 months following the completion of treatment (of maximum 6 months duration), or after 12 months surveillance, participants will receive between 1 and 3 follow-up scans.  Those patients who receive long term hormonal treatment will not receive mandated follow-up scans 
Patients are randomized to either  18F-fluorocholine positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FCH-PET/CT) or Conventional Imaging (CI)which is a combination of computed tomography (CT) and whole-body bone scan (WBBS). The randomized group determines which modalit(ies) (FCH-PET/CT or CI) the participant will have as the first-line imaging work-up. Then, the participants will receive the alternate imaging (CI or FCH-PET/CT) as a second-line imaging work-up if the first-line was negative/equivocal for distant metastasis.

ACTRN12609000512224,Cone Beam Computed Tomography image guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer to improve treatment accuracy and outcomes.,"Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with low-energy x-rays is a new image-guidance modality in external beam radiotherapy that permits diagnostic-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional images of a patient to be acquired while lying in the actual treatment position under a medical linear accelerator.  Computed Tomography requires multiple projection images of the patient to be acquired over a 180degree or 360 degree rotation of the imaging device.  CBCT is hence similar to the more ubiquitous Computed Axial Tomography (CAT) scanners used in diagnostic radiology, except in the mathematical details of filtered back-projection and axial reconstruction from a conical projection of diagnostic x-rays.  The high quality of soft-tissue definition in CBCT allows the full spatial extent and orientation of the prostate gland to be imaged routinely with minimal additional radiation exposure, and CBCT does not depend on any invasive implantation of fiducial markers.

CBCT therefore provides the most comprehensive information about the prostate, bladder and rectum status, and can be used immediately prior to radiation to correct for the displacement of the prostate gland with sub-millimeter accuracy.  Hence, the highest degree of treatment accuracy is made feasible with CBCT and this technique can itself be used as a diagnostic-quality reference against which the accuracy of conventional portal imaging of bony landmarks and other fiducial-based methods can be benchmarked.

The additional radiation dose (in excess to the prescribed radiation dose) to the patient due to the low-energy x-rays used in CBCT has been measured by an accredited medical physicist according to International Electrotechnical Commission standards, and the additional dose would not exceed a volume weighted integral dose of 3 centigray (cGy) per CBCT scan in the imaging area.  For relative comparison, the dose to the clinical target volume for each fraction of treatment is 200 cGy.  Hence, even in a worst-case estimate where CBCT were prescribed for each fraction of treatment, the additional imaging dose would amount to no more than 0.15% of  the radiation treatment dose.  The increased accuracy of radiation delivery to a mobile target, such as a prostate gland, concommitantly with improved sparing of adjacent organs-at-risk leading to reduced risk of radiotherapy-related side effects arising from the additional x-radiation exposure.

The radiation therapy dose prescribed for patients in phase 1 is 7400cGy in 37 fractions at 200cGy per daily fraction, 5 fractions per week, over 7 and a half weeks. The imaging x-ray dose due to weekly CBCT (7 scans) is 21 cGy.

The radiation therapy dose prescribed for patients in phase 2 is 7400cGy in 37 fractions at 200cGy per daily fraction, 5 fractions per week, over 7 and a half weeks. Phase 2 will recruit different patients to those used for Phase 1 of the study.  The imaging x-ray dose due to daily CBCT in the first 3 fractions followed by weekly scans (10 in total) is 30 cGy.

Phase 3 is purely digital re-analysis of image data already collected in phase 2, involving clinical assessment of a novel technique of mathematical image reconstruction.  Hence no additional patients are to be recruited in Phase 3 (the data used will be from patients who attend phase 2) and no additional scans will be required.",CODE: Treatment: Other,"Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma Localised prostate cancer of any T-stage Gleason score and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)

ACTRN12609000590268,A pilot study of the role of CD133+ as a cell marker for human haematopoietic stem cells,"Therapeutic transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is an increasing area of interest in 
medicine. In autologous stem cell transplantation, there is the ability to harvest stem cells soon after 
chemotherapeutic treatment, and then cryo-preserve and store such cells for stem cell transplantation at a later date. 
CD34 is the typical cell marker used to identify HSCs for transplantation. There exist certain limitations to CD34+ HSCs which include its expression on cells not capable engraftment, and also on acute leukaemic cells. CD133 is an alternative cell surface marker on HSCs which could prove useful in identifying cells for 
transplantation. Preliminary research suggests that CD133 is a more primitive marker, which is expressed 
by early progenitor cell line, and it has the additional advantage of not being expressed on acute leukaemic 
cells. 
The Launceston General Hospital is the site for stem cell harvest for the North and North-West of Tasmania. 
Annually, approximately 20-30 patients undergo stem cell harvest typically one time over few days (majority of patients can successfully harvest over 1-2 days), which usually lasts few hours on each harvest day depending on the amount of cell harvested with the aim of later transplantation. This project is a pilot study to evaluate the value of CD133 in addition to the usual marker CD34+ as a cell marker for HSCs while using the current protocol for stem cell harvest. There is currently little data on the validity of 
CD133 as a HSC marker, and this project, as a part of Master degree at the School of Human Life Sciences at the University of Tasmania, aims to add to the current data and potentially identify the role of CD133 as HSC marker.",CODE: Diagnosis / Prognosis::||::CODE: Not applicable,Patients requiring stem cell harvest at the Launceston General Hospital with subsequent stem cell transplantation .,Patients under 18 years of age.

ACTRN12609000594224,"Study of chromosomal abnormalities by fluorescent in-situ-hyberdisation (FISH),  and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in Multiple Myeloma patients and correlations with treatment outcomes.","Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell dyscrasia resulting in high levels of monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) production leading to immunosuppression and other physiological disturbances. 
A median survival of about 2 years is usually obtained with conventional chemotherapy, however trials using 
high-dose therapy with subsequent autologous stem cell rescue have improved the remission rate, event-free survival, and overall survival (OS) in certain cohorts of patients. Various chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in MM patients but the 13q- and t(4:14) abnormalities are present in over 50% of abnormal plasma cells in these patients though the clinical significance of this has not been elucidated. Reports have linked the presence of the 13q- abnormality with 
altered therapeutic responses to common treatments. 
Strong evidence now indicates that conventional cytogenetics fails to recognise about 50% of these abnormalities because of slow growth of MM cells in cell culture as compared to fluorescence in situ hyberdisation (FISH) or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Both techniques are representing molecular high technology methods studying and amplifying both cell nuecleus ontent Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and Ribonucleic acid (RNA) of myeloma cells. Furthermore FISH detects chromosomal aberration in both actively dividing cells and interphase nuclei. 
Therefore our approach utilises patients blood and bone marrow samples at time of diagnosis or relapse assessed by commercially available probes for FISH analysis on CD 138+ cells and 
reliably detects the prognostically significant genomic aberration, thus allowing clinicians to assess the 
biological risk of disease progression in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). The bone marrow studies will be performed as part of routine investigations for myeloma with extra 10 ml sample to conduct this research. The procedure takes approximately 30 min. 
This project will involve the validation of Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridisation (FISH) analysis of the 13q- and t(4:14) chromosomal abnormalities and development of rapid qPCR assays for the detection of these chromosomal abnormalities in bone marrow samples from denovo patients with MM. 
The aim of this project is to develop rapid qPCR assays for analysis of 13q- and t(4:14) chromosomal abnormalities and correlate the frequency of these abnormalities with treatment modalities and outcomes.

Technetium 99m-MIBI and whole body (magnetic resonance imaging) MRI scans will be studied at staging for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and during follow-up of existing patients. 

Technetium-99m (99mTc-sestamibi) has recently been proposed as a potential sensitive tool in early diagnosis of bone disease in multiple myeloma, as its increased uptake in the bone marrow has been reported as indicator of myeloma activity. 

Whole body MRI will be performed according to the study of Baur-Melnyk et al., published in 2007. Technetium 99m-MIBI will be administered in intravenously; thereafter anterior and posterior whole body scans will be obtained, using a large field of view gamma camera equipped with a low-energy high resolution microcast collimator.  A semiquantitative uptake score will be used and scintigraphic findings will be correlated with whole body MRI, clinical and laboratory data. 

For each patient a recent whole body MRI study will be available at the time of 99mTc-MIBI and the results of both techniques will be evaluated. 

Evaluation of Imaging Data
All images will be assessed by two expert radiologists (more than 10 years of experience in MRI and nuclear medicine. The skeleton will be divided into 61 regions. Every region will be evaluated in a as presence of lytic lesion (yes or no) for myeloma involvement. In MRI, myeloma involvement will be determined according to the published criteria for focal or diffuse disease. Focal myeloma involvement is defined as a focal area of low signal intensity on T1-weighted spin-echo images which will be found in the bone marrow corresponding to high signal intensity on STIR images consistent with focal accumulation of myeloma cells. Diffuse infiltration is defined as diffusely reduced signal on T1-weighted spin-echo images and increased on STIR images in the bone marrow and will be graded as low, intermediate or high grade.",CODE: Not applicable,Adult patients who are 18 years and above with confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma according to the Salmon and Durie/World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and attending for treatment at the Launceston General Hospital,Patients without bone involvement

Participants will be ineligible for the study if they have previously received radiation therapy, the radiation dose prescribed is less than 50 Gy and they are participating in other Quality of Life trials that might interfere with this study. 

Trial Design
This is a cross-sectional longitudinal descriptive study, which collects Quality of Life data alongside socio-demographic and clinical background data at three time points during the patients radiation therapy treatment. The following time points will be used to test for acute proctitis: 
1.	At least two (2) weeks prior to radiotherapy treatment (when they see their clinician);
2.	During the first (1st) week of treatment;
3.	At the end of treatment;
4.	At the three (3) to six (6) months scheduled follow-up appointment, after treatment completion.

Patients will be asked to complete the first questionnaire when they are seeing their clinician during a routine visit. On subsequent occasions the questionnaire will be either provided when they present for treatment or alternatively posted to them with reply paid envelopes so that patients can post these questionnaires back to them.

Administration of the questionnaire at these time points will facilitate evaluation of how the patients experiences of acute proctitis change as they proceed through treatment.  Socio-demographic details collected will include age, geographical location, education and clinical background data will include diagnosis, tumour site and radiation dose prescribed. Patients will be stratified by treating centre and tumour site.
   
A second group of participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at two time points once treatment is complete to measure chronic proctitis. The time points used will be 
1.	When patient is experiencing moderate to severe symptoms;
2.	When patient is experiencing minor to mild symptoms.


Patients who participate in the study will be asked to complete a demographics questionnaire, the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the proctitis module (EORTC QLQ-PRT23). They will then be asked to respond to the following questions as recommended by the EORTC quality of life group:
a)	How long did it take you to complete the questionnaire?
b)	Did anyone help you to complete the questionnaire?
c)	Were there questions that you found confusing or difficult to answer?
d)	Were there questions that you found upsetting?
The clinicians involved in treating these patients and identifying them for the study will be asked to complete the EORTC Tadiation Therapy Oncology Group classification system for each patient at each time point.

ACTRN12610000448044,Promoting Optimal Outcomes in Mood through Psychosocial Therapies for cancer patients: a randomised trial,"Patients who have low to mild distress or who have risk factors for becoming depressed will receive a self-directed resource suite which includes handbooks on coping with cancer, a relaxation CD, information about coping with stress and other information about topics such as sleep hygiene and exercise. Information is included about the availability of support through the Cancer Helpline. 
Patients who have mild to moderate depression/distress and/or risk factors for becoming depressed and a HADS score of 8 to 21 inclusive will receive tailored psychosocial therapy, aligned with patient needs as identified on patient self-report on the Distress Thermometer. 
The precise type of psychosocial therapy will vary depending on patient need, examples of which include:
i)	Practical concerns such as about finances; difficulty with domestic tasks: Therapy may include referral to Social Work; clarification of concerns; structured problem-solving; challenging black and white thinking about the need to perform domestic tasks; re-assigning priorities. 
ii)	Family - concerns about children: Therapy components may include empathic listening; acknowledgment of concerns; explanation about children's needs; discussion about the benefits of maintaining routine; reassuring children that they have not caused the cancer. 
iii)	Emotional concerns, for example anxiety about chemotherapy: Therapy may include explanation and provision of information; identification of automatic thoughts; challenging negative cognitions; relaxation and guided imagery.
iv)	Physical concerns such as pain: Therapy would include referral for medical review; exploration of concerns about pain; identifying and challenging misbeliefs e.g. about becoming dependent on analgesia or that use of morphine implies inevitably poor prognosis; relaxation and guided imagery.
v)	Spiritual concerns such as shame about dependence, low sense of worth: Therapy would include dignity-conserving techniques e.g. exploration of past experiences, reflection on strengths; engaging in creative discussion about ways to feel in control; framing assistance as necessary to maintain dignity.
The psychosocial therapy will be delivered by health professionals from diverse backgrounds including nursing, radiation therapy or speech therapy who have undergone focused training. The training will be delivered through a structured self-directed educational manual, supplemented with a day-long skill development training session faciliated by one of the psychiatrist investigators at the specific Site. The duration of the training for participating health professionals will be approximately 10 weeks. During the delivery of the psychosocial therapy, all health professionals will participate in weekly clinical supervision conducted in group format with other participating health professionals at the respective Site, facilitated by one of the psychiatrist investigators, in order to monitor progress and ensure fidelity of the psychosocial intervention.
The therapy sessions will each be of maximum 30 minutes' duration, for a maximum of 4 sessions, delivered over 4 weeks.

ACTRN12610000457044,A comparison of the accuracy of two bowel cancer test kits in healthy people.,"The study is an open study designed to determine  the clinical specificity of the bowel cancer screening tests QuickVue(R) faecal immunochemical test (FIT) and to compare this to Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R).
A new immunochemical, faecal occult blood test (FOBT) QuickVue(R)FIT  has recently been developed, that incorporates features that may result in improved population participation.
These features relate to sampling process itself where a specimen is taken by inserting into the stool a small grooved probe instead of the more traditional spatula sampling; therefore the QuickVue(R) FIT device uses a stool sampling procedure where a small probe is inserted into the stool surface at multiple points and then transferred to a plastic container containing a stabilization solution which is then sealed. The test is then activated and a stable test result is generated which is concealed from the participant. 

The Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R) device is a guaiac (chemical) test, which employs a direct  stick-based faecal sampling method to collect a sample from a stool captured by defaecating onto a stool collection sheet held above toilet bowel water. The faecal sample is then smeared onto a collection card by the patient using a small wooden spatula, allowed to dry and sent to the developing laboratory using postal system approved packaging. 

Therefore one significant difference between these devices is that the Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R) uses a stick-based stool sampling method while the QuickVue(R) FIT uses a probe sampling method. While there are other inherent differences between the sampling methodologies used in the QuickVue(R) FIT and the Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R) test devices, a study based on a direct, per-stool comparison is practical. 

To complete both devices a total period of approximately 6 days, depending on bowel habit, is expected.

This study commenced enrolment 7 July 2009. Enrolment is expected to be completed in June/July 2010.

These tests are undertaken simultaneously using the same stool sample; i.e. the participant will use both the FOBT QuickVue(R) FIT and the Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R) device on the same sample of stool on three different occasions. 
All participants use the Hemoccult II(R) Sensa(R) device first followed by the QuickVue(R) FIT

1) Patient and Carer Communication Support Program - consists of one face-to-face meeting (approx. 90 mins) and one telephone follow-up (approx. 30 mins) with a specially trained nurse.

- The face-to-face meeting will encourage the patient and carer to reflect on and discuss their goals, wishes, preferences and concerns about care into the future and to discuss the challenges inherent in asking questions or communicating concerns with the patient's oncologist. They will also be guided through a new Question Prompt List targeting discussion of prognosis and end of life issues and assisted in selecting and prioritising any questions they may wish to ask in future consultations. Strategies to overcome barriers to asking these questions and to communication in the health care context in general will also be discussed. This face-to-face meeting will take place approximately 1 week prior to the audio-taped oncology consultation.

- The telephone follow-up will review the patient's next oncology consultation after the face-to-face meeting with the nurse to identify any new barriers or challenges, discuss solutions to these and further assist in identifying and prioritising questions to ask at future consultations. It will be completed approximately 1 week after the audio-taped consultation.

2) Oncologist Consultation Skills Training Program - consists of 2 components, an academic detailing session and facilitated role-play with a simulated patient, delivered in one one-on-one session by an experienced communication facilitator (approx. 90 mins).

- The academic detailing will review evidence and methodology for calculating prognosis and evidence and strategies for discussing life expectancy and end of life issues. A 'take home' pack will also be provided consisting of current literature and a DVD modelling ideal communication behaviours and responses to challenging questions from the Question Prompt List.

ACTRN12610000915055,A randomised phase II study of Carboplatin and Bevacizumab in Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme (advanced brain tumours) (CABARET study),"Part 1

Bevacizumab plus carboplatin versus bevacizumab alone.

In Part 1, patients will be randomised as follows:

Arm A: Bevacizumab 10mg/kg given intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks until disease progression
Arm B: Bevacizumab 10mg/kg given intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks + carboplatin AUC 5 given IV every 4 weeks until disease progression

Part 2 

Effects of continuing or stopping bevacizumab after disease progression.

Following disease progression in Part 1 patients who are able and who consent to continue onto Part 2 of the study will receive further treatment as follows:

Patients who were in Arm A of the study will commence carboplatin chemotherapy AUC 5 IV every 4 weeks until disease progression. If a patient decides with their doctor that they are not suitable for further chemotherapy, they will receive best supportive care rather than carboplatin. Best supportive care involves treatments to assist with controlling the symptoms of cancer such as antibiotics and pain medication. Patients will then be randomised to cease bevacizumab (Arm C) or continue bevacizumab 10mg/kg, 2 weekly until disease progression (Arm D). 

Patients who were in Arm B of the study will cease carboplatin and choose between two chemotherapy agents (temozolomide or etoposide) in consultation with their doctor. As above, patients who are not suitable for additional chemotherapy may elect to receive best supportive care rather than etoposide or temozolomide. Patients will then be randomised to cease bevacizumab (Arm E) or continue bevacizumab 10mg/kg, 2 weekly  until disease progression (Arm F).",CODE: Treatment: drugs,"For inclusion in this study, all of the following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled: 1.

Scans are performed on fresh (unfixed) ex vivo human breast tissue samples immediately after excision from the patient. No additional tissue is excised for this study  scans are performed on tissue that is excised as part of normal surgery. Image acquisition takes approximately 2-10 minutes.

(BN83495) in Patients Receiving an Oral Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor
(EGFR-TKI) for the Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung
Cancer (NSCLC)","BN83495 Dosage and Administration
BN83495 (also known as STX64 and 667-coumate) is a first in class inhibitor of steroid sulphatase (STS), currently in clinical development to target steroid dependent cancers. STS converts oestrone sulphate to oestrone, a precursor of oestradiol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a precursor of adrenal testosterone.
The oral dose of BN83495 is 40 mg daily, fasted (30 minutes before breakfast), given in the morning. BN83495 will be taken for 12 weeks.

BN83495 will be supplied by Ipsen Pty Ltd as tablets packed into conventional blister strips (10 tablets/blister).  

EGFR-TKI Dosage and Administration

The EGFR-TKI used in this study will be either Erlotinib or Gefitinib which will be taken for 12 weeks.

The oral dose of erlotinib is 150 mg daily, taken at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food.

The oral dose of gefitinib is 250mg daily, taken at least one hour before or two hours after the ingestion of food.  

In stratum A, patients with NSCLC requiring treatment with an EGFR-TKI will be pre-treated with BN83495  for 3 days prior to starting the EGFR-TKI.

a) via real-time video videoconferencing - with visual and audio information transmitted over videoconferencing, and with printed information (e.g., assessment stimulus items) being transmitted from the therapist's computer to the childs computer using remote access software.
b) via internet-based real-time video  with visual information transmitted over the internet, audio information transmitted over speaker phone, and printed information (e.g., assessment stimulus items) being transmitted from the therapists computer to the childs computer using remote access software.
The children will also complete the screening assessment in-person (comparator condition).  The order of these 3 conditions will be random.

Each screening assessment will take approximately 15 minutes, and the child will be assessed under all both telehealth conditions and also the in-person condition (comparator) on one day.  All conditions will be simulated at the Royal Children's Hospital (for the videoconferencing and internet-based conditions the therapist will be located in another part of the hospital).  The parent or caregiver will be present in the room with the child during all conditions.  Similar but different receptive and expressive language screening tasks will be administered in each condition to avoid the test-retest effect.  As each assessment is very short (15 minutes duration), there will be no wash-out period and the children will be assessed in each of the 2 telehealth conditions and also the comparator condition (in-person) consecutively.

Children will be divided up into two groups: the preschool-aged group (3  5 years) and the school-aged group (6  12 years).
The screening assessment for the preschool-aged group will consist of:
a) The Diagnostic Screener and Oromotor Assessment subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in both telehealth conditions and also the in-person (comparator) condition.
b) The Preschool Language Scale  4th Edition Screening Test (PLS-4 Screener) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in 1 condition only (random selection - may be administered in either of the telehealth conditions or the in-person (comparator) condition).
c) Selected items from the Preschool Language Scale  4th Edition (PLS-4) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  Selected items will be chosen to mirror similar items in the screening test.  Two different sets of items will be administered in the other two conditions (random selection).

The screening assessment for the 6  12 years age group will consist of:
a) The Diagnostic Screener and Oromotor Assessment subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in both telehealth conditions and also the in-person (comparator) condition.

Participants will be patients of the Department of Oncology and Palliative Care at Mater Heath Services, South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. 

Eligible patients are those receiving paracentesis for the management of symptomatic malignant ascites. 

Potentially eligible patients will be screened by research staff. Those that are eligible will be provided with all trial information and asked to provide written consent. Research staff will ensure that the patient understands the off-label use of bevacizumab and the potential toxicities. 

Therapeutic abdominal paracentesis using a Cardinal Health thoracocentesis/paracentesis catheter (REF:TPK1001) will be undertaken at the site of maximal fluid collection as identified by abdominal ultrasound. Ascitic fluid will be drained to dryness, or until there is less than 200ml/hr output from the drain. Maximum fluid removal at one time will be 5 litres, after this the drain will be clamped for two hours before further fluid is removed. Intravenous fluids will only be administered if clinically indicated. 

Prior to removal of the catheter, bevacizumab will be administered into the peritoneal cavity via an Alaris pump over 1 hour. The intraperitoneal catheter will be removed at the end of the infusion and a small transparent drainage bag placed over the drain site. 

The first five patients will receive a dose of 200mg intraperitoneal bevacizumab following paracentesis. Interim analysis of safety and preliminary efficacy will be performed after five patients. Treatment will be considered potentially efficacious if the median time to repeat paracentesis is greater than 14 days in >3 of these patients.

If the 200mg treatment is considered potentially efficacious at interim analysis and there are no serious adverse events effects thought directly attributable to intraperitoneal bevacizumab, a further five patients will receive 100mg intraperitoneal bevacizumab following paracentesis. 

If the 200mg treatment does not extend the time to repeat paracentesis to greater than 14 days, and in the absence of adverse effects, the next five patients will receive a dose of 300mg intraperitoneal bevacizumab following paracentesis.

ACTRN12611000318987,Development of a better screening test for bowel cancer.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death from cancer despite the fact that the disease is curable when detected in its early stages. Furthermore, CRC is preventable by a number of methods which include adenoma detection and removal

Studies of faecal occult blood testing have demonstrated that annual screening with such tests leads to a reduction in mortality

Studies clearly show that screening can also lower cancer incidence through the early detection and removal of precancerous polyps including adenomas.

Based on this evidence, to effectively decrease incidence at the population level, we need to identify and remove adenomas. The current methods for identifying people likely to have adenomas are largely ad hoc and limited.

Conversely, a sensitive and specific marker with strong positive predictive value for colorectal adenomas would provide an effective selection process for individuals to undergo colonoscopy, and polypectomy when an adenoma is found. 

The literature now describes a number of molecular characteristics of adenomas that may be useful in this setting but none of these has been explored for its value in blood or faeces. In addition, preliminary molecular studies here at Flinders University using materials from the tissue bank have identified approximately 67 genes that show promise differentiating adenomas from normal tissue
We now have a need to establish a clinical bank of relevant target clinical materials (specifically faeces and blood), that would allow us to determine the presence of these markers in faeces and blood and to relate them to the neoplastic status of patients.

Phase 1 research and research by others has identified several colorectal neoplasia-associated biomarkers in blood that may be useful, individually or together, for the development of new screening tests for early detection of colorectal neoplasia. 

Phase 2 of the research will evaluate the accuracy in larger population samples of several candidate biomarkers for detection of screen-relevant colorectal neoplasia, relative to a proven immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT, FIT) and the diagnostic test colonoscopy. The panel includes at least one candidate biomarker, KIAA1199, highly expressed in colorectal neoplasia relative to normal colonic epithelium, and which is also detectable in blood of CRC patients. 

To evaluate the accuracy of a panel of blood-based candidate biomarkers for detection of screen-relevant colorectal neoplasia, relative findings at colonoscopy, a commercial blood based test for CRC and to a proven faecal occult blood test (FOBT). 
We will invite participants who are scheduled for a colonoscopy to complete an FOBT (Faecal Occult Blood Test), on one occasion only, prior to their colonoscopy. 
The participant will be asked to collect a sample of approximately 0.5 g of stool using provided scoop and transfer the scoop with faeces into a double sealed, self-contained transport vessel that stabilizes and disperses the faecal sample for storage and transport. 
We will take one blood sample only just prior to the participants colonoscopy procedure. 
We will view the results (histopathology) of colonoscopy or/and any ensuing colorectal surgery

Phase 2b
Some patients resected for CRC will be subsequently diagnosed with further (recurrent) cancer, not necessarily located within the bowel. Some current simple methods to monitor patients for recurrence of CRC, such as CEA, are not optimal. A blood test using the biomarker panel may more sensitive for detection of recurrent cancers and blood samples will be assayed for our markers during monitoring as approved for serial sampling after diagnosis.
To explore this possibility, we first need to determine whether the CRC biomarkers we have identified are detectable in tumour tissues from both an initial and any subsequent cancer from the same patient. We propose an initial small retrospective observational sub-study within BiBCoN to determine the pattern of expression of the markers across time and tumour locations. One or both of the tumour samples would be derived from the Joint RGH and FMC Tissue Bank where patients have consented for tissue to be accessed for research. Where possible the level of expression of other clinical biomarkers for recurrent cancer may be determined on the same tissue samples. 
If both samples from the same patient prove to be positive for the biomarker test panel in a small initial sample, further prospective studies using tissues and blood from patients with recurrent cancer will be proposed to explore the feasibility of the blood test to detect cancer recurrence.Each patient will be followed for 2 years

Each booklet addresses one of the following challenges: 1) symptom management, 2) communicating effectively with health care professionals, 3) supporting your partner, and 4) managing worries and emotions. For each challenge, specific coping strategies are proposed, including a step-by-step guide to mindfulness and muscle relaxation, practical self-care tips to manage side effects, using a question prompt list to improve communication with health care professionals, and worksheets to encourage joint problem-solving. Multiple coping strategies are presented to couples to facilitate a personalised approach, where couples can pick and choose and apply those that most closely correspond to their needs. Also, the booklets contain information about additional health care resources that can contribute to optimal coping and illness adjustment, including the type of support that can be expected from different members of their health care team.

The gamma probe makes a noise, the volume of which is proportional to the amount of signal that it picks up from the seed. The highest number of counts (maximum noise) corresponds to the location of the seed and therefore the abnormal area in the breast.

These consist of a thin flexible foam layer with silicon webbing which does not react with chemicals in and on the skin. The silicon layer allows the dressings to adhere to healthy skin but not to open wounds. As soon as the skin shows signs of erythema, the red skin will be divided into two equal halves. The halves will be randomized to either Mepilex Lite or control cream by the PI Dr Patries Herst who has no direct invovement in the day to day running of the trial (based on computer-generated random numbers).

The dressings are applied to one half of the red skin (they adhere without the need for adhesives). Their position on the skin is indicated by black permanent marker pens. The dressings are removed for radiation treatment and during showering. careful instruction is given to patients how to handle the dressings to keep them in a clean place and how to reapply them after showering. The dressings are changed every 4 days but when moist desquamation occurs, they will be replaced daily. Dressings will be used until the skin reaction is completely resolved, which may be upt o 6 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.",CODE: Treatment: Other,All women receiving post-mastectomy radiation therapy for breast cancer.,Women with previous RT or systemic disease are excluded.

Type of intervention:  One-on-one behaviour modification therapy.
Delivery of intervention: To be run in individual sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or run twice daily over 1 week (intensive schedule).
Description of Intervention: Involves providing a verbal prompt to encourage consumption of spoonfuls of new food/s , with positive reinforcement (verbal and/or with toys etc), upon consumption of these foods. Parents initially observe from behind a one-way mirror and assist in collecting information about the behaviours they are observing in their child. As sessions continue, parents are transitioned into the room, and are trained to offer new foods and provide positive reinforcement by the end of the therapy block. 

Arm Two: HELPing Mealtime Experience
Type of Intervention: Small group sensory desensitisation therapy
Delivery of intervention: Run in small group sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or twice daily for 1 week (intensive schedule). 
Involves the child being exposed to gradually more challenging modelling and play with food (based on a sensory heirarchy of look>touch>smell>taste). Parents initially observe the sessions from behing a one-way mirror with a second therapist and assist in observing transitions and reactions in their children.  As the block continues, parents are rotated in and out of the room to assist in modeling play using the sensory hierarchy (i.e. 1 parent and primary therapist in room; 1 parent and secondary therapist outside of room).

ACTRN12611000850976,"A randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of an online decision aid for unaffected men with a family history
of prostate cancer","The intervention is an online decision aid (DA) consisting of 15 screens. The DA contains information about: prostate cancer; prostate cancer prevention; familial prostate cancer; types of prostate cancer screening available; possible screening results; possible outcomes of a PSA test; diagnosis of prostate cancer through biopsy and ultrasound; prostate cancer treatment and side effects; an interactive personal worksheet regarding the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening, and two example worksheets. Men are also presented with tailored information about their chances of being diagnosed with, and dying from, prostate cancer over the next 10 years if they choose to have annual screening, compared to no screening. 

Contingent upon  men's responses to three questions regarding their age and personal and family history of prostate cancer, men who are randomised to the DA condition are automatically directed to one of eight versions of the DA containing risk statistics appropriate for their age group (40-49 yrs; 50-59 yrs; 60-69  yrs or 70-79 yrs) and risk status (moderate- or high- risk). A man is classified at 'moderate risk' if he has: one first degree relative (FDR) or one second degree relative (SDR) diagnosed with prostate cancer, or; two SDR diagnosed with prostate cancer; or one FDR plus one SDR affected with prostate cancer. A man is classified at 'high risk' if he has two FDR with prostate cancer, or three or more FDR or SDR with prostate cancer. 

The eight versions of the DA are identical in content with the exception that the risk statistics in each version regarding the chances of being diagnosed with, or dying from, prostate cancer with or without annual screening over the next 10 years, are tailored to the age and family history data of the user.

The overall duration of the intervention is 18 months. The subjects of the research are clinicians whose practice is being monitored, so there is no direct interaction between the investigators and patients.

ACTRN12611001273976,Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of Intra-Arterial Liver Isolation Chemotherapy Using an Implantable Vascular Access System,"SCREENING & WORK UP: The patient is screened by the trial staff and a comprehensive patient history is recorded. Baseline blood tests and a CTA scan is carried out to determine patient suitability. A baseline PET-CT scan is also performed to determine treatment lesions. A Quality of Life (QOL) Survey will be filled in by the patient at this time also. 

DEVICE IMPLANTATION PROCEDURE: The procedure involves the surgical implantation under general anaesthetic of a large bore temporary access port (a peripheral access sytem) in either the common femoral artery or the subclavian artery. The device is implanted by anastomosing the ePTFE graft skirt of the device onto the patient's common femoral artery and tunnelling the tubing of the device through the patient's subcutaneous tissue in the upper thigh/pectoralis and out through the skin. The implantation procedure can take between 1-3 hours and the patient can be discharged after recovery. 


CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSION PROCEDURE: During the chemotherapy infusion sessions the patient will be ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) whilst under general anesthesia. Depending on the specific patient anatomy up to 4 catheters will be used to selectively cannulate and obstruct the target visceral vessels. Once the flow to the liver is isolated, a microcatheter will be used via the coeliac trunc to superselectively target a pre-determined liver lesion and subsequently deliver chemotherapy locally for 20-30 minutes. All catheters are removed after the infusion and the patient discharged after recovery. The procedure is expected to take between 60-200 minutes. Depending on the patient response, the patient will be infused 3-8 times over the 30 day course. 

DEVICE EXPLANTATION PROCEDURE: After the final chemotherapy infusion, and on the same day, the patient undergoes an explantation procedure where the implanted access device is removed and the vessel sutured, either with or without a patch angioplasty. This procedure takes approximately 1-2 hours and the patient is discharged after recovery.


FOLLOW UP PROCEDURE: The trial staff will follow up on the progress of the patient at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months from the date of the explantation procedure. A PET-CT scan and a QOL Survey will be carried out during the 1 month follow up period. ",CODE: Treatment: surgery::||::CODE: Treatment: Devices,"Colorectal cancer liver metastases patients:

ACTRN12612000168853,Assesment of New Radiation Oncology Technologies and Treatments,"The Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) has been commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) to undertake a project to assess new Radiation Oncology Technology and Treatments. This project is being undertaken in response to a recognised need for the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) to support appropriate new radiation oncology technologies and treatments as they become available, to ensure optimal patient care.

The first phase of the project required TROG to develop a Generic Research Framework (the Framework) capable of collecting and generating information to substantiate the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of new technologies and treatments.

The second phase of the project requires that the Framework be piloted to assess the safety, clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) in four tumour sites. 

The two new radiation oncology technologies being assessed  are; 

1) Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT); which is the method used to vary the fluence within a photon beam to achieve a highly conformal dose distribution to the target volume and minimise dose to surrounding organs at risk (OAR). The fluence modulations are inversely calculated using an optimisation process to produce a prescribed 3D dose distribution. Inverse treatment planning defines the desired dose to target and critical structures as a starting point, and intensity-modulated beam arrangements are derived to acceptably approach or meet these desired dose limits. At least single-point dose constraints, but more commonly a multipoint description of dosevolume limits, drive the process.1 The modulated beams are delivered using time variant apertures defined by multi-leaf collimators (MLC). The term IMRT for the purpose of the project refers to standard IMRT delivered by a fixed gantry. This definition excludes rotational IMRT delivered by single or multiple arcs (e.g. RapidArc) and Volumetric Arc Therapy (VMAT) (e.g.  Tomotherapy). 

2) Image Guided Radiation Therapy; is radiation therapy based on imaging acquired at the point of treatment delivery with the intent to ensure geometric accuracy of radiation delivery.  In this context, IGRT must be able to provide information of the target itself.
For the purpose of the ANROTAT project, IGRT is defined as daily imaging with on-line decision making that at a minimum allows for daily patient re-positioning based on imaging of the target volume or an appropriate surrogate marker. Two options exist:
a) Planar imaging using electronic portal imaging (EPI) or kilo-voltage (kV) on-board imaging. In this case, the implantation of fiducial markers into the prostate gland is required.
b) Volumetric imaging using one of various CT systems. kV and MV Cone Beam (CB) CT are allowed. Ultrasound methods are not permitted in the present protocol.
 IGRT for the ANROTAT project will focus on intact prostate imaging i.e. daily orthogonal planar imaging with fiducial markers or volumetric (e.g. CBCT) imaging.

The source data collected for this second stage of the project will be taken from patient medical records, reports, RT plans and QOL/Cost questionniares. As retrospective participants registered in this study have to have completed RT treatment with the last 60 months before registration, the year range the data will be collected is from 2006-2011.",CODE: Not applicable,"All protocols:

ACTRN12612000169842,The Assessment of New Radiation Oncology Technologies and Treatments Radiation Oncology Register Pilot,"The Department of Health and Ageing has asked the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) to develop and pilot a radiation oncology register as part of the ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) project (http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12612000168853.aspx).

The ARORP will include the development and testing of a set of data variables to capture demographics, diagnosis, staging, surgical treatments, quality of Life, follow-up and radiotherapy intervention related data. A cross sectional feedback survey of participating centre staff authorised to enter data into the ARORP will be undertaken to assess the feasibility of the collection of the data items in routine practice as well as the web-based registration, the user manual and the register in general. 

Data will be collected in two groups of patients; 
   1. Prospective ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) study participants at or after the first follow-up visit
   2. Patients who are attending for their annual follow-up appointment (including ANROTAT (TRP 11.A) retrospective patients and NON-ANROTAT patients). 

The data will be collected from the patients medical records, reports, RT plans and from QoL Questionniares. Patients are to be within 60months of completion of RT treament on registration, therefore the year range of the information collected will be from 2006-2012. 

The study population are patients who have undergone; 
- Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) or non-IGRT in patient with intermediate risk prostate cancer
- Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) or 3DCRT in patients with prostate cancer (post-proctectomy)

Participants will have a tiny metal seed containing a small amount of Iodine 125 inserted into their breast lesion by a radiologist using imaging guidance. The seed will be inserted on the morning of the day of surgery and it usually only adds a few minutes to the overall radiology procedure time (usually around an hour).  The seed consists of a tiny (4mm) metal capsule within which there is a very low dose of the radioisotope Iodine 125 (in a solid form not a liquid). The conventional method of marking the abnormal area in the breast is by putting a hook wire into it. This will still  be performed in addition to the insertion of the seed, to provide a back up method of localisation for the surgeon until the team has built up expertise and experience in using the seed alone to find the breast lesion for removal. The signal given out by the  seed is detected within the breast by the surgeon using a hand held gamma detector, which makes a noise in response proportionate to the proximity of the detector to the seed within the breast. The seed and the abnormal area of the breast will be removed together and sent for pathology analysis. The seeds are returned to the Medical Physics Department at the Hospitals for safe disposal and are only for single use. Having the seed in place is likely to make your time in theatre less.

ACTRN12612000544875,"Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenomics of busulphan and other agents used in blood or marrow transplantation","By examining the pharmacokinetics (PK, dose versus concentration relationship), pharmacodynamics (PD, concentration versus effect relationship) and pharmacogenomics (genetic influences on PK and PD) of drugs used in blood or marrow transplantation, it may be possible to individualise the dose to enhance therapeutic efficacy, reduce toxicity and maximise the chance of disease control. 	

The aims of this project are to: 

1.	Examine the pharmacokinetics of busulphan and other drugs used in BMT conditioning and to  identify sources of variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters
2.	To examine whether there is an association between exposure to busulphan and other drugs and toxicity and/or outcome following BMT (pharmacodynamics) 
3.	To examine the influence of genetic factors on the pharmacokinetics of busulphan and other drugs and outcome following BMT. Outcome endpoints include frequency of servious (Grade 3 +) toxicity, as well as survival endpoints.  
4.	To investigate whether patients who get veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD)  following busulphan-based conditioning use different metabolic pathways than those who do not.

	The target population are patients scheduled to receive busulphan or other agents prior to autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. 

The required blood and urine sampling will depend on the level of participation of the institution. Each institution can participate in any or all of four  levels and this will be    
determined by the Principal Investigator, who will make this decision at their own discretion based on factors including (1) the characteristics of the local patient population and the common toxicities seen at the site and (2) the availability of resources for trial participation  Additionally, participants are also able to  accept or decline certain levels of participation. on the consent form. Level 1 involves the collection of clinical data in patients having busulphan concentrations measured for routine pharmacokinetic assessment. Level 2 involves the collection of additional 	bloods to analyse the pharmacokinetics of BMT drugs other than busulphan. The actual drugs being studied will depend on the protocols being used. Random urine samples will also be collected before and on the last day of busulphan dosing to investigate differences in busulphan metabolism. Level 3 involves the collection of a single EDTA blood sample prior to BMT conditioning for pharmacogenomics tests. 	Level 4 involves the weekly collection of blood for metabolomics studies to 	investigate the pathogenesis of VOD. These bloods can be retrieved from Pathology 	following routine Biochemical tests. 

Drug concentrations will be measured using the chromatographic equipment in the Department of Biochemistry at The Childrens Hospital at Westmead. Pharmacokinetic software (including  Kinetica4.0 and NONMEM7.3)  will be used to calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters for each patient, and to identify sources of pharmacokinetic variability (e.g .body size, patient age, diagnosis, concomitant medication, prior medication, renal function and pharmacogenomics traits). Statistical tests including logistic regression and  multivariate cox proportional hazards regression will be used to identify whether drug exposure and other factors are significant contributors to toxicity and outcome after BMT. Patient outcome will be followed up to 5 years post transplant. 

This information is important for developing optimal dosing strategies for BMT drugs and has the potential to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes following BMT.

The frequency of these text messages is as follows: One message per week for the first three months of the study, then one message per month for the remaining nine months. These messages contain tips on how to protect your skin from the sun, provide encouragement to do so, and act as reminders to do so. The sun safety text messages will be personalised by addressing the participant by name and will sometimes include a reference to an outdoor activity they have reported as doing outdoors on a regular basis. For example, one sun safety message is as follows: ""Planning some outside activity this weekend (name)? Encourage your friends to be sun safe like you by wearing a hat & sunscreen. Have fun! Monika"". The skin self examination messages will also be personalised by using the participant's name. These messages contain information about how to do a skin self examination, provide encouragement to do so, and act as reminders to do so.

If 0/3 patients have a DLT then the current dose will be declared to be the final dose and expansion to phase II study at dose level -1 will start immediately
If 1/3 patients have a DLT then a further 3 patients will be enrolled at the current dose level. If there are no further DLTs then the current dose will be declared to be the final dose and the phase II study will begin at dose level -1. 

If >2/6 or > 2/3patients have a DLT then the study will be terminated.
 
For patients enrolled at dose level 2 (40mg panobinostat)

If 0/3 patients have DLTs then the current dose will be declared to be the final dose and expansion to phase II will start at 40mg.

ACTRN12612000775819,Investigating computed tomography ventilation as a functional imaging modality for lung cancer radiotherapy,"This is a validation study of utilising respiratory correlated computed tomography (CT) imaging (e.g, four dimensional CT) in obtaining the distribution of lung ventilation. The CT ventilation imaging will be validated with the gold standard in ventilation imaging, nuclear medicine ventilation imaging. The study participants will undergo (1) a CT imaging session where a four dimensional CT, a static end-inspiration breath hold CT and an end-expiration breath hold CT will be acquired and (2) a nuclear medicine imaging session where a PET-Galligas (alternative will be SPECT-Technegas) ventilation scan will be acquired. The CT ventilation images will then be used to create a functional based radiotherapy treatment plan. A standard anatomical based treatment plan will also be created which the functional based treatment plan will be compared to. We will estimate the difference in dose to the functional lungs (toxicity) between the standard of care anatomical based treatment plan used in radiotherapy planning and the study's functional based treatment plans. Neither of these plans will be used in the any of the study participants' treatments. Summary of imaging scans to be collected per study participant: Two static breath hold CT scans one collected after inhalation and the other after exhalation, One four-dimensional-CT (4D-CT) scan, One Nuclear Medicine ventilation scan (PET-Galligas or SPECT-Technegas). All CT scans will be obtained on the same day in one session on a dual modality PET/CT machine taking approximately 1.5 hour in total to complete. These scans will be collected only once in the study. The static breath hold CT scans will require the patient to hold their breath for 20 seconds during the scan acquisition. Each of the static breath hold CT scans will take less than 1 minute to complete. The 4D-CT scan will take approximately 3 minutes to complete. The nuclear medicine scan will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. In all the scans outlined above the participant will be asked to lie on their back with their arms above their head for the duration the scans. All the scans will be acquired with the use of a respiratory regulator system called the Audiovisual Biofeedback system. The Audiovisual Biofeedback system requires the participant to wear electronic goggles which will display their breathing pattern in the shape of a wave and they will be guided to maintain regular breathing by following the wave pattern during the image acquisitions.  The total dose received from all scans in study will be approximately 50 - 70 mSv. The study will be accrue 30 patients over the period of 3 years.

This is the first study of PEG-AVP0458 in humans.  The ultimate purpose of this research is to find better ways to detect and treat prostate and ovarian cancers.  The product under investigation, PEG-AVP0458, has been designed to attach to a specific protein called TAG-72, which is found on the surface of some types of cancer cells however it is not a treatment for cancer. The aims of this study are to determine the safety of PEG-AVP0458 at the doses studied, and to demonstrate that PEG-AVP0458 can attach to the TAG-72 protein on prostate and ovarian cancer cells in humans. PEG-AVP0458 will be combined with a low dose radioactive iodine particle by a process called radiolabelling, and injected.  The radiolabel acts as a tracer, which means that it can be detected in tissue by a special scanning system called a PET scan.  
124I-PEG-AVP0458 is to be administered to patients by slow intravenous infusion over an hour, with safety monitoring during and for 4 hours post infusion. PET imaging will be performed post infusion of 124I-PEG-AVP0458 on Day 0, and on a further 4 occasions over a one week period. 
The first three patients entered into this study will receive 1 mg/m2 of PEG-AVP0458 (the first dose level). If no patients entered in the 1st dose group experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) then the next dose group may commence 30 days after the last patient on the previous dose group has received the 124I-PEG-AVP0458 infusion. If any one patient experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be entered in the 1 mg/m2 dose group. 
After completion of accrual into the first cohort (1 mg/m2 dose), a Trial Management Committee will review the safety data from these participants before a decision is made to escalate the dose to 10 mg/m2. 
The second dose group  of three patients will receive 10 mg/m2 (second dose level), and the amount of 124I radioactivity is kept constant at 3-5 mCi. If any one patient experiences a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be entered in the 10 mg/m2 dose group.

ACTRN12612000806864,Pilot study to assess the effect of Brazil nuts on plasma selenium levels,"Participants will take 6 brazil nuts a day for four weeks.
This four week intervention will be preceded by a 4 week run-in / wash out phase 
participants will be advised to exclude any selenium rich foods or green tea during the study

This Pilot study will confirm the amount of Brazil Nuts we will use in the study comparing with green tea. This  follow up study (Effects of combining Selenium (Se) and green tea on biomarkers for colorectal cancer prevention in human subjects). will be registered with ANZCTR in the near future'

At the initial interview dietary advice will be given. This will give an understanding of the nature of the volunteers diet and the likely influence of Se to the diet and suitability to become involved in the study 
(if intolerant to nuts volunteers will not participate in the study)
We will ask participants not to consume, whenever possible, throughout the study:-
Any selenium supplement
Any selenium enriched foods, such as nuts, sea food (such as tuna or octopus)

The Brazil nut is a large nut that comes from the castanheiro de para tree in Brazil's rainforests. Each serving of about six to eight nuts contains 4 g of protein and 7 grams each of monosaturated and polysaturated fat.
Brazil nuts (Berholletia excelas, family Lecythidaceae) are the richest known food source of selenium, with mean concentrations reported in the literature between 8-83 micrograms Se/g
6 Brazil nuts daily provides 48 micrograms Se/day - 53 micrograms Se/day",CODE: Prevention,"Healthy, with no active bowel disease, or

ACTRN12612001122842,Optimising mens participation in faecal occult blood test screening for bowel cancer.,"Name of intervention: gender specific mail-administered screening invitation strategies.

All participants will receive an offer to participate in a free FOBT which will be delivered by mail. Intervention arms will differ from control according to the information included in the materials accompanying the screening offer. All study participants will receive a standard screening reminder irrespective of their intervention group. Intervention materials will target specific psychosocial variables previously identified as being related to male participation in FOBT screening.

The intervention period is 14 weeks. All participants will receive a screening offer according to the following timeline. 
 
Baseline: Advance notification letter sent
Week two: Invitation package sent
Week eight: Reminder letters sent to those who have not completed an FOBT
Week 14: Data collection ceases.

Arm 1: Control

The control arm will receive a standard offer to participate in FOBT screening designed to mimic the strategy utilised by the Australian national bowel cancer screening program (NBCSP).

The standard offer includes an advance notification letter and a screening invitation package. 

The advance notification letter is sent two weeks prior to the screening invitation package and is designed to alert participants that an invitation to screen for CRC with an FOBT will soon follow. The standard advance notification letter introduces basic information about colorectal cancer and the health benefits of screening.  

The screening invitation package includes a) a screening invitation letter b) an immunochemical FOBT with associated instructions c) an information booklet that describes colorectal cancer and screening and d) a participant details form. The standard invitation letter emphasises the importance of reading the information booklet prior to completing the test, provides contact details for those requiring more information and describes the meaning of a positive result on an FOBT. 



Arm 2: Gender Specific (GS) 1

Participants in trial arm two will receive a gender specific advance notification letter plus the standard screening invitation package.

The gender specific advance notification letter will include messages designed to; reduce perceived barriers to FOBT screening (e.g., faecal aversion) and increase mens engagement with sources of social support and influence (e.g., family members, general practitioners) regarding the decision to participate in screening. 

Arm 3: GS2
Participants in trial arm three will receive the standard advance notification letter plus a gender specific screening invitation letter.

The gender specific invitation letter will include messages designed to increase the perceived health benefits of FOBT screening and increase participants perceived self-efficacy and competence for completing the FOBT.

Approximately fifty eligible patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer will be randomised into intervention and control groups after completing an initial assessment.   Those in the intervention group will be given three cancer coaching sessions with a trained coach over 3-months during regularly scheduled outpatient treatment appointments.

The Flinders Program is a set of generic tools and processes enabling health professionals and health consumers to undertake a structured process that allows for assessment of self-management behaviours, collaborative identification of problems and goal setting leading to the development of individualised care plans (Flinders Human Behaviour & Health Research Unit, 2005).

During this time, three extra 10ml tubes of blood (30ml, 6-8 teaspoons) will be taken for this sub-study.  During routine blood tests before each cycle of chemotherapy and maintenance phase of the GSK2110183 drug (see main study details below), an extra 30mls of blood will be collected.  At the end of the study, a final 30mls of blood will also be collected.

Patients will also be asked to have a biopsy of their tumour before starting treatment (chemotherapy) and during treatment. The biopsies will give the researchers information about how the drug works and help to develop tests that predict who might respond to treatment.  The tests involve looking at the molecules in the tumour tissue. Biopsies will be done only if it is easy to perform with minimal discomfort to participants.  This will be done as a day case at the hospital after using a local numbing medicine to allow painless biopsy from the area by an experienced radiologist.  The second biopsy is optional.

Addditionally, at any point during the study, should a participant require a clinical procedure to remove fluid from their abdomen, researchers would like to store some of the fluid which would otherwise be disposed of.

ACTRN12613000097741,Combination of Selenium and Green Tea on bowel health,"30 healthy volunteers (>50yrs) at-risk for CRC by virtue of age and /or other standard risk factors will be recruited to participate in a randomised, three cohort dietary intervention study. with a parallel design to test the effects of Se and green tea alone and in combination on molecular biomarkers for CRC prevention in the normal rectal epithelial cells. They will be instructed to maintain their usual diet during the study but to avoid supplementation with any green tea-related food or drink (limited to <3 cups of black tea per day), and Se-rich foods such as octopus, crab and tuna, liver and kidney or additional Brazil nuts or other nuts (except those Brazil nuts and green tea extract prescribed by us). The study will consist of dietary intervention period of 6 weeks, preceded by a run in period of 4 weeks.

The volunteers will be randomised (randomisation will be computer generated) into one of three groups of 10, receiving 
1) Se, supplied as Brazil nuts (6 Brazil nuts daily will provide 48micrograms Se/day); 
2) Green tea, supplied as a green tea extract capsule (4 capsules daily will provide 800mg EGCG/day); and 
3) Se + green tea (6 Brazil nuts daily + 4 green tea extract capsules daily (will provide 48micrograms Se/day and 800mg EGCG/day). 

Six Brazil nuts has been chosen because the average Se concentration (2.7 micrograms Se/g) in Brazil nuts (supplied from Charlesworth, Australia) is relatively low compared to that of the report by Thomson et al, where the Se concentration is 6.4micrograms Se/g, and average weight for one nut is 4g, 2 nuts provided 53 micrograms Se/day (Am J Clin Nutr 2008;87:379-3840). Since the average weight of one Brazil nut (supplied from Charlesworth, Australia) is 3g, 6 Brazil nuts daily will provide 48micrograms Se/day, similar to the dose of 53micrograms Se/day. 

The green tea dose depends on the concentration of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) per capsule, one green tea extract capsule containing 200mg of EGCG is supplied by NOW Foods, USA, 4 capsules of green tea has been chosen because it is equivelant to 4-6 cups of green tea, which could be achieved in humans. Intake of a green tea extract capsule containing 400mg EGCG up to 2,000mg EGCG is safe in human trials (J Clin Oncol. 2009 Aug 10;27(23):3808-14). The intervention period is 6 weeks to replicate the intervention period of our previous Se human trial (Br J Nutr. 2011 Aug;106(4):572-582). Also 6 weeks is the time when maximum plasma Se level was achieved after supplementation of 2 Brazil nuts in a clinical human trial, where 2 Brazil nuts daily was shown to be as effective for increasing Se status as 100micrograms selenomethionine (Am J Clin Nutr 2008;87:379-3840). Our previous studies and others have also shown that 4-6 weeks of dietary intervention proved to be suitable to reveal changes in biomarkers in rectal biopsies (Br J Nutr 2007;98:525-534).

Immediately prior to the allocated dietary intervention and subsequently after 6 weeks of dietary intervention, blood samples will be collected and rectal biopsies (four biopsies are taken during each procedure) will be taken by sigmoidoscopic examination performed without bowel preparation. The biopsies will be performed by an experienced proceduralist who has performed these procedures previously. An initial 4 week pre-treatment assessment period will precede the supplementation. The first blood sample will be taken at the start of this period and it will be assayed for Se to determine if the entry criterion for plasma Se is met.
The Brazil nut is a large nut that comes from the castanheiro de para tree in Brazil's rainforests. Each serving of about six to eight nuts contains 4 g of protein and 7 grams each of monosaturated and polysaturated fat.
Brazil nuts (Berholletia excelas, family Lecythidaceae) are the richest known food source of selenium, with mean concentrations reported in the literature between 8-83 micrograms Se/g

The AV biofeedback system is comprised of audio-visual goggles that the patient wears to receive their audio and visual guiding prompts. The real-time respiratory input is provided by an infra-red camera tracking the motion of a marker positioned on the patient's abdomen. The AV biofeedback system will be implemented during two CBCT scans. By breathing with the guidance of AV biofeedback participants will wear the goggles and follow the audio and visual prompts as best they can. By breathing without the guidance of AV biofeedback, the participant does not wear the goggles, but their respiration motion is still monitored. 
As a part of their clinical treatment plan, the patients will already be having 18 CBCT scans; by participating in this study, they will have only two additional CBCT scans.
The patients specifically undergoing SBRT are chosen because they will already have fiducial markers implanted about their liver tumours. SBRT does not form a part of this study. This AV biofeedback study will be conducted during their treatment planning phase when they are receiving numerous CBCT scans.  
Each study session will take a total of 1 hour inclusive of setting and packing up the AV biofeedback system in addition to the CBCT scans, but it may be completed in less time than this. After each session the patient will be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding the AV biofeedback system; each questionnaire is designed to only take 2 minutes to complete.

With the major developments in MPN biology and emerging new pharmaceutical agents this is a major potential growth area for basic/translational research and clinical trials.

Currently, there is no co-ordinated approach to collect data on the numbers of MPN patients, and the current standards of care around Australia and New Zealand. This information is vital to planning and feasibility assessment for future clinical trials.  A well-constructed database will generate useful data, as has been shown by international groups that have had high impact publications from retrospective data analysis.

The database will hopefully be a major resource for translational research, particularly if patients in the registry also consent to ALLG tissue banking. Investigators with an interest in a specific subset of MPN patients will be able to query the database for a list of such patients and their characteristics.

Data will be collected and entered online by registry physicians/sites at the time of diagnosis and annually for all patients enrolled on the registry. Physicians will be able to access the MPN Registry website at any time to enter and edit the data from their own patients, to access MPN registry documents or to view site-specific subject data reports.

'Supporting Men, Supporting Women' is organised in a menu-driven modular format, with each module addressing an identified area of concern and need for male support partners. As well as providing a thorough explanation of the genetic testing process, it offers information about womens typical and preferred coping responses, and the implications of different testing results, including surveillance and preventive options. The intervention is unique in that it also provides information from the male perspective including: common responses of male partners to being a support person; ways for men to cope with these responses; guidance for how male partners can support the woman through testing process (including videos providing simple strategies for recognising and reducing stress); and, how couples can effectively communicate with each other and with other family members about genetic testing and its implications. 

In addition to usual care received throughout the genetic testing process (genetic testing of a blood sample as well as genetic counseling prior to, and following, test result disclosure), both male and female participants in the intervention group will receive full and immediate access to the Supporting Men, Supporting Women web-based intervention for the duration of the study (4 months).

This scan is used commonly in many different medical conditions throughout the world and does not differ in technique in this trial when compared to its use in regular clinical practice. A radiotracer (the FDG) will be injected into a peripheral vein, after 60 mins a scan by the PET camera will be performed of the whole body which takes up to 20 mins.

2. 18F Fluorocholine (FCH) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan:
This is an experimental scan which has only been used in a small number of trials internationally. It is not in regular clinical use. Its technique is identical to the FDG scan other than the tracer which is FCH and the total imaging time is closer to 30 mins.

3. There will be two groups of patients enrolled, depending upon which standard of care treatment that independant physicians assign:

Arm 1: Both scans performed at the time of diagnosis. These patients will undergo any treatment other than transarterial chemoembolisation.

Arm 2: Both scans performed at the time of diagnosis and then a second set of scans performed after standard of care transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE).

Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) is a commonly used treatment modality in HCC worldwide. It is not being assessed in this trial in an experimental fashion. It will only be used in patients who have been enrolled in this trial if the clinical situation demands it. If a patient undergoes TACE, as decided upon by clinicians independant to the trial, a second set of PET scans will be performed 6 weeks after in order to assess the treatment response. TACE will be performed as standard of care which includes femoral arterial access, angiography to locate the HCC feeding vessels, then embolisation of the vessels with beads loaded with epirubicin (the chemotherapy agent). Depending upon the clinical situation, patients may undergo several TACE procedures over months to years. However, only one set of PET scans will performed after the first TACE.


The two arms exist as we are using the PET scans in different ways. In the first arm, patients  simply undergo the two PET scan at time of diagnosis which completes their involvement. In the second arm, patients have the PET scans at time of enrollment, they then undergo TACE, then 6 weeks later have another set of PET scans. The results will not be compared against each other or against any other groups undergoing any other intervention of test.

ACTRN12613000239763,Phase II Feasibility Study of Lipidiol Markers for Radiation Therapy Localisation and Response Assessment in the Multi-Disciplinary Team Management of Oesophageal-Gastric Cancer,"Lipiodol is a stable fatty acid ethyl ester which is a derivative of poppy seed oil  which has a wide range of applications in current medical practice which include localisation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Endoscopically inserted lipiodol is currently utilized for the treatment of bleeding gastric varices in combination with Histoacryl (n-butyl cyanoacrylate) which acts as a glue in order to prevent extravasation of the lipiodol.   Currently surrogate markers exist in the form of standard surgical heamaclips have been routinely used in neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, breast surgery and abdominal surgery for 50+ years. Radiotherapy fields can be more accurately marked and treatment delivered using surgical clips.
At present only one study utilizing lipiodol injection as a surrogate marker for localization prior to radiotherapy planning exists. This study utilized trans-rectal ultrasound guidance to inject lipiodol into the prostate. However there has been extensive experience in the use of lipiodol and histoacryl in the treatment of gastric varices where it has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy with minimal complications.

Whilst the combination of lipiodol/histoacryl are not yet standard therapy for localization of tumours, however given the promise of the initial pilot study the Urology unit at Austin health are also further investigating the utility of lipiodol marking of prostate cancers. Further more at Austin Health it is standard practice for patients who require radiotherapy for prostate cancer to have gold seed fiducials  as surrogate markers inserted into their prostate glands before treatment.  This helps to track the location of the prostate during radiotherapy. It is standard practice for patients who require radiotherapy for breast cancer to have titanium heamaclip fiducials inserted in the breast at surgery before radiotherapy.

 The use of lipiodol markers for the purpose of assessing tumour response in oesophageal cancer is something that has not been published previously. One previous pilot study has demonstrated the feasibility and safety of using metal fiducials in oesophageal cancer, gastric and pancreatic cancers for surgical pathologic correlation and/or image guided radiotherapy. This has been supported by our own recent experience with gold fiducial insertion in gastro-oesophageal cancers.

Endoscopic tattooing is standard of care in gastrointestinal tract tumours (oesophageal, gastric, colonic). At present carbon particles (SPOT), Indocyanine green and India ink are currently used to mark these lesions. However they are radiolucent whereas lipiodol which is radio-opaque and therefore should act as a marker for radiotherapy as seen in the previous study performed in the prostate.

A submucosal injection into normal muocsa adjacent to the tumour will be performed through the gastroscope with 1.4mls of saline, followed by 0.4mls of lipiodol:0.4mls of histoacryl  solution to prevent extravasation of the lipiodol. This procedure will be performed 4 x to outline the superior/inferior and lateral margins of the tumour. This will be performed as a once off procedure. The duration of the markers will be dictated by the patient's treatment pathway (eg. if curative then will be resected in surgical specimen at time of the operation).
Whether a patient proceeds to radiotherapy, its duration, intensity etc will be discussed for each participant at the multi disclipinary meeting prior to marker insertion. The markers have no impact on the type or duration of the radiotherapy involved and each patient will receive current standard of care treatment.",CODE: Treatment: Other,"Biopsy-proven primary (non-recurrent) squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus or stomach

ACTRN12613000271707,Phase I pilot of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction intervention for Head and Neck Cancer patients receiving treatment of curative intent.,"A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, adapted specifically for the needs of Head and Neck Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. 

This intervention consists of 7 sessions, lasting up to 90 minutes each, which are administered one-on-one to patients by an experienced mental health professional. In addition, these sessions are supplemented by practice at home of the skills learned in sessions. 

The first session of the MBSR program is administered before patients begin radiotherapy. Radiotherapy for patients being treated with curative intent generally runs for 7 consecutive weeks. The first session will be ideally be administered one week before patients begin radiotherapy. However, due to the difficulty of aligning the start of the MBSR intervention perfectly with the patients idiosyncratic radiotherapy schedules, patients may start the MBSR intervention more or less than a week prior to radiotherapy.

It is our experience that patients begin to experience severe side effects from radiotherapy by week 4 of their treatment. We have designed the administration of the MBSR intervention so that patients receive the majority of the sessions of the MBSR intervention before this point, in order to give them time to familiarise themselves with the mindfulness skills being taught before they become ill. The MBSR intervention is therefore designed to be staggered so that patients receive sessions 1 to 5 of the MBSR intervention on a weekly basis, meaning they complete these sessions in week 4 of their radiotherapy treatment. We will then give patients sessions 6 and 7 on a fortnightly basis, meaning that patients will ideally finish their last session of MBSR in the week after they finish the MBSR intervention. This schedule means that patients have the maximum time to gain skills to help themselves before they become debilitated by radiotherapy side effects, but still have the support of the clinician administering the intervention throughout their whole radiotherapy treatment period. The MBSR sessions that are administered while patients are on active radiotherapy treatment do not need to be administered immediately before or after a patient's radiotherapy session, simply some time in the same week.

Patients are asked to practice the skills they have learnt from their MBSR sessions at home using a CD of mindfulness meditations, as well as practice informal mindfulness (e.g., paying full attention to a routine task like showering). Patients are asked to practice mindfulness daily. The time that patients are asked to spend meditating a day depends on the specific meditations assigned as homework in a given week; however, it is generally at least 20 minutes a day. However, it is made clear to participants that they are to do what they can manage on a day-by-day basis and to try their best.

The MBSR intervention used in this study uses the tool of mindfulness meditation to teach patients the skills of: (1) paying attention on purpose to the present moment experiences of thoughts, sensations, bodily states, and the environment; (2) with a particular attitude of openness, non-judgement, curiousness, and acceptance.  Developing these skills assists with the emotional pain that can come with people's automatic tendency to relive the past, plan the future, judge their experiences, and act reflexively. The skills and understandings developed through MBSR have broad applicability for people experiencing cancer and their families/carers which includes, but is not limited to, stress reduction. Our aim is to help clients develop better coping and emotional regulation skills overall during radiotherapy, with a specific focus on addressing the changes to their body and the impact of treatment side-effects such as nausea, fatigue and pain over the course of radiotherapy.

ACTRN12613000320752,"Eating As Treatment (EAT): A stepped wedge, randomised control trial of a health behaviour change intervention provided by dietitians to improve nutrition in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy","The current study is a stepped wedge, randomised controlled trial, whereby each site undergoes a control period (varying in duration from 4 to 16 months) followed by training (consisting of a two day workshop and a one day clinic visit) and then an intervention period (varying in duration from 4 to 16 months).

Intervention 

EAT is a behaviour change counselling intervention based on the strategy delivered by Dr Britton in the pilot study [publication in development]. It has been refined to be delivered by dietitians in the clinical setting, alongside their normal dietetic involvement with HNC patients (i.e. weekly during radiotherapy, fortnightly for six weeks post-radiotherapy and then 'as needed' thereafter).

It is largely based on motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) strategies. EAT is designed to improve health behaviours of HNC patients and maintain their nutrition over the course of their cancer treatment. Of particular interest are behaviours related to sufficient daily nutritional intake, either orally or via feeding tube. Although to a healthy population this may seem a simple task, in order for HNC patients to eat, they must overcome significant barriers of pain, oral disfigurement, mucositis, nausea, reduced or no saliva, taste changes and severe losses of appetite in addition to the premorbid complications of high rates of alcohol misuse, mental illness and poorer self-care. EAT is designed to assist the HNC patient in finding the motivation to eat despite all these barriers, and to provide them with practical behaviour change strategies to support this change. 

Training will be delivered in a two-day workshop. On the day after training, the trainers will accompany dietitians during their usual consultations to assist with the clinical implementation of EAT. The trainers will return in two months to refresh EAT intervention skills, problem solve clinical concerns and troubleshoot any systems change issues that may have arisen. 

During the intervention phase, dietitians will participate in at least monthly supervision with one of the trainers (clinical psychologist). Supervision will be used to discuss clinical issues, problem solve and provide skills based feedback. Common themes, barriers and solutions discussed during supervision will be distributed (e.g. email) to participating dietitians. 

Systems change strategies will be used to encourage the implementation of EAT and, as appropriate, to align dietetic practice with clinical guidelines. This element of the study is aimed at positioning dietetic intervention and counselling as an integral part of cancer care. The following elements will be addressed with staff during training. 

1. Due to the prevalence of depression amongst HNC patients, dietitians will be trained in a method used to screen for symptoms of depression (PHQ-2). For patients who are identified to be at risk of depression, dietitians will be encouraged to work with radiation oncologists to implement a referral procedure. This procedure will be site specific and developed in close consultation with hospital staff. Dietitians will be asked to document in client notes when the PHQ-2 is administered and the outcome (i.e. whether the patient was referred to the radiation oncologist). Radiation oncologists will be asked to document in client notes what support option(s) were discussed with the patient and whether a referral was made. 

2. Dietitians will be asked to consult with patients in accordance with the schedule documented within the clinical guidelines (weekly during radiotherapy, fortnightly for six weeks post treatment and as required thereafter). Dietitians will be asked to document the occurrence of each dietetic consultation within client notes. 

3. Sites will be asked to schedule dietetic appointments adjacent to radiotherapy appointments. Integrating dietetics into radiotherapy in this way is designed to position dietetic intervention as an integral part of cancer care for both patients and department staff. 

4. To prompt the delivery of dietetic intervention consistent with the intervention/guidelines, the medical records of patients will include a coloured printed prompt, placed by research staff, identifying the patient as a trial participant, outlining the key components of dietetic intervention and the behavioural change techniques recommended for use during the consultation.",CODE: Treatment: Other::||::CODE: Behaviour,"Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer involving the Nasopharynx, Oropharynx, Oral Cavity, Larynx, or Hypopharynx requiring definitive or postoperative radiotherapy with curative intent

ACTRN12613000436774,A Pilot Study of patients with Oligometastases from Prostate cancer treated with Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiosurgery ,"Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiosurgery (SABR) involves highly hypofractionated radiotherapy given as an ablative treatment. A single fraction of 20Gy will be the prescribed dose.
As part of this study you will be required to discuss your past medical history and progress of your prostate cancer with the doctor. A general physical examination with a focus on where the cancer has spread to is part of the study. You will have standard blood tests including your hormone levels and prostate specific antigen (PSA) level. Also as part of this study you will be required to have a special scan called an 18F-PET/CT (stands for fluoride-positron emission tomography/computer tomography) scan. This involves an injection of a radioactive chemical and then a scan to see where your prostate cancer has spread to.
If the tests show that the research study is suitable for you, and you still wish to take part, you can join the study and begin the treatment.
Prior to your stereotactic body radiotherapy you will be required to fill out quality of life and pain questionnaires. This may take up to 20 minutes of your time. You will have either a single session ofstereotactic body radiotherapy (SABR) or in the rare situation where there is not enough time available you may be required to return for two sessions (if you have two lesions) and three sessions (if you have three lesions).
In order to deliver this treatment, you will need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit is required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. All sessions are usually conducted on different days and we will contact you to give you the dates and times to attend for these sessions once they have been booked for you.
Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years after the radiotherapy treatment. At each visit you will be reviewed by the doctor and have a prostate blood test (PSA). At each visit you will be expected to indicate on a questionnaire if you have any pain. At the 1, 3, 12 and 24 month visits you will be expected to fill out a quality of life questionnaire which will take about 20 minutes of your time. You will have a whole body bone scan at 12 or 24 months after your treatment. At 6 months after your radiotherapy treatment you will have another 18F-PET/CT scan, which will be very similar to the scan before your treatment. The purpose of this scan is to assess the effect of the treatment on your lesion(s).

The treating physician will administer either the remaining 180 mg/m2 dose or another dose based on the test pharmacokinetic results targeting a melphalan exposure at or just above the median levels achieved in previous drug testing. The initial 10 mg/m2 test dose produced low melphalan concentration in two patients (close to the limit of detection of the assay), making it difficult to make predictions for full dose melphalan exposure.

ACTRN12613000542796,Enhancing Head and Neck Cancer Patients Experiences of Survivorship,"Participants will be randomly allocated to either Usual Care, or one of two possible interventions.

Arm 1
Information: In addition to usual care, patients will receive a written resource Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer.  This 61-page publication was developed by a number of health professionals involved in the treatment of people with head and neck cancer, and contains detailed information and recommendations about coping with issues such as diet and swallowing problems, oral health, fatigue, pain, stress, emotional concerns and communication. The resource has been reviewed by consumers and pilot tested at Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital, Herston, Australia.

Arm 2
Intervention: As with the Information Arm, patients will continue to receive usual care and the resource Facing the future: Living with confidence after treatment for head and neck cancer. However they will also meet with an oncology nurse who has undergone specific training in developing a tailored survivorship care plan. 
The face-to-face meeting will take between 30 and 60 minutes and will focus on issues which are of concern to the patient. For example the care plan might include a graded approach to improving fatigue, or a plan about how to get into a routine to manage oral health. It might include details about how to cope with social interactions and relationship concerns, or fear of eating in public. The care plan will be designed to not just list information  it will be designed to enable participants to work out how to feel more in control of their health, deal with anxiety and give them confidence about when and how to get professional advice as needed.  
Once the survivorship care plan is complete the patient will receive a written copy so that they can keep working on the issues in it. A copy will also be sent to their General Practitioner so that the GP is familiar with the issues the patient is working on can provide ongoing assistance as necessary.
Oncology nurses who are providing the intervention will undergo focused training which will include completion of a self-directed training manual and a day-long skills development session. During the delivery of the intervention the nurses will also participate in fortnightly clinical supervision, facilitated by study investigators highly experienced in health professional education and skill development.

ACTRN12613000551796,"In women with breast cancer, does Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) demonstrate acceptable general cosmesis with an improved quality of life?","We are testing the feasibility of using Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (APBI) to deliver adjuvant radiation to only the breast tissue surrounding the surgical excision cavity. This is different to the normal external beam radiation approach whereby the entire affected breast is treated.

The procedure involves the insertion of approximately 10 to 25 hollow plastic tubes (catheters) into the region surrounding the surgical excision cavity of the breast under general anaesthetic and ultrasound guidance. These catheters will remain in situ for 7 days. 

The catheters are then connected to a computerised machine which remotely controls the movement of a high dose rate radioactive source into the catheters and determines the exact amount of radiation given (3.4Gy per fraction). 

In doing so, the dose of radiation is individually tailored to target the areas which are at the highest risk of disease recurrence whilst minimising dose to the surrounding normal structures.

The treatment time is truncated from approximately 15 to 30 daily treatments for external beam radiotherapy
(depending on individual patient factors and institutional protocols) to twice daily treatments with an inter-fraction interval of at least 6 hours over 5 days in total for APBI. Each treatment lasts for 10-15mins.

ACTRN12613000655741,Can the use of low dose radioactive seeds to guide surgical removal of small areas of abnormal breast tissue reduce the rate of second operation compared with standard hook-wire technique? (ROLLIS RCT: Radio-guided Occult Lesion Localisation using Iodine-125 Seeds) ,"The radiopharmaceutical product (medical device) is a needle with wax plug, containing a radioactive seed. 

I-125 seeds are entered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for a different purpose (prostate brachytherapy).  Low activity seeds are packaged on-site into a sterile needle kit to be used for ROLLIS, under the Therapeutic Goods Administration Clinical Trials Notification scheme.

Participants will give informed consent and be randomised to HWL or ROLLIS.
For ROLLIS participants, a low-dose sterilised radioactive I-125 seed is placed within the patients cancer under local anaesthesia with imaging guidance. The approximate duration of the seed insertion procedure is 5 minutes. Localisation by seed may be up to 4 days prior to surgery.  The standard 2-view mammogram will be obtained to confirm satisfactory positioning of the seed(s).  The seed remains in situ until surgery. If the position of a seed is not ideal, a hook-wire will be inserted to guide the surgical excision.  (A second seed may cause confusion rather than aid guidance, since the signal from each seed may not be distinct).
In theatre, the surgeon then uses an intraoperative gamma probe to guide removal of the impalpable cancer containing the seed by breast conserving surgery (BCS) within 4 days.

The rest of the questions will ask about:
* Breast cancer diagnosis
* What things the particpant thought about, or might think about, to help them decide whether or not to have chemotherapy before breast cancer surgery
* What treatments the participant had for their breast cancer
* What were their worries and concerns while they were having treatment for breast cancer
* What information women should have, before deciding whether or not to have chemotherapy before breast cancer surgery.

ACTRN12613000665730,"The effects of aerobic- versus resistance-based exercise on
breast cancer-related lymphoedema","This study will evaluate and compare the effects of aerobic- versus resistance-based exercise to usual care on lymphoedema, lymphoedema-related symptoms (e.g. decreased fitness, impaired functioning, changes in weight, strength loss), and quality of life.  Women will be asked to participate in a 12-week intervention (or usual care) and will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and 12 weeks post-intervention.  

For those in the aerobic-based exercise group, any form of aerobic activity may be undertaken, provided it is at a Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 11-13 (on a 6-20 scale) for weeks 1-6 and an RPE of 12-14 for weeks 7-12.  Sessions will be conducted at location convenient to the participant.  During weeks 1-4, there will be 2 supervised sessions a week (50 minutes each), with participants asked to accumulate another 50 minutes of unsupervised exercise (150 minutes total each week).  For weeks 5-12, participants will receive 1 supervised session per week (50 minutes) and be asked to achieve an additional 100 minutes unsupervised.

All resistance-based exercise sessions will begin with a five-minute cardiovascular warm-up period, followed by a full-body strength training program, including: chest fly, triceps kick-back, squat, curl-ups, bent-over row, bridging, wall push-up, bicep curls, calf raises, shoulder press, external rotation and forward lunge.  Modifications will be made at the researchs discretion if pain, injury or altered range of motion prevents proper technique of the given exercise.  The same schedule and intensity as the aerobic-based group will be used in the resistance-based group.

To monitor adherence, participants in the aerobic- and resistance-based exercise groups will be given activity logs in which to record their weekly, unsupervised exercise, including time, modality and RPE during the session.  They will also be asked to record relevant information for exercise sessions (e.g., modifications, pain/discomfort, barriers encountered).  At each supervised session over the 12-week intervention, the researcher will review this log with the participant to assess adherence and address any concerns or queries that may arise.  The researcher and participant will also schedule days and times during the week when the unsupervised exercise will be undertaken, with identification of an additional back-up time period should any barriers arise during any of the selected times.  As each program is supervised, this will include discussion of personal barriers and strategies to overcome them, as is traditionally done by exercise physiologists.  

Verbal praise will be used when participants complete expected unsupervised exercise and given positive encouragement and advice when unsuccessful in meeting the weekly goal.  Though 100% adherence is emphasised, individuals will be reminded that an overall adherence of 80%, or 1920 total minutes, over the 12 weeks is the ultimate aim, and if there are weeks they cannot obtain 150 minutes of exercise, they can make up the missed time the following week.  Participants in the usual care control group will be called weekly (weeks 1-4) or fortnightly (weeks 5-12) to maintain their interest in the study and ensure they have not increased their exercise participation.

ACTRN12613000725763,Ultrasound visible breast markers: can these be used for preoperative ultrasound guided lesion localisation?,"Each participant will have one of six commercially available breast biopsy markers inserted following a stereotactic vacuum assisted core biopsy of one (or more) breast lesion(s).
A list of the six markers will be provided to the clinic staff. The order of the markers will be determined by random selection based upon a table of random numbers. They will then be used sequentially starting with the first randomly chosen marker on the list for the first lesion then the next lesion will receive the next marker on the list and so on. When each clip has been used twice a new randomisation will produce a new list and the same process will be repeated. This procedure will be used until sufficient numbers of subjects has been recruited. After clip selection the participant's ID and lesion number will be entered against the marker used on the list so that the next lesion (or participant, if the participant has only one lesion for stereotactic biopsy) will receive the next marker on the list and so on. The radiologist will not be allowed to ""choose"" which marker is used.

The insertion procedure is performed at the end of each stereotactic vacuum assisted biopsy and takes only a few minutes at most to perform.
The position of the marker will be checked on an immediate post biopsy mammogram  (this is standard procedure) and the visibility of the marker and any post biopsy hematoma will be assessed on a targeted ultrasound immediately after the biopsy is completed (this is an addition to standard practice).
Participants whose biopsy results indicate that surgical removal of the lesion is required and who return to our hospital for surgery will have a further targeted ultrasound on the day of surgery, again to assess marker and hematoma visibility to see if preoperative hook-wire localisation can be successfully performed using ultrasound rather than stereotactic guidance (the metal component of each biopsy marker is always visible using mammography). If the marker or hematoma is not sufficiently visible using ultrasound, the hook-wire will be inserted using stereotactic guidance. A mammogram will be performed to assess position of the hookwire relative to the marker. If the wire position is not optimal then a further hookwire will be inserted using stereotactic guidance.
For those participants who do not need to have surgery for their lesion their participation ends on the day of the stereotactic biopsy. 
Participants who need surgery will continue in the study until the specimen XRay and pathology results are available to allow determination of whether the lesion (marker) has been successfully removed.

ACTRN12613000731796,A proactive and structured telephone based intervention to reduce carer burden and depression among carers of cancer patients,"The intervention comprises: 

a)	A proactive and structured Outcall program of information and support, delivered by experienced Cancer Council Helpline nurses to carers, that links them to a range of community based supportive care services as required; 

b)	Screening carers for distress and refers those with elevated levels to their GP for follow up psychological services to reduce their burden and improve their psychological health. 

Participants randomised into the Intervention group will be contacted by a Cancer Council Helpline nurse as follows:  
Using a standardized protocol and check list, a Cancer Council Helpline nurse will telephone participants 7-10 days post referral (Outcall One), four weeks later (Outcall Two), with the third outcall (Outcall Three) three months later. 
For each outcall, seven Cancer Helpline outcall attempts over different times (eg 9am-1pm; 1pm-5pm; 5pm-6pm) across different week days over 2 weeks will be undertaken. After seven failed attempts and no response, a person will be declared absent for a particular outcall. No further contact will be made until the next outcall is scheduled. All successful and failed attempts will be documented. Duration of each telephone call will be on average 20 minutes.
During each of the three outcalls, the Helpline nurse will administer the Distress Thermometer (DT) and will then raise six items for further discussion during which tailored information, support and specific carer resources will be provided. The areas selected for discussion have been specifically chosen to achieve the intended outcomes of reduced carer burden, improved psychological health and quality of life and increased health literacy and ability to navigate the health system.

The project will involve the provision of an iPad, with specially designed applications. The iPad home screen will have all the options loaded that are specific to the project with all other Apple applications removed. There will be an application for the patient and one for the carer. There will be a 'contact nurse' function, as well as a Facetime button to facilitate video conferencing between the nurse and patient or carer. Cisco jabber is loaded onto the iPad as the virtual case conferencing platform. The community nurse will organise a virtual clinic with the patient as part of a monitoring function and this time will be scheduled with the patient as clinically indicated. The patient is asked to complete the symptom severity tool that is loaded into the patient application function each day. An increase in symptom scores will send an automatic email alert to the community nurse who will respond when able. The patient and carer will be taught how to assess the patient functional status and this will be recorded weekly. A drop in functional score below 70% signals the need for a virtual case conference between all key health care providers. The patient and carer will be informed of the working hours of the nurse as this is not a 24 hour service, so routine provisions to access the On call service will be in place to support out of hours and on weekends.   This project will not only facilitate regular and responsive online access to health professionals but will provide brokered access to quality information and resources to support palliative care patients and their carers. The education is loaded onto both the patient and carer application functions. This information is provided from the website CareSearch and is peer reviewed and evidenced based. The types of information provided include how to access community services, general information on how to care for someone with a life limiting illness, and information on Advance Care Planning. The palliative care service will test if use of information technology can be incorporated into current care processes and whether this will reduce service requirements and/or increase the number of patients that can be managed in the community as well as sustaining a patient at home for the same time or longer.

ACTRN12613000746730,A pilot study of two new imaging scans after high precision radiation therapy for patients with limited secondary spread of cancer to the lung.,"If you participate in this study you will have two different types of scans as well as a single stereotactic body radiotherapy session (SBRT). The two types of scans we are researching are called a four-dimensional positron emission tomography (4D-PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan. 
Both scans are slow and recorded along with your breathing, which allows us to see how much your organs move as you breathe in and out. Each 4D-PET scan is broken down into many separate scans, each showing where your organs and the cancer are at a specific point of your breathing, for example, just as you start breathing in. For us to know whether you are breathing in or out, we will monitor your chest movement using breathing equipment. This will be done by either putting a belt around your chest or abdomen which senses your breathing, or a small lightweight reflective box on your chest and watch this using a special camera in the room. Both devices can tell us at which part of your breathing cycle each CT or PET image was taken, so we can make sets of images from each phase. Either device can be used during your scan, and this will depend on the particular machine on which you have your scan taken. The CT perfusion scan is similar to a standard CT scan, but is taken over a longer period of time with more contrast. This allows us to record the flow of contrast and blood flow into the cancer.  
Specifically, the research involves:
1.  Before treatment, you will have a four-dimensional positron emission tomography (4D-PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) perfusion scan, as a baseline.
2. After treatment, you will have another 4D-PET scan and a CT perfusion scan at day 14 and day 70. These will be compared with the first scans in order to assess how your cancer responded to the treatment. Each scan will take approximately 30 minutes of time.
The stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment itself will routinely involve a third type of scan: a cone-beam CT. This scan is performed on the treatment machine, and is used to make the treatment more precise.
Specifically, the stereotactic radiotherapy treatment involves as standard: 
3. Prior to treatment whilst being set-up on the treatment machine, a cone-beam CT will be used to check the position of the cancer. This will be repeated immediately before the treatment and again mid-way through the treatment (a total of 3 cone-beam CTs). 
4. A single high-precision, high-dose radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment directed against the cancer. The treatment is a 26Gy single fraction. The treatment will take approximately 60 minutes.
Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 2.5 to 3 months, and then at 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months from treatment. Participation in this study will involve no extra cost due to either having these scans or the treatment.

ACTRN12613000774729,"Bladder Adaptive Radiotherapy (BART) Trial - A study on the feasibility of BART.

 
","What is BART and what does it involve?

Radiotherapy uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells by damaging their DNA.

Bladder adaptive radiotherapy (BART) is a specialized technique that utilizes computed tomography (CT) scans to visualize the bladder, and therefore allow optimal matching of a radiotherapy treatment plan on a daily basis. Adaptive radiotherapy is particularly useful in the treatment of bladder cancer, given the significant daily variability in the location and size of the bladder. The technique of daily optimization of treatment plans allows smaller volumes to be treated and therefore less toxicity to surrounding normal organs (such as small & large bowel).

The dosage amount and frequency of radiotherapy administered in this trial will not differ from standard non-adaptive treatment that you would otherwise receive if you declined participation in the trial. These parameters will be determined by your Radiation Oncologist. In the large majority of cases, radiotherapy will be given as 5 treatments per week (daily from Monday to Friday), as part of a 4-7 week treatment course.

BOLART refers to an ongoing study of adaptive image-guided radiotherapy for muscle invasive bladder cancer that is being carried out by the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group. We have adapted the BOLART protocol to allow the adaptive radiotherapy technique to commence from day 1 rather than day 8. This adjustment allows the benefits of adaptive radiotherapy to be realised earlier on in the treatment. We have also modified from BOLART the method of optimization of treatment plans, which we theorise from our experience should allow easier and tighter matching to the best fit of the day.

The duration of radiotherapy treatment will be determined by your Radiation Oncologist, but will generally range from 4-7 weeks. Follow-up review will be conducted by treating Radiation Oncology team at 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months post-treatment.

ACTRN12613000783729,Self-compassionate writing for breast cancer survivors,"Aims of project
To assess whether affect and mindset can be modified in the short term through a self-compassionate writing activity focused on body image.

Plan and method
Part One
There are two parts to this research. The first part of the research involves completion of an online questionnaire package to collect background data. This should take about 20 minutes and is conducted in the convenience of the participants home.
From this point participants will be randomised by the researcher into two groups (control and experimental) using the www.randomizer.org program.

Part Two
The second part involves a writing exercise and completion of a paper-based questionnaire which will be sent via mail. 

All participants will complete a brief pre-writing questionnaire (envelope 1) 

After this participants will open another envelope (envelope 2) with a set of instructions and writing paper. Participants in the control condition will receive instructions for unstructured descriptive writing regarding body image after treatment. They will be asked to write for a total of 4 pages with general writing guidelines (ie use of introduction, body, conclusion) but will receive no additional prompts or structure to their writing.

Participants in the experimental condition will also engage in writing however using additional prompts designed to encourage a compassionate orientation to the self, modelled after the procedures of Leary et al (2007). Participants will be asked to write a response to each self-compassion prompt, comprising a total of 4 pages. These prompts are designed to elicit attitudes of self-kindness, mindfulness and feelings of common humanity and are based on the definition of self-compassion provided by Neff (2003).

Immediately after completion of writing participants will be asked complete a post writing questionnaire that rates their affect using Likert scales as per Leary et al (2007). Participants will also complete an additional rating scale created to measure self-compassionate mindset. This entire package will be sent via post and a reply paid envelope will be provided for the return of pre & post writing questionnaires. 

Participants will be given the option of keeping their writing exercise or sending it in with their questionnaire responses. This will be entirely according to the participants preference.

This part should take approximately 45 minutes in total and is undertaken in the convenience of the participants home.

Measures:

The Body Image Scale (BIS) was developed by Hopwood, Fletcher, Lee & Ghazal (2001) for use with oncology populations. It consists of 10 items to measure body image distress, including aspects of affect, behaviour and cognition. This scale shows high reliability (Cronbachs alpha 0.93) and good clinical validity and sensitivity to change. The BIS has been widely cited by researchers in the oncology field (eg. Harcourt et al, 2003, Garry et al, 2004)

The Self Compassion Scale (SCS) measures compassion towards the self, as rated by the participant. Twenty-six Likert scale items include a series of six sub-scales to assess self compassion using a total score. The SCS has been assessed to have good test-retest reliability (a=0.93) and validity, (Neff, 2003).

The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21) is a short version of the full 42 item DASS scale developed by Lovibond & Lovibond (1995). The DASS 21 comprises 21 items (with three subscales, 7 items each) to measure respondents levels of depression, anxiety and stress. This instrument has been found to have satisfactory validity and reliability, and have higher user acceptability, (Henry and Crawford, 2005).

The Body Image Appreciation Scale (BAS) was developed to assess body image. Higher scores indicate higher body appreciation. This scale has acceptable psychometric properties with item consistency of .94 for the scale and demonstrated construct validity (Avalos, Tylka & Wood-Baraclow, 2005).

It is expected that the at home writing exercise and questionnaire completion will take no more than 45 minutes of participant time in total. 

Data collection and storage:
Data collected will be stored in a password protected folder. Participant emails and data obtained will be stored separately and emails will not be linked to data. Only the study investigator and supervisors will have access to research data. All patient information obtained for the study will be de-identified before publication and dissemination of results.

ACTRN12613000861752,Predicting and preventing leukaemia in children with Down syndrome.,"The aim of the study is to better understand the relationship between GATA-1 gene mutations and development of transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and myeloid leukaemia in children with Down syndrome (ML-DS), particularly acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL). GATA-1 gene mutation analysis will be performed on genetic material extracted from blood. 
A small sample of blood (about a teaspoon full) will be collected for GATA-1 gene mutation analysis. Another small sample of blood will be collected for a full blood count (FBC) for haematological assessment.

Methods and testing
Patients enroled on this protocol will be followed up by their primary clinician and study team to ensure that required blood collections are performed. The study will follow-up participants from birth or time of consent until the age of 4 years (48 months).

Blood collection timepoints are designed to coincide as much as possible with routine testing procedures required for children with Down syndrome.

Study samples and a full blood count (FBC) sample will be collected at the time of consent. Ideally this would be within the first few weeks after birth. All children with Down syndrome are eligible to participate in the study, regardless of any health issues they may have.

Participants who do not develop TMD will have blood collected at 3,6,12,18,24,36 and 48 months. 

Participants who develop TMD will have additional blood collections to those stated above at 9, 30 and 42 months. These extra blood collections are required for monitoring the TMD.

Participants who develop AMKL will have blood collected for the study at diagnosis. After this they will no longer be required to have blood collected for study purposes.

Haematological evaluation of FBC will help clinicians monitor levels of red and white blood cells in participants.

Study samples for GATA-1 gene mutation analysis will be sent to a specialised lab for testing. Results of these tests will establish methods for GATA-1 gene mutation testing in future children with Down syndrome.

Primary Objectives
-to assess levels of GATA-1 gene mutations detected in children with Down syndrome found to have TMD/ML-DS.

-to identify factors that promote regression of TMD or subsequent progression to ML-DS in children with Down syndrome.

-to evaluate the true incidence of subclinical TMD and explore its relationship to the subsequent formation of AMKL.

Secondary Objectives
-to develop novel techniques that will assess GATA-1 gene mutations in non-TMD or non-AMKL populations in the future.

-to determine how the GATA-1 loss of function mutation contributes to the pre-leukaemic state.

-to assess feasibility of monitoring children with documented TMD or AMKL for minimal residual disease using GATA-1 mutation testing.

-to determine whether children with Down syndrome progressing to ML-DS can be indentified before frank leukaemia develops.

A Pilot Study.,"The intervention in this study will be the provision of a lower limb exercise programme. The 6 exercises  are designed to slowly pump the muscles which will help squeeze fluid up the leg. They will be taught by the same physiotherapist to all the participants. The programme starts and finishes with diaphragmatic breathing to stimulate the deep lymphatic system. abdominal muscle contractions are followed by gluteal contactions, quadriceps and hamstring contactions and then gastrocnemius contractions. each exercise is repeated 20 times. theraband resistance is used for each exercise except for the abdominal contractions. the exercises will be taught by a physiotherapist on an individual basis. exercises will be undertaken twice a day for the 3 month trial period. The exercises should take 15 minutes to complete in the patient's own home
 
Each exercise will be repeated for 20 repetitions at intensity 13 on the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) The Borg Scale is a patients subjective measure of physical activity intensity level based on the physical sensations a person experiences during physical activity such as increased heart rate, increased respiration or breathing rate, increased sweating, and muscle fatigue (Borg, 1998). It is agreed that perceived exertion ratings between 12 to 14 on the Borg Scale suggests that physical activity is somewhat hard being performed at a moderate level of intensity.
The exercises are graded level 1 (easier) or level 2 (harder)and commence day 1 after surgery with no hip movement for the first 48hours to reduce strain on the suture line in the early post-operative period. Patients can choose which exercise level suits them best to gain level 13 on the Borg Scale. Each participant will be provided with an exercise protocol sheet containing written and pictorial description of all the exercises to ensure they are replicated exactly. Each participant will have their exercise regime checked at every review appointment by the same physiotherapist that prescribed the regime to ensure consistency of technique between the participants. review appointments consist of 40 minute consultations with the physiotherapist at baseline, 1 month, 6 weeks after chemotherapy, 6 weeks after radiotherapy or at 3 months if no adjuvant therapies occur

The program will consist of weekly, 90 minute E-Health treatment sessions, delivered over 6 weeks to provide diet education specific to the needs of childhood cancer patients after cancer treatment. The program will include information on how to manage child feeding behaviors, evidence-based best feeding practices by parents, healthy nutrition/diet after cancer treatment, medical long term effects of cancer treatment, healthy lifestyle now and in the future and goal setting. The program will also consist of a 15 minute child component that will deliver nutrition information and feeding therapy techniques through fun messy play and workbook activities. Sessions will be delivered through video conferencing software on the Internet (WebEx, by Cisco). WebEx combines a teleconference with a web-based video-conference and requires a phone line, a computer with standard browser and a webcam. It is a secure, password-protected videoconferencing program that allows participants access to the online system only through a personal email invitation from the study coordinator. WebEx includes an automated upcoming session reminder and can record sessions. Participants will also receive a reminder SMS on their mobile phone 24 hours before their session. Several SCH staff are trained WebEx technicians and will support the technical aspects of this study. The use of this delivery method was also following recommendations of the systematic review that suggested that if frequent session delivery is not feasible in clinic (often due to the rural location of patients), telephone or online sessions in the home environment, may be a practical alternative. 

After each session the study coordinator will collect session-specific feedback through a short 10 minute online survey using Lime Survey Trademark completed by the parent participant. This will enable the study investigators to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of each individual program treatment session and module content for the parent. The information collected will be on: If participant found the session useful, what they and their child enjoyed from the session, the skills they gained from the session and any barriers (time or technological) that they may have experienced for the running of the session.

This model aims to systematise the approach to screening for distress and responding to that distress in a coordinated manner, including facilitating continuity of care for patients who reside some distance from the acute care setting where their cancer treatment was received. 
As part of the newly developed model of care, all inpatient and outpatient urology and H&N cancer patients will be screened at their first diagnostic or treatment visit and at each subsequent follow-up visit, using the Distress Thermometer (DT) and accompanying Problem Checklist, which will inform the development of a care plan to address the issues identified through the screening and second-line inquiry. The care plan will facilitate provision of care tailored to specific needs of patients and promote continuity of care across care settings and providers, including with health care providers (HCPs) in rural and regional areas.
The screening and problem checklist will act as a trigger for frontline staff to inquire about and discuss the cause/s of distress with patients whose distress levels are above the recommended cut-off of 4 out of 10. Training for frontline staff will focus on discussing the cause of the distress, developing an evidence-based psychosocial care plan to address identified concerns, providing information and/or basic counselling or referring patients with significant or persistent distress to the psycho-oncology service, and facilitating continuity of care including linking patients with hospital and community services as required. Training will be delivered in 2.5-3 hour sessions on a quarterly basis throughout the duration of the intervention period. Long-term sustainability of these service changes will be promoted through organisational leadership and management support; engagement of cancer clinician leaders in each unit in the design and evaluation of the service model; and development of a model with the aim of adaptability and flexibility to diversity of locations and patient complexity (e.g. through complex case review and revision of psychosocial care plans and active involvement of clinicians from rural locations in this process).

ACTRN12613000993796,A phase I/II clinical study of deliverability and efficacy of high dose lenalidomide for the treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,"This trial involves the use of the oral capsules lenalidomide. In the induction phase, patients will be treated with lenalidomide 50 mg/day for 28 days, followed 2 weeks later by another cycle at the same dose. In patients with progressive disease after or during first cycle or patients failing to reduce bone marrow blast count to less than 50% of diagnosis, further two cycles with 65mg (and 75 mg/day, if not responding to 65 mg/day) lenalidomide are planned. In patients with rapidly progressive disease, dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 may be administered weekly for 2 weeks, till the patient has received at least one cycle of 75 mg/day dose. Responding patients will receive 25 mg/day lenalidomide 21 days every month till disease progression as maintenance therapy. Patients experiencing serious toxicity or disease progression will be taken off study. For patients developing a toxicity which in investigators opinion doesnt warrant discontinuation of lenalidomide, may be considered for dose de-escalation if the disease is not progressing. Objective evidence for biological activity of the strategy will be assessed using sensitive flow-based assays on bone marrow samples at baseline, at weeks 4 and 10 then 3 monthly of maintenance therapy. 
Lenalidomide will be supplied by the clinical trials pharmacy.Drug accountability and monitoring treatment adherence will be managed in part by the practise of returning containers and/or unused stock to the pharmacy. Regular hospital visits and blood test are also required.

If a response rate of >20% obtained or no patient receives at least one cycle of 75 mg/day lenalidomide, to verify the safety and efficacy of the higher doses level, further patients will be enrolled to an expansion phase until a total of 14 patients have been recruited to the entire study.

For patients relapsing after allogeneic HSCT, the following schedule will be followed:  Lenalidomide will be dosed at 10mg daily for 21 of 28 days for cycle #1 (28 day cycle) and escalated to 15mg daily for 21 of 28 days for cycle #2 in the absence of treatment emergent aGvHD. Dexamethasone will be given for the first 2 cycles only, at a dose of 40mg weekly in cycle #1 and 20mg weekly in cycle #2.   Dose modification will be allowed for lenalidomide (15mg -> 10mg-> 5mg) and dexamethasone (40mg -> 20mg -> 10mg) as per standard criteria.
 Dexamethasone will be given as an oral tablet.

ACTRN12613001177741,Investigating breathing training for lung cancer radiotherapy ,"There is a clear link between irregular breathing and errors in medical imaging and radiation treatment. To address the problem of irregular breathing, a respiratory guidance system has been developed by our research group: audiovisual (AV) biofeedback.
AV biofeedback is an interactive, personalised and non-invasive breathing training system designed to assist the patient to breathe regularly. AV biofeedback is comprised of the real-time position management (RPM) system and a visual display (e.g. monitor, tablet computer), none of which are of any risk to the patient. The system is designed to be easily implemented into any treatment or imaging facilities. 
The patient views the tablet screen which displays their breathing pattern to them based on the real-time respiratory motion captured by the RPM system. 
AV biofeedback will be used during every radiotherapy and imaging session. As for the period and frequency of such sessions, it will vary from site to site and between patients depending on the type of treatment prescribed to them (e.g. 3D-conformal, stereotactic body radiation therapy, or intensity-modulated radiation therapy). 
Patients in the intervention arm will undergo a screening procedure that will determine what breathing condition is best used for their treatment: either free breathing or AV biofeedback. This will take the form of a breathing session in which we will record the patient's free breathing and analyse the reproducibility of its amplitude and period. This will then be repeated using AV biofeedback, and which ever breathing condition resulted in the most reproducible breathing signal will be the one to continue to be used throughout the patient's imaging and treatment.

Images can then be obtained which may enable better visualization of the Barretts segment. These are non invasive technologies where the light at the end of the endoscope changes to a more narrow wave length light which could improve visualization of vasculature which can be more pronounced in early neoplasia. Patients will either receive the white light endoscopy (WLE) examination followed by examination with NBI or examination with the NBI followed by WLE. Any suspicious areas detected by both modalities will be documented (location and distance from incisors) and subsequently further assessed with Narrow Band Imaging with Dual Focus (NBI-DF) where optical biopsies/ interpretation of the histology will be made in real time. Targeted biopsies will then be taken. This will then be followed by random 4 quadrant biopsies on WLE. The time taken to perform the examination on NBI and NBI-DF as well as time taken to perform the examination on WLE will be documented. All images with all modalities will be recorded and stored in high definition files. All biopsies corresponding to the imaged areas on all modalities will be documented, labeled separately and sent for blinded histopathological examination.

Intravenously injected EDV nanocells exit the leaky vascular system found within tumours and attach to cancer cells via a specially designed, targeted bi-specific antibody. Once attached, the nanocell is able to enter the tumour cell and deliver the payload of chemotherapy, siRNA, or miRNA or a combination of these. In parallel, the bacterial cell wall of the nanocells stimulates key components of the immune system, which are then activated to seek out and destroy cancer cells.
The Tailored EDV study (ENG4) is an open-label feasibility study of a single delivery agent vEDVsPayload containing clinician chosen therapeutic payload(s) (cytotoxic drug, siRNA or miRNA) in eligible patients with advanced solid tumours, who have no curative treatment options. 
Eligibility requires patients to have an archived, or incidentally collected at elective surgery, tumour sample(s) (paraffin block or slide) for analysis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) expression. In addition, radiological assessment by MRI, CT or PET scan confirming measurable disease is also required for study entry.
There are four potential cytotoxics, in addition to potent anti-tumour siRNA or miRNA, that can be individually selected as the payload; Maytansinoid, Doxorubicin, Mitoxantrone and Gemcitabine. The VEDV can be packaged with a single or multiple payload, dependent on the pre-identified sensitivity of a patients cancer cells to one or more of the cytotoxic agents, uniquely targeting the individuals disease. 
All patients will commence on a starting dose of 2x10^9 VEDVsPayload. If the patient tolerates this initial dose level, subsequent doses can be increased to 5x10^9 VEDVsPayload.at the discretion of the Investigator. 
VEDVsPayload will be administered once per week for 8 weeks, via an intravenous 20 minute infusion, which will equate to 1 treatment cycle. Tumour evaluation is to be performed at week 9 using the same method of assessment as at screening; CT, PET or MRI scan. 
If the patient does not fulfill any of the criteria for withdrawal they may continue to receive further cycles of VEDVsPayload. Cycle 2 will recommence at Week 10 with IV VEDVsPayload to be administered weekly for 8 weeks, unless the patient becomes intolerant to the study medication or the patient withdraws consent, for up to a maximum treatment period of 12 months. Tumour evaluations by MRI, CT or PET scan will be performed every 9 weeks. 
The primary completion of the study for the primary analysis will occur after all patients have either completed the study or 6 months of treatment. A safety follow-up visit must be performed 30 - 35 days after the last dose of VEDVsPayload. 
All patients that discontinue Investigational product and have not withdrawn consent to participate in the study, will continue in the long term follow-up phase.

ACTRN12614000229673,Evaluating the feasibility and utility of a Quality of Life instrument as a clinical aid in cancer and palliative care,"The Quality of Life at the End of Life (QUAL-E) instrument is a survey to measure quality of life at end of life from the patient's perspective. Originally a 25-item self-report tool, the instrument investigates 4 domains: a) life completion; b) relationship with health providers, c) preparation for end of life; and d) symptom impact. The QUAL-E was validated in 2011 as a reduced 17-item version. Piloting the tool with Australian hospital palliative care patients in 2009 revealed its potential utility as aid from clinical care when administered as an interview by research assistant.
This current trial will further pilot the QUAL-E to evaluate its feasibility and clinical utility when administered as an interview. The QUAL-E interviews will be conducted by a research assistant with nursing and research experience. Each interview will be conducted face-to-face and audio-recorded. The research assistant will document patient participants' responses to each item on a hard copy instrument. Audio-recording of the QUAL-E interview will also be audio-recorded to faciltate the capture, transcription and content analysis of patients' qualitative responses. Each patient will be interviewed once; there will be no follow-up. It is envisaged that each interview will last approximately 30 minutes. ",CODE: Other interventions,"Diagnosis of advanced cancer

ACTRN12614000283673,"Exercise positron emission technology (PET) imaging of the heart to predict cardiac complications after major cancer surgery
","This is an observational study, investigating the feasibility and utility of preoperative exercise cardiac positron emission technology (PET) imaging in identifying patients with cardiac disease preoperatively.
Participants will undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing (as per standard institutional protocol before major cancer surgery), which involves 10-12 minutes of cycling on a stationary bicycle. 
Endothelial function will be assessed non-invasively using a finger tonometry device (EndoPAT) before cardiopulmonary exercise testing. This involves application of a finger-probe on each hand which measures arterial pulse wave amplitude using plethysmographic technology. The testing process involves a resting measurement phase, forearm occlusion (using a blood pressure cuff inflated above systolic blood pressure on one arm for 5 minutes), and a final measurement of the magnitude of reactive hyperaemia after release of the forearm blood flow occlusion. 
Exercise PET imaging involves intravenous injection of radiolabelled glucose after peak exercise through an intravenous cannula. The radiolabelled glucose is taken up by ischaemic myocardium in the fasted state after a high fat and low carbohydrate meal. PET imaging then uses detection of emitted positrons to generate a tomographic image of the heart.
Patients must fast for 4-6 hours prior to the cardiopulmonary exercise test, and must consume a high fat, low carbohydrate meal for dinner the evening prior to the test and at 4-6 hours before the exercise test. A range on suggested high fat, low carbohydrate meals options will be provided to participants to choose from.

ACTRN12614000351617,"Phase III Clinical Study of Allogeneic Stem Cell
Transplantation with Reduced Conditioning (RICT)
versus Best Standard of Care in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
(AML) in First Complete Remission","Patients in the Control (no transplant) group will be treated as per local practice, whereas patients with an identified and medically approved donor will proceed to Reduced Intensity Conditioning Transplant (RICT).

MSD (Matched Sibling Donor)/RICT and MUD(Matched Unrelated Donor)/RICT groups:

Patients allocated to RICT group should proceed as soon as possible to transplant as the next treatment after achieved remission. Due to medical or logistic factors, consolidation course(s) according to institutional practice may be given. Consequently, patients in the RICT group will (before conditioning) receive a total of 1-3 chemotherapy courses.
If a patient in the RICT group relapses, or if a contraindication to the assigned treatment occurs, the patient will be treated at the discretion of the clinician, but nevertheless reported within the study.

Centers may select any of the conditioning regimens described below and are then asked to consistently use the chosen regimen. Note that busulphan may be given intravenously or orally as per center preference.
Intrathecally administered methotrexate will be given to selected patients as per center routine.
As fludarabine is metabolized partly by a renal mechanism (Malspies Sem Oncol 1990), doses of fludarabine need to be modified if the calculated or assessed renal clearance is below the lower limit of the normal range.
Busulphan (orally or IV) and fludarabine
Fludarabine 30 mg/sqm iv infusion over 30 min;
-on day 8 to day  4 (=five days) for MSDs
-on day -9 to day -5 or -4 (= five or six days) for MUDs
Busulphan may be administrated orally or intravenously;
-Orally. Total dose 8 mg/kg, given as eight doses of 1 mg/kg each on day 4 (two
doses), day 3 (four doses) and day 2 (two doses).
-Intravenously1. Total dose of Busulphex is 6.4 mg/kg given as two doses of 3.2 mg/kg each, administered over 3 hours, on days -3 and -2.
In-vivo T depletion with ATG, or alemtuzumab, as per local standards is permitted for MUDs
There shall be an interval of = 8 hours between fludarabine and busulphan, and 48 hours between last dose of busulphan and infusion of stem cells.

Fludarabine, carmustine, melfalan
Fludarabine 30 mg/sqm IV infusion over 30 min q d days 8 to -5 (four days)
Carmustin 150 mg/sqm IV infusion over 60 min q d, days 7 and 6 (two days)
Melphalan 110 mg/sqm IV infusion over 30 minutes on day 2.
Alemtuzumab 10 mg (total dose) SQ on day -1.
There shall be an interval of 48 hours between melfalan and the infusion of stem cells.
Supportive measures post transplant
Supportive measures listed below represent basic general recommendations. In principle, centres are
free to follow their local standard guidelines.
Blood transfusion support. Red blood cell and platelet transfusion support will be given using standard procedures at each institution. Blood products should be irradiated and filtered.

Antibacterial prophylaxis. As per center preference

Herpes simplex virusand varicella zoster prophylaxis. As per center preference

Surveillance and pre-emptive treatment of CMV. Test for CMV antigenemia or PCR assay should be performed weekly from day 0, at least until D +100. If positive, appropriate treatment should be given.

Fungal prophylaxis. As per center preference

P. carinii prophylaxis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol at appropriate dose for a duration of at least one year.

The use of G-CSF in the post-transplant setting should be individualized.

Immunosuppressive therapy
In the RICT setting, there are no data to support any claims of superiority of one regimen over another.
All regimens in use at the participating institutions have been evaluated locally. It is not possible to mandate that one particular regimen should be used. Therefore, this protocol includes the use of eithermethotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in addition to cyclosporine-A (CyA). It is however
recommended that each center uses the same regimen throughout the study.
Cyclosporine-A (CyA)
The dose of CyA should be targeted and adjusted to a serum concentration as per center preference.
The first doses of CyA are given intravenously to try and ensure adequate levels at the time of transplant. If there is nausea and vomiting anytime during CyA treatment the drug should be given intravenously at the appropriate dose. Blood pressure, renal function tests (creatinine, BUN), electrolytes and magnesium need to be followed closely while receiving CyA at full dose.
In principle, cyclosporine should be given IV or orally in full dose from Day 1 until day 60, then be tapered, in the absence of GvHD, and stopped at day +120. However, if GvHD occurs, or if
justified by chimerism data, CyA dose and duration should be individualized.

CyA and short course methotrexate
This immunosuppression combination includes full dose CyA and methotrexate. The dose of methotrexate is 15 mg/sqm iv day 1, 10 mg/sqm day 3 and day 6. The use of folinic acid rescue on
days 4 and days 7 10 is optional. A fourth dose (10 mg/sqm) of methotrexate Day +11 with optional use of folinic acid rescue on day +12, should be added after MUD-RICT, or otherwise if the risk of GvHD is considered high.

CyA and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).  This immunosuppression combination includes full dose CyA and MMF. For CyA-dosage and schedule, see above. The MMF dose, either orally or IV, is 15 mg/kg bid. Doses will be rounded to the
nearest 250 mg (capsules are 250 mg). Most patients will receive 1000 mg bid.

After MSD-RICT, and in the absence of GvHD, MMF will be given until day +50 post-Tx and then stopped without tapering.

After MUD-RICT MMF will be given 15mg/kg q 8 hrs to day +40, then tapered to day +96.  If there is nausea and vomiting, preventing oral administration, MMF dose should be reduced
accordingly, or administered intravenously.
GvHD, treatment Acute GvHD, should be treated as per local routines with prednisone/prednisolone. In case of steroid-refractory GvHD, defined as progression after three days or no improvement after 7 days or incomplete response after 14 days of corticosteroid treatment, patients will be managed according to local practice or ongoing studies. Chronic GvHD will be treated according to local practice.

Chimerism analysis and immunological intervention
Most centers have developed routines for chimerism assessment and immunological intervention.
Therefore, only some principles are stated and centers are free to use their own routines as to the rest.
For the purpose of this protocol, chimerism analysis should be performed at least in PB at +1 month, at D +100 and at 1 year in PB or BM. Extra assessments may be needed in case of remaining MRD or administration of DLI. It is recommended to assess chimerism in T-cells and myeloid cells separately. Remaining or reappearing of host myeloid cells may be used as surrogate marker for MRD.
Immunological intervention such as CyA taper or DLI may be considered.
No recommendations could be given as to the use of MRD surveillance. Local or national routines for surveillance and intervention will be applied.

The intervention to be evaluated will take place over a 2 year time period, and is made up of three main components: an adolescent intervention, a parent/adolescent decision aid, and logistical strategies. Prior to the first dose of the HPV vaccination, education is delivered by school personnel through the school in an interactive session of approximately 45-50 minutes. The education intervention will take place before the first dose of the HPV vaccine is administered and ideally, before the vaccination consent forms have gone home to parents/guardians. As each school chooses when to undertake the education intervention as it fits in with their time-tabling, the time between the education intervention and the first dose of the vaccine will vary, but is most likely to take place within a few weeks of the administration of the first dose. An educational magazine is given to students as take-home information designed by and for adolescents; a website and app providing information for students to access in and outside of school; and distraction/relaxation app for students to be used on vaccination day.  

A parent/adolescent HPV Decision Aid or a brief HPV information resource for parents and adolescents to use together is delivered to parents and adolescents at the time of the vaccination consent form.

ACTRN12614000452695,Assessment of Safety and Efficacy of Repeated Intra-Arterial Pancreatic Isolation Chemotherapy,"SCREENING & WORK UP: The patient is screened by the trial staff and a comprehensive patient history is recorded. Baseline blood tests and imaging (PET-CT, CTA scan, guided ultrasonography, and or MRI) is carried out to determine patient suitability and to determine treatment lesions. A Quality of Life (QOL) Survey will be filled in by the patient at this time also. 

DEVICE IMPLANTATION PROCEDURE: The procedure involves the surgical implantation under general anaesthetic of a large bore temporary access port (a peripheral access system) in either the common femoral artery or the subclavian artery. The device is implanted by anastomosing the ePTFE graft skirt of the device onto the patient's common femoral artery and tunnelling the tubing of the device through the patient's subcutaneous tissue in the upper thigh/pectoralis and out through the skin. The implantation procedure can take between 1-3 hours and the patient will be monitored overnight and discharged the following day. 


CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSION PROCEDURE: During the chemotherapy infusion sessions the patient will be ventilated with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) whilst under general anesthesia. A large duodenal balloon catheter will be introduced intraorally up to the entrance to the jejunum. Depending on the patient's anatomy, up to 4 balloon catheters will be used introduced via the implanted peripheral access system to selectively cannulate and obstruct the arteries supplying blood to the pancreas. Once all catheters are in place, a microcatheter will be introduced to into the appropriate pancreaticoduodenal artery or distal pancreatic artery. All balloon catheters are deployed to isolate the flow, and the duodenal balloon deployed to protect the duodenal mucosa before chemotherapy is infused through the microcatheter. All balloons catheters and the duodenal balloon are deflated and removed after 20 minutes. The procedure is expected to take between 60-200 minutes. The patient may be discharged on the same day after recovery after being assessed by a study clinician. Depending on the patient response, the patient will be infused 6-8 times over the 29 day course. 

DOSAGE REGIMEN: Patients 1 & 2 - Esclalating oxaliplatin (5, 10, 20, 40 mg/m^2 for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th infusions respectively; 50 mg/m^2 for 5th & 6th infusion; 7th & 8th infusion dose determined from response to previous doses). Patient 3 & 4 - Fixed oxaliplatin (50 mg/m^2) for all 6-8 infusions. Patient 5 & 6 - fixed oxaliplatin (50 mg/m^2) and gemcitabine (250 mg/m^2) for all 6-8 infusions. 

INFUSION SCHEDULE: Typically infusions will take place twice a week for the 29 day period with the 1st infusion scheduled for a Monday or Tuesday and the 2nd infusion scheduled for a Thursday or Friday of each week. 

DEVICE EXPLANTATION PROCEDURE: After the final chemotherapy infusion, and on the same day, the patient undergoes an explantation procedure where the implanted access device is removed and the vessel sutured either with or without a patch angioplasty.

ACTRN12614000484640,A pilot study of patients with oligometastases from breast cancer treated with stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery.  ,"Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy treatment is usually delivered in small doses over many treatments (usually 5 to 20 treatments). SABR treatment is different as it uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1 or 2 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages with the aim of destroying all cancer cells at the site of treatment. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses.

SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control the cancer spots that have spread from the breast to the bones and that are being treated with SABR.

Initially you will be assessed to check that you are suitable to join the study. This screening period may last for a number of weeks and will involve the following procedures. All of the tests that you will undergo during this screening period would normally be done as part of your standard care, even if you were not participating in this study.

* Medical history
* Physical examination with a focus on where the cancer has spread to in the body
* CT scan (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis) 
* CT of extremity (only if the cancer is present on an extremity)
* Whole body bone scan
* Other investigations, for example an MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging) may be ordered by your doctor

Also as part of this study you will be required to have a special scan called an 18F-PET/CT (stands for fluoride-positron emission tomography/computer tomography) scan. This involves an injection of a radioactive material/tracer and then a scan to see where your breast cancer has spread to.

If the tests show that the research study is suitable for you, and you still wish to take part, you can join the study and begin the treatment.

You will have either a single session of SABR treatment (20Gy in 1 fraction per area to be treated) or in some cases where there is not enough time available or for technical reasons you may be required to return for two or three sessions (i.e. You may receive 28Gy in 2 fractions).

In order to deliver this treatment, you may need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit may be required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. 

Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years after the SABR treatment. At each visit, a doctor will review your general health and whether anything new has happened to you since the last study visit (including any bad reactions or injuries), any side effects you may be experiencing, an assessment of how well you can perform daily activities and a review of any further anti-cancer treatments you may have undergone.

At 12 and 24 months after your SABR treatment, you will have a CT scan and whole body bone scan, as well as a another 18F-PET/CT scan (at 12 months only), which will be very similar to the scan before your treatment. The purpose of this scan is to assess the effect of the treatment on your bone lesion(s).

child diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Triple P is an evidence-based program developed specifically to provide parents with practical strategies for dealing with problem behaviour in their children.

Current research shows that parents of children being treated for childhood leukaemia have reported treatment related behavioural problems, including sleep, diet and general behaviour. Currently no evidence-based parenting interventions targeting these issues exist. The aim of the current study is pilot an existing evidence-based parenting intervention: Triple P - Positive Parenting Program (Group format for 0-12 year old children) using a live online meeting platform in order to: 1) assess the relevance of the intervention for paediatric cancer; 2) identify any modifications required to better tailor the program to the needs of parents of children with cancer; and 3) assess the feasibility of the live online delivery modality. 

The intervention will be delivered in an online group format therefore providing accessible and equitable parenting
support for metropolitan, regional and rural families. The results from this pilot intervention will be used to inform the
development of a cancer-specific Triple P Intervention (CancerCare Triple P) for implementation across multiple
paediatric oncology sites nationally.

ACTRN12614000702617,Improving quality of patient centred care in cancer,"Hospitals involved in this study will participate in a quality improvement intervention, based on the Breakthrough Series. The Breakthrough Series is a collaborative model of learning developed by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). This model focuses on health care systems improving the quality of their health care through sharing and learning from each others experiences and resources. It typically involves a number of hospitals working towards improving a similar, pre-determined area/s of care, over a set amount of time. Representatives from each hospital will meet and discuss their experiences, the strategies they used and share resources related to their efforts in improving the pre-determined area of care. The Breakthrough Series Approach has not been previously adapted such that consumers play a central role in guiding the process of change. This study will adapt the current Breakthrough Series Model to incorporate consumer involvement in identifying priority quality of care concerns, developing solutions and monitoring the success of those solutions. The theoretical underpinnings of the original Breakthrough Series Model will provide the basis of this intervention.

A modified Breakthrough Series approach will be used to deliver a multi­faceted consumer driven intervention aimed at improving patient­-centred care. This iterative and collaborative process will involve multi­disciplinary teams led by a Cancer Council New South Wales (CCNSW) consumer advocate. The teams will identify and work towards achieving hospital set goals, based on key patient priorities identified in the baseline data (Consumer Preferences Survey). The intervention will be carried out in a collaborative manner using the expertise and support of the multidisciplinary teams, the CCNSW, and change champions. The intervention will occur as follows: 1) Selection of influential consumer advocates to lead change in each experimental hospital. 2) Pre-intervention workshop. 3) Hospital data and goal setting. A collaborative sub-committee will be established to provide support and higher-level advocacy to each hospital and monitor adherence to the intervention via monthly teleconferences.

The intervention will be conducted as a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial with 6 sites. The 6 sites will be paired based on approximate size and location (rural/urban) of the hospital. All 6 units will start in the control condition. One site from each of the pairs (i.e. 3 of the 6 sites) will be randomly selected to switch to the intervention condition at 2 months after the commencement of baseline data collection, and will remain in the intervention condition for the remainder of the study intervention period (i.e. 10 month intervention). The remaining three chemotherapy units will switch to the intervention condition at 8 months after the commencement of baseline data collection, and will remain in the intervention condition for the remainder of the study intervention period (i.e. 4 month intervention). In total there will be 6 measurement periods.",CODE: Treatment: Other,"Eligible hospitals will be New South Wales based chemotherapy units.

Each session will last for about 1 hour and consist of a small group with each participant having a personally tailored program. This will continue for 6 months. Intensity will be monitored during exercise sessions using heart rate monitors and rate of perceived exertion (Borg scale). During the intervention phase, exercise intensity will be maintained in the moderate intensity and not enter into vigorous intensity (>60% VO2R). The key components of the exercise intervention include resistance training to increase lean muscle mass, and aerobic training to increase aerobic fitness.  Each exercise program will be fully supervised and designed in accordance with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines(Franklin BA, Whaley MH, and Howley ET. ACSM's Guidelines for exercise testing and prescription (6 ed.). Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, 2000). The program will consist of a 10 min warm up period, with light stretching, followed by 30-45 min of a circuit-based program which will use a combination of both endurance (65-85% of HRmax, monitored continuously using a Polar heart rate monitor) and resistance (55-70% maximal voluntary contraction) exercises, and a 10 min cool down.

Varenicline will be administered orally via tablets in accordance with approved labelling. Dose titration will be: 0.5 mg/d for days 1 to 3; 1 mg/d for days 4 to 7; and 2 mg/d (the target dose) from days 8 to 84. In accordance with recommendations from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (2009), patients who successfully complete the initial 3-month course will be offered an additional 3-month course (2mg/d) to assist with maintaining abstinence.

Varenicline will be provided at no cost to participants. The initial course of Varenicline will be distributed at treatment planning. Patients who successfully complete the initial 3 month course will receive a further 84 day supply of Varenicline during their appointment with the radiation oncologist (RO) following RT completion. Medication adherence will be evaluated via self-report and pill count. Medication compliance will be explicitly discussed by the RO and psychologist as part of the Behaviour Change Counselling Intervention. The psychologist will also administer an established medication adherence questionnaire at each appointment.  At each follow-up assessment, participants will be asked to return the blister packs administered at the preceding timepoint. Any missed medication will be retained by the research staff and counted. Any outstanding medication will be returned to the participant along with the next instalment of medication.

At the time of treatment planning (simulation), RO's will offer brief medical advice to quit. This brief intervention is designed to supplement Varenicline administration to assist patients to stop smoking. Brief advice will also be integrated into routine consultations.

Intervention participants will also receive up to 10 sessions of manual-based motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) delivered by a psychologist. Sessions will include 2 x pre-quit and 1 x quit day sessions (of up to one hour) and 7 x relapse prevention sessions (of up to 30min). Sessions will be weekly for the first four weeks and approximately fortnightly-monthly thereafter (as needed and according to patient preference).

Each of the intervention groups (parents, teachers and students) will work with researchers to devise policy changes to improve sun protection behaviours that are adopted by children during periods when students are exposed to ultraviolet light.
The behaviours sought to be modified include;
a)	Students wearing of wide brim hats and sunscreen during UV exposed periods of the day
b)	Students playing in shaded areas during periods of high UV exposure
c)	Teachers role-modelling the wearing of hats and sunglasses during exposed periods of the day 

The policy will be implemented by working with teachers (the primary change agent in schools) through professional learning workshops whereby they are given and develop their own strategies in how to model and encourage sun safe practices in primary school-aged children. These workshops will be guided by focus groups conducted with grade 6 students, parents and other teachers in the school community as to what are the enablers and barrieris to effective promotion of sun safe behaviours. The policies will also be required to adhere to the three pillars of the Health-Promoting Schools Framework.

Objective direct observation data collection will be used to monitor adhearence of teacher role-modelling behaviour. Post follow-up focus groups may also be conducted with teachers and students (time and funding pending) to ascertain the perceived adherence to the intervention.

The dose levels will be escalated throughout the study up to the MTD or the predicted efficacy level.  Dose escalation will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design (detail is described as below).

Cohort 1: 5 mg oral capsule once daily
Cohort 2: 10 mg oral capsule once daily
Cohort 3: 20 mg oral capsule once daily
Cohort 4: 30 mg oral capsule once daily
Cohort 5: 40 mg oral capsule once daily
Cohort 6: 60 mg oral capsule once daily

The starting dose will be 5 mg/day (5 mg once daily). The 24 day initial treatment cycle (Cycle 1) of each dose will consist of a single administration of BGB-283 (Day 1), followed by a 2 day treatment free period (Days 2 and 3) and a 21 day period of repeated drug administration (Days 4 to 24).  

Evaluation of a cohort of at least three (3) subjects completing one cycle of treatment at that dose level is required prior to determining the next dose level and dose regimen for the next cohort.

ACTRN12614001181695,A pilot study of patients with oligometastases from breast cancer treated with stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody MK-3475. ,"Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy treatment is usually delivered in small doses over many treatments (usually 5 to 20 treatments). SABR treatment is different as it uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1 or 2 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages with the aim of destroying all cancer cells at the site of treatment. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses. SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control the cancer spots that have spread from the breast to the bones and lymph nodes and that are being treated with SABR. 

The investigational drug (MK-3475) is a type of monoclonal antibody. An antibody is a common type of protein made in the body in response to a foreign substance. Antibodies attack foreign substances and protect against infection. A monoclonal antibody is a laboratory-produced antibody that is carefully engineered to attach to your cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies mimic the antibodies your body naturally produces as part of your immune system's response to germs, vaccines, and other invaders. There are now several approved monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer or other diseases.

MK-3475 is a monoclonal antibody that works against a protein called PD-1 on the surface of the cancer cells. It is thought that cancer cells with increased levels of PD-1 avoid detection by the bodys immune system. The study drug (MK-3475) is being tested to see if it can decrease the level of PD-1 in your cancer and allow the bodys immune system to identify and work against the tumour cells.


1) Screening Assessments:

Initially you will be assessed to check that you are eligible to join the study. This screening period may last for a number of weeks and will involve the following procedures. 

A) Physical Assessment: Including height, weight, pulse rate and blood pressure assessment. You will also be asked questions about your medical history and the medicines you currently take. Finally, your doctor will assess your performance status (by asking questions about your general well-being).

B) Disease Assessment: Your breast cancer will be assessed by: 
* Radiology scans such as a CT (computed tomography) scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
* Whole body bone scan 
* Nuclear medicine scans such as a FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) - PET (positron emission tomography)/computed tomography (CT). 
* X-rays (if necessary) 

* Tumour Tissue: If you decide to participate in this study, your doctor will be required to send a sample of your tumour to a central laboratory, which was previously collected when you were diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. This sample (which has already been taken from you) is currently stored in a pathology laboratory and we will request this sample to be sent to our central laboratory with your permission.

If your tumour starts to grow again at a location where it is readily accessible, your doctor may propose to take a biopsy again. We would like to collect a sample of this biopsy as well to determine in which way the tumour has changed. 

C) Routine Blood Samples: Before entering the study, blood will be taken (approximately 15-30mls or approximately 2 tablespoons) to check for; blood cell counts, liver, pancreas, kidney and thyroid function, HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, a breast cancer tumour marker called cancer antigen 15-3 (CA15-3), as well as a pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant. Blood samples will be taken at every 3 weeks while treatment is continuing to monitor your haematology and serum chemistry levels. 


2) STUDY TREATMENT:

If you decide to participate in the study and meet the criteria to take part in the study, you will be treated according to the following schema:

A) SABR TREATMENT

Prior to your SABR treatment, you will be required to fill out a pain rating scale, which may take up to 2 minutes of your time. You will have either a single session of SABR treatment (20Gy in 1 fraction per area to be treated) or in some cases where there is not enough time available or for technical reasons you may be required to return for two or three sessions (i.e. You may receive 28Gy in 2 fractions).

In order to deliver this treatment, you may need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit may be required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes.  When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. 

B) MK-3475 TREATMENT

MK-3475 (200mg) will be given to you by a needle in your vein (called venous infusion) over a period of 30mins, with the first dose starting a maximum of 5 days after completing SABR treatment, and delivered once every three weeks for a total of 8 cycles (i.e. 1 cycle every 3 weeks for a total of 8 cycles).

Treatment with MK-3475 will continue until you have completed 6 months of treatment, or until your cancer spreads further to other parts of your body, or you experience intolerable side effects. If you stop treatment for any reason prior to completing the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment, you will be offered alternative treatment options by your study doctor.

During the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment, you will be required to have a doctors visit every 3 weeks. Overnight stay in the hospital is not anticipated, but may become necessary. Routine blood tests, including liver, thyroid and kidney function, will be carried out during treatment at each visit before you receive MK-3475. If you develop side effects, more frequent examinations may be necessary.

Your physician will document your general condition and all hospital stays during the clinical trial. He/she will similarly ask you about all side effects which you experienced and about all medications or treatments which you received since your last visit.

Your doctor may suggest other tests, such as a CT scan if appropriate. The regular doctors visits are part of your standard medical care and are handled the same way as if you did not take part in the study.

If you complete the 6 months of MK-3475 treatment and your cancer has responded, but sometime in the future your cancer returns or grows (should this happen), you will be given the option to receive a further course of MK-3475 treatment by your study doctor.


3) CLINIC VISITS/FOLLOW-UP: 

After your SABR treatment is completed, you will be asked to attend the hospital for a check-up at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years from the date that SABR treatment was completed. Some of these visits may coincide with the 3-weekly visits required during the MK-3475 treatment, and if so, you wont be required to come to the hospital twice.

At each visit, a doctor will review your general health and whether anything new has happened to you since the last study visit (including any bad reactions or injuries), any side effects you may be experiencing, an assessment of how well you can perform daily activities and a review of any further anti-cancer treatments you may have undergone.

At every follow-up visit, you will be expected to fill out a questionnaire to nominate your current pain rating, which will take about 2 minutes of your time. 


A) RADIOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS:

The following radiological investigations will be undertaken during and after your treatment on this study:

* CT Scan and Whole Body Bone Scan: You will a CT scan and whole body bone scan at 6, 12 and 24 months post end of SABR treatment unless there is evidence that your disease has progressed, in which case the scans may be done earlier.

ACTRN12614001205628,A randomised trial assessing the acceptability and effectiveness of providing generic versus tailored feedback about health risks for a high need primary care sample,"Participants were invited by a Research Assistant (RA) to complete a health risk survey while waiting for their GP appointment. Immediately following completion of the survey (and also prior to their appointment), the RA provided participants with either tailored feedback (intervention group) or generic feedback (control group). The health risk survey was developed for the study and assessed the following risk factors: overweight (based on measured height and weight), and self reported: smoking, physical inactivity, inadequate fruit and vegetable intake, excess alcohol consumption, drug use, depression and under screening for blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and cervical, breast and colorectal cancer (according to age and gender). Survey items were drawn from previously validated measures or other national health surveys where possible. The survey took an average of 11 minutes to complete with the majority of participants completing the survey in less than 20 minutes. The tailored feedback was generated using study specific software and was based on individual survey responses, showing only those risk factors for which the participant was classified as at risk according to national guidelines or other cut offs. Tailored feedback showed the participant's current behaviour compared to that recommended in national guidelines. For example, for overweight participants, the tailored feedback displayed their current weight and a healthy weight for them (based on a BMI calculation of 25kg/m2). Generation and printing of the tailored feedback took approximately 2 minutes. Generic feedback included general guidelines covering all of the risk factors included in the survey, and was pre-printed and therefore provided to the participant immediately after survey completion. Both types of feedback also included simple advice about addressing health risks. For example, for weight, advice included tips for eating a healthy diet, doing more exercise, and advised talking to their GP for further help. All participants were instructed that they could show the feedback to their GP during their routine appointment if they wanted, and to ask their GP if they had any questions about the feedback. Participants had any remaining waiting time before their appointment to review the feedback. It was the choice of the participant and/or their GP about whether to discuss or take any other actions about the health risk feedback, including whether to schedule a follow-up appointment. Outcomes of the participant's appointment were assessed using an participant exit survey immediately following the participant's appointment with their GP.

ACTRN12614001245684,Rekindle: testing an online resource to promote sexual wellbeing for both cancer patients and their partners,"After consenting, participants will log into the Rekindle web intervention. Participants will be asked a series of questions that will determine their unmet needs and inform what of the available content is appropriate to each participant (the assessment battery). At this stage, participants will also be randomly assigned to one of the three study conditions: Rekindle, Rekindle Plus, and Attention Control. Patients and their partners may elect to complete Rekindle together or separately.

The content covered by the intervention includes psycho-education about sex, sexuality, cancer and side effects of cancer, principles of cognitive behavioural therapy, communication skills training, medical and non-medical treatments for diminished sexual function, mindfulness, sensate focus, and strategies for maintenance of skills. 

Participants in the Rekindle and Rekindle Plus conditions will then complete the exercises determined as most appropriate by their responses to the Assessment Battery. 
These exercises are completed sequentially at whatever pace and intervals that best suit individual participants. The intervention is estimated to take 10 weeks, although this will vary depending on each participant's identified needs. The exercises may include reading written text, watching videos and animations, and completing quizzes. Participants will be able to indicate whether or not they want to have more information at the end of each topic.

Participants will repeat the Assessment Battery at 10 weeks and six months after they commenced the intervention.  Participants in the Rekindle Plus condition will receive three phone calls across the intervention to encourage their ongoing participation with the aim of heightening engagement with Rekindle by providing added support. The calls will be made by trained Cancer Council supportive care staff within one week of joining the study, mid-way through each participants program, and at the end of each participants program.

ACTRN12614001248651,The first testing of TargomiRs in the human setting: dose-finding studies in patients with recurrent malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer,"TargomiRs are targeted minicells containing a microRNA mimic. They consist of three components: 1. A miR-16-based microRNA mimic. The miR-16 family has been implicated as a tumour suppressor in a range of cancer types. The mimic is a double-stranded, 23 base pair, synthetic RNA molecule. 2. Drug delivery vehicle  EDVs. EDVs are nonliving bacterial minicells (nanoparticles). They function as leak resistant micro-reservoir carriers that allow efficient packaging of a range of different drugs, proteins or nucleic acids. 3. Targeting moiety. The EDVs are targeted to EGFR-expressing cancer cells with an anti-EGFR bispecific antibody.

TargomiRs are IV injected.


Phase 1
Planned dose levels

Dose level 1: 5 billion once a week
Dose level 2: 5 billion twice a week
Dose level 3: 5 billion once a week with cardiac monitoring
Dose level 4: 2.5 billion twice a week with cardiac monitoring
Dose level 5: 2.5 billion twice a week with dexamethasone challenge and cardiac monitoring

All patients begin on modified, micro doses to allow the body the opportunity to adjust to the introduction of EDVs into the body. The full phase 1 dose for a patient is reached in treatment week 3. 

Duration of treatment for each dose level is on a patient by patient basis. Officially the cycle is 8 weeks long however a patient can continue on treatment if they are deriving clinical benefit from the treatment. 
If at any time point before or after the 8 week mark, a patient progresses, experiences ongoing or unreasonable toxicities or withdraws from the study, they will cease treatment. 

Escalation of dose in cohorts of 3-6 patients per dose level. If at least 2 patients are observed to experience Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT), the prior dose level is defined as the MTD.

Cardiac monitoring includes a Sestamibi scan and Echo before the patient begins on TargomiR treatment and if any cardiac changes are observed whilst the patient receives treatment, these scans are to be repeated and a Troponin blood level obtained. ECGs are obtained on the same schedule as all previous cohorts. 

Dexamethasone is one of the pre-medications given prior to TargomiRs. The dexamethasone challenge seeks to reduce the amount of dexamethasone given to patients during the course of their treatment period. 
The schedule is to reduce the dose from 4mg to nil over the course of 8 weeks so long as the patient does not experience undue allergic actions to the TargomiRs.


Adherence to the protocol tends not to be problematic in patient groups where the trial treatment is their only treatment option.

Participants will access the Decision Aid online via a link in an email sent to them by the BCT when they register for the study (registration is also online). The Decision Aid will take approximately 30 minutes to read; it can be downloaded and printed if required.

Participants will also complete a series of online questionnaires at 4 different timepoints over a 12 month period:
1) Before participants read the Decision Aid, a set of questionnaires will ask them how they feel about the treatment options they have been offered. These will take about 5-10 minutes to complete.
2) After participants see their medical oncologist and make their treatment decision. The questionnaires will ask them how they feel about the treatment decision they have made. It will take about 15-20 minutes to complete.

ACTRN12614001268639,"Benefits of home-based multidisciplinary
rehabilitation in non small cell lung cancer","In addition to usual care, participants will receive a structured multidisciplinary intervention including a personalised aerobic and resistance exercise program, goal setting and follow up in one to one phone and home visit consultations and symptom self-care education as outlined below. The aim is to increase general physical function levels, adherence with exercises through behaviour change and symptom management support. The initial physiotherapy session will be performed in the participants home, followed by weekly, scripted telephone contact to monitor exercise adherence and progress exercises and up to 2 additional home visits as required. Participants will also receive weekly nursing telephone intervention to monitor symptoms and provide self-care education. At the completion of the eight week home based program, a maintenance exercise program will be prescribed for each participant individually, with monthly physiotherapy telephone contact to monitor adherence and progress to the final 6 month time point.
Physical intervention: Will include both aerobic and resistance exercise training. Exercise intensity for each participant will be guided using a modified Borg Scale for perceived exertion/breathlessness (scale 0-10) aiming for exercise to be performed in the range of 4-5 (somewhat strong exertion). This will permit prescription of the same relative intensity across participants and allow participants to guide and monitor their own exercise effort to minimise likelihood of the exercises being too strenuous. Partners/carers will be encouraged to motivate participants as well as participate in the exercises, diary entry and measurement sessions. Participants will be taught all exercises by trained physiotherapists at an initial one hour face-to-face session.
The resistance exercise package will incorporate upper and lower limb exercises performed in the participants home using hand weights. Functional exercises, easy to perform at home, will also be included to assist in strength training (eg; step ups, sit to stand). Exercise dosage will be prescribed following an initial 10RM. With participants completing up to 80% of their 10RM and 2-3 sets of each exercise. Resistance exercises will be performed at least three days per week for 20 minutes and logged into activity diaries. Participants will be provided with a smartphone during the 8-week program and will receive one SMS reminder per day to act as a prompt to complete their exercise regime. They will also be able to use the smartphone to monitor their daily physical activity (steps taken and distance walked). Participants will be provided with a resistance exercise DVD and encourage to view this weekly to remind them of the accurate performance of each exercise. 
The aerobic component will consist of prescribed walking exercise. The aim of the walking program will be to progress to walking for a minimum of 150 minutes in total per week at a moderate intensity, as recommended by the guidelines for lung cancer. Walking may be undertaken in bouts of 10 minutes or in one block of 30mins or more. Defined, individualized outdoor physical activity will be prescribed to each subject by the physiotherapist and monitored using a combination of mapping and GPS software. Safety: Participants will be advised not to start exercising if they have a fever (>38 degrees Celsius), or have any new onset chest pain and will be provided with a contact number to ring if they or their partner/carer are concerned. They will be advised to stop exercising if they experience any new chest pains or are too breathless to be able to speak. Participants will be encourage to record details of daily aerobic and resistance exercises into an exercise diary. 

Symptom management and behaviour change support sessions: The model used for behaviour change support is the Health Change Australia Model of Behaviour Change. The aim is to build motivation and self-efficacy by identifying and addressing individual barriers to the recommended resistance training and cardiovascular exercise goals and thus initiate and sustain new physical activity behaviours. The physiotherapist will use the behaviour change model to establish the motivation level to participate and set individualised participant goals. 
Self-care requirements will be assessed at each 15 minute, scripted nursing telephone session where the nurse will use the validated Edmonton symptom assessment system to identify areas of individual unmet physical and emotional need. The aim of the initial nursing intervention session is to ensure symptoms that might interfere with exercise are addressed. Evidence based self-management information for specific symptoms will be provided to patients during these sessions. In addition, patients will be referred for further assessment and treatment by the medical team if more severe uncontrolled symptoms or side-effects are identified.

ACTRN12614001279617,Body composition assessment of children undergoing treatment for cancer,"All children participating in the study will have their height and weight measured on arrival at the centre. The Paediatric Oncology Assessment Tool will be completed before any body composition measurements are taken.  Mid arm circumferences will be taken using a tape measure and following standard guidelines. Skinfolds will be measured using calibrated calipers and following the strict standard site protocol. Measurements will be taken at the biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac sites. 

Total body potassium (TBK) analysis will be performed using a shadow shield whole-body counter (Accuscan, Canberra Industries, MA, USA), which contains three sodium iodide crystal scintillation detectors arranged above a scanning bed. The crystals detect the 1.46MeV gamma rays being emitted by the potassium-40 (40K) found in the body.  As a fixed proportion of the bodys potassium occurs as the natural isotope 40K, TBK can be determined. The measurement of TBK will require the subject to lie supine on a bed that is moved under the detectors. Two 1100sec scans will be performed for each subject with all personal metallic objects having been removed. Background and sensitivity checks will be completed daily and considered in each measurement, with TBK in grams being reported. Body cell mass (BCM) will then be calculated from TBK and adjusted for body size (BCM/HTp). BCM/HTp will be expressed as a Z score relative to laboratory reference data. 

ADP measurement will be performed using the Bod Pod (registered trademark)  Body Composition System, adhering to the manufacturers instructions (Life Measurement Inc, Concord, CA, USA; software version 1.69). Prior to each measurement, the Bod Pod will be calibrated at zero litres and with a standard calibration cylinder of 50 litres. The child is required to wear a swimming costume and swimming cap (both may be provided by the laboratory, specially laundered, if the child does not have their own) during the test.  Body volume measurements will be taken as the subject sits inside the chamber for a 50 second period. The measurement will be completed twice or until the body volume measurements are within 150ml or 0.2% of each other, whichever was the smallest (maximum of three attempts).

patients will undergo primovist MRI as part of their work up for presentation with locally resectable pancreatic cancer

An MRI is a scan, which does not expose the patient to any ionizing radiation. A contrast agent is injected through a cannula, usually in the arm. Patients are then required to lay flat on their back for the duration of the scan, which is usually about 35 minutes. The contrast injected in this situation would be Primovist.
Primovist is a liver specific contrast, which helps characterize liver lesions in MRI more accurately. It has been available since 2005 and is used with increasing confidence in many liver centres. It is TGA approved but not yet available on Medicare. 

the primovist MRI will be in addition to the multiphase CT as this is the usual test to assess the liver but also the pancreas cancer and its relationship to vessels and the chest for disease.

We will assess the ability of this programme to improve the quality of recovery for these patients.
The study will involve five phases: study planning; assessment; alignment; application and measuring.
Study planning: This phase will involve finalisation of the study protocol; development of study tools and education of research staff around data collection methods. Ethics and local approvals will also be obtained in this period.
Assessment: This phase will involve data collection on all patients admitted following lung cancer surgery to the ICU over a six month period. The aims of this phase are to identify the target patient population; map current workflow and care practices; assess current morbidity rate; assess current intensive care and hospital length of stay for this group; estimate current clinical and economic impact and costs; and identify specific opportunities for improvement. Patients will be invited to participate in a follow-up interview with a research nurse which will assess quality of recovery via a web-based or telephone based interview using the postoperative quality recovery scale (PQRS scale). 
Alignment:This phase will commence on completion of the assessment phase and will last three months. We will identify and engage core interdisciplinary team members; define Enhance Recovery Programme (ERP) triggers and build checklists; map and test ERP workflow and interventions and communicate the plan to key stakeholders in preparation for the application phase of study. All staff will be trained in the programme and how it will be implemented. During this period, data collected in the assessment phase will be analysed and used as the comparator for the data collected following the application phase to assess the success of the programme.
Application: This phase - lasting six months - involves establishing the ERP in this patient population and to complete recruitment and document compliance levels with the ER programme. Patients will be approached by an ERP nurse specialist following referral for surgery and introduced to the programme. All elements of the programme will be instituted and then patients will be invited to participate in a follow-up interview with a research nurse which will assess quality of recovery via a web-based or telephone based interview using the post-operative quality recovery scale. 
Measuring: In this final phase we will gather morbidity, length of stay and compliance data for the group enrolled to experience ERP. Also, one year follow-up measures of quality of life and recovery will be completed. Measurement and analysis of clinical and economic outcome benefits will compare ER outcomes to programme goals; we will communicate results to the key stakeholders and identify opportunities for improvement, expansion and knowledge translation.

ACTRN12615000085572,Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial of a Supervised EXErcise Program in Patients with Lymphoma treated with Chemotherapy,"Participants undergo an initial assessment where an accredited exercise physiologist designs an individually tailored exercise program. Sessions are conducted twice weekly for a total of 20 sessions. All sessions are conducted within a group setting with a maximum number of 6 individuals under the guidance and supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist.
The exercise program will include both aerobic and resistance training. Although prior observational exercise intervention studies have focused on aerobic physical activity alone, our study will involve a combination of both aerobic and resistance training as the latter has been shown to have a positive effect on the performance of tasks required for everyday function.
Initial sessions will be of 20 minutes duration with 5-minute warm up and cool down periods. The sessions are classified as light in intensity with an aim to achieve 40-50% of heart rate reserve or a rate of perceived exertion (RPE) of 10-12. Subsequent sessions will gradually increase in duration (by 5 to 10 minutes) and intensity to a maximum of 45 minutes, with a 40:60 ratio of aerobic training to resistance training. It is recognized that some participants may achieve the training goals earlier but progression will adhere strictly to the American College of Sports Medicine Guidelines.

Aerobic

Aerobic exercises primarily consist of treadmill or upright/recumbent cycling. Aerobic activities are usually 5  15 min duration depending on Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) or fatigue levels. Intensity is gradually progressed i.e. speed or resistance to support cardio- respiratory improvements. Rowing or Elliptical trainers are also available and may be considered as an alternative.

Resistance Training

All major muscle groups are exercised and we utilise pin loaded weights machines to ensure safe and effective technique. The participants commence at 75% or their 1 RM score and the resistance is gradually increased and capacity/strength improves.

For the intervention group, the unbound (free) concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics will be calculated from the total concentration assay of blood samples taken at the mid of dosing interval and 15 minutes before the next dose as a trough. Based on the free antibiotic concentration at the specified blood sampling times, whether  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) target is achieved or not will be determined. The PK/PD target is achievement of 100%fT>MIC (the free antibiotic concentration remains above the MIC for the entire duration of the dosing interval). This will be determined by using local institutional antibiograms at the study hospital or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) (http://www.eucast.org/clinical breakpoints) recommendations will be used as reference bacterial susceptibility breakpoints. The proposed sampling time allows determination of PK/PD target without calculating the exact time above MIC. Results of the free antibiotic blood concentration and target attainment will be communicated to clinicians treating the patient. Based on the results, investigators of the study will then identify the need for dose adjustment in conjunction with the clinicians. When deemed necessary, dose adjustment will be performed. Doses will be adjusted as necessary either by increasing the frequency by 25 to 50% or changing the mode of administration into extended infusion or both. If trough concentrations  are greater than ten times the MIC, dose reduction will be performed by reducing the frequency by 25 to 50 % or decreasing the dose by 50%. The overall duration of treatment will be at clinician discretion.

ACTRN12615000213549,Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy for Fear of Recurrence in Ovarian Cancer Survivors. (FROCS),"Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy.
Mindfulness based cognitive therapy is a group program that is generally used to delay or prevent recurrence of major depression, but may also reduce depressive symptoms. The treatment combines the clinical application of mindfulness meditation with elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and was first developed in 2000.
Mindfulness is purposeful, nonjudgmental attention to the present moment, which is developed through meditation and other practices. CBT is based upon the theory that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors lead to psychopathology; the clinician and patient identify these dysfunctional cognitions and the patient tries to change the resulting problematic behaviors.
There are similarities between mindfulness based cognitive therapy and CBT. Both treatments teach patients to identify triggers and symptoms of relapse such as anxiety and depression, and to develop a behavior plan for avoiding relapse. Other similarities include directing patients to observe their thoughts and to rate activities for the pleasure and sense of mastery they provide. 
What distinguishes mindfulness based cognitive therapy is its emphasis upon accepting dysfunctional thoughts. In contrast, CBT emphasizes changing dysfunctional thoughts by gathering evidence to dispute their validity. 
The MBCT course comprises 8 weekly sessions with each session being approximately 2 hours. The duration of the course is 8 weeks and the sessions take place in groups of 8-15 individuals. The groups will be run by experienced clinicians in psychotherapy, counselling and meditation and will have a clinician manual and a participant workbook outlining the themes and exercises for each week. Adherence is monitored by discussion of issues which may arise during practice of the techniques in between sessions.

ACTRN12615000223538,A Multicentre External Beam Radiotherapy Study Using Stereotactic Boost for Prostate Cancer Patients ,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows high doses of radiotherapy to be delivered using external beam radiotherapy to a similar dose that is achieved using brachytherapy. The study investigates if stereotactic radiotherapy can be as safe and as effective as brachytherapy without the need for an invasive surgical procedure involved with delivering brachytherapy. The main reason for this study is to try to replicate this technique in Australia using equipment available in all radiotherapy departments.
This study also includes a mechanism for SBRT dose escalation. A minimum of 20 men are to complete treatment without >15% suffering a grade 3 acute toxicity or any episodes of grade 4 acute toxicity at a particular dose level. The individual centre must also accrue >5 patients at the previous dose level prior to exploring dose escalation. Once this is satisfied the SBRT dose is to increase by 1Gy. The initial dose will be 19Gy, therefore the first dose escalation will be to 20Gy. This process can be followed a maximum of three times, to a maximum SBRT dose of 22Gy.
Radiotherapy can cause damage to the lower part of the bowel, known as the rectum, which is right next to the prostate. Two methods are available to try to reduce the risk of any damage to the rectum by moving the rectum a little further away from the prostate. Firstly, a device called Rectafix could be used in this study to do this. It involves inserting a probe the same size as a finger into the back passage and using it to angle the rectum away from the prostate inserted only for the duration of the radiotherapy planning, and only for the duration of the two stereotactic radiotherapy treatments. Secondly, a water based gel called SpaceOAR could also be used in this study to do this. It involves inserting this gel in the space between the prostate and rectum 1-2 weeks before radiotherapy planning. Either of these rectal displacement techniques (Rectafix or SpaceOAR) will be utilised at the doctor's discretion in consultation with the participating patients.

Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy and uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1-3 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages. The recommended dose fractionation for this study is site-specific, and ranges from 18Gy/1Fx to 45Gy/3Fx. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses. Generally, SABR treatment is given in a single 60 minute session, however, if more than one session of SABR treatment is required, this will be done on non-consecutive days within 14 days.",CODE: Treatment: Devices,"- Aged 18 years or older

ACTRN12615000335594,TROG 15.01 (SPARK) Efficacy of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM) in men with prostate cancer undergoing stereotactic prostate radiotherapy,"All participants will receive Multi-Fraction SABR; 36.25 Gy (PTV D95) in 5 Fractions within 2-5 weeks.
The frequency and overall duration of SABR is determined at the discretion of the physician with patient consultation.
Most linear accelerators used to treat cancer patients today are equipped with fixed X-ray imagers which are typically used to take images of a tumour before a patient receives radiotherapy. A new technology, known as Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM), has recently emerged which allows images the position of a the tumour to be taken measured in real-time while the treatment is occurring. Real-time imaging involves a single gantry-mounted kV x-ray imager acquiring 2D projections of implanted fiducial markers. 3D positions are then reconstructed by maximum likelihood estimation of a 3D probability density function.
The SPARK trial is testing the use of KIM in prostate cancer patients being treated with Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy. The researchers expect this trial to result in better targeted prostate cancer patient outcomes with lower toxicity. 
Patients involved in this trial will receive radiotherapy to the prostate over five sessions given within two weeks. During radiation therapy, KIM will be used to check the position of the cancer.  If the cancer moves more than 3mm, the treatment will be stopped and the cancer will be realigned with the treatment beam. The five stereotactic sessions will take around one hour each, including the preparation time.  
From the end of treatment participants will be followed up at regular intervals for the reminder of the study, which will be a minimum of 2 years from enrolment.

ACTRN12615000356561,A research study about personal genetic risk of melanoma among the general population,"Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive:
1)	Personal information about their melanoma genetic risk.
2)	Telephone access to a genetic counsellor; 
3)	Printed and electronic general educational materials on melanoma preventive behaviours including sun exposure, sun protection and skin examinations.

Determination of genetic risk: From participants saliva samples, we will genotype specific variants in 20 genes that have a confirmed association with melanoma risk. All variants will have been identified through adequately powered and replicated large, international studies. Genetic risk estimates for melanoma will be presented both as: 1) an absolute-risk and relative-risk estimate of the participants lifetime risk of developing melanoma; and 2) a broad genetic risk level  low, average, high. Participants will not be given their individual genotypes, only the risk estimates derived from them. A persons lifetime risk of melanoma based on the 20 selected genomic variants will be estimated using published statistical methodology. The calculation assumes a multiplicative model and is based on the persons genomic variation, the odds ratio for melanoma associated with each variants risk allele from replication studies or meta-analyses, the corresponding population frequency of each risk allele, and age- and sex-specific melanoma residual lifetime risk estimates from NSW cancer incidence data. 

Communication of information on personal melanoma genetic risk: When it is time to give the participant the information on their personal genetic risk of melanoma, they will be contacted by telephone by the studys genetic counsellor. At this time, the genetic counsellor will ask whether or not the participant has any questions or concerns and will check that they still wish to receive this information (verbal consent) before talking to them about their personal melanoma genetic risk derived from their saliva sample. When speaking to the genetic counsellor, participants can decide whether they would like to 1) receive their risk information from the genetic counsellor over the telephone, followed by receiving the same information in a written format; or 2) whether they would prefer not to speak to the genetic counsellor at that time, but would prefer to first receive their risk information in a written format. Regardless of whether or not participants elect to receive their risk information first over the telephone from the genetic counsellor, all participants will receive written communication of their personal melanoma genetic risk either via mailed letter or emailed letter (according to personal preference as indicated on the Consent Form). If the participant has any further questions about the information we send them, they can contact the studys genetic counsellor by telephone to discuss further. The genetic counsellor will provide a mandatory follow up call to all those participants who elect to wait to receive their risk information via letter where the results indicate a high risk. There is no limit on the number and duration of telephone-based counselling sessions. A qualified genetic counsellor will administer the sessions.

Men who meet the inclusion criteria will be identified by the treating team, who will refer the man to the True NTH coordinator as early as possible in the care pathway.  Following referral to the True NTH service by the treating team, the local care coordinator will undertake a comprehensive screening and assessment process in a structured face to face consultation.  This initial screening and assessment is communicated to the treating team and provides the basis for development of a care plan and referral to other relevant True NTH services. All men will then be provided with a technology supported platform which enables them to undertake ongoing self-monitoring of symptoms and needs on a 3 monthly basis, or when new symptoms emerge. An alert will be sent to the True NTH care coordinator and general practitioner when assessments are completed. On the basis of these assessments, navigation to the following services will occur: a)Central Coordination Service; b)Practical support; c)Lifestyle Plan; and d)	Peer group. 

Not all men will need to access all of the True NTH intervention components. The man will only be referred to the components needed, as identified during screening and assessment, and agreed by the treating specialist/team.

2. Information Provision and Decision Support
At the time of recruitment, the care coordinator will make available to the man and their carer the appropriate education and decision support material relevant to their stage of disease and treatment.  The education package will include evidence based patient education booklets according to need. The local care coordinator will provide a one-to-one instructional session with the patient and carer, tailoring information to patient and carer needs. The local care coordinator will also provide self management messages to reinforce key messages for preventing and responding to physical or psychological symptoms, drawing on evidence based information included in the information and education packages. 

The local care coordinator will introduce men with localised prostate cancer to an online decision support aid - the Personal Patient Profile - Prostate (P3P) Decision Support Aid1, which will be modified to suit the Australian context (language/text, definitions, statistics, videos and weblinks). The treating team will access the information gained from the patients use of the decision support aid to facilitate discussion regarding treatment choices.

3. Practical Support 
The local care coordinator and central True NTH services will refer the man to relevant support services to address practical needs relating to transport, accommodation, finance and advance care planning. These referrals will be based on assessment of needs and preferences. Local service registries will be developed to support referral, with reference to True NTH Specialist Services where local services are unavailable to meet the mans needs.

4. Peer Support 
The local care coordinator and central coordination service will provide information to the man and his carer about a range of peer support programs. The list of local services will be developed following the initial mapping of local peer support initiatives and advice from Prostate Cancer Foundation Australia and Cancer Council contacts.

The program will be delivered through multiple modes, depending on available resources, including: a)Face-to-face consultations with an accredited exercise physiologist (AEP); b)Telephone or online teleconference with an AEP; c)Online delivery via a web site with customisation to the individuals requirements and contraindications; d)DVD exercise programs with generic prescriptions for men at different stages of disease and treatment; e)Paper based exercise programs with generic prescriptions for men at different stages of disease and treatment. For an exercise clinic staffed by AEPs, laboratory standard tests will be applied. The AEP will provide initial face to face assessment, develop a tailored exercise prescription and support the man remotely as required over time to maintain adherence to the program, adjusting as needed. Where no EP is available, telehealth assessment and ongoing support will be provided, drawing on the support of other allied health, medical and nursing professionals where appropriate. 

The exercise assessment and prescription will be provided from Edith Cowan University (ECU). The exercise prescriptions will be tailored to the individual to address the specific issues causing greatest concern or to prepare them for future treatments such as surgery, or to address post-treatment issues. That is, the exercise physiologist will deliver a structured program relevant to the mans disease stage.  The program will include the following components: a)The man undergoing a curative treatment option prostatectomy or radiation oncology will undertake a 6-8 week exercise program in readiness for treatment incorporating a pelvic floor exercise program; b)All other men will have an exercise program tailored for them individually by an exercise physiologist following the Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESAA) guideline for cancer; c)Men with advanced prostate cancer will have a specialised exercise program focused on impact exercise for those receiving ADT or with bone metastasis. Regular monitoring of the man will ensure safety as well as providing motivation to continue to adhere to the exercise prescription. To facilitate this, the latest technology for biometric monitoring will be used to track key fitness and health measures. This will be coordinated through ECU using their online data collection systems. 

2) Nutrition
True NTH will provide access to services of a dietician either locally or through central coordination services, depending on the capacity of the local health service and preferences of the man.  The man will undergo an initial nutrition screening using the Malnutrition Screening Tool and calculating body mass index (BMI). In addition to the initial screening for malnutrition and excess weight at referral to the True NTH local care coordinator, additional screening points will include: a)At completion of curative treatment or those on active surveillance; b)At diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer and then at 3 monthly intervals. If identified to be at risk at any screening point, men are referred to an Accredited Practicing Dietitian (APD) for a comprehensive nutritional assessment.  This referral will be to a local APD where available, or to a central care coordinator who will facilitate referral to an APD if no local service is available.   

6. Specialised Support Services 
The local care coordinator will work with the local treating teams to match services to the needs and preferences of the man and their carer at entry to the True NTH program and at any point during the study intervention phase. The navigation will involve referral to the following specialist services where required: 
1)Psychological services
The local care coordinator will undertake the initial screening using the distress thermometer and identify factors associated with any distress. Men with mild or moderate anxiety and/or depression will be referred to an online self management program. The self-management program focuses on developing skills to manage distress and is delivered by Mindspot. For men with moderate or high level needs at referral or at any follow up assessment, referral will be made to: a)Psychological support services within the treating service where available; b)Remote psychological support services coordinated by the central coordination service, and delivered by staff from Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre.

2)Sexual health 
At referral to the local care coordinator, all men will receive standard information and education relating to sexual health issues.  Assessment and ongoing monitoring will identify men with sexual health needs who require additional services. These men will be referred to a local sexual health counsellor where available or referred to a specialist service from the centralised True NTH service where local services are not available. 

3)Continence services	
At referral to the local care coordinator, all men will receive standard information and education relating to continence issues. Assessment and ongoing monitoring will identify men with continence needs who require additional services. These men will be referred to local continence advisors where available and/or referred to the Continence Foundation Australia (CFA) if such services are not available.  CFA will liaise with the treating specialist team to contribute to a continence plan through advice and expertise.

7. Advance Prostate Cancer Comorbidities management
On enrolment to the study, the local care coordinator will liaise with the patients GP to facilitate the following assessments: a)For men with localised prostate cancer an assessment for comorbidities, using RACGP Guidelines; b)For men with advanced prostate cancer, a specific set of tests and measures for osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes. 
Based on this assessment the GP will be provided with care plan guidelines to facilitate management of any identified risks and conditions. The lifestyle component of the True NTH intervention will also support the man to minimise risk of ADT adverse effects as well as those from other treatments for men with advanced prostate cancer.



While each component of the intervention is available for all men, the intervention and each of its components are tailored to the patients stage of disease and their health related needs.  Delivery of specialised support services will depend on resource  availabililty, access, treating specialist /team  preference and preference of the man. The service model incorporates centralised coordination and referral to specilist services where required, as it is acknowledged that all services may not be available at a local region. The total duration of the intervention is 6 months.",CODE: Treatment: Other::||::CODE: Rehabilitation::||::CODE: Lifestyle,"Patients will be eligible for the study if they:

ACTRN12615000731594,Beneficial effects of exercise done before prostate cancer surgery,"This study was a 6-week exercise intervention programme with assessments undertaken at three time-points: (1) baseline, (2) immediately pre-surgery and (3) 6-week post-surgery follow-up. The 6-week exercise programme commenced 6 weeks prior to the schedule surgery date. Patients undertook an exercise programme that consisted of two supervised clinic sessions per week. Each supervised exercise session took approximately 90 minutes to complete. Sessions commenced with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of moderate level of aerobic exercise (~60% heart rate maximum (HRmax)), as well as stretching exercises of the major muscle groups: chest, shoulder, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles. This was followed by a resistance-training regime that included a series of six exercises targeting the major muscles of the upper- and lower-body. Upper-limb exercises included chest press, seated row and lat pull-down. Lower-limb exercises were leg extension, leg curl and leg press. All exercises were performed through the full range of motion adhering to correct techniques. To ensure the progressive nature of the training programme, patients were encouraged to work past the repetition maximum (RM) prescribed, with resistance increased by 5  10% for the subsequent set/training sessions if they were able to exceed the number specified. Specifically, training phases were: week 1  2 (two sets 12 RM), week 3 (three sets of 10 RM), week 4  5 (three sets of 8 RM), week 6 (four sets of 6 RM). Each supervised session also included 15 minutes of exercises focusing on the trunk stabilising muscles. Patients performed three sets of three different exercises with a rest of 30 to 60 seconds between each set. These exercises consisted of planks (anterior abdominals), reverse bridge on Swiss ball (back extensors) and side planks (oblique abdominals) (Lehman, Hoda, & Oliver, 2005). The training load increased progressively by 5  10 seconds every week, starting with 10 seconds for the side planks and 30 seconds for the other trunk stabiliser exercises. Following the completion of the trunk stabiliser exercises, a further 20 minutes of aerobic exercise was undertaken. This included such specific activity as walking or jogging on a treadmill; cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer; or exercising on a cross training machine depending on each patients preference.

The program is delivered orally in a group format, by two psychologists/social workers with training in ACT. Groups consist of 4-8 participants and runs once a week for 7 sessions of 1.5-2 hours duration, for an overall duration of 7 weeks. Parallel to the intervention one parent of the participant (not necessarily the parent with cancer) is given a psychoeducational booklet which provides details about the program, ACT and research findings regarding the impact on children of having a parent with cancer. Session 6 is a joint participant-parent session. The content of session 6 follows on from the content of the parent psychoeducational booklet and provides an opportunity for the participants and their parents to discuss issues pertinent to the family situation when a parent has cancer. 


Homework is administered through weekly tasks with a participant booklet. Homework exercises consist of small daily tasks that would take approximately 30-60 minutes per week. Fidelity to the program measured by facilitator compliance to the manualised program, homework compliance and participant engagement. Facilitator compliance is measured through written logs of each group session which is sent to the independent administrating team and discussed at weekly briefing/debriefing meetings. Homework compliance is measured by a homework log that is completed by the participant at each session and forwarded to the administration team.

ACTRN12615000771550,Adaptive Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Cancer: Feasibility and Clinical Implications ,"Adaptive radiotherapy involves re-planning the radiation treatment during the course of treatment to account for changes in shape due to tumour shrinkage and patient weight loss. This can potentially reduce the radiation dose received by normal structures (particularly the parotid salivary glands), and increase the dose received by the target volume. 

Patients will undergo standard curative-intent definitive radiotherapy (70Gy in 35 fractions, 2Gy per fraction, 1 fraction per day delivered 5 days per week for overall duration of 7 weeks). The participants will continue with this dose schedule for the whole course of treatment. At 3 and 5 weeks of treatment they will undergo both a repeat radiotherapy planning CT and repeat PET-CT. The repeat planning CT will be loaded on to the radiotherapy treatment planning system. The patient's initial RT plan will be overlaid on to this and re-calculated by the treatment planning system to give the new expected dose distribution on the patient's altered anatomy. The PI will then manually re-contour all the target volumes and normal structures on the repeat scans to create a new RT plan. We will then compare the dose distribution between the original plan and the re-contoured plan. to determine whether adaptive re-planning can reduce the dose to organs at risk or improve the dose to the target volume.

The participants will continue with treatment using their original radiotherapy plan unless the treating radiation oncologist deems it necessary to alter the treatment volumes (current standard treatment).

ACTRN12615000878572,The efficacy of the application of Self-Determination Theory to an online cognitive rehabilitation intervention in remediating cognitive dysfunction associated with cancer and its treatment.,"The online version of ""ReCog"" was adapted from the face-to-face manualized intervention that is based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive rehabilitation. The online intervention is comprised of 4 modules that offer education, skills training and skills practice on topics such as memory, attention, fatigue, and emotions, as well as between-session homework. The intervention is designed to be completed on a laptop or desktop computer remotely (e.g., at home) via the internet. Each module takes approximately 60 minutes to complete, and should be completed in one sitting. Participants are expected to complete one module per week, and thus are given 4 weeks access to complete all 4 modules. Each module involves education and skills training (e.g. goal-setting, problem solving, relaxation training). Participants are then expected to practice these skills for homework each week by keeping record of their practice habits and their implementation of their learnt skills. This should take approximately 30-60 minutes per week. Treatment adherence is monitored through response submissions during completion of the online modules, and participant feedback about homework completion.

ACTRN12615000894594,Oral Paclitaxel for the Treatment of Cancer,"Stage 1 is a cohort of up to 6 patients (Cohort 1), to confirm the dose of Oraxol when compared with IV paclitaxel.
This is a randomised trial and therefore Oraxol may be administered in Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2.
Oraxol is administered over three days (i.e. Days 1, 2 and 3 of the applicable Treatment Period). The daily dose of Oraxol is one HM30181AK-US 15mg tablet administered one hour before oral paclitaxel 205mg/m2. Oraxol will be administered at the study site on each dosing day. Patients need to fast for 8 hours before and 4 hours after Oraxol administration.
Dosing for Treatment Period 2 may start on the last day of PK sampling for Treatment Period 1, or may be delayed for up to 3 weeks, if needed, to allow the participant to recover to less than or equal to Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) or baseline toxicity from the prior study treatment or to allow the participants flexibility in scheduling inpatient treatment.
An interim analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Cohort 1 will be conducted to determine if the administered regimen would appear likely to achieve BE (AUC0-inf), if tested in a greater number of participants in Stage 2. A decision will be made by consensus of the DSMB, Kinex, Zenith Technology, and the Principal Investigator as to whether a second cohort administered a different dose is required to complete Stage1 or whether the study can proceed to Stage 2 using the dose administered in Stage 1. An additional 18 to 42 evaluable participants will be enrolled into Stage 2 based on the Stage 1 results (AUC0-inf). The study design for Stage 2 is the same as for Stage 1.

Study Design: 
This study is a three-arm, 12 week randomised controlled trial. 

Participants: 
Men and women who have been previously treated for colorectal cancer will be invited to participate in this randomised clinical trial. 

Intervention Structure:
Following recruitment, participants will complete a familiarisation session, before which they will be provided with further details of the research program and afforded the opportunity to seek clarification for any questions related to the study. At the commencement of this session informed consent will be attained by way of a written consent form, witnessed by the principle investigator. The familiarisation session will conclude with a test of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak test) After familiarisation, participants will complete a baseline testing session to measure all primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will then be randomised  to one of three groups: (1) high intensity exercise - continuous (HIE-C) training group; (2) high intensity exercise - tapered (HIE-T) training group;(3) or a moderate intensity exercise (MIE) training group. 

The HIE-C and MIE groups will train at a frequency of 3 times per week for 8 weeks whereas the HIE-T group will train at a frequency of 3 times per week for the first 4 weeks, and at a frequency of once per week for the later 4 weeks. Participants will undergo testing at baseline (0 weeks), midpoint (4 weeks), endpoint (8 weeks) and follow-up (12 weeks). All exercise testing and training sessions will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (Exercise and Sports Science Australia). Participants will exercise in groups ranging from 1 to 4 depending on the suitability of times for each individual participant. 

Intervention:
The HIE sessions will commence with 10 minutes of warm up at 50-70% of peak heart rate (HRpeak) before commencing 4 x 4 minute bouts of cycling at 85-95% HRpeak. Each 4 minute interval will be interspersed with a 3 minute period of active recovery at 50-70% HRpeak, totalling 38 minutes for the session. Attendance will be measured via a training log, and adherence to the prescribed exercise will be asssessed by continuous heart rate monitoring.

A Dermatologist will be responsible for the Photodynamic Therapy as part of their normal practice. Photodynamic Therapy involves the application of a topical photosensitising agent, Methyl Aminolevulinate Hydrochloride (MAL) cream, to the area to be treated. 160mg/g is applied with a 10mm margin at least 1mm thick. Occlusive and opaque dressing is then applied for 3 hours. 

The application of MAL makes Basal Cell Carcinoma/Bowen's Disease cells sensitive to a certain type of light. Illumination leads to the release of reactive oxygen species within the target tissue. Local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine by injection (subcutaneous or dermal) will be offered prior to illumination. 

The area is illuminated with noncoherent red light at a wavelength of 630 nm for a total dose of 37 joules/cm2. The light source is placed 5-8cm away, and parallel to the skin surface. The duration of illumination is approximately 9 minutes. When the area is exposed to the light source, neoplastic cells are destroyed by either necrosis or apoptosis.

A bone marrow is additionally required at the end of the Monotherapy Phase. Patients will be required to return empty lenalidomide containers to pharmacy. 

Monitoring Phase:
Patient will stop lenalidomide and remain off imatinib. The Monitoring Phase will last for up to 30 months (2 and a half years) unless relapse occurs as decided by clinical discretion of the treating physician..
Patient will continue to have monthly BCR-ABL levels in which 27 mL (2 tablespoons) of blood will be collected for the first 6 months and then every 2 months for the subsequent 18 months, and every 3 months for one year.  4-12 mL (1-2 and a half teaspoons) of blood will be taken 3 monthly for the first 2 years and then yearly for the subsequent year to assess the levels of different types of blood cells, important blood minerals, and to assess liver and kidney function.  A bone marrow is additionally required at month 3 of the Monitoring Phase.

Re-Treatment Phase:
Patients who relapse at any time after stopping imatinib will stop taking lenalidomide (if applicable) and resume imatinib at the previous effective and tolerated dose for as long as is needed. During the Re-Treatment Phase the response to treatment will be monitored every month for at least 6 months.  If any patient shows a poor response to re-treatment with imatinib, then alternative treatment will be offered.

Follow-Up Phase:
The Follow-Up Phase will last for 3 years after the completion of the Monitoring or Re-Treatment Phase (if this is needed).
Patient will have blood tests every 6 months for BCR-ABL PCR (27 mL or 2 tablespoons) and yearly to assess the levels of different types of blood cells (4 mL or 1 teaspoon).  This will continue for the next 3 years.  The total duration for the study will be up to 6 and a half years.

ACTRN12615001183572,"A study to investigate whether a combined Positron emission tomography (PET) and computerised tomography (CT) scan which utilises a tracer called Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) - a substance expressed by prostate cancer cells - can be used to better identify locally recurrent prostate cancer in men with a rising Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) following radical prostatectomy. The study will then measure the impact of early salvage radiation therapy using advanced localisation techniques on patient survival, clinical toxicity, health related quality of life and prostate cancer-specific quality of life.","Screening intervention: Patients presenting with elevated levels of circulating PSA between 0.1-2.5 ng/mL following post-prostatectomy, and fulfilling all other inclusion criteria as outlined in section 5.2.1, will undergo [68Ga] Gallium-labelled PSMA PET/CT imaging. For the PET scan the 68Ga-PSMA ligand will be administered intravenously, and a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT will be performed 90 minutes post injection (scanning takes approximately 30-40 minutes). A low dose whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan will be performed during the PET scan as this helps to interpret the PET scan. A contrast enhanced CT Chest/Abdo/Pelvis will be performed following the PSMA PET/CT. This is standard care. However, if the imaging centre does not have the ability to perform the contrast enhanced CT Chest/Abdo/Pelvis, the low dose CT will be acceptable.

Study participants who report a positive PSMA PET scan for metastatic disease will be screened out and receive appropriate treatment for their metastatic disease off-trial, whilst those who are PSMA PET positive for locally recurrent disease only (macroscopic disease), or those with a negative PSMA (microscopic disease), will be offered a course of salvage radiotherapy utilising implanted Calypso (Registered Trademark) radiofrequency beacons to track movement of the prostate bed in real-time. Participants who are ineligible for Calypso beacons will be enrolled as a control group receiving the standard radiotherapy treatment described above, but without Calypso beacons.

Treatment Intervention: Curative salvage radiotherapy will be undertaken using a series of electromagnetic (EM) transponders (or beacons) that are implanted into the prostate bed then tracked in real-time by the Calypso (Registered Trademark) 4D Localisation System (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) during the entire radiation treatment schedule. 
1)	Prior to treatment, three tiny electromagnetic transponders or beacons  about the size of a grain of rice  will be permanently implanted during a routine day hospital procedure, similar but less invasive than a prostate biopsy. 
2)	During treatment, an electromagnetic array will be positioned above the treatment site. The array sends a signal that excites the transponders, which then communicates the location of the target.
3)	Using harmless non-ionizing electromagnetic waves, the system detects even slight tumour movement in real time and if required, the radiation therapist can pause treatment to make adjustments, so that radiation delivery is once again focused on the tumour.  
4)	The Varian Calypso (Registered Trademark) system links with our treatment linear accelerators, which produces and delivers the X-rays used to treat cancer.

Following beacon insertion, a CT scan will be acquired in order to demarcate the prostate bed region to be ablated with radiotherapy. This is standard practice. The radiation oncologist will then combine clinical judgment with established radiotherapy protocols to define the clinical tumour volume (CTV). Clinical target volumes will be expanded by 3-5mm to create the planning target volume (PTV) and will be treated to 70Gray (Gy) in 35 fractions at 5 fractions per week if they have a negative PSMA. Participantss with a PSMA that is positive for local recurrence only will receive an additional 4Gy in 2 fractions as a boost dose (therefore total dose = 74Gy in 37 fractions at 5 fractions per week). Radiotherapy plans must meet pre-specified dose constraints to normal tissue and relevant organs at risk. Radiotherapy treatment will be delivered using the existing linear accelerators at Epworth Richmond and Freemasons Hospital. The treatments will be adjusted as required based on the biofeedback of the Calypso (Registered Trademark) system to ensure accurate treatment of the clinical target volumes.",CODE: Early detection / Screening::||::CODE: Treatment: Devices::||::CODE: Treatment: Other,"Phase I (PSMA PET/CT)

ACTRN12615001202550,Study to assess the neurological and cognitive effects of using Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy used to treat multiple (3-10) brain metastases.,"Prescription Dose Per Site
Stereotactic radiotherapy over 5-6 days or stereotactic radiosurgery over 1-2 days will be performed using planning software which allows for the planning and treatment of multiple (3-10) cerebral metastases. Dose prescription and fractionation schedules will be based on metastases size, location and previous surgery. For each metastatic site identified, 98.5% of the defined PTV volume must be covered by the appropriate dose. All prescribed doses per lesion classification are outlined below:

PTV* (total) -Total Dose (Gy) to 80% IDL* -	Fractions
0.5-4.0 cubic cm will receive 20 Gy in 1 fraction
4.0-15 cubic cm will receive 35 Gy in 5 fractions
Brainstem/basal ganglia will receive 36 Gy in 6 fractions
Resection Cavity 0.5-4.0 cubic cm will receive 20 Gy in 1 fraction
Resection cavity >4.1 cubic cm will receive 35 Gy in 5 fractions

*PTV = Planning target volume / IDL = Isodose level

Dose prescriptions
All fractionation is based on the prescription dose covering >98.5% of the PTV. Dose-fractionation has been designed to provide similar efficacy in terms of tumour control with increasing fractionation based on volume (PTV), and to provide maximum safety in terms of late reactions such as tumour necrosis and symptomatic cerebral oedema.

For participants prescribed hypofractionated dose regimes, it is expected that treatments will be delivered daily totaling 5 fractions per week according to departmental policies, except where interruptions to treatment schedule are unavoidable due to public holidays or any other reason. If an interruption in treatment is needed due to an adverse event, the cause and nature shall be documented and scored using the per-protocol CTCAE v4.03, with treatment to resume as soon as is clinically feasible. Any other alternative events that result in treatment interruptions should also be documented. 

Planning System Requirements
The computerised planning system should have the following minimum capabilities:
- Provides a 3D dose calculation algorithm (e.g. convolution / superposition algorithm) capable of performing calculations that account for variations in scatter in the presence of 3D CT defined heterogeneities. 
- Can provide dose calculation grid spacing of 1x1x1mm.
- Can provide digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) with superimposed target volume, critical structure contours and treatment aperture. 
For the purposes of this study, BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Brain Metastases Planning system (Version 1.0) (BrainLab AG, Germany) utilizing iPlan Pencil Beam Convolution RT Dose (Verision 4.5.3) (6MV photons) will be employed, using a calculation grid size resolution of 1mm or finer to ensure the accuracy of dose distribution calculated. 

Beam Arrangement and Technique Selection
(i) Treatment Modality
BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning program (BrainLab AG, Germany) is a novel radiotherapy planning software that was designed solely for the treatment of numerous brain metastases simultaneously. Internal algorithms within the software will analyse predefined target and critical structure proximity and dose constraints, structure priority, size and shape, and work in reverse to construct a plan that best achieves the dosimetry that matches all the input parameters (i.e. inverse-planned). Radiotherapy planning with BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning software and the use of dynamic Micro-multi-Leaf Collimators (mMLCs) to create tight margins around identified targets allows for dose distributions with steep dose gradients that greatly minimise dose to the normal healthy surrounding tissues and structures. 

(ii) Number of treatment arcs and arrangement
In order to make treatment sessions exponentially faster, and to meet predefined dose constraints, BrainLab Elements (Trademark) Automatic Brain Metastases Planning (BrainLab AG, Germany) software will automatically place a single virtual isocentre and utilise a number of dynamic arcs at multiple table angles (non-coplanar) (maximum 10 arcs at 5 table positions) respectively. Arcs will rotate backward and forward at the same couch position to ensure adequate coverage of metastases that may be occluding one another.",CODE: Treatment: Other::||::CODE: Treatment: Devices,"- Three to ten cerebral metastases

the last active cancer treatment (either chemotherapy or radiotherapy). Patients from Cohorts A to C inclusive undergoing chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, will have their study-related imaging performed at a 2-3 week interval post chemotherapy. Patients will thus undergo a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 4 echocardiograms and cardiac MRI scans (pre and post chemotherapy, and/or pre and post radiotherapy), depending on the patients cancer treatment program.
For each MRI scan, the patient will lay still on a flat bed which moves through a cylindrical tunnel scanner. The scan will take approximately 20 minutes.
For each echocardiogram, the patient will undergo an ultra-sound test laying on a bed, and can take approximately 20 minutes.
At each study time-point, cardiac toxicity will be documented by the study clinicians by taking a directed cardiac history, examination, and scoring toxicity as per the

ACTRN12615001300561p,The Impact of Combined Modality Therapy on Sensorineural Hearing Loss in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer,"The primary aim of this study is to develop a stratified risk model for patients who are most at risk of developing sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).  Participants will be allocated to a risk profile prior to their radiotherapy planning. These risk profiles include minimal risk of hearing loss and increased risk of hearing loss, with participant allocation based on tobacco and alcohol consumption, chemotherapy agent and cumulative chemotherapy dose. 

Participants in both risk profiles will have their chemotherapy delivered according to standard department protocol. Participants in both risk profiles will have their radiotherapy simulation conducted according to department protocol. This involves a CT scan, used to define organs and disease, lasting approximately 20 minutes. Participants assigned to the minimal risk profile will have their radiotherapy planned according to standard protocol. Participants assigned to the increased risk profile will have their radiotherapy planned using stricter, standardised guidelines. These guidelines will create consistency in HNC radiotherapy planning and include the following:
- the planning radiotherapist will be responsible for defining audiology structures using the validated, audiology contouring atlas, developed and validated in phase one. This will ensure standardisation in the accuracy of contours. All contours will be checked for accuracy by the prescribing Radiation Oncologist.
- a standardised ear radiation dose tolerance will be prescribed by the Radiation Oncologist. Currently, due to a lack of evidence based literature, ear tolerances vary greatly between physicians as its subject to physician preference. These tolerances were derived using information gathered in phase one, in conjunction with literature and oncologist clinical experience. It is important to note, that achieving these tolerances will not take priority over tumour coverage. Further, if a tighter dose tolerance is favourable, this is acceptable.

In addition, all participants will undergo audiology testing. Current practice sees patients referred for audiology assessment when they complain of hearing loss. For this study, patients will undergo audiology assessment at four pre-determined time intervals throughout their treatment (before treatment, week 5 of treatment, 6-12 weeks and 1 year after treatment). Each session will last for approximately 45 minutes in  pure tone audiometry, otoacoustic emissions testing, reflexometry and tympannometry testing will be carried out using beeps, whistle and word repetition.

The interventions include;
a)	The patients will complete the Distress Thermometer and Checklist, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Supportive Care Needs Survey  9 items.  Based on the patients results, they will be emailed links to self-management websites. These websites consist of publically available resources from reputable national (e.g. Cancer Council, Cancer Institute NSW) and international (e.g. McMillian) sources. Staff will receive a report summarising the results of the patients PROMPT-Care survey  with recommendations for action, as developed by the studys Clinical Advisory Group. 
b)	The PROMPT-Care survey measures items over 5 domains: Physical wellbeing (e.g. fatigue, pain, mouth sores), emotional wellbeing (e.g. anxiety, depression, loss of interest in activities), functional wellbeing (e.g. getting around, memory and cognition), social and family wellbeing (e.g. support from family and friends, problems with partner) and practical support (e.g. transport, housing, being informed about test results). 
c)	The PROMPT-Care system is accessible by patients (to input PROMPT-Care survey results and to access self-management resources), staff at the cancer treatment centre (e.g. oncologists, nurse care coordinators, allied health staff), and selected members of the research team who have approval to access patients medical records using the MOSAIQ database. 
d)	Frequency of use  patients on active treatment will complete the PROMPT-Care survey every 2-4 weeks, depending on the schedule of their review appointments. Patients in long-term follow-up care will be asked to complete the survey on a monthly basis. Patients completing the PROMPT-Care survey every 2-3 weeks will complete the Distress Thermometer and Checklist, and ESAS only. The Supportive Care Needs Survey is only administered on every second assessment for participants completing the PROMPT-Care Survey every 2-3 weeks as that measure has been validated using a 4 week time frame.  Participants completing the PROMPT-Care survey on a monthly basis will always complete the full assessment (i.e. DT and checklist, ESAS and Supportive Care Needs Survey-9 items) An assessment schedule is established when the participant enters the study that indicates the frequency and pattern of assessments that the participant will receive.   
e)	Duration of intervention  = 3-4 months
f)	Patients attending clinic will be asked to complete the PROMPT-Care survey in the waiting area, using an electronic tablet device. Patients in long-term follow-up will typically complete their PROMPT-Care survey from home, however should they be attending clinic for review they will be asked to complete that monthly survey while in the waiting area. 
g)	Strategies to monitor adherence: As this is a pilot project to determine the feasibility and acceptability of the PROMPT-Care system we will send patients who do not complete their PROMPT-Care surveys  from home one reminder email. We will also be conducting evaluation interviews with participants to get their views of the system and to discuss issues around their adherence to the project. 
Participants will be asked to fill out an evaluation survey and to attend a single interview to assess their views on the eHealth platform, which will last approximately 20 minutes.

Three different methods of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) data collection by telephone or mail or email will be introduced to assess the quality of life of prostate cancer patients using EPIC -26 tools. Details of each of the three different interventions are described below:

Men are contacted to confirm that clinical data are accurate and up-to-date and to collect PROMS using the validated EPIC-26 quality of life instrument. Contact is made any time within a window period of 21 days either side of the anniversary date for data collection (henceforth recorded as the Anniversary Date). This is 12 months from the date of the positive biopsy for patients who do not proceed to active treatment or only receive androgen deprivation therapy; or 12 months from the date on which final initial treatment, or course of treatment, finished.  For surgery and low-dose rate (seed) brachytherapy, this is the date of the procedure. For radiotherapy and chemotherapy it is the date that the last dose of therapy was provided; for radiotherapy this is usually six weeks after radiotherapy was commenced and for chemotherapy this is usually 12 months after treatment commenced. 

Intervention A: PROMs data collection by follow up data collectors over the telephone
1.	An attempt to contact patients via phone will be made up until 21 days post diagnosis/treatment.  Approximately each day a data collector will make one attempt to contact the patient 
2.	Patients responding will have PROMS entered directly to the PCOR-VIC web system 
3.	Patients will be considered lost to follow up if they do not respond after 21 days from 12 month Anniversary Date. 
Intervention B: Data collection by follow up data collectors by mail (postal service)
1.	The EPIC-26 survey will be mailed to patients if they are contacted any time from 21 days before, up to and including, the Anniversary Date. The survey will be accompanied with a personalised, signed letter with instructions and a postage-paid, self-addressed envelope;
2.	If the survey is not returned by 14 days post the Anniversary Date, patients will be telephoned as per Intervention A. Data collector will make one attempt each day i.e 14 attempts in total.
3.	Lost to follow up  refer to Step 3 of Intervention A.
Intervention C: Data collection by E-mail link to online survey
1.	If email is not available then the participants will randomly assign to either telephone (intervention A) or mail (Intervention B).
2.	In this method, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is the address of a web page link to the EPIC-26 survey will be emailed to participants if they are contacted any time from 21 days before, up to and including, the Anniversary Date.
3.   If participants do not complete the online survey by 14 days post the Anniversary Date, patients will be telephoned as per Intervention A. Data collector will make one attempt each day i.e 14 attempts in total.

The BC-Med diet will consist of increasing the intake of olive oil, flaxseed oil, vegetables, fruit, legumes, fish, nuts, onions, leeks, garlic and turmeric while limiting the intake of red meat, butter, margarine, cream, carbonated drinks and pastries. The treatment diet will not restrict food volumes, just alter food types. 

Those placed in Arm 2 will be asked to adhere to a New Zealand healthy eating diet and will receive dietary support and education.  The healthy eating diet will follow guidelines from the Nutrition Guidelines and will advocate fruit and vegetable consumption, low fat dairy, low fat meat, wholegrains and adequate hydration.  The treatment diet will not restrict food volumes. An educational newsletter will be provided to the BC-MED and healthy eating groups once a month during the intervention. The intervention period will be 6 months. 

Changes in gene expression levels will be calculated and used to determine the pathways and networks affected by the change in dietary intake. Study participants will be genotyped in order to account for some of the risk associated with hereditary factors and differences in response to the diet. Diet adherance will be determined via attendance at education sessions, and on analysis of the food diaries completed mid way through the intervention, and change in PREDIMED questionnaire.

Participants in each group will be matched for receptor expression and histology, breast cancer grade and use of hormone therapy. Research will be conducted at the Clinical Research Centre at Grafton campus of The University of Auckland.

ACTRN12616000047493,Full Spectrum Endoscopy (FUSE) colonoscopy versus conventional forward-viewing colonoscopy in the detection of dysplasia in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases . ,"Randomized order of colonoscopy type (conventional versus FUSE colonoscopy) to determine the miss rates of colonoscopy type. 
The intervention is the use of the FUSE colonoscope which is a colonoscope that incorporates 3 cameras on the colonoscope tip to provide a panoramic 330-degree field of view. .The size and function of the FUSE colonoscope is otherwise the same as the conventional colonoscope (control). Both instruments visualise the internal lining of the bowel and permit the identification and removal of neoplasia. 
All subjects will have both procedures performed back-to-back (""crossover tandem colonoscopy"") but the order of the procedure will be randomized. The effect is that the second procedure will determine if lesions were missed during the first procedure, and which colonoscope can identify more neoplasia. 
Both colonoscopies are expected to be equivalent in duration, taking 15-25 minutes. Quality indicator is that colonoscopy withdrawal should be of at least 6 minutes to improve the chances of not missing pathology. 
Both colonoscopies are conducted by investigators who are experienced in surveillance colonoscopies and accredited endoscopists. The histopathologists are from the Department of Pathology and familiar with the identification and interpretation of IBD dysplasia. Where dysplasia is found, a second gastrointestinal pathologist will assist with the grading through consensus. Both pathologists are blinded to the order of the colonoscopy (which is coded). There is no need for a wash out, as this is not a drug trial. The second colonoscopy is inserted as soon as the processor is connected and switched on, which usually takes 4-5 minutes.

Patients undergoing Liver Resection in the Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) group (experimental group) will have a Flotrac/Vigileo device TradeMark connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Patients in the GDT group will be managed by a Stroke Ventricular Volume (SVV) guided protocol to maintain SVV < 20%. This percentage of SVV is frequently used in our institution as a target for patients undergoing this procedure. For the GDT group, if SVV remains above 20% for at least 2 min, then a 250mL bolus of balanced crystalloid (Hartmanns solution or Plasmalyte) or colloid fluid (Albumen) will be given. The SVV will be assessed every 20 seconds via the FloTrac/Vigileo proprietary algorithm. Similar to other GDT studies, the preferred colloid will be albumin secondary to the known effects of improved intravascular repletion and intravascular half life and the theoretical benefit of prolonged stroke volume optimization. In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

ACTRN12616000179437,"Can exercise mechanically suppress tumour formation and growth in advanced prostate cancer patients with sclerotic bone metastases? Safety, feasibility and efficacy of a modular, multi-modal exercise program with spinal isometric training (M3EP-SIT).","This is a single-blinded (investigators blinded to group allocation), two-armed, randomised and controlled (exercise versus usual care) explorative phase 1 clinical trial which will examine the safety, feasibility and efficacy of combining spinal isometric training with a modulatory, multi-modal exercise program (M3EP-SIT) in men with advanced prostate cancer and sclerotic spinal bone metastases. The exercise group (intervention arm) will receive an individually tailored and supervised three month (12 weeks) exercise program involving resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises in addition to usual medical care. 

Participants assigned to the exercise arm will be required to participate in a modular, multi-modal exercise intervention with spinal isometric training (M3EP-SIT) for 12 weeks (3 months). The combined M3EP-SIT program requires participants to attend three supervised exercise sessions each week spanning 60 minutes in duration (including warm-up and cool-down). Participants will also be asked to perform the SIT program during two additional home-based exercise sessions spanning 15 minutes in duration.
 
The modular, multi-modal exercise (M3EP) component of the program will be comprised of resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises undertaken 3 times per week in an exercise clinic setting, supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist (AEP, Exercise & Sport Science Australia). This M3EP component is designed to minimise loads on affected skeletal sites through-out the body. Exercise prescription will be modified based on the location and extent of bone metastases for all activities. Resistance exercise will be set using repetition maximums (RM). Participants will be asked to perform 10-12 RM for 3 sets per exercise to achieve moderate intensity and volume. Aerobic exercise will be set using age-predicted heart rate maximum (HRmax). Participants will engage in cardiovascular exercise using various modes including treadmill, cycling and rowing ergometers, performed at 60-85% HRmax for 20-30 minutes using heart rate monitors (Polar Electro Oy, Finland). Flexibility exercise will involve static stretching of all joints considered important for function, and for all muscles engaged during the session. All stretches will involve 2-4 sets per muscle group with a 30-60 second hold per set.

The spinal isometric training (SIT) component of the program will comprise of exercises that isometrically load deep spinal muscles. These will be performed 5 times per week. Three sessions will be supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist synonymous with the M3EP component at an exercise clinic; with additional two sessions self-managed by the participant. This SIT component is designed to directly target and stimulate spinal lesion site(s) through muscular contraction, thus isometric exercises have been designed to activate the full spinal column due to the commonality of lesions in thoracic and lumbar regions; the feasibility of which has been demonstrated. The SIT program will require the participants to perform five exercises in whole and partial weight-supported prone and supine positions on the floor, whilst maintaining a neutral spine (isometrically) during gentle and dynamic accessory movements. Hip control and stationary spinal isometric exercises will first be used to ensure safe and correct technique during Week 1, prior to progressing to more challenging exercises which include less stability or dynamic accessory movements for Weeks 2 to 12.

Adherence to supervised exercise sessions will be monitored and recorded by the exercise physiologists delivering the intervention. Patients will be provided with an exercise sheet for use during their twice weekly self-managed spinal isometric training sessions. Exercise sheets will be handed to the exercise physiologists at the patients next supervised session. Adherence to self-managed spinal isometric training will be subsequently be monitored and recorded by the exercise physiologist in consultation with the patient. This will be reported as a percentage of actual exercise completed versus prescribed exercise completed; as well as sessions missed as a ratio of sessions prescribed.",CODE: Treatment: Other::||::CODE: Lifestyle,"* Male, aged greater than or equal to 18 years.

ACTRN12616000231448,"A Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) of iCanADAPT, an internet Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) program for the treatment of depression and anxiety in early stage
cancer patients and cancer survivors.","INTRODUCTION 
The Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (CRUfAD) have developed an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety and depression in cancer patients and survivors. It is called iCanADAPT. Aspects of existing online interventions for anxiety and depression were adapted to the cancer context in the development of the iCanADAPT program. iCanADAPT is a 16week self-managed, mixed anxiety and depression program that is tailored to unique aspects of the cancer context, such as fear of cancer recurrence and adapting to illness, side-effects and survivorship. 

PROPOSAL 
The proposed study will evaluate the efficacy of the newly developed program as a cancer specific, online intervention for anxiety and depression and will aim to demonstrate that iCBT is an effective program for reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in cancer patients and survivors.

ALLOCATION 
Participants with elevated anxiety and depression scores and either a current early stage cancer or a prior cancer diagnosis will be recruited. They will complete online screening questionnaires on CRUfAD's clinical trials website (www.virtualclinic.org.au) to assess eligibility to participate, and provide informed consent, before being interviewed over the telephone to assess eligibility for inclusion into the study. If accepted into the study, the participant will be randomly allocated into one of two groups:
GROUP 1 receive access to the iCanADAPT program
GROUP 2 treatment as usual group (may access care at any point) and after a 16 week period, will then be offered access the iCanADAPT program. 

OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM 
The iCanADAPT program consists of eight Modules based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). It includes all treatment components typically seen in face-to-face CBT (the first-line treatment for depression and anxiety in early stage cancer patients and survivors). Each of the eight Modules can be considered as a discrete package. Each of the Modules contains: 
-	A Lesson (consists of a comic based, easy to read story, pertinent to all participants), 
-	An associated Lesson Summary (consists of more dense reading material, likely pertinent to all participants) 
-	Any additional resources for that part (which may not be needed by all participants)
-	Any additional worksheets for that part (pertinent to all participants)

THEMES of THE MODULES 
The overriding messages in each Module i.e. the each Lesson and its associated Lesson Summary, and any additional resources is arranged by themes. The main themes are: 
Module/Lesson 1	Learning about Depression and Anxiety in the cancer context
Module /Lesson 2 	Identifying and Tackling Thoughts 
Module/Lesson 3 	Tackling Unhelpful Behaviours  
Module/Lesson 4  	Helpful Coping  
Module/Lesson 5  	Adjusting to Change 
Module/Lesson 6 	Tackling Avoidance 
Module/Lesson 7 	Mastering Your Skills 
Module/Lesson 8  	Staying Well in the Long Term and Getting Even Better

EXAMPLE of a MODULE 
Hence, for Module 3 the theme is Tackling Unhelpful Behaviours, hence the Lesson shows the characters addressing their unhelpful behaviours in a comic based, easy to follow story. Further specific, more detailed, writing is contained in the Lesson summary, in this case under the following headings: 
1.	Tackling Low Activity 
2.	Before starting activity scheduling and physical activity 
3.	Daily Activity Scheduling 
4.	Physical Activity
5.	Structured Problem Solving
6.	Assertive Communication Skills
7.	Your Checklist
8.	Summary
In this case, the Extra Resources in Module 3 are:
3.1 - 100 Things To Do (List of Pleasant Activities)
3.2 - Diet 
3.3 - Smoking 
3.4 - FAQs Module 3
Furthermore, worksheets relevant to the Lesson/ Lesson Summary are provided: 
3.W1 - Activity planning and Monitoring worksheet 
3.W2 Structured Problem Solving worksheet
3.W3 Pros and Cons Worksheet

HOW TO WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAM 
Participants will asked to complete the Lesson (including the questionnaires beforehand for that lesson). Each lesson will take approximately 45 - 60 minutes to complete. They may go through all slides in a single sitting, or they may take multiple sittings to get to the end. Once they have completed the Lesson, the computer system automatically releases the associated Lesson Summary (i.e. it becomes available for download on completion of the lesson). They participant are asked to practice any associated skills/activities over the course of the following 14 days. Furthermore, upon completion of the Lesson, the extra resources for that part of the course, that Module, similarly become available. We ask participants to aim for an additional 3 hours per week to read these associated resources and to put into practice the CBT skills. 

TIMING of EACH MODULE
There is a purposeful lock-out time of 5 days between release of the subsequent Module i.e. next Lesson & Lesson Summary etc. The 5-day lock-out refers to specific time points for the release of the next lesson and its associated lesson summary. For example, if a participant undertook Lesson 4 in one sitting & hence downloaded the Lesson 4 Summary on 01st of the month, we purposely do not allow them to start Module 5, i.e. Lesson 5, until at least 5 days later, the 05th of the month. We will recommend instead that they spend up to two weeks (until the 14th of the month) reflecting and working through the prior Module i.e. Lesson 4, Lesson 4 Summary/ recommendations. However, as some patients prefer to progress at a quicker pace we do not necessitate the full 14 day period. Instead a five day minimum is set; to ensure that the patient does not get information overload and to encourage them to reflect and undertake activities for at least a short time period.  

CONTACT
Routine email contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist or psychiatry trainee/ medical officer) after completion of the first two lessons will occur. Further email contact will occur then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email.

ADHERENCE 
Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.

ACTRN12616000268448,"Does an individualised performance-focused swimming training program improve health, fitness and function in individuals following megaprosthesis bone replacement surgery?","Phase 1. Baseline
Participants will complete a 15-week pre-participation period or baseline during which they continue with their current lifestyle, including physical activity levels, and report to The University of Queensland on a weekly basis for testing (further detail to follow). 

Phase 2. Introductory training
Individuals who complete the pre-participation period will then participate in a 15-week low to moderate intensity health focused training program comprising four main training modalities:
1.) Land-based aerobic training,  
2.) Resistance training, 
3.) Neuromotor training 
4.) Swimming. 
Modalities will be interspersed throughout the intervention and progressed on an individual basis. 

Training dose:
The frequency, intensity, duration and activities included in each session will steadily progress over 15 weeks in order to bring participants to the point where participants are:
1.) Meeting national physical activity guidelines for health (150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week including two resistance training sessions)
2.) Remediating existing deficits in lower limb strength and range of motion. 
3.) Able to swim  competently and safely for fitness.

Training intensity will be monitored using heart rate monitors and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), Prescribed target heart rate during training sessions will be between 40-70% of heart rate maximum.
The prescription of frequency and duration of training sessions will be individualised based on each participant's exercise tolerance and baseline physical activity levels. As stated above, the duration and intensity of training will slowly and safely be increased until each participant is able to meet the above criteria. 

This phase may continue longer than 15 weeks if the participant is unable to meet these criteria within the time frame. One of the main purposes of this run-in period is to bring all participants to the same baseline physical activity level before progressing them to undertake sports performance-focused training.

Once the above criteria are met, participants will progress on to a  15-week, swimming  performance focused training program designed to enhance stroke technique, aerobic and anaerobic endurance, in-water power, race starts and swim speed.  
The program will  be comprised of moderate to high intensity:
1.) Land-based aerobic training,  
2.) Resistance training, 
3.) Neuromotor training 
4.) Swimming training. 
Modalities will be interspersed throughout the intervention and progressed on an individual basis - tailored to optimise each individuals swimming performance. 

Training dose
 During this phase of the project, participants will be training up to 4 sessions per week, the frequency, intensity and duration of each session will be prescribed based on the participant's individual exercise tolerance and fitness level. Training intensity will be monitored using heart rate monitors and Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) as per phase one of the study, The intensity of training in this phase will range from easy to challenging, and will aim to elicit an RPE score of between three and ten, depending on the aim of the session. Prescribed target heart rate during training sessions will be between 40-100% of heart rate maximum.
the duration and intensity of training will continue to be slowly and safely  increased until the participant is consistently exceeding moderate levels of physical activity i.e. completing more than 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week including two strength sessions. 

Phase 4. Maintenance/off-season
This phase will mirror phase one, baseline. Participants will complete a 15-week off season or maintenance  period  during which they continue with their current lifestyle, including physical activity levels, and report to The University of Queensland on a weekly basis for testing.

Exercise prescription
Training programs included in both phase two and phase three of this study will be designed specifically for each individual, taking into account the training principles of specificity, progressive overload, reversibility, variety, initial values and diminishing returns. Exercise prescription will also employ the ACSMs FITT-VP principles: Frequency, intensity, type, time, volume, pattern and progression. By employing these principles we hope to maintain participant safety, decrease injury risk and optimise participant adherence and exercise benefit. 
Training will utilise a combination of land and  pool-based training sessions. Within the land-based sessions, a combination of resistance, flexibility, balance, proprioception and motor control training will be used. 

Training monitoring
Throughout the intervention (during both the introductory program and the performance-focused program) adherence to the program will be logged using a training diary which is completed by the participant. This will include: frequency, intensity, duration, type of training, level of enjoyment, pain and fatigue. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted on an 8-weekly basis to ascertain participant's perception of the program.

Training delivery
All training programs will be designed and  administered by a combination of swimming coaches, exercise scientists and physiotherapists. As recruitment into this study will be progressive, mode of training delivery will vary. Participants may be supervised and trained one-to-one face-to-face or in small groups of no more than three individuals to one practitioner.

ACTRN12616000271404,"Randomised comparison of how different terminologies for papillary thyroid cancer affect decision making about treatment among an Australian community sample
","The intervention will test how different terminologies used to describe the same diagnosis (papillary thyroid cancer) affect decision making about treatment. This will be done by surveying a population from the Australian community with no history of thyroid cancer and presenting them with 3 hypothetical scenarios that describe a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer using various terminology with and without the ""cancer"" term. The terms presented to participants are papillary thyroid cancer, papillary lesions of indolent course and abnormal cells. Participants will also be given a table with information on the risks and benefits to each treatment option (total thyroidectomy, hemi-thyroidectomy or active surveillance) so that participants are able to make an informed decision about their treatment options.  Each hypothetical scenario and the treatment options presented to participants will be identical with the only difference being the terminology used. 

Participants will be called randomly using random-digit dialing to mobile numbers across Australia by an experienced independent social research company (the Hunter Research Foundation). Participants who agree to participate will be sent a link via email to the online survey. Participants will then complete the survey which includes all 3 hypothetical scenarios at once. It is estimated to take participants 10-15 minutes to complete.

Intervention arms: exercise and standard care/ standard care alone
Standard care will involve general lifestyle education for prostate cancer and encouragement to be physically active, in accordance with Australias Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines These include written recommendation to participate in 150-300 mins of moderate activity per week and strength training twice per week (available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines)..  Those in the intervention arm will, in addition, be provided with an individualised, home-based functional lower limb-strengthening program.  

This individualised exercise program will be developed at study entry in the department of physiotherapy at Austin Health. This initial visit will take 90 min. Individualised means that exercise will be tailored to each individual. It is difficult to describe this im detail but in principle, the physiotherapist will assess which muscles are the weakest and provide the participant with a written exercise program accordingly, with clear instructions.  

The program will focus on muscles utilised in walking and balance, specifically hip flexors, extensors and abductors, knee extensors and plantarflexors.  Exercises will replicate the way muscles are used during walking, with respect to joint position, type of contraction and speed of movement. For example, hip flexors will be strengthened with the hip in an extended position with an emphasis on a fast concentric contraction.  Simple equipment such as theraband and cuff weights will be used in conjunction with body weight to provide resistance.  Participants will be instructed to perform one to two sets of each exercise, with each set comprising 10  15 repetitions at 50  70% of 1RM (Repetition Maximum).

Patients undergo colonoscopy and are randomised prior to the procedure to either narrow band imaging or standard white light on Olympus 190 series colonoscopes.  These are illumination settings on the colonoscope and can be used by a simple push of a button. Narrow band imaging uses filters to illuminate tissue at a selected wavelengths (415 and 540nm)- giving a high definition and excellent visual determination of polyp/adenoma histology. The proceduralist will be told prior to the procedure which modality they will be required to use and then they will complete the withdrawal of the colonoscope (when polyp detection is predominantly done) in this modality.

The procedure will be performed by consultant gastroenterologists or advanced trainees under the direct supervision of consultants.

ACTRN12616000534482,An evaluation of the role of Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) in Mucosal Primary Head and Neck Cancer,"The intervention involved in this study is seven additional MRI scans of approximately 45 minutes in length for each scan. These scans will involve the use of a contrast agent administered by the treating doctor. The MRI scan will be performed by a suitably qualified allied health professional using three MRI sequences. These sequences are all investigational sequences and include DCE, DWI, and R2*. 
DCE MRI is Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and gives information about tissue and tumour blood flow.
DWI is Diffusion weighted imaging MRI and gives information about the degree of cellularity or density of cells.
R2* is a type of MRI sequence that gives information about the level of oxygenation within the tumour. 
These scans will be performed before, during and in the follow up stage after radiotherapy treatment over approximately a 4 month period. This includes MRI scans performed one week prior to radiotherapy treatment, 4 times during radiotherapy treatment one week apart (either directly before or after the daily treatment in treatment week 2, 3, 5 and 6) and then week 4 and week 12 after radiotherapy treatment is finished.    
ALL MRI scans performed before, during or after the radiotherapy treatment are only for treatment response prediction. These scans are not being performed for the purpose of diagnostic accuracy.  
For the standard PET-CT and investigational MRI scan performed prior to radiotherapy treatment, week 3 during radiotherapy treatment and at 12 weeks after radiotherapy treatment, these will be performed within a few days of each other at the same hospital but in different departments. All other investigational MRI scans will be performed on the same day as either radiotherapy treatment or the routine clinic visit.

ACTRN12616000538448,"Goal-directed Therapy for Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy 
","Goal-directed Therapy/Experimental Group 

Patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) group (experimental group) will have a Flotrac/Vigileo device TradeMark connected after insertion of the arterial line. The arterial catheters will be connected to the cardiac output device transducer system and haemodynamic data from the Flotrac device will be collected throughout surgery. All transducers will be zeroed to atmospheric pressure at the level of the right atrium.

Patients in the GDT group will be managed by a Stroke Ventricular Volume (SVV) guided protocol to maintain SVV < 20%. This percentage of SVV is frequently used in our institution as a target for patients undergoing this procedure. For the GDT group, if SVV remains above 20% for at least 2 min, then a 250mL bolus of balanced crystalloid (Hartmanns solution or Plasmalyte) or colloid fluid (Albumen) will be given. The SVV will be assessed every 20 seconds via the FloTrac/Vigileo proprietary algorithm. Similar to other GDT studies, the preferred colloid will be albumin secondary to the known effects of improved intravascular repletion and intravascular half life and the theoretical benefit of prolonged stroke volume optimization. In both groups, the administration of blood products will be at the discretion of the anaesthetist, as clinically indicated. There will be no standard protocol for fluid maintenance infusion for either group.

The GDT group will receive standard perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care and additional haemodynamic monitoring using the FloTrac/Vigileo TradeMark (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). 

The anaesthetist will have no influence over any aspect of postoperative care management. All clinicians and nursing staff in charge of postoperative care will be blinded to the allocation of patients.

ACTRN12616000547448,S.A.F.E. Study: Safety And Feasibility of Exercise for women with breast cancer,"Intervention: The exercise intervention will involve a minimum prescription of 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic- and resistance-exercise each week, with the type, intensity and duration per session individualised according to patients interests, fitness, presence of treatment-related side effects and co-morbidities. That is, while each womans exercise program will be individualised, total exercise dose prescribed per week will be at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week. For example, patient #1 may accumulate the required exercise dose by walking 3 days/week for 30 minutes and undertaking resistance-based exercise (using machine weights) for 30 minutes on an additional 2 days/week. Patient #2 may exercise (including walking, stationary cycling and resistance-based exercise using hand weights) twice daily for 10-15 minutes.
In line with exercise promoted within breast cancer rehabilitation models, the intervention will encourage women to exercise in both a supervised and unsupervised setting.
However, given the patient population to be studied, and that safety is a primary outcome of interest, unsupervised sessions will be introduced slowly. Participants will receive a workbook that includes information relating to the exercise program and a logbook to record details about the exercise sessions, as well as presentation of adverse events. All women will perform the supervised sessions at their homes (or another location as specified as convenient for the participant (e.g., local gymnasium) under the supervision of a trained Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP).
The study is a randomised wait-list study with a two-group design. The wait-list control group will be provided with a modified intervention; that is, the exercise program will be delivered with less face-to-face contact with the AEP (that is, 5 sessions instead of 20 sessions). However, the dose of exercise prescribed will be identical in both groups (150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise/ week). Group 1 (immediate-intervention group) will attend 20 sessions with an AEP over the 12 weeks (2 sessions per week for the first 8 weeks and 1 session per week for the final 4 weeks). Group 2 (wait-list control) will attend 5 sessions with an AEP over 12 weeks (the five sessions will be scheduled taking into consideration AEP clinical judgement and participant preference).

ACTRN12616000581460,Efficacy of Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and Computed Tomography (CT) following head and neck cancer treatment.,"The first is a breathing test done in the Lung Function lab. This should take 20 minutes and you may well have had this before. This is to see whether there is any other lung conditions which can make early cancers more likely.

The second is the camera into the throat and lungs ( Bronchoscopy). When we do the camera examination you will be given medication to make you sleepy to make the procedure as comfortable as possible. This is a normal practice with many such tests. This is done as an outpatient day case procedure.   The medication is given through a small needle (cannula) and a numbing medicine is sprayed in the back of the throat. The doctor first of all looks in detail at the throat region with the assistance of the ENT surgeon, then passes the scope down through the vocal cords (voice box) into the lung (air passages). This is a standard procedure. In the first part of the procedure just a standard light will be used and the appearance recorded. Then the blue light will be used to look at the same regions. This blue light has a wavelength of 450 nm- it is not a laser and does not affect the bronchial tubes in any way. Any areas which require a sample to be taken will be noted and samples taken using a biopsy (sample) forcep. This is a standard method for obtaining material to confirm whether there is anything significant which may require treatment. Biopsies of the throat region will be done with the ENT surgeon, and biopsy of the air passages by the Respiratory specialist doing the procedure. One additional biopsy of normal appearing airway lining will be taken for comparison. This is a tiny amount of material (only 1 or 2 millimeters across). This is so we can check that we are not missing significant changes elsewhere in the air passages.In the procedure approximately 10 minutes  of white light is used, then approximately 10 minutes  NBI blue light is used, dependent on the number of lesions and biopsies required. Patients go home the same day.

Biopsies will be followed up at an outpatient clinic the following week. Any treatment which is required will be discussed between yourself and your doctor as is the usual practice following a biopsy. 

You will be therefore be participating in a cross-over study. In a cross-over study the patients have one method of investigation followed by a different method and the two are compared. In this study the first method is the white light and the second method is the blue light. We want to compare which light gives the best results in terms of finding early cancers.

This research project has been designed to make sure the researchers interpret the results in a fair and appropriate way and avoids study doctors or participants jumping to conclusions. This is done by reporting of the biopsy results by the pathologist without knowledge of which colour light was in use when the abnormality prompting the biopsy was found. 

The third procedure is a CT (CAT) scan of the chest. This is also done as a day case It takes only 5 minutes and patients lie on the examination table and the scan is taken as they hold a single deep breath. Results of this will also be discussed at the time of the other appointment as above.

If the camera test and CT are negative for any abnormal areas then just normal follow-up will continue with the ENT department. If there are abnormalities of the camera depending on biopsy there may be a need for a follow-up bronchoscopy in 3-6 months time; if there is a cancer there steps will be initiated immediately to organise treatment for that. Similarly if there are abnormalities on the CT chest these may require follow-up scan in 3-6 months, or a biopsy in those few cases where there is an obvious abnormality requiring immediate attention.

The study will run for two years however only these initial 3 tests are done for the research study. Follow-up tests would only be done in the event of abnormalities as mentioned above. We would follow the results of any additional biopsies or treatments over the two years of the study. Those treatments would be directed by your own doctors who already follow your case up, or the Respiratory specialist who did the camera test.

This is a 16 weeks exercise programme that commenced prior to the schedule surgery. Patients undertook an exercise programme that consisted of two supervised clinic sessions per week. Each supervised exercise session took approximately 60 minutes to complete. Sessions commenced with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of moderate level of aerobic exercise (~60% heart rate maximum (HRmax)), as well as stretching exercises of the major muscle groups: chest, shoulder, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles. This was followed by a resistance-training regime that included a series of six exercises targeting the major muscles of the upper- and lower-body. Upper-limb exercises included chest press, seated row and lat pull-down. Lower-limb exercises were leg extension, leg curl and leg press. All exercises were performed through the full range of motion adhering to correct techniques. To ensure the progressive nature of the training programme, patients were encouraged to work past the repetition maximum (RM) prescribed, with resistance increased by 5  10% for the subsequent set/training sessions if they were able to exceed the number specified. Progression of resistance followed guidelines previously outlined by Galvao and Newton (2005). The training phases were as follows: week 1  2 (two sets 12 RM), week 3  5 (three sets of 10 RM), week 6  8 (three sets of 8 RM), and week 9  10 (four sets of 6 RM). After week 10, the training phases set in week 1  2 were resumed to implement a periodised exercise model. A further 20 minutes of aerobic exercise was undertaken. This included such specific activity as walking or jogging on a treadmill; cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer; or exercising on a cross training machine depending on each patients preference. The target intensity was 60  80% of the estimated HRmax (220  age in years) measured using heart rate monitors. The design criteria for the exercise intervention programme were to optimise the stimulus to the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems while maximising compliance and retention. All sessions were conducted with one-on-one supervision by a qualified and accredited exercise physiologist who ensured safety and adherence to correct lifting techniques. Each session concluded with a 5-minute cool-down with stretching activities similar to the warm-up.

ACTRN12616000712404,Assessing the quality of bowel preparation by addition of Movicol to standard bowel preparation regimen in patients undergoing routine colonoscopy: a randomized controlled trial,"Consenting patients who are to undergo routine colonoscopy will be randomised to receive the standard bowel preparation or Movicol (intervention) in addition to the standard bowel preparation.
Movicol is a combination product available in powder form.  Each sachet of Movicol powder contains Macrogol-3350 13.125 g, Sodium chloride 350.7 mg, Sodium bicarbonate 178.5 mg, Potassium chloride 46.6 mg Lemon flavor and Potassium acesulfame as a sweetener. 
Macrogol 3350 exerts an osmotic action in the gut, which induces a laxative effect.
Movicol is routinely used as laxative by increasing stool volume and is indicated in the treatment of chronic constipation. 
Movicol is also effective in resolving faecal impaction, defined as refractory constipation with faecal loading of the rectum and/or colon confirmed by physical examination of abdomen and rectum.
Each Movicol sachet should be dissolved in 125ml water and taken orally.
The usual adult dosage is 1 sachet daily. This may be increased to 2-3 sachets daily as required.  
Participants in the intervention arm will receive 8 sachets of Movicol to be taken over the 5 days prior to the day of the procedure.
The first sachet is to be taken in the evening 5 days prior to the procedure. One sachet is taken at 7am and 7pm for the next 4 days. The eighth sachet is taken on the morning of the day prior to the procedure, ahead of commencing the standard bowel preparation of Prepkit C.
An instruction sheet and schedule for taking the Movicol sachets will be provided with the sachets.  Participants will be asked to tick a box against each dose taken and return the form on the day of the procedure. This will enable researchers to monitor compliance with the intervention.

","This study aims to examine the use of StrataXRT silicone gel in the management and prophylaxis of skin reactions on patients receiving external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast at Townsville Cancer Center (TCC). StrataXRT is Therapeutic Goods Administration approved product in Australia. The silcone-based gel has two aims:  prophylatic care of skin to reduce skin reactions and improve skin care management once a reaction occurs.  The outcomes from this pilot will also help investigators determine if further study is warranted.  

A 20 gram tube of StrataXRT will be provided to the patient. Stratpharma, the pharmaceutical company representing StrataXRT, have indicated that one tube should be sufficient for the entire length of treatment, with one application per day for five weeks of treatment with enough product left over for post-treatment application. Additional StrataXRT gel will be provided if required.  

The first application of StrataXRT will be on the patients first day of treatment and will be done by the investigating radiation therapists as recommended by Stratpharma. This will continue for the first week of treatment and ensures the correct amount (approximately the size of a 5 cent coin) is applied. 
The gel should form a thin, clear barrier if applied properly. 

During this time, patients will be instructed on the correct application of the product by one of the two investigating therapists. This will facilitate correct application by the individual patient for the remainder of treatment. Patients should continue to use their allocated product until the skin reaction has resolved.

In patients where moist desquamation develops, StrataXRT will continue to be used for skin care. Patients using Sorbolene cream will see nursing staff for appropriate management or dressings

ACTRN12616000787482,"Safety and tolerability of MIL-38/ Gallium67 (MILGa) in patients with advanced prostate, bladder and pancreatic cancer. ","The investigational product MILGa is a chimeric MIL-38 monoclonal antibody targeting GPC-1, which has been chemically conjugated with the chelating agent DOTA and labeled with the radioisotope Gallium 67 (67Ga). MILGa is being developed for imaging metastases in prostate, pancreatic and bladder cancer patients. A total volume of 3-8ml (1mg of antibody at an activity of 250mBq) will be infused via slow IV push. The use of the chimeric MIL-38 monoclonal antibody conjugated to DOTA and labelled with 67Ga is safe and clinically useful for the detection of advanced prostate, bladder and pancreatic tumours. The addition of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA will aim to minimise binding of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga to non-tumour sites. The initial cohort of 3 patients will receive a 250 MBq imaging dose of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga. 
Cohort 1 (Patients 1, 2 and 3)
*Patient 1: inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 48 to 72 h
*Patient 2: Four weeks after patient 1, inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 24 to 48 h 
*Patient 3: Four weeks after patient 2, inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 24 to 48 h 

Cohort 2 (Patients 4, 5 and 6)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with 3.5 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga. Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

Cohort 3 (Patients 7, 8 and 9)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga.  Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

Cohort 4 (Patients 10, 11 and 12)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga.  Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

At end of each cohort: Safety assessment by DSMC and preliminary assessment of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga scan utility will be determined. Furthermore, the effect of the dose of un-labelled chMIL-38-DOTA used per cohort on tumour targeting will be reviewed at the end of each cohort to determine the unlabelled antibody dose for the subsequent cohort.

Targeting of MILGa to patients metastases will be assessed by planar gamma imaging and SPECT/CT and compared to known metastases identified by standard of care imaging. Standard of care scans will be taken on the day of screening (visit 1) up to 14 days prior to MILGa infusion. 
Planar whole body and SPECT/CT imaging studies are planned as follows:
*Transmission whole body scan with Cobalt-57 phantom prior to infusion with patient and without patient 
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T 30mins post infusion
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T6h post infusion
*Planar whole body imaging and SPECT/CT at T24h
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T48h
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T72h (Day 3) 
*Planar whole body imaging and SPECT/CT at T144h (Day6) 
*Planar whole body imaging at 2 weeks post infusion (if required)
Any potential metastatic lesion identified on MILGa scanning but not visible on routine scans may be followed by standard radiology and, if possible, be biopsied later.

Baseline evaluations are to be performed within four weeks prior to the start of treatment, include complete medical history; informed consent; complete physical examination; height; weight; performance status; vital signs; standard laboratory assessments; CA-125 tumour marker; urine hCG; standard of care imaging; ECG and blood sampling. Day 1 evaluations will include physical examination; weight; performance status; vital signs; standard laboratory assessments; assessment of adverse events and pharmacodynamic blood sampling. For patients on weekly treatments, evaluations on day 8 and day 15 will include physical examination; weight; performance status; vital signs; standard laboratory assessments; assessment of adverse events and pharmacodynamic blood sampling. End of study evaluations at 4 weeks after the last cycle of treatment will be consistent with the day 1 schedule listed above. 

The primary difference between standard of care and this research is the collection of 10 ml blood for plasma samples for pharmacodynamic assessments at pre-treatment with each cycle of chemotherapy. Specifically there will be a sample collected during screening / baseline, another sample at every day 1 for 3 cycles, potentially another 2 samples at day 8 and 15 for 3 cycles depending upon which chemotherapy regimen is chosen in addition to a final sample at 4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy for a total maximum of 11 samples of 10ml for a total of 48 participants.

ACTRN12616000954426,The feasibility and effect of using consumer-based physical activity monitors to improve exercise behaviour in women with Stage II+ breast cancer.,"The intervention will involve one face-to-face, 60-minute structured physical activity counselling session with an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP), plus provision of a Fitbit physical activity monitor (Fitbit Charge HR, https://www.fitbit.com/au/chargehr) for 12-weeks. The physical activity counselling session will be one-on-one, and conducted at an exercise clinic by an AEP with experience in exercise prescription and supervision for women with stage II+ breast cancer. During this session, the AEP will use a patient-centred approach by following the Chronic Disease Self-Management Intervention Model to develop individualised physical activity goals that are consistent with National and International physical activity guidelines for women with breast cancer. During the 60-minute session, the AEP will lead each participant through a study-specific physical activity maintenance handbook that has been developed in accordance with the CDSM. Participants will be informed of current National and International physical activity guidelines for women with breast cancer provided to them in the study handbook and will discuss physical activity goal setting. Specifically, participants will be encouraged to: identify and discuss benefits associated with maintenance physical activity and exercise participation; identify expected benefits remaining physically active; identify forms of motivation to maintain long-term physical activity participation; identify barriers to physical activity participation and use a problem-solving approach to address barriers, and; develop individualised goals that are realistic and measurable. Participants will also be shown how to use the Fitbit physical activity monitor. Following completion of the 60-minute face-to-face physical activity counselling session, participants will use the Fitbit independently to self-monitor and self- manage their physical activity as desired during the 12-week period. Participants will be able to use and access the Fitbit and associated software as desired over the 12 weeks. Adherence to use of the Fitbit will be assessed by evaluating the total number of days and mean number of hours per day the device was worn (obtained via self-report). No additional AEP contact, physical activity counselling or structured sessions with the AEP during the 12-week period (i.e., after completion of the 60-minute physical activity session).

This involves a face-to-face health questionnaire with the participant performed by a study researcher and takes no longer than 30 minutes. Health domains covered as part of the geriatric assessment include functional status, comorbidity, history of falls, cognition, nutrition, psychosocial health and a timed walk test. The geriatric assessment is performed in the outpatient clinic area on one occasion prior to the participant commencing treatment with chemotherapy. The treating oncologist is asked to nominate for each patient their estimate of the likelihood of severe chemotherapy toxicity over the course of treatment, and make an assessment of the patient's clinical frailty status and performance status. For Part 1 of the study, the treating oncologist is not made aware of the results of the geriatric assessment and CARG Toxicity Score, but results are recorded by study researchers. Participants are followed throughout their chemotherapy course to observe for severe chemotherapy-related toxicity and treatment deliverability (unplanned hospital admissions, dose modifications).

The Jansari assessment of Executive Functions, JEF (Copyright), is a novel, computer based virtual reality program. 
In the assessment, a participant is invited to navigate around a Virtual Reality(VR) environment on a computer to complete a set of 10 listed tasks and a further 2 tasks that require creative thinking. The scenes are set in a typical office and meeting room. Participants are guided by a research team member with clear instructions given for the assessment. No prior computer knowledge or use is required. The assessment takes on average 40 minutes to complete.
Paper based tasks
Four standardised measures of executive functions have been chosen based on recommendations by the International Cognition and Cancer Task Force (Wefel et al, 2011) and previous studies in this area. They assess the domains of different executive functions that can be evaluated against standardised norms. The tests comprise of the following:

*Hopkins Verbal Learning Test  Revised (HVLT-R): 5-10 minutes with a 25 minute delay
HVLT-R measures verbal memory. Participants are presented with 12 words over 3 immediate learning trials and 1 delayed recall trial followed by a recognition list task.

*Trail Making Test (TMT) A: 1-2 minutes
TMT A measures sustained attention and working memory. It requires a participant to connect numbered circles consecutively.

*Trail Making Test (TMT ) B: 1-3 minutes
TMT B measures an executive function - cognitive flexibility. Participants are asked to connect alternating numbers and letters in sequence.

*Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA): 3-5 minutes
COWA is a measure of speeded lexical fluency using letters that correspond to specified word frequencies in the English language.

ACTRN12616001022459,A phase I pharmacokinetic evaluation of oral arsenic trioxide in previously untreated patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia,"This is a phase 1 study that looks at the bioavailability of an oral arsenic trioxide (ATO) in consolidation therapy for APML.

Following standard induction therapy of All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA, tretinoin) + IV ATO (+ idarubucin for high-risk patient), patients will be registered into the trial after documentation of haemotological complete remission.  

The study consists of two parts:
(i) A 1-sequence, 4 ATO period single arm study over 28 weeks in total.  Patients will be given 7 cycles of All-Trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA, tretinoin) (45mg/m^2, in 2 divided doses) + 4 cycles of IV ATO (0.15mg/kg/day) with the exception of week one of ATO cycle #2, and week one of ATO cycle # 4, when oral tablet ATO (0.15mg/kg/day) will be used.  The pharmacokinetic data will be used to adjust each patient's oral dose for week 1 of cycle #4. 
(ii) A 2-sequence, 4 ATO period, randomised cross-over study over 28 weeks in total.  Patients will be given 7 cycles of ATRA (45mg/m^2, in 2 divided doses) + 4 cycles of IV ATO, with the exception of week one of either ATO cycle #1 or ATO cycle #2, and week one of either ATO cycle #3 or ATO cycle #4, when oral tablet ATO will be used (sequence will be determined by randomisation).
*ATO cycle= 5 days/week for 4 weeks; 4 weeks between cycles;
*ATRA cycle= 7 days/week for 2 weeks; 2 weeks between cycles.

ATRA is administered in oral capsule form; IV ATO is administered IV by infusion pump over 2 hours.

Part (i) - There is an effective ATO washout period of 30 days between each cycle of consolidation (the weekend of week 4 followed by the 4-week interval before the subsequent cycle). The oral ATO capsule formulation will be used at a dose of 0.15mg/kg/d in week 1 of cycle #2. The oral ATO dose that will be administered in week 1 of cycle #4 will be determined on an individual patient basis by the trial management committee, based on the results of the PK data obtained in week 1 of cycles #1, #2 and #3. 

Part (ii)- All ATO in part (ii) will be given IV at a dose of 0.15mg/kg/day, with the exception of week 1 of either cycle #1 or cycle #2 (determined by randomisation), when ATO will be given orally at a dose determined by the trial management committee based on the aggregate PK data generated in part (i). Oral ATO will also be used at the same dose in week 1 of either cycle #3 or #4.  Oral arsenic capsules should be taken 1 hour before food on an empty stomach.  PK studies will again be performed in week 1 of each ATO cycle.

Regardless of the PK data, the maximum oral dose of ATO will be 0.3mg/kg/day, and the minimum will be 0.08mg/kg/day.  

Maintenance therapy, typically involving ATRA + methotrexate + 6-mercaptopurine, will not be used for either part (i) or part (ii) of this study, regardless of initial risk category.

The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator such as the Pharmacy Department at participating institutions, must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of the investigative agent.  A pharmacy file will be provided for the purpose and will collect information such as drug name, batch number, expiry date, amount dispensed and disposal of supplies via approved procedures at the end of the study.",CODE: Treatment: Drugs,"1.

ACTRN12616001071415,Efficacy of Oral Cancer Resection Guided by Narrow Band Imaging on Local Recurrence,"1) Resection of oral squamous cancer - guided by Narrow Band Imaging.
Device: Narrow Band Imaging (Olympus). Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) uses 2 narrow bands of light, one at 400-430nm and the second at 525-555nm. 
Procedure: Margins around the tumour will be delineated with Narrow Band Imaging prior to tumour resection.
Resection of the oral cancer will proceed under General Anaesthesia as per usual practice. The peri-operative experience of the patient will not be altered by which group they are randomised to and will be no different to their experience had they undergone routine management outside of the trial.  

2) Punch biopsies of tumour, NBI margin, WL margin and normal oral mucosa  guided by White Light Panendoscopy and Narrow Band Imaging. 
Device: Narrow Band Imaging (Olympus), White Light Endoscope (full spectrum white light with wavelength inclusive of 400-700 nm).
Procedure: 5mm punch biopsies will be taken from the body of the tumour, the WL and NBI margins at 3, 6, 9 and 12 oclock and normal tissue from the contralateral side of the oral cavity.


Specifics applicable to both interventions
Who: Completed by Consultant Otolarynology Head and Neck Surgeons 
Timing: 
- The interventions will occur sequentially, intra-operatively, under General Anaesthesia. Punch biopsies will be performed following margin delineation and prior to tumour resection. 
- Those patients in the intervention arm will have a slightly increased time required for surgical margin delineation as they will undergo both WL and NBI nasendoscopy.
This said, the time taken for the procedures will not significantly alter the total time taken for the surgery. Total operative time depends on the clinical circumstance. 
Mode of delivery: Face-to-face, single patient at a time. 
Number of times: Intervention completed on a single occasion. 
Location: Operating Theatre, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia.

ACTRN12616001187437,Molecular Profiling and Matched Targeted Therapy for Patients with Metastatic Melanoma (MatchMel),"This is a patient oriented translational research project aiming to improve clinical outcomes for patients with BRAF and NRAS wild-type unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic melanoma who have progressed on, or are unable to receive standard therapy (in general, immunotherapy).

Consecutive patients seen at three major clinics with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma   will be invited to participate. All patients are first provided with the standard care BRAF/NRAS mutation testing, followed by standard care therapy.

Those patients with melanoma found to be BRAF/NRAS wild type will also undergo extended molecular testing of their melanoma. The extended test in this project covers approximately 400 cancer related genes. Following progression on standard therapy, patients with BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma will be reviewed at a meeting of the project multidisciplinary team. Patients will be offered a targeted therapy matched to the genetic aberrations detected on extended testing. The current library of targeted therapies include:

Everolimus
Bortezomib
Cabozantinib
Ceritinib
Crizotinib
Dasatinib
Erlotinib
Everolimus

Imatinib
Lapatinib
Nilotinib
Olaparib
Palbociclib
Pazopanib
Ramucirumab 
Regorafenib
Sorafenib
Sunitinib
Trametinib
Vorinostat

Where multiple targets are identified in one patient, or where multiple potential therapies would be appropriate for a single tumour mutation, the appropriate therapeutic approach will be decided after consultation with the multidisciplinary team, using the latest version of library of matched therapies. Similarly, for patients where no genetic aberration was detected or for whom there is no current targeted therapy available for a specific genetic aberration, further treatment will be discussed with the molecular multidisciplinary team formed for this project.

ACTRN12616001265460,Local HER-O: A study of local therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer.,"For patients who have Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer, which has metastasised to the brain, the main treatment options for these brain metastases are Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Neurosurgery (NS). Sometimes, if the metastases are small and are not causing any symptoms, they do not require any immediate treatment and will be observed.  
The purpose of the study is to determine 1) How likely the tumour/s are controlled after treatment with local therapies Neurosurgery (NS) and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and 2) How likely is it that other tumours develop at new sites in the brain when no Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) is given.

The local treatment offered will be determined by the patients doctor in consultation with the site multidisciplinary team and will be dependent on the size and location of the brain metastases. Each treatment will be performed by the specialist in that field, i.e. neurosurgeon and/or radiation oncologist.
Neurosurgery: The decision whether or not to recommend neurosurgery will be made independently of this research study. The surgery may be performed up to 6 weeks before participant being registered on the trial or up to 4 weeks after registration. The complexity and length of the surgery depends on the size and location of the tumour(s).
Sometimes stereotactic radiosurgery is required to be delivered to the cavity left after the metastasis has been removed (also known as a cavity boost). Timing of Cavity SRS is at the discretion of the treating team. SRS cavity boost must be given after registration and can be given up to 8 weeks after NS resection.
Stereotactic Radiosurgery: If the participant will be receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (either alone or in combination with neurosurgery), the Radiation Oncologist will organise for the participant to have a Radiotherapy planning. Treatment is to commence within 4 weeks of study registration. 
The size, number and location of the brain metastasis will determine the dose and fractionation schedule of radiotherapy. Single metastasis, smaller than or equal to 2cm, may require 1 fraction. Alternately, multiple metastasis, metastasis in the brain stem, or those bigger than 2cm will required multiple fractions to treat.  The dose range for the study is 20Gy/1 fraction to 24Gy/3 fractions. Each fraction is given on a separate day.

The exercise group (intervention arm) will receive an individually tailored and supervised three month (12 weeks) exercise program involving resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises in addition to usual medical care.

Participants assigned to the exercise arm will be required to participate in a modular, multi-modal exercise intervention with spinal isometric training (M3EP-SIT) for 12 weeks (3 months). The combined M3EP-SIT program requires participants to attend three supervised exercise sessions each week spanning 60 minutes in duration (including warm-up and cool-down). Participants will also be asked to perform the SIT program during two additional home-based exercise sessions spanning 15 minutes in duration.

The M3EP component of the program will span 45 minutes, whereas the SIT component of the program will span 15 minutes (to make a 60 minute session during supervised sessions, and a 15 minute session during home-based, self-managed sessions). During the supervised exercise clinic sessions, patients will be provided with one-on-one supervision.

The modular, multi-modal exercise (M3EP) component of the program will be comprised of resistance, aerobic and flexibility exercises undertaken 3 times per week in an exercise clinic setting, supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist (AEP, Exercise & Sport Science Australia). This M3EP component is designed to minimise loads on affected skeletal sites through-out the body. Exercise prescription will be modified based on the location and extent of bone metastases for all activities. Resistance exercise will be set using repetition maximums (RM). Participants will be asked to perform 10-12 RM for 3 sets per exercise to achieve moderate intensity and volume. Aerobic exercise will be set using age-predicted heart rate maximum (HRmax). Participants will engage in cardiovascular exercise using various modes including treadmill, cycling and rowing ergometers, performed at 60-85% HRmax for 20-30 minutes using heart rate monitors (Polar Electro Oy, Finland). Flexibility exercise will involve static stretching of all joints considered important for function, and for all muscles engaged during the session. All stretches will involve 2-4 sets per muscle group with a 30-60 second hold per set.

The spinal isometric training (SIT) component of the program will comprise of exercises that isometrically load deep spinal muscles. These will be performed 5 times per week. Three sessions will be supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist synonymous with the M3EP component at an exercise clinic; with additional two sessions self-managed by the participant. This SIT component is designed to directly target and stimulate spinal lesion site(s) through muscular contraction, thus isometric exercises have been designed to activate the full spinal column due to the commonality of lesions in thoracic and lumbar regions; the feasibility of which has been demonstrated. The SIT program will require the participants to perform five exercises in whole and partial weight-supported prone and supine positions on the floor, whilst maintaining a neutral spine (isometrically) during gentle and dynamic accessory movements. Hip control and stationary spinal isometric exercises will first be used to ensure safe and correct technique during Week 1, prior to progressing to more challenging exercises which include less stability or dynamic accessory movements for Weeks 2 to 12.

Adherence to supervised exercise sessions will be monitored and recorded by the exercise physiologists delivering the intervention. Patients will be provided with an exercise sheet for use during their twice weekly self-managed spinal isometric training sessions. Exercise sheets will be handed to the exercise physiologists at the patients next supervised session. Adherence to self-managed spinal isometric training will be subsequently be monitored and recorded by the exercise physiologist in consultation with the patient.

ACTRN12616001440415,The Australian Predicting Infectious Complications in Children with Cancer (PICNICC) Project,"The aim of this project is to prospectively validate the European-based PICNICC clinical decision rule (CDR) that reliably stratifies children with cancer and febrile neutropenia into low and high risk for microbiologically documented infection (MDI), so as to optimise their management and quality of life and improve resource allocation. The CDR is based on six simple clinical variables including (i) tumour type (ii) maximum temperature, (iii) total white cell count, (iv) monocyte count, (v) haemoglobin and (vi) severity of illness. It provides the opportunity for a world first external validation of this globally derived rule and is a critical step before the rule can be safely implemented into practice. 

Patient demographic, FN episode and outcome data will be collected prospectively by the study-site research assistant (RA) and will follow international consensus definitions. Patients that develop FN outside of RA working hours will have relevant data collected retrospectively within 72 hours. Data will be entered into an electronic password protected study database (REDCap). Accuracy of data collection will be verified by project manager (first ten records for each site then periodically throughout recruitment) as well as chief investigator and site associate investigator.

To identify novel biomarkers that predict outcomes we will perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from participants at Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne at two time points. Blood will be collected in EDTA tubes (5ml if <40kg and 12ml if >40kg). Peripheral blood samples will be processed by the Childrens Cancer Centre Tissue Bank. Within two hours of sample collection, plasma will be harvested following centrifugation and stored at -80 degrees celsius. PBMCs will be isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. PBMC will be cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for in vitro assays and pelleted and resuspended in RNAlater for nucleic acid extraction. Samples will be batched and distributed by the CCC Tissue Bank.

RNAseq will be performed at MCRI (25-30 M coverage) on unstimulated and stimulated samples. Additionally PBMCs will be analysed by flow cytometry to determine the frequency of T cells, and monocytes. This latter data set will allow bioinformatic deconvolution to dissect the transcriptome of relevant cell types. When we have established which method (stimulated or unstimulated) provides that most robust data we will proceed to collect and analyses 100-200 samples . Flow cytometry and stimulation of PBMCs will be performed in the Pellegrini laboratory at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The cell samples sent to WEHI will be thawed and placed in culture medium. During the pilot study these samples will be unstimulated or stimulated with agents that are known to amplify immune responses for a few hours. The medium the cells were kept in will then be collected, to be analysed upon completion of transcriptome analysis for secreted immunogenic factors. The cells themselves will be labelled with specific antibodies which will distinguish the individual cells into subtypes of immune cells and their activation status. During this process all the cells will be run on a machine to analyse composition. Therefore no cells will remain after the analysis has taken place. However, the culture medium these cells were kept in will be stored indefinitely at -80 degrees celsius in the secure Pellegrini laboratory freezer. RNA sequencing is being carried out to identify biomarkers that can predict the outcome of FN episodes only. The transcriptome analysis performed as part of this study is purely exploratory. None of the tests being performed are validated or accredited as diagnostics. Therefore no information will be revealed about disease-predisposing germline traits, heritable disorders or parental identity. 

Each enrolled patient that experiences a febrile neutropenia episode will be followed at presentation (i.e. Day 1), Day 2, Day 7 and Day 30. Cost information will be obtained using hospital costs records for inpatient data and outpatient costs via the Medicare consent form, completed at patient recruitment by the RA. 

The optional quality of life surveys have been replicated into an electronic format for parents/guardians and patients older than three years, The age ranges for the CHU-9D assessment (7 to 18 years and a  proxy version for patients aged 3 to 6 years) have been stipulated by the University of Sheffield and will be adhered to when implementing the questionnaire. The RA will implement each tool electronically prior to discharge, providing education on how to complete the surveys.

The survey will assess the patient's potential health risks related to under-screening for bowel cancer, cervical (women only) and breast cancer (women only), smoking, risky  alcohol consumption and depression. For intervention participants, preferences for help with identified health risks will be elicited as part of the survey. Upon completion of the survey, intervention participants will receive printed feedback on health risks identified from their survey along with recommended self-management actions as endorsed by a range of Australian Government-supported organisations aimed at promoting health in these areas. Participants who report being under-screened for cancer (bowel, breast, cervical) will be encouraged to discuss screening options with their doctor. Participants identified as smokers will be presented with self-management options such as referral to Quitline (a telephone-based smoking cessation intervention), talking to their doctor, and nicotine replacement therapy etc. Participants identified as drinking above recommended levels will be presented with options for reducing alcohol intake such as  choosing alcoholic drinks with lower alcohol content, and discussing approaches with their doctor etc. Participants who report depressed mood will be presented with options such as attending counselling, contacting Beyondblue (a telephone-based emotional support service), and discussing with their GP  etc. The printed feedback will be given to patients in an envelope by a research assistant immediately after completion of the baseline survey in the primary care clinic.

This project aims to deliver an 8-week mindfulness treatment  to ten participants diagnosed with brain tumours in Christchurch Hospital, Canterbury District Health Board. 
Participants will be recruited in the neurosurgical ward and/or clinic. If considered eligible by their treating clinician, they will be told about the study. If interested, they will be approached and given information about the study (including the study brochure) before surgery. Prior to (or subsequent to) discharge after an uncomplicated surgery, patients who are interested in participating will meet with either J Jordan or C De Tommasi to go through the information sheet and provide informed consent. They will complete a self-report questionnaire booklet assessing demographic, anxiety and mood symptoms, quality of life and mindfulness questionnaires. The measures include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS),  Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, general quality of life (QoL, SF-12)  and disease specific quality of life (FACT-BR).
Clinical information regarding tumour management will also be collected: tumour histology, surgical treatment, adjuvant therapy, medications etc. Participant confidentiality will be preserved by allocation of a unique research identifier. 
Participants will then receive a preliminary 10 minute guided mindfulness practice session via the AMT Headspace 'Registered Trademark', and will receive an email with a unique activation code for a free full subscription for 1 year to Headspace 'Registered Trademark'. This is an easily accessible self-guided meditation application that allows patients to customize their experience. We will not impose specific criteria with regard to app use and utilization but will recommend a minimum of 10 minutes daily practice for at least 8 weeks.
Participants will be informed on the information sheet that we will be obtaining data about frequency and duration of practice from the app provider about their use of the app during the project. 
We will re-assess patients at end treatment (week 8) and at 1-month follow-up (12 weeks), repeating key measures (HADS, FFMQ and QoL measures). A treatment satisfaction and feedback questionnaire will also be completed at end treatment.

ACTRN12616001536459,Oxaliplatin Dose Modification for Colorectal Cancer Triggered by Patient Reported Toxicity: Acceptability and Effect on Chronic Chemotherapy Induced Peripheral Neuropathy,"The intervention involves a questionnaire that is given to patients prior to each cycle of chemotherapy which is given every 3 weeks as an outpatient at secondary hospital settings in the MidCentral Region. Patients will receive up to 8 cycles of chemotherapy.
This questionnaire is a modified version of the NCI PRO-CTCAE neurotoxicity questions. It has been modified for use in this study by also incorporating questions regarding symptom duration and persistence of symptoms. The answers to the questions are then used by the treating clinician who is either the specialist medical oncologist or the training registrar under the supervision of the medical oncologist, to modify the Oxaliplatin dose according to a pre-specified guideline which is outlined in a flow-diagram. This guideline suggests the following modifications:
* No numbness or tingling continue with same dose
* Reported mild numbness and tingling triggers a 20-25% dose reduction in Oxaliplatin for the subsequent cycle
* If a patient reports that mild numbness and tingling occurred on no more than or lasted for no longer than 3 days, the clinician has the option of continuing with the same dose of chemotherapy
* If a patient reports persistent mild numbness and tingling present at the time of clinic, this triggers a hold on Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine continues. If the numbness or tingling improves or remains mild at the subsequent pre-chemotherapy clinic, Oxaliplatin can be reintroduced with a 20-25% dose reduction
* Reported moderate numbness and tingling triggers a hold on Oxaliplatin for the subsequent cycle
* Capecitabine chemotherapy continues, without Oxaliplatin
* Assessment of numbness and tingling at the subsequent pre-chemotherapy clinic
* If numbness and tingling is present and has not improved, Oxaliplatin is discontinued
* If numbness and tingling has resolved or has improved and is reported as mild on the modified PRO-CTCAE questionnaire, Oxaliplatin can be reintroduced with a 20-25% dose reduction
* Reported severe or very severe numbness and tingling triggers discontinuation of Oxaliplatin
* Dose reductions for numbness and tingling can be made on two occasions. If there is ongoing numbness and tingling after 2 dose reductions, Oxaliplatin is discontinued

Patients in the intervention group will be invited to complete the risk tool with a trained researcher prior to a consultation with their GP. The tool will take a maximum of 7 minutes and will be completed at baseline only. Participants will receive their risk of colorectal cancer and screening advice based on their risk which they will take with them into their consultation with their GP. All participants will also complete a survey collecting information about cancer risk perception, worry and bowel cancer screening intention and behaviour at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after recruitment. The follow up survey should take no more than 15 minutes to complete and will be sent through the post or a link to the online survey will be sent via email.

ACTRN12616001580460,safety and tolerability of an experimental treatment called LeY CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of Lewis Y expressing advanced solid tumours,"The study treatment consists in a single intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-zeta vector.
The study involves initial pre-screening of tumour tissue for Lewis Y expression to assess patient eligibility for the study protocol. If eligible, the patient will undergo leukapheresis as soon as possible (within 14 days), followed by lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy and then infusion of LeY CAR T cells. Patients will then have follow up for assessment and management of adverse events and evaluation of response. 
## Leukapheresis (14 days from Infusion) Leukapheresis should be scheduled as soon as possible after registration (14 days of registration). Venous access is required for leukapheresis and should be determined according to institutional practice. For the MNC collection an initial apheresis cycle is to be performed to obtain sufficient quantity of PBMCs to generate LeY CAR T cells. If there is an insufficient yield of PBMC following the apheresis, initiation of the cell culture will not proceed. However, the patient may undergo further apheresis procedures. If a sufficient number of PBMC cannot be achieved with a maximum of five collections, the patient may be withdrawn from the study.The turnaround time for the transduction of the Tcells is 12 days
## Lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy (within 7 days from Infusion) this is not standard of care. To increase immunosuppression and improve persistence of engineered T-cells, patients will receive fludarabine before re-infusion of the transduced T-cells. Upon notification from the sponsor that LeY CAR T cells will be available, Lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy should be initiated so as to finish at least 48 hours prior to LeY CAR T cells administration. Patients will receive intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) for 2 consecutive days prior to cell infusion. Chemotherapy should be started within 7 days of re-infusion of the T-cell product (day 0).  Alternative lymphodepleting schedules may be investigated in discussion with the DSMC.
## Re-Infusion of LeY CAR T cell(Day0)
After the date of infusion of the LeY CAR T cells has been determined, generation of the LeY CAR T-cell product will proceed. LeY CAR T cells are an autologous cellular immunotherapy product containing T cells that have undergone ex vivo activation, gene modification, expansion and formulation in re-infusion medium (normal saline with 5% Albumex 20). LeY CAR T cells will be administered according to the dose level to which the patient is assigned.Decisions to modify the dose increments or the number of patients in each dosing cohort may be made at the discretion of the principal investigator in conjunction with the DSMC in the event of adverse events observed among any patients during dose escalation at an unexpected high incidence or severity. It may also be possible to explore additional dose levels.

##Concomitant treatment will consist of prophylaxis of hypersensitivity reactions to the infusion of the T-cell product by intake of 10 mg of loratadine (oral tablets) or Phenergan (25mg oral or IV) and 1g of paracetamol (oral tablets) 30 minutes prior to the infusion. Whether loratadine or phenergen is administered will be in the the opinion of the treating physician.


Only one patient can be treated with the T cell product at any given time point during the dose escalation. No additional patients can progress to T cell infusion until the current patient is 2 or more weeks post infusion during the dose escalation phase.
Initially 3 patients will be enrolled into a cohort, starting at dose level cohort 1.
#If 0/3 patients report a DLT within the observation period (28 days following infusion of LeY CAR T cells) then 3 patients will be enrolled at one dose level above. If current dose is dose level -1 or dose level 4 then a further 3 patients will be enrolled at the current dose level.
# If 1/3 patients report a DLT within the observation period then a further 3 patients will be enrolled at the current dose level.

Minimal residual disease (MRD), performed by flow cytometry will be assessed at 1 month pre-allograft and 1, 3 and 6 months post-allograft. MRD is residual leukaemia that is undetectable by conventional microscopy.  Our current gold-standard for identifying disease is based on microscopy. However, several studies have demonstrated the presence of MRD by immunological methods using a flow cytometer is predictive of relapse and overall survival. Flow cytometry (FCM) is a test where protein expression is tested on or within leukaemic cells.  
The primary endpoint is to compare, in a prospective setting, the time to morphological relapse (TTMR) between patients who are MRD+ at that time point, and those who are MRD- at that time point. The cut-off values for MRD positivity is 0.1% ie. our detection sensitivity threshold is validated to 1 in 10 000 white blood cell events.  Follow-up is for 12 months.

Patients will be treated with a combination of intratumoural CFA and intravenous pembrolizumab to characterize the safety and anti-tumour activity of this combination. 
CFA will be administered at the start of a 42 day cycle. This cycle will be repeated every 42 days at discretion of the investigator.
 
One cohort (3 patients) will start at a dose level of 0.5ml of CFA, one will start at 1ml of CFA and the third will start at 2ml of CFA. At any dose level if no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) are observed, the dose will be escalated. Patients must complete 1 cycle of treatment with the minimum safety evaluation and drug exposure, or have had a DLT within the first cycle of treatment to be considered evaluable for dose escalation decisions. CFA dose can be escalated at discretion of the investigator if the patient is deriving benefit and has not experienced DLT or a serious adverse event. Intermediate or additional dose levels of CFA may also be considered depending upon the safety and tolerability of this agent. If a DLT is observed in 1 out of 3 patients at a given dose level, up to an additional 3 patients will be enrolled and treated at that dose level. If patients at that dose level have DLTs, the dose will be decreased to the previous dose level and 3 additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level. When up to 3 additional patients are added to a given dose level, if 1 of the 6 patients has a DLT, that dose will be declared as maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase II dose. If 2 of the first 3 or 2 of the total 6 patients experience DLTs at the initial dose level of 0.5 ml CFA, further enrollment will be halted and the study terminated or amended to evaluate lower doses.

ACTRN12616001645448,"A pilot trial of the iCanADAPT Advanced Program, an internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) program for the treatment of depression and anxiety in ambulatory advanced-stage cancer patients. ","INTRODUCTION 
The Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety and Depression (CRUfAD) have developed an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention for anxiety and depression in advanced-stage cancer patients. It is called iCanADAPT Advanced. Aspects of existing online interventions for anxiety and depression were adapted to the cancer context in the development of the iCanADAPT Advanced program. iCanADAPT Advanced is a 12 week self-managed mixed anxiety and depression program that is tailored to unique aspects of the cancer context, such as adapting to illness, fear of cancer progression and end-of-life concerns. 

PROPOSAL 
The proposed study will explore the outcomes of the clinician-guided iCBT program for people experiencing anxiety and/or depression symptoms who have been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. 

ALLOCATION 
Participants with elevated anxiety and depression scores who have been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer will be recruited. They will complete online screening questionnaires on CRUfAD's clinical trials website (www.virtualclinic.org.au) to assess eligibility to participate and provide informed consent, before being interviewed over the telephone to assess eligibility for inclusion into the study. 

OVERVIEW OF PROGRAM
The iCanADAPT Advanced program consists of six 'Modules' based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). They include all treatment components typically seen in face-to-face CBT (the first-line treatment for depression and anxiety in people diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer). Each of the six 'Modules' can be considered as a discrete package. Each of the 'Modules' contains: 
- A Lesson (consists of a comic based, easy to read story, pertinent to all participants)
- An associated Lesson Summary (consists of more dense reading material, likely pertinent to all participants) 
- Any additional resources for that Module (which may not be needed by all participants) 
- Any additional worksheets for that part (pertinent to all participants) 

THEMES OF THE MODULES 
The overriding messages in each Module i.e. the each Lesson and its associated Lesson Summary, and any additional resources is arranged by themes. The main themes are: 
Lesson 1: Learning about Depression and Anxiety
Lesson 2: Adjusting to change
Lesson 3: Identifying and Tackling Thoughts
Lesson 4: Tackling unhelpful Behaviours
Lesson 5: Facing your fears
Lesson 6: Maintaining your skills

EXAMPLE OF A MODULE 
Hence, for Module 4 the theme is Tackling Unhelpful Behaviours, hence the Lesson shows the characters addressing their unhelpful behaviours in a comic based, easy to follow story. Further specific, more detailed, writing is contained in the Lesson summary, in this case under the following headings: 
1. Tackling Low Activity 
2. Before starting activity scheduling and physical activity 
3. Daily Activity Scheduling 
4. Physical Activity
5. Your Checklist
6. Summary

HOW TO WORK THROUGH THE PROGRAM 
Participants will be asked to complete the Lesson (including the questionnaires beforehand for that lesson). Each lesson will take approximately 45-60 minutes to complete. They may go through all the slides in a single sitting, or they may take multiple sittings to get to the end. Once they have completed the Lesson, the computer system automatically releases the associated Lesson Summary (i.e., it becomes available for download on completion of the lesson). The participants are asked to practice any associated skills/activities over the course of the following 14 days. Furthermore, upon completion of the Lesson, the extra resources for that part of the course, or 'Module'', similar become available. We ask participants to aim for an additional 3 hours per week to read these associated resources and to put into practice the CBT skills. 

TIMING OF EACH MODULE
There is a purposeful lock-out time of 5 days between release of the subsequent 'Module' i.e., next Lesson and Lesson Summary etc. The 5-day lock-out refers to specific time points for the release of the next lesson and it's associated Lesson Summary. For example, if a participant undertook Lesson 3 in one sitting and hence downloaded the Lesson 3 Summary on 01st of the month, we purposely do not allow them to start 'Module 4' i.e., Lesson 4, until at least 5 days later, the 05th of the month. We will recommend instead that they spend up to two weeks (until the 14th of the month) reflecting and working through the prior Module i.e., Lesson 3, Lesson 3 Summary/recommendations. However, as some patients prefer to progress at a quicker pace we do not necessitate the full 14 day period. Instead a five day minimum is set; to ensure that the patient does not get information overload and to encourage them to reflect and undertake activities for at least a short time period. 

CONTACT 
Routine email contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist or psychiatry registrar/medical officer) after completion of the first two lessons will occur. Further email contact will occur then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email. 

ADHERENCE 
Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.",CODE: Treatment: Other::||::CODE: Behaviour,"Adults, aged over 18 years old with no maximum age

- Being within the first 6 weeks of de novo metastatic cancer diagnosis or initial diagnosis of recurrence of cancer. The rationale being that the program is not designed to address the immediate shock/distress of a cancer diagnosis; instead it is aimed to address clinical depression and clinical anxiety states
- Brain cancer/malignancy. The rationale being that intracranial neoplasm and their associated treatments regularly cause cognitive impairment and burdening a patient with an online modality of CBT would be a poor choice. 
- Current hospitalisation. 
- Physical Health status exclusion will be an ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status of greater than 1 (Oken et al., 1982). "

The twice weekly exercise sessions are conducted in groups of approximately 10 participants under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. The maximum number of participants per group is 15-20 (site dependent) and the groups are administered with an exercise physiologist to participant ratio of up to 1:10. The sessions last approximately 1 hour in duration and consist of a combination of moderate to high intensity aerobic and resistance exercise as well as flexibility exercises. The aerobic exercise component includes 20 to 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise using a variety of modes such as walking or jogging on a treadmill, cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer. The target intensity is between 60 to 85% of estimated heart rate maximum. The resistance exercise component involves 6 to 10 exercises that target the major upper and lower body muscle groups. Target intensity is manipulated from 6-12 repetition maximum (RM; i.e. the maximal weight that can be lifted 6 to 12 times which is equivalent to ~60-85% of 1RM) using 1-4 sets per exercise. Resistance exercise selection is individually prescribed. The flexibility component involves approximately 5 minutes of stretching of the major muscle groups for 15-30 second duration each. Exercise prescription is progressive and modified according to individual response.

Further assessment will be performed if there are additional findings based on the CESM which could change recommended management if confirmed to be malignant and may include targeted ultrasound (US), additional mammographic views and breast MRI. If there are  additional findings that cannot be downgraded to a NBCC 2 or below (i.e. benign) on further work-up and if determination of the underlying pathology will change treatment, core needle biopsy or preoperative image guided localisation for open biopsy will be performed after multidisciplinary discussion.

In instances where biopsy is not possible or biopsy result is benign or inconclusive, follow-up breast imaging at six to twelve months post treatment using the most appropriate modality will be the default recommendation. If all further imaging is negative (US, mammogram and CEMRI), surgical planning will proceed as per findings on standard of care imaging with routine annual follow-up mammography. Wherever possible all additional imaging prompted by the CESM study will be performed within the usual time frame between diagnosis and the surgical planning appointment for patients seen in the public system (2 weeks). 

Surgeons will be asked to complete a questionnaire documenting if / how the findings on CESM influenced the surgical plan recommended to the participant.

As per standard of care for patients who have had breast conserving surgery, all participants will have a routine cancer follow-up mammogram 12 months following their treatment.

ACTRN12616001697471,Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for Liver Cancer After Radiology treatment (TACE),"Imaging of patients will be reviewed by investigating EUS Endoscopist and Radiation Oncologist. If required, radiotherapy fiducial markers will be placed by EUS in four quadrants of the ablated site, or surgical margin to outline its peripheral borders. EUS and fiducial placement will be carried out in accordance with Gastroenterology and Hepatology Unit protocol at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Fiducial insertion will be performed by A/Prof Nam Quoc Nguyen MBBS (Hons) PhD FRACP, Consultant Gastroenterologist/ Interventional Endoscopist at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The patient is sedated for the procedure which takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.

CT simulation will be performed within five days after fiducial placement. Simulation will employ full body immobilization (Omni V SBRT system), multi-detector 4DCT with 3mm slices and IV contrast (late arterial phase scan). Simulation tumour motion study will be assessed to determine the degree of tumour excursion. Treatment planning is determined by imaging (CT or MRI) to ensure accurate delineation of the target volume on the 4DCT maximum intensity projection. SABR will be scheduled to commence within two weeks from simulation. The planning criteria will be as follows: Planning Target Volumes (PTV): In ablated lesions, PTV will be determined by gross tumour volume (GTV) plus uniform 5mm margin. In resected lesions, PTV will be determined by the clinical target volume (CTV) plus uniform 5mm margin. 
The absorbed dose will be 42-45Gy in three fractions to each PTV (BED10 = 100.8Gy). The prescription isodose should encompass at least 95% of the PTV. The maximum dose within the PTV should not exceed 140%. Treatment delivery will be in three fractions, with a maximum of two fractions per week at least 48 hours apart. Online image matching process of the gold seed fiducial markers to the reference image will be carried out. 
Follow up: The clinical outcomes of tumour size, AFP and survival will be collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months after the completion of treatment. The exact modality of radiological restaging (CT or MRI) will be at the discretion of the HCC MDT, to allow for the best method of assessing efficacy of therapy. Any subsequent therapy due to progression of HCC (if needed), will be determined by the HCC MDT. 
To evaluate the feasibility and safety of fiducial marker insertion and SABR on liver disease evident by decompensation of synthetic liver dysfunction or regional toxicity from radiation - weekly blood tests (CBP, EUC, LFT and INR) will be performed from commencement and up to four weeks after completion of SABR, to assess for deterioration of liver impairment/failure. Side effect profile will be carefully documented including any pain, discomfort, nausea or vomiting during or post SABR. Complications related to EUS insertion of fiducials will be recorded, including fiducial migration, bleeding, and organ perforation. 

Fiducial markers: endoscopic ultrasound guided insertion of 3 gold markers in the peritumoural region.
SABR: ct simulation takes approximately 45 min to 1 hour. SABR is delivered over 3 fractions at least 48 hours apart. Each fraction takes approximately 30-45 min to complete.

The decision for 42 vs 45Gy is determined at the time of radiotherapy planning. Where the dose can be delivered safely without exceeding the normal tissue constraints, 45Gy in 3 fractions would be choice at the discretion of the radiation oncologist. The timing is a departmental logistical decision. Whilst adhering to the rule of 48 hrs apart and 2 fractions max per week, the logistical capacity of the department to treat is the determining factor regarding exact timing. Exact isodose is determined at planning  this choice is a balance of achieving dose coverage of the tumour target and maintaining a dose max that is within the recommended constraints.

Biopsy will be performed by a Urologist. Participants will have PSMA-PET scan and MRI in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine by experienced Radiologists in the Royal North Shore Hospital before starting stereotactic radiotherapy.  Participants will  require fiducial markers inserted in the prostate and may require hydrogel insertion depending on the location of the recurrence. If these are required, it will be done by experienced radiation oncologists. Fiducial markers insertion involves inserting three gold markers into the prostate.

ACTRN12617000066381,Treatment decision making in papillary thyroid cancer: an online discrete choice experiment survey,"The intervention aims to test the factors (trade-offs of risks including surgical side-effects, cancer progression and risk of mortality) that are most important to patients when deciding between treatment options (total surgery, partial surgery or active surveillance, which will be described as monitoring to participants) for papillary thyroid cancer, and whether this differs based on the terminology used to describe the condition. This understanding will enable further discussion and understanding as to how the varying terms to describe the same diagnosis change patient decision making and how powerful and influential the term cancer can be. It will also provide insight into the acceptability of active surveillance as a management option for papillary thyroid cancer. 

Participants in this study will be men and women across the Australian community identified and recruited using a market research company specialising in online panel survey research (Survey Sampling International, SSI). This company maintains an extensive database of over 100,000 Australians, who have indicated their willingness to be involved in online survey research. To be eligible participants need to be above the age of 18, be fluent in English and have no previous history of a thyroid cancer diagnosis. Potential participants will be recruited to reflect the general population in terms of sex, age, cultural background, education, employment status, income. Participants will be excluded from the study if they are below the age of 18, unable to speak adequate English and have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer. 

The intended sample size for recruitment will be between 750-1000 participants in each arm (in total between 1500-2000 participants). Piloting the survey will produce results to allow for more a more definite sample size to be determined. Previous experience with discrete choice experiments (DCE), and the use of an efficient DCE design that will be generated using specific software to minimize sample size requirements, will ensure that this sample is sufficient to accurately and robustly estimate model parameters and subsequent benefit harm trade-offs.

This quantitative survey study is intended to take approximately 3-5 months for recruitment and completion of the survey by participants. The study will be conducted via an online survey, accessed through SSI. Each survey will taking approximately 10-15 minutes for participants to complete.

Data will be collected directly from participants in the form of an online survey. Once invited by email by SSI, participants will be provided a link to login in to the discrete choice survey. Participants will be provided with an online Participant Information Sheet. As this is an online survey, no signed consent will be sought, rather, if respondents proceed beyond the Participant Information Sheet and consent information and complete and submit the survey, this will be considered evidence of consent (as discussed in NHMRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007)). Participants will be randomised to either receive the cancer term (papillary thyroid cancer) or non-cancer term (papillary lesions). The discrete choice survey will consist of at least 6 choice questions comparing different decision making scenarios. Participants will be asked to choose the option they most prefer for each question. This will be presented as a two part question to give people an option not to choose either scenario. Following completion of the discrete choice questions, participants will be asked some additional sociodemographic questions such as age, education level, employment status and personal and family history of cancer. 

By observing participant choices for different scenarios using DCE, the analyst is able to construct sets of utility functions. These utility functions model the weights that individuals attach to each of the attributes, and as such, allow for an estimation of the relative importance of each attribute.",CODE: Treatment: Other,"Participants in this study will be men and women across the Australian community identified through Survey Sampling International.

ACTRN12617000081314,Feasibility of an online mindfulness-based program for patients with melanoma ,"The intervention is a 6-week online mindfulness-based program designed to: (1) help patients understand the potential benefits of using mindfulness in their day to day life; (2) support the establishment of daily meditation practice. Each week of the program explores a different topic, which builds on the topic explored the week before. The program includes three main components: (1) educational component  weekly themes related to the application of mindfulness. Participants are invited to watch at the beginning of each week, a series of videos (the number varies for each week), each 40 seconds to 60 seconds long. The scripts of those videos can be downloaded if participants wish to refer to the information at a later stage; (2) informal practice. Participants are given a weekly mindfulness-based task to practice during their daily activities; and (3) formal meditation practice. Participants are asked to practice meditation twice daily for 5 minutes each time. This time is increased to 10 minutes each practice from week 3 onwards.
Participants will receive an email at the start of each week with a link to a brief questionnaire inquiring about their level of engagement with the program. Following completion of the questionnaire, participants will be directed to a video introducing the theme for the upcoming week. At the end of each video, participants will be reminded to keep up with their daily meditation practice (formal practice), and will be given a specific mindfulness task to practice during their daily activities (informal practice).
To support participants with establishing a meditation routine, emails containing a link to a short, guided meditation audio file will be sent to participants twice daily. These emails will serve as reminders to meditate and will provide easy access to the meditation practice of the week. 
The website will have a section addressing common questions about meditation, which participants will be able to consult at any time throughout the course of the program. 
The mindfulness program can be accessed at any time via direct login to the Website or via the hyperlink sent to participants in the weekly e-mails.
The software used to run the mindfulness program will allow tracking of participants online activity, including login date/times, navigation patterns, page views and duration, and features used (video, audio, and document downloads). A set of three questions will be presented weekly to capture information on any use of other types of meditation unrelated to the intervention, and frequency of practice.

In both groups, PET-2 is to take place in the last week of the 2nd chemotherapy cycle (between day 17 and day 21) PET-6 is to take place within 3 weeks after day 21 of the 6th chemotherapy cycle.  
Patients will undergo restaging by FDG-PET with low dose CT, of the whole trunk of the body; images of the lower extremities are only required if a primary tumour was located there.  Each restaging will always include an examination of all initially involved lymph nodes or organs using adequate methods.  The objective of the PET-2 interim restaging is to document the response to chemotherapy, and to reassess if the patient is still qualified for the trial.  The objective of the PET-6 restaging is to document the response to chemotherapy, and to recommend patients for radiotherapy where tumour masses are greater than or equal to 2.5 cm after chemotherapy. If a patient is scheduled for radiotherapy following PET-6 restaging, an additional FDG-PET will take place within 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.  The decision and organisation of the radiotherapy is up to the discretion of the treating physician on site.

ACTRN12617000092392,Investigating the impact of a web-based melanoma awareness video on intentions to engage in sun protection among a sample of young Australians.,"This study investigated the impact of the melanoma awareness video Dear 16-year-old me, a self-assessment of perceived melanoma risk, and a control condition.

'Dear 16-year-old me"" is a five minute melanoma awareness video developed by the David Cornfield Melanoma Fund in 2011, which is available online. The video addresses the importance of protecting and checking ones skin via personal testimonies from real life melanoma survivors and their families, who share with their younger selves the advice that could have prevented them or a loved one from developing melanoma. 

The risk self-assessment used in this study was one component of a self-administered melanoma questionnaire that assesses personal risk, level of concern, protective behaviour, and knowledge (Gillespie et al., 2011). For the purpose of this study, only the risk component of the questionnaire was used (the Personal Risk for Melanoma Questionnaire; PRMQ). This 7-item self-assessment collects information about skin type, hair colour, and other personal factors that can contribute to an individuals likelihood of developing melanoma. Each response attracts a score, and the sum of these is a numerical indication of melanoma risk, ranging on a scale from -2 to 22.

ACTRN12617000131358,Behavioural intervention trial to increase physical activity in colorectal and gynaecological cancer survivors at cardiovascular risk ,"The intervention arm will receive a Fitbit to use to monitor physical activity for the duration of the 12-week intervention. Participants who are randomised to the intervention arm will also attend two group sessions which will target goal-setting and action-planning skills. 

The treatment group will be able to collect the Fitbit post-randomisation. Participants will be able to pick the Fitbit up from the hospital, signing it out upon collection at their first group meeting. They will be asked to wear the Fitbit as much as possible during the 12-week intervention (at least 8 hours per day, preferably all waking hours), and will be encouraged to download Fitbit software that will assist in tracking their physical activity. Use of the Fitbits will provide participants with a practical and convenient method for monitoring their activity. 
Throughout the 12-week intervention, participants in the treatment group will be required to attend two 1-hour group sessions. The first group session will be held in week 1, and the second in week 4 of the study. Session one will focus on introducing participants to the Fitbit and giving instructions on how to use this device as a self-monitoring tool. Participants will complete goal-setting worksheets (Appendix F - attached to ANZCTR registration form) to set their activity goals for the following 12 weeks. Behaviour change specialists SH and CMS will assist participants with effective action planning, goal-setting and self-monitoring.
Session two will attend to support needs and help participants to plan for and overcome barriers to increasing their physical activity level. Participants will also be able to adjust previously established goals, if necessary. This session will also allow for trouble-shooting of any problems or queries that participants encounter regarding Fitbit wear and use.
Participants will take all worksheets from the sessions home with them, to assist with achieving their goals. At the end of the 12-week intervention, all participants should have completed two group sessions. Although this is not required, it is recommended that participants will also meet and build rapport with other participants in their neighbourhood outside of the meetings to boost their support and provide a sense of accountability. A final booster message will be sent to participants via text message or email (according to participant preference) at week 6. In keeping with the theme of self-monitoring and support needs, this booster message will contain a brief note of encouragement and a recommendation to track physical activity, with the aim of meeting the government guidelines. Participants will attend their end of intervention assessment at 12 weeks, where they will also be invited to assess the feasibility of the intervention. At 24 weeks (twelve weeks post-intervention), participants will attend their final follow-up assessment. Participants will be required to return their Fitbit within the fortnight following the 24-week intervention.

In the absence of this data, individuals will be recruited based on their ASA score at time of treatment. Only those with an ASA score of 2 or 3 will be eligible for recruitment. An ASA score from 1-4 is assigned to patients upon admission to hospital for a surgical procedure. A low ASA score indicates that the patient is at minimal cardiovascular risk, and a higher ASA score suggests that the patient suffers from comorbidities that may pose a threat to their life. Participants with ASA scores of 2 or 3 will have comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidaemia, and elevated BMI, putting them at risk of CVD. The ASA score is globally recognised as an indicator of physical health status of patients prior to undergoing surgery (Owens, Felts & Spitznagel, 1978).

These cancer subtypes are typically associated with a poor prognosis. By excluding these subtypes, we hope to avoid attempting to contact individuals who may be deceased. 
Individuals with an ASA score of 1 are unlikely to benefit from the project as it is expected that cardiovascular health improvements will be minimal in patients who are already in good health. Additionally, those with an ASA score of 1 do not fall into the target sample of cancer survivors at high cardiovascular risk. Individuals with an ASA score of 4 are considered to have significant life threatening comorbidities, deeming the intervention inappropriate for this group.

ACTRN12617000132347,The EXCISE Study - EXcisional treatment Comparison for In Situ Endocervical adenocarinoma,"Eligible participants reported on screening cytology referred to a gynaecologist or gynaecological oncologist will be randomised to undergo a LEEP or CKC procedure.

Participants randomised to the Intervention arm LEEP, will have their procedure performed either under local or general anaesthesia in an outpatient setting or operating theatre at the discretion of the treating specialist as per local routine practice. All participants will undergo endocervical curettage at the time of their LEEP or CKC. The approximate duration of the procedure is 15 - 30 minutes.

Loop diathermy (LEEP) is the most commonly used treatment for high grade squamous dysplasia of the cervix in developed countries. The dimensions of the loop should be chosen after colposcopy preceding therapy to meet the width of the transformation zone and the planned type (length) of excision. Excisions are classified according to the length of cervix excised.
Type I - usually to 8 mm and not more than 10 mm length of cervical tissue excised 
Type 2 - not more than 15 mm length of tissue excised
Type 3 - equivalent to cone biopsy and > 15 mm length
In this study only type 3 excisions are permitted.
Diathermy settings should be significantly higher than used in most open or laparoscopic surgeries to reduce thermal artefact (this should be minimised to 0.2 mm). It is imperative that the clinician obtain the recommended power settings from the electrosurgical system manufacturer. It should be noted that each clinician will have a personal preference (to suit their surgical technique, loop size, speed of excision and other factors) that determine their personal best settings for electrosurgical procedures. Extensive application of coagulation current should be avoided, especially at the endocervical margin, which rarely bleeds. A single pass of the loop (side to side or posterior to anterior) to produce a specimen in one piece is optimal. LEEP may be performed in an operating theatre, outpatient clinic or consulting rooms under local or general anaesthesia in accordance with local practice and at the discretion of the treating specialist.

A cold knife cone biopsy uses a scalpel to excise a cone shaped piece of cervical tissue where the glandular abnormality (AIS) is located. The shape of the excision is not in reality a true cone, but a cone on top of a cylinder. The initial incision is perpendicular to the external cervical surface to ensure the excision of glands originally exposed in the post-menarche transformation zone now overlain by mature squamous metaplasia. Cone biopsies are type 3 excisions. The procedure is performed in an operating theatre under general anaesthesia by a gynaecological oncologist or gynaecologist with experience in the technique.


All treating Investigators will be highly experienced providers and certified under the Colposcopy Quality Improvement Program (CQUIP) in accordance with the requirements of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.

Following treatment all patients will undergo the 'Test of Cure' management pathway.

Arm B: Permanent placed indwelling catheter (Rocket 'Registered Trademark') for intermittent drainage (treatment group).
Operators / Interventional Radiologists restricted to two very experienced radiolkogists are to wear head, face and shoe coverings. All access to the room will be restricted to the team performing the procedure. Patients are to be nil by mouth for 6 hours before the procedure (water with medication allowed). Patients may receive conscious sedation with IV midazolam (1 mg) and IV fentanyl (50 mcg).  This will be adjusted as required due to patient discomfort, anxiety and body habitus and previous opiate exposure. 

There will be prophylactic pre-procedure antibiotic coverage for skin flora with IV cefazolin 1g will also be administered. An appropriate alternative will be provided for people who have a Cephalosporin allergy.

Radiologic Technique: Sonography will be performed before the surgical scrub to localise of a large pocket of ascites. Lateral location for initial access is preferred to facilitate a medially directed subcutaneous tunnel. This allows the exit site of the catheter to be close to midline, allowing a convenient place for access.

The Rocket Indwelling Abdominal Catheter will be placed as per the product instructions for use. All the equipment needed for placement is included in the Kit.  The site is selected and the patient is prepped. The surgical field will be prepared with providone iodine solution. The operative field will then be draped.

The skin of the insertion site and tunnel will be infiltrated with local anaesthetic. A small incision is then made at the insertion site and the tunnel exit site.  Under ultrasound guidance the 18g needle will be inserted into the peritoneal cavity and aspiration performed to confirm position. The guide-wire will then be inserted through the needle and the needle removed leaving the guide wire in-situ.  The IAC would then be tunnelled (antegrade) using the pre-attached tunnelling device and then drawn through until the cuff is mid-way along the tunnel. 

The 16g tear way sheath will be then inserted over the guide wire into the peritoneal cavity. The catheter detached from its tunneller and inserted through the sheath which is then torn away and removed. The catheter will then be withdrawn until the cuff is one centimetre from the outer end of the tunnel.  The primary insertion site and the tunnel exit are then closed and the site is dressed.  The included drainage bag would then be attached to the catheter and the ascites allowed to drain freely. 

Approximately 90 minutes for the pre and post procedure within interventional radiology, with an additional 6 hours post op follow up within oncology acutes.

The catheter will remain in-situ until death, or removed for an adverse event removal, or at patients request.

Weekly visits to patient  home will be carried out by the Research Nurse. Abdomen will be assessed for ascites, if present will be drained up to a maxim of 2L.

Weekly visits will include an assessment of the insertion site for infection, drainage problems ie occlusion and leakage from the insertion site. All results will be recorded and tabled in the results on frequency of each problem.

ACTRN12617000163303p,EX-MED CANCER: A Community Based Exercise Medicine Program for Cancer Survivors,"Exercise Intervention:
The Ex-Med Cancer exercise intervention will involve a 3-month, group-based, supervised exercise program delivered in community fitness centres/gyms in Victoria. Prior to commencing the program, each participant will receive a consultation and individual exercise session (~60 min) with an exercise physiologists (EP) in order to individualise the exercise prescription to their specific needs according to their cancer and general health history, physical abilities and personal preferences. A combination of aerobic (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) and resistance (i.e. lifting weights) exercise will be undertaken 3 times per week. Specifically, the aerobic exercise component will include 20 to 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular exercise (~60-85% of estimated maximum heart rate) using a variety of modes such as walking or jogging on a treadmill, cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer. Participants will be encouraged to undertake additional home-based aerobic exercise with the goal of achieving a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise each week. The resistance exercise component will involve 6-8 exercises that target the major upper and lower body muscle groups. Intensity will be manipulated from 6-12 repetition maximum (RM; i.e. the maximal weight that can be lifted 6 to 12 times which is equivalent to ~60-85% of 1RM) using 1-4 sets per exercise. Exercise prescription will be progressive and modified according to individual response. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be supervised by an experienced EP.  Compliance and attendance (including the reason for any missed sessions) will be tracked throughout the program by the EP. At the completion of the 3-month supervised exercise intervention survivors will have an individual consultation with their EP (~60 min). The consultation will re-evaluate their personalised exercise prescription taking into account participants progress through the exercise sessions and develop a plan for long-term exercise behaviour.

ACTRN12617000174381,TrueNTH solutions: an integrated multi-component intervention to improve the lives of men with prostate cancer in Australia,"Men with prostate cancer and their partner/carer will receive a 12 month individualised intervention. 

1. Care coordination
Local service providers and the central care coordination service where necessary, will work collaboratively to implement coordination interventions. These include screening, assessment, navigation, information and education, ongoing monitoring, and practical and social support. Consented men will receive an initial consultation with a Care Coordinator, face-to-face or via videoconferencing or telephone, to assess their symptoms and health needs and provide tailored information and education. The duration of the initial consultation varies according to the man's stage of disease and health needs. The mode of the consultation will depend on local service availability, access and preferences of the man. The Care Coordinator will then communicate with the man's care providers (i.e. specialist medical doctors, nurses, allied health practitioners and general practitioner) to develop a care plan for the man, which contains referrals to other relevant prostate cancer services. The man will also be provided with access to a webpage that can be accessed via a computer or a mobile device. On this webpage, he will be able to enter symptoms related to recovery from prostate cancer that he may be experiencing. This will allow the Care Coordinator and other health professionals involved in his care to closely monitor his recovery from the effects of prostate cancer and provide ongoing advice and support over 12 months. If men do not have access to a computer or mobile device, hard copies of the care plan and/or other information will be provided, as required. The Care Coordinator and other health professionals involved in the care can provide ongoing assessment, monitoring and support face-to-face or via a telephone.

Based on assessment of needs and preferences, the Care Coordinator may also refer the man to relevant support services to address practical needs relating to transport, accommodation, finance, legal, employment, partners/carers support and advance care planning as required. The coordination service will also provide information to the man and his carer about a range of peer support programs.

2. Decision support
Men who have been newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer will have access to an online decision support aid, the Personal Patient Profile Prostate (P3P), which will support the man in understanding the treatment options and adverse effects against his own values and thus reduce the burden of making the decision and later decision regret, and improve informed consent. P3P is developed and evaluated in the US and has been modified to suit the Australian context (language/text, definitions, statistics, videos and web links).

3. Lifestyle management
An appropriate, prescribed, evidence-based exercise program developed by TrueNTH researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) will be provided to men with prostate cancer regardless of their stage of disease; past, current or future treatments; financial capacity; or geographic location. Where possible, the exercise prescription once developed will be implemented in face-to-face consultations; or by telephone or videoconference with a local accredited exercise physiologist (AEP) identified by the TrueNTH team. The exercise prescriptions will be tailored to the individual to address the specific issues causing men's greatest concern, to prepare them for future treatments such as surgery, or to address post-treatment issues. The exercises performed and the number, frequency and duration of exercise sessions will thus be determined on an individual basis. Regular monitoring of the man will ensure safety as well as providing motivation to continue to adhere to the exercise prescription. 

In addition, all men will undergo an initial nutrition screening with the TrueNTH service at point of entry. The initial consult with the TrueNTH Dietitian will assess the need for referral to a local Accredited Practicing Dietitian (APD), or continue servicing the man through teleconferencing or video conferencing. Referral will be made to a local APD for a comprehensive nutritional assessment where possible depending on the capacity of the local health service and the preference of the man. The duration of the initial nutrition consultation with the dietitian varies according to the man's stage of disease and nutritional needs.

4. Specialized clinical support services
The care coordinator will work with the man's treating team to match services to the need and preference of the man and his partner/carer at entry and at any point during the intervention. The navigation will involve referral to the following specialist services where required, using specified study protocols:

* Psychological support and management
The care coordinator will undertake the screening using the 'distress thermometer' and identify factors associated with any distress. For men and/or partners/carers with moderate or high level needs at referral or at any follow up assessment, referral will be made to local or central psychological support and management services. 

* Sexual recovery
The intervention aims to provide a range of sexual rehabilitation interventions tailored to the needs of the individual/couple and stratified according to needs and risk factors. This intervention will commence pre-treatment where possible. At the initial care coordinator consultation, all men will receive standard information and education relating to sexual recovery issues. Assessment and ongoing monitoring will identify men with sexual recovery needs who require additional services. Where required these men will be referred to a relationship and intimacy counsellor with expertise in prostate cancer locally, and if not available locally will be referred to the Monash Health or Royal Women's Hospital intimacy and relationship counselling service (Victoria); and/or erectile dysfunction management supported by Men's Erectile Solutions (Queensland).

* Continence management
At the initial care coordinator consultation, all men will receive standard information and education relating to continence issues. Assessment and ongoing monitoring will identify men with continence needs who require additional services. These men will be referred to local continence advisors where available and/or referred to the Continence Foundation Australia (CFA) if such services are not available. CFA will liaise with the treating specialist team to contribute to development of a continence plan through advice and expertise.

5. Prostate cancer comorbidities management
At entry to the intervention, the care coordinator will liaise with the man's GP to facilitate the assessments for metabolic risk assessment (for men with advanced prostate cancer) or for comorbidities (for men with localised prostate cancer). Based on this assessment the GP can liaise with the treating team to facilitate management of any identified risks and conditions. 

6. Partner/carer support
The care coordinator will also provide partner/carer support as appropriate, including information provision and referral to local or central counselling services as required. Partners/carers are encouraged to attend appointments with the man. If the partner/carer is identified as needing care, a care plan will be developed. The referral and follow up processes for the partner/carer will be similar to the man.

The facilitators will be from the communities of each of the cases.  The programmes will run continuously over a one year period and participants will be invited onto the programme as they are identified by each MHP organisation.  Groups will be run once/fortnight (once/month over winter).  TThe duration of each session is not yet known and will vary depending on the needs and preferences of the group, however it is likely that each session will involve an hour of information sharing and another hour of whakawhanaungatanga (connection) and hakare (eating together).  The locations of the support groups are yet to be finalised, but are likely to be at local marae or other community meeting places where whanau will feel comfortable.

ACTRN12617000237381,"Deep Inhalation Breath Hold for reduction of cardiac toxicity in patients with left-sided breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy, HART (Heart Avoiding Radiation Therapy)","The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate the feasibility to evaluate Deep Inhalation Breath Hold (DIBH) countrywide as demonstrated in patient compliance and reproducibility of set-up.

The trial is a two-arm study assessing the feasibility of DIBH during Radiotherapy treatment: the intervention group corresponds to left-sided breast cancer patients whereas the control group corresponds to right sided breast cancer patients. 

Left sided breast cancer patients who do not proceed to treatment with DIBH will be included in the assessment. A control group is included to compare the reproducibility of set-up between participants treated with/without DIBH and compare resource requirements. 

 Patients will undergo DIBH (provided they are able to hold their breath in a reproducible and consistent manner for a long enough period, which is approximately 10 to 15 seconds). Participants with left-sided breast cancer will undergo breathing training if applicable. 

There is no prescribed breathing training for participating centres as we would like to capture clinical practice. Breathing training will also depend on the equipment used to guide DIBH. The type of breathing training that is provided by the site will be captured prior to the commencement of the trial. 

Most centres would provide training and according to informal discussions, this is between 20min and one hour. The training is most likely performed by radiation therapists who also oversee and conduct the planning CT scans for the patient. RTs are a registered profession. It is also common that patients undergo a practice session prior to the CT scan where they take breaths under observation in the same way as during treatment but without either imaging or treatment delivery.

When performing the DIBH, patients are asked to take a deep breath prior to radiation delivery. This is likely to move the heart away from the high dose region aimed at breast tissue (or chest wall) thereby reducing dose to the heart. Patients will perform DIBH at every radiation delivered over the five weeks. 

Each participant will complete and anxiety assessment before receiving standard of care radiotherapy treatment as per their institution's guidelines. All participants will have daily electronic portal imaging (EPI) taken during the first week of treatment and then weekly EPI for 5 weeks. During the 3rd week of radiotherapy treatment, the participants with left-sided breast cancer will complete another anxiety assessment.

As part of the trial, patients will have two planning CT scans: Free breathing and DIBH. The scheduling of the two scans is left to department practice. Patients in the control group will only have the standard CT scan used for treatment planning.

ACTRN12617000288325p,The use of a visualisation intervention to improve recovery behaviours following colorectal cancer surgery,"The current study includes 3 conditions, two of which are intervention arms: the visualisation intervention and a verbal information only group (active control). The final group is a standard care group. The intervention group will receive an animated intervention depicting the purpose of the recovery behaviours of early re-mobilisation and the early re-introduction of food and drink following surgery. These animations will be displayed on an iPad and shown to patients at their bedside at day 1 following their surgery and takes approximately 10 minutes to deliver.. The intervention will be administered by the student researcher (Annie Jones, PhD student in Health Psychology). The intervention will provide information about how these two behaviours (which are part of the standard Enhanced Recovery After Surgery programme which all patients undergo) will help the patient to recover faster from their surgery. There are two versions of the intervention where either a male or female actor patient is used. The version of the intervention the patient sees will be their gender match. The intervention will begin by highlighting common beliefs that patients have about recovering from a surgical procedure, such as ideas around bed rest being the fastest way to heal. These ideas will be challenged by providing information about the ERAS programme including evidence from previous clinical trials. The intervention then explains the recovery behaviour of early mobilisation. The presentation incorporates real life footage of an actor with animations depicting the internal bodily processes occurring while either resting, or when mobile. The animations show the heart, the lungs, and bodily circulation. The second part of the intervention shows the importance of the early re-introduction of food and drink following surgery. An animation explaining the digestive system is used here. The intervention also outlines to patients their daily goals for each of the behaviours. These are pre-existing goals that are given to all patients in their information booklet. Finally, the intervention ends with an elaborative reasoning task, which tries to get the patient to contextualise their ideas about exercising with their own life.

EORTC stands for the 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer' and the melanoma questionnaire is being studied by the quality of life working group. The QLQ_C30 has been adapted for many specific cancer types. The objective of the study is to better understand and evaluate the experience of people diagnosed and treated for melanoma and its impact on their life. 

Patients with melanoma will be asked to complete a data collection pack containing some questionnaires whilst they are waiting to be seen at an outpatient appointment. A member of the research team will complete a form by asking the patient some socio-demographic information including: age, gender, initials, date of birth, indigenous status, country of birth, level of education attained, living circumstances and employment status..The study team member will then ask about the treatment and investigations for melanoma the patient has had and how long they have been attending the clinic.

Patients are then asked to complete 2 standard questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and HADS), followed by a questionnaire that is the new research tool being tested. The EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire is a tool to asses the quality of life in patients with any form of cancer. It includes questions about the patient's rating of his/her physical and mental health. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).questionnaire is used to assess the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient may be experiencing.

After completing the questionnaires, patients are asked to complete a survey asking what they thought of the questionnaires and if they required help in answering them.

Callers may be offered one or more of these services based on the consultants clinical judgement and the caller's level of distress which is measured by a single-item screening tool (the Distress Thermometer [DT]). 

Arm 2 (Structured Care): Consultants who are randomised to Arm 2 will administer a two-stage screening process (the DT plus PHQ-4). Based on these results, the consultant will refer to the structured care model and offer the caller those services which align with their level of distress (i.e mild, moderate or severe). The structured care model was developed specifically for this study by the University of Newcastle research team, Cancer Council NSW, and Cancer Council Victoria. Development included: i) a review of existing distress screening and management guidelines including the NCCN guidelines; 2) iterative discussion with place card mapping and think aloud methodology; and 3) pilot-testing.
The structured care model can be supplemented with an additional follow-up call involving repeat screening and further support for those with elevated or unchanged distress scores (i.e. stepped care). Those callers with moderate to severe distress will be offered this additional outbound call; if accepted, the call will be scheduled at least two weeks following the initial inbound call and dependant on other events (such as start or completion of treatment). 

Callers allocated to Arm 1 (Treatment as Usual) will not be denied any services. Rather, callers within Arm 1 will not be assessed for service suitability in the systematic and structured fashion which will be the case for Arm 2 (Structured Care).

Intervention fidelity: To assess consultants fidelity to administering the DT (Arm 1 and 2), the PHQ-4 (Arm 2 only), and the structured care model (Arm 2 only), the research team will review a random sample of audio recordings. Furthermore, using the Client Record Management Systems it will be possible to audit the proportion of calls in which DT or PHQ-4 scores were recorded; participants will also be asked to report which services were offered during their call at a 3- and 6-month follow up survey.

ACTRN12617000411347,The ADAPT Program to support the management of anxiety and depression in adult cancer patients: a cluster randomised trial to evaluate different implementation strategies. ,"A cluster randomised trial will be used to compare different implementation strategies to embed the 'Clinical Pathway for the Screening, Assessment and Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Cancer Patients'* into routine care. Twelve cancer services in New South Wales will be recruited into this study. Six (Arm 1) will be randomised to receive one set of implementation strategies to support adherence to the Clinical Pathway into routine care and six (Arm 2) will be randomised to receive a differing set of implementation strategies to support adherence to the Clinical Pathway into routine care. The implementation strategies are targeted at cancer services and cancer service staff.  Randomisation is at the cancer service level only, stratified by large versus small cancer services.
*Clinical Pathway for the Screening, Assessment and Management of Anxiety and Depression in Adult Cancer Patients: Australian Guidelines. Butow, P. et al.  Psycho-Oncology, 24 (9) pp 987  1001. 

The interventions for each study arm include: 

1. The ADAPT Portal - an online, integrated management system that allows cancer service staff to operationalise the Clinical Pathway and has the following essential features and functions:
i.	Patient Registration, Management and Referral
Cancer service patient details are entered into the Portal by cancer service staff. The Portal generates a screening date for each patient and alerts staff when patients are due to screen. The Portal generates a screening alert for patients every 3-months, and also at key points in their treatment. If a patient screens with high levels of depression and/or anxiety, the Portal alerts staff that the patient requires triage. After triage, the Portal alerts clinical staff as to the relevant step of the Clinical Pathway for each individual patient, and the appropriate referrals and support to offer. The Portal provides standardised templates for referral and feedback to/from mental health services when required. 
ii.	Patient screening and education materials
When cancer service staff register a patient's details in the Portal, the system generates a log-in for the patient. Patients may then log-in to their own individual pages within the Portal where they are systematically prompted to complete validated screening and assessment questionnaires online. Using their log-in, patients may also access patient information that explains the importance of screening for anxiety and depression, and the process involved for patients in the use of the Clinical Pathway. These patient information materials will also link to existing patient/caregiver resources about cancer-related anxiety and depression.
iii.	iCanADAPT Online therapy treatment programs
Two programs delivering online psychological therapy have been developed by the ADAPT Program for patients with early stage or advanced stage cancer identified as having symptoms of anxiety and/ or depression. The therapy includes behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving, attentional training and mindfulness strategies, completed in 6-8 sessions over 10-12 weeks. These online courses are available in the ADAPT Portal for patient self-referral or clinician referral. Patients who access these courses will be monitored by a clinical psychologist.
iv.	ADAPT Online Health Professional Education Modules
Online education modules have been developed using evidence-based learning principles and spaced education to promote interactive learning. This education targets screening, assessing severity, making a referral - particularly when patients are reluctant - and empathic communication. Staff will be prompted to undertake annual refreshers by the portal. Modules will be available on eviQ, the most widely used Oncology education site in Australia, with links in the ADAPT Portal

All sites will receive full access to the ADAPT Portal and training to use the Portal resources and systems. The study arms will differ as to the extent to which they receive the following implementation strategies (interventions):
2. Academic Detailing and Support: Initial staff training and support about the Clinical Pathway and use of the ADAPT Portal. Tailoring of the ADAPT Portal set up to fit individual service requirements, service and staff profile. 
3. Awareness Campaigns: Roadshow and poster campaigns to inform cancer service staff about the Clinical Pathway and the Portal. 
4. Champions: ADAPT program staff will work with sites to identify and support local Clinical Pathway and Portal Champions.
5. Education: Staff will be trained to use the Portal, in face-to-face training and also by engaging with User Guides and by seeking the support of the Local Champion. 
6. Reporting: Reports will be provided to site Leads and Champions regarding use of the Portal and the Clinical Pathway issues and concerns. 
DELIVERY

All interventions and available ongoing support throughout the study duration will be delivered by experienced health service research professionals, with train the trainer approaches for some aspects during a two-month site engagement and preparation period prior to services initiating implementation of the Clincial Pathway over a 12-month period. 

ADHERENCE MEASURES
The primary endpoint of this study is adherence to the Clinical Pathway. This outcome will be measured using a study-developed measure, capturing information about screening, information provision, emotional support, triage, referral, uptake and progress review, as specified in the Clinical Pathway. Adherence will be calculated as a percentage of patients at each site whose care is considered adherent to the Clinical Pathway.  This is based on individual calculations for each patient of a continuous score of 0-100 of appropriate critical components of the Clinical Pathway provided over the 12-month study period, transformed into a binary score of adherent or not adherent. This data will be obtained from patient records (with patient consent).

Participants can use the app at their discretion, but are prompted to check in regularly through daily notifications.

To determine whether these game features work as intended, we are enrolling participants at random into one of two groups. The first group has the full features of the Quittr app enabled, while the second group has the game features disabled. This will allow us to detect differences in the outcomes reported for each group.

We will also monitor usage analytics, to determine how engaged the smoker is with the various features of the apps over time.

The intervention group will have access to the full features of Quittr, including the ""Tappy Town"" incentivisation game and QuitCoin rewards. They will be granted QuitCoins in return for positive behaviours that are likely to improve their chances of quitting smoking (i.e. not smoking, consuming educational content, checking in regularly). The QuitCoins can be redeemed in the Tappy Town incentivisation game. This is a city builder/clicker style game that allows the player to incrementally grow a city by placing a variety of buildings/improvements into the game map. As the city grows so does its income potential, allowing the player to afford gradually more grand buildings and improvements.

ACTRN12617000592347,CXCR4 PET/CT for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) staging.     ,"The study intervention is the addition of PET/MR, a PET/CT image using a CXCR4 tracer (68Ga-CPCR4-2) and an additional FDG PET/CT scan. We would also take saliva and blood samples. The scans and samples will be taken within 36 hours of each-other and be at least 4.5 hours apart. It is standard for biopsy samples to be taken during surgery, but in addition their location would be recorded. Tissue will be obtained from the surgical procedure.  There will be no impact on usual patient care. Participants will also receive MR contrast agent so as to obtain a standard of care MRI acquisition during the PET/MR scan; in some cases, where participants have had a prior MRI scan, the use of MR contrast agent will be an additional intervention.

Blood samples
Before imaging begins, a blood sample will be taken by injecting a needle into a vein and letting a small amount of blood pool into a collection tube. Three tubes of blood will be taken but from the same needle.

Session 1a: 68Ga-Pentixafor -PET/MR
After emptying your bladder, a qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will ask you to lie on the scanner bed. They will insert a tube into your vein and inject a radioactive substance called 68Ga-Pentixafor as well as MRI Contrast. The scan involves lying flat with knees supported and arms resting by your side. Only your head/neck will be scanned. The scan time for the PET/CT will be approximately 70 minutes. During this time the MR part of the scanner will make buzzing or knocking noises as it generates different kinds of images.

Session 1b: 68Ga-Pentixafor-PET/CT
You will be asked empty your bladder again and walk to the PET/CT scanner in the room next door. After lying down you will be scanned from head to mid-chest. This scan will last approximately 20 minutes.

After the first imaging session and having a drink of water and something to eat, you will be asked to not eat or drink anything but water (drinking water is encouraged) for the four hours prior to the next scan.

Saliva samples
Approximately one hour after eating and drinking you will be asked to provide three saliva samples. The three saliva samples will take some time to obtain because a different method will be used each time: 
1. Once after waiting for saliva to build up in the mouth, 
2. Once after having had a lemon sweet, and
3. Once after rinsing with mouthwash.

After the saliva samples have been taken, you will then be asked to continue to avoid eating, but encouraged to drink water.

Session 2: FDG-PET/CT
Four hours after eating, a qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will ask you empty your bladder and to lie on the scanner bed. They will insert a tube into your vein and inject a radioactive substance called FDG. The scan involves lying flat with knees supported and arms resting by your sides. For approximately the first 60 minutes only your head will be scanned. In the second part of the scan, you will be scanned from head to mid-chest. This will take approximately another 15 minutes. 

After the examination is completed, you will be able to eat and drink normally.

Scanning sessions can be performed on two separate days if required but both scanning sessions need to be performed within 36 hours of the first scan starting.

ACTRN12617000621314,The North Queensland Sun-Safe' Clothing Study: effectiveness of sun-protective clothing in preventing or delaying the development of pigmented moles in early childhood.,"This prospective cluster-randomised controlled intervention trial involved children aged 1-35 months-old (at baseline) attending intervention daycare centres (n=13) wearing sun-protective study garments and legionnaire hats while at daycare. 

All daycare centres in the intervention group were given sufficient numbers of the following study garments (in a range of sizes) to ensure that they could clothe all children in attendance at the centre in our study garments each day:

1) Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) 50-plus legionnaire hats; 

2) 100% cotton T-shirts offering ""very good protection"" (i.e. UPF 25-39 blocks between 96 percent and 97.4 percent of erythemally effective UVR) with sleeves 21 percent longer than T-shirts made to Australian standard sizing;

3) water-resistant nylon taslon shorts designed to cover the legs to below the knees and made of UPF 40 rated fabric (i.e. blocks at least 97.5 percent of erythemally effective UVR)  providing ""excellent protection"".  

4) water-resistant UPF 40 rated nylon taslon long-sleeve shirts for use during outdoor water-play. 

Study clothing was used and maintained (laundry service provided) in these 13 intervention centres continuously for 5.5 years  from 2000 until mid-2005, when the last child enrolled in the intervention group had their 3-year skin examination. The intervention generally involved children wearing study garments for a duration of at least 3 years of follow-up (from the time baseline naevus count was performed). Children leaving the daycare centre  permanently before achieving 3 or more years of follow-up were given a final skin examination prior to departure, whenever possible, so that data for shorter periods of observation could also be included in the analysis (intention to treat). 

Staff members at intervention centres were trained to dress all children in this clothing on arrival at the centre each day in order to ensure that each child's trunk, posterior neck, upper arms and thighs were fully covered at all times when outdoors (i.e. T-shirt sleeves to cover to at least the elbows and shorts to cover to below the knees). Staff were instructed not to change children back into their own clothes until just prior to them leaving the centre at the end of each day. Laminated signs were also put on the exit doors of intervention child-care buildings to remind staff to ensure all children were dressed in study clothing before going outdoors.  Compliance in intervention centres was observed and recorded when collecting dirty garments for laundering twice per week and also by monitoring weekly laundry volumes at these centres. 

Parents of intervention children were also educated about the correct fit and use of the study clothing used in the daycare setting. A UPF 50-plus legionnaire hat and high-UPF swimwear (long-sleeved UPF 40 nylon taslon shirt and commercially available UPF 50-plus Lycra (nylon elastane) suit with long sleeves with either full or knee-length legs) was given to each child attending an intervention centre to use when swimming at home or places other than daycare  (issued at time of recruitment and annually thereafter for 3 years at the beginning of Summer). Home use of sun-protective garments (including the sun-protective swimwear given to intervention children) was unable to be monitored by direct observation. Consequently, this was achieved by including relevant questions in the self-administered sun exposure questionnaire completed annually by the parents of participating children for the duration of the intervention (3+ years).

The 12 daycare centres assigned to the control group did not receive sun-protective clothing.  Likewise the children attending the control daycare centres received no sun-protective clothing for daycare or home use, and continued to receive the usual level of sun-protection provided by the daycare centre they attended for the duration of the study. To prevent contamination of the control population, the study garments were manufactured for the study only.

Similar to children in the intervention group, control children were examined for melanocytic naevi at baseline and annually thereafter for 3+ years, or until they were ready to start school or leave the centre for other reasons (relocating etc).

ACTRN12617000655347,Dynamic and static functional imaging and morphological imaging in Neuroendocrine Tumour (NET) with known liver metastases.,"Each participant will receive a Ga-68-DOTATATE PET/MR and PET/CT Scan at Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF) on the same day.  

Initial PET-MRI Scan
After emptying your bladder, a qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will ask you to lie on the scanner bed. They will insert a tube into your vein and inject a radioactive substance called Ga-68-DOTATATE as well as a special dye called contrast.  
The scan involves lying flat with knees supported and arms resting by your side. You will be scanned from the top of your head to the middle of your thighs.  The scan time for the PET-MRI will be approximately 45 minutes. During this time the MR part of the scanner will make buzzing or knocking noises as it generates different kinds of images.

PET-CT Scan
You will be asked empty your bladder again and walk to the PET-CT scanner in the room next door. The PET-CT scan involves lying flat and takes approximately 30 minutes to scan you from the top of your head to the middle of your thighs. 

Final PET-MRI Scan
After the PET-CT Scan, you will be asked to walk back to the PET-MRI scanner where a final PET-MRI will be performed. This scan will not require any further injections. This scan will go from the top of your head to the middle of your thighs and should take approximately 30 minutes. This scan is performed to directly compare the PET-CT images to the PET-MRI images.

ACTRN12617000679381,Magnet Resonance to Manage Breast Disease,"You will need to return a signed consent form prior to participation. Upon return of the consent form you will be asked to participate in the following;

If you are scheduled for surgery;
A biopsy or a small piece of tissue will be collected by your surgeon prior to surgery for the purpose of this study.  This tissue will be examined under Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy within hours of sample collection.  After your biopsy, you will also be provided an appointment time at the imaging facility closest to you to complete a MRI and MRS of your breasts.

If you are a volunteer who is identified as carriers of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutations;
If you have an unconfirmed BRCA genetic status, but identify as potentially possessing the gene mutation, due to your family history, you will be asked to provide blood for analysis. Blood collection will be completed with either the relevant hospitals blood collection services or at the Clinical Research Facility. The amount of blood collected for BRCA genetic testing is 16mls.

For those participants who have a confirmed BRCA1 or 2 mutation you will then be provided an appointment time at the imaging facility closest to you to complete a MRI and MRS of your breasts. Along with your regular clinician, the study will provide yearly follow up MRI/MRS imaging for further monitoring for the entirety of the study. The number of follow up appointments will be determined by factors such as what time point you enrolled into the study and how close your enrolment is to the closure of the study.

NB: If abnormalities in the tissue are detected, your referring doctor will be notified and you may require a biopsy.


If you are a healthy volunteer or do not carry the gene(s) or have not been diagnosed with breast cancer;
If you have an unconfirmed BRCA genetic status, you will be asked to provide blood for analysis. Blood collection will be completed with either the relevant hospitals blood collection services or at the Clinical Research Facility. The amount of blood collected for BRCA genetic testing is 16ml. 

Once confirmed that you do not carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, you will then be provided an appointment time at the imaging facility closest to you to complete a MRI and MRS of your breasts.

If you are confirmed to be eligible to proceed on to have the imaging of your breast then the research nurse will arrange an appointment visit for you at one of the following facilities: 
 
-Herston Imaging Research Facility, Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital campus, Bowen Bridge Road, Herston
-Princess Alexandra Hospital Medical Imaging Department, Ipswich Road, Wolloongabba
-Hunter Medical Research Institute Imaging Centre, John Hunter Hospital campus Newcastle, Lookout Road, Newcastle 

During your visit to the imaging facility you will be required to undergo two non-invasive imaging procedures with a clinical scanner used for routine testing. Your two scan procedures will be done in a single visit on the same day with a short break in between. 

For the 1st MRS scan you will require to lie in the scanner for approximately 40 minutes. During this scan images of your breast and information on its chemistry will be obtained.

The 2nd MRI scan is a functional MRI and will assess the blood flow in different areas of your breast. This scan will take approximately 45 minutes. These are additional MR scans which you would not be undergoing unless you were part of the study.

As it is unknown how pregnancy may affect chemical changes, pregnant females cannot participate in this study. So if you are a female participant of child bearing potential and you suspect you may have become pregnant prior to attending for your imaging appointment you will be asked to contact the research nurse who will arrange for you to have a urine pregnancy test.  

The major discomforts of an MRI are that the scanner is noisy. You will be offered earphones to reduce the noise. Some people may experience symptoms of claustrophobia from lying in a confined space. Should  you  feel discomfort or become  distressed  while  lying  in  the  MR  scanner  the  healthcare specialist working with you at that time will provide information and advice regarding additional support and/or referral for your particular concerns. You can signal at any time that you wish to be stop the scan and the healthcare specialist will stop the scan and assist you.

ACTRN12617000691347,The Melanoma Genomics Managing Your Risk Study: examining the impact of personal melanoma genomic risk information on prevention behaviours in the general population,"Participants randomly allocated to the intervention arm will receive:
1.	A mailed saliva collection kit for subsequent DNA extraction and genotyping.
2.	Personal genetic risk of melanoma information. About 2-3 months after providing a saliva sample, participants will receive their genetic risk information in a hardcopy booklet sent via postal mail. The booklet, developed as part of our pilot trial (ACTRN12615000356561), presents and describes participants individual genetic risk of melanoma using evidence-based risk communication strategies, such as numerical and visual presentations of lifetime absolute risk. Participants reported high satisfaction with the genetic risk booklet in the pilot trial, and we have made minor modifications to enhance clarity for participants in the Managing Your Risk Study. The risk information includes:  
*An absolute risk percentage showing their remaining lifetime risk of developing melanoma. For example, our pilot study observed remaining lifetime genomic risk estimates of up to 20% but the average risk was around 2-4%.
* A risk level: higher than average = top 25% of genomic risk, average = middle 50%, lower than average = bottom 25%; based on quartile cut-points within each age, sex and state strata. 
The genetic risk booklet also contains simple explanatory information about how a persons risk is calculated, and what they can do to reduce their risk. 
3.	A telephone call from the study genetic counsellor. The genetic counsellor will contact all participants in the intervention arm within two-weeks after their genetic risk information is sent via postal mail. The purpose of the phone call is to confirm receipt of the booklet and to answer any potential questions. We expect the phone call will last approximately 10 minutes, depending on the number of questions or discussion points raised by participants. 
4.	An educational booklet on melanoma preventive behaviours and skin examinations. The educational booklet, developed for our pilot trial (ACTRN12615000356561), is based on SunSmart campaign resources. It includes information on risk factors for melanoma and other skin cancers, recommendations for optimal sun exposure and sun protection behaviours, information about skin examinations including an online video showing step-by-step skin self-examination, and information about Vitamin D. Educational materials are widely used by the Australian general public and, as such, are considered standard care. In the pilot trial, this educational booklet was rated highly (more than 8 out of 10) in terms of satisfaction by participants.

All participants will undergo a diagnostic endoscopic examination (standard of practice) using a gastroscope with an outer diameter of 9.2mm (Olympus GIF-H190, Olympus Corp, Tokyo), at Day Surgery St Goerge Hospital. Sedation is administered by anaesthesiologists using fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol. 

Participants allocated to the treatment arm will receive a series of endoscopic dilatations at of the pharyngo-oesophageal junction at the time endoscopy. Endoscopic dilatations are performed using bougie dilators (Savary-Gilliard, Wilson-Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, NC, USA). The selection of initial dilator size is based on an estimated lumen diameter from endoscopic view as determined by experienced gastroenterologist consultants. Dilators are passed sequentially in increments of 1mm diameter with periodic inspection following some or all dilator passages until one or more of the following is reached: 1) mucosal tear identified upon re-inspection, or 2) a maximal dilator diameter of 16mm is passed. Based on our pilot data [Paramsohthy, S et al. Gastroenterology 2012 suppl), a median of 3 dilatations per patient was necessary to achieve an adequate clinical response. Hence, patients are re-scheduled for repeat dilatation at 2 weekly intervals until 1) satisfactory clinical response is achieved on global assessment; or 2) a maximal dilator of 16mm is passed; or 3) further increment in dilator size is considered unsafe. 

Participants allocated to placebo arm will receive no endoscopic dilatation.

ACTRN12617000714381,A randomised trial of nonselective versus selective adjuvant therapy in high risk apparent stage 1 endometrial cancer.,"STATEC is testing the use of a surgical procedure called lymphadenectomy (or lymph gland removal) to help guide further treatment in women with endometrial (womb) cancer.   In patients who undergo lymph gland removal, the results of the lymph gland removal (e.g. node negative or node positive) will be used to select further (adjuvant) treatment.
Patients will be randomised to one of the following two arms, either prior to surgery or following hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO):
Group 1: Randomised treatment will be hysterectomy and BSO, plus lymphadenectomy. Patients randomised prior to hysterectomy and BSO will receive the lymphadenectomy as part of the same operation as the hysterectomy and BSO.  Patients randomised after hysterectomy and BSO will receive the lymphadenectomy as a separate operation. Adjuvant treatment will then be determined by lymph node status. Node positive patients will receive adjuvant treatment to include chemotherapy with or without external radiotherapy, while node negative patients will receive brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy) only.
Group 2: Randomised treatment will be a hysterectomy and BSO without lymphadenectomy. Patients randomised after hysterectomy and BSO will receive no further surgery. Patients will then receive adjuvant treatment to include chemotherapy with or without external radiotherapy.

ACTRN12617000788370p,personalised pelvic floor Muscle Training for Urinary incontinence after Prostatectomy,"(i) Urethral muscle training - comprehensive individualized program focused on training the striated muscles that pressurize the urethra. Exercise relies on the principles of motor skill training with trans-perineal ultrasound imaging for assessment (during voluntary contraction, coughing and a 60-s maximal contraction) and biofeedback. Training is based on assessment outcomes and commences with skill acquisition (training of optimal muscle recruitment patterns to increase urethral pressure). A key focus is the striated urethral sphincter, but with tailoring to include the other muscles, based on the assessment. Treatment is progressed using principles of exercise physiology according to a decision tool developed with the Clinical Advisory Committee. Based on the assessed needs and deficits of the patient, progression includes; training of sustained holding to enhance adaptation of striated muscles to provide ongoing maintenance of continence, training of ballistic efforts for episodes of increased bladder pressure (lifting, coughing, etc), skill development for functional training into broad range of activities including training with increasing bladder volumes, and high performance training for demanding tasks including strength training. Daily home exercise to practice tasks taught in each session is encouraged and monitored.  

Participants in Urethral training and Conventional training (described below) groups will attend up to 10 sessions of face-to-face pelvic floor muscle training supervised by a physiotherapist. The number of sessions will be determined by the need for further training at the discretion of the treating physiotherapist or when the participant meets the criteria for continence on the home 24 hour pad test. Each session will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants will attend a session 1-2 weeks prior to surgery. Participants will commence training before surgery. They will attend up to 9 sessions post-surgery, 1 week apart, commencing on catheter removal (~2 weeks post-surgery). Adherence to treatment (home-based exercises) in both groups will be recorded using a daily diary which will be inspected by the physiotherapist at each face-to-face treatment session. Participants in both training groups will be instructed to perform their home-based exercise program up to 3 times per day initially, but more frequently when exercise becomes more functional. For participants in the Urethral muscle training group, home exercises will involve practice of the tasks provided by their physiotherapist at the previous visit based on individualized assessment. For participants in the Conventional training program, participants will perform brief 6-s maximal voluntary contractions and the number of repetitions will be determined/progressed by the physiotherapist at each visit. Adherence to exercise will be encouraged and monitored using a smart phone application.

ACTRN12617000806369,A pilot study evaluating focal irreversible electroporation as treatment for participants with recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy.,"The NanoKnife (Registered Trademark) System with six outputs is indicated for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It has FDA approval [510(k) Number: K080376]. Intended use in this study is to treat radio-recurrent prostate cancer. 
Patients will receive general anaesthesia, followed by intravenous muscle paralysis, a single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis and the insertion of an indwelling urethral catheter. 
Up to 6 Needle-like electrode probes are then placed around the tumour using transrectal ultrasound for guidance during the insertion through the perineum with a 5x5 mm brachytherapy template grid.. The placement of the electrodes aims for focal ablation of the tumour.  This will include a circumferential safety margin of at least 5mm whilst still being mindful of nearby vital structures. Technical considerations include spacing of the electrodes (required to be 10mm to 20mm apart), and an average electrode exposure length per needle of 15mm. The number of electrodes required for each patient is dependent on the volume of tissue to be ablated and will be determined by the treating clinician before the procedure. 
The Nanoknife system is then programmed to start with 10 pulses per electrode-pair with pulse length set to 90 microseconds and intensity of 1500 V per cm. Treatment delivery is then automatically calculated by the system on the basis of the number of electrodes inserted, the respective distances between each electrode and the active electrode length to obtain an optimal electrical field of between 20A and 40A. If the current does not reach the minimum of 20 amps between one or more electrode-pairs, the voltage will have to be increased with 10 percent for that particular electrode-pair. Following the initial 10 pulses, the subsequent 80 pulses will be delivered to achieve a total of 90 pulses.
The total procedure time is estimated to be 1 hour, starting with the administration of general anaesthesia. The actual Nanoknife procedure will take around 30min. 
A Urologist, the coordinating investigator (CI), will perform the procedure once as day surgery at St Vincents Private Hospital. The CI has a great expertise in the treatment of prostate cancer in Australia and has 4 years experience conducting the procedure, primarily in the setting of primary prostate cancer.
Adherence of the intervention is assessed by the treating Urologist. In addition a second medical doctor or nurse is present during the procedure to ensure settings and adjustments are correctly entered in the Nanoknife system. A procedural template will be filled out during the procedure to help with accurate recording of all settings and adjustments made during procedure.",CODE: Treatment: Devices::||::CODE: Treatment: Surgery,"1.

Attention will be paid to ensure the whole transformation zone and lesion are seen and that there is no colposcopic evidence of glandular or invasive disease.  If a lesion persists, representative biopsies must be taken, two if possible and one from each quadrant in larger lesions.  If the colposcopy is normal, we encourage the taking of a biopsy from the transformation zone in the previously affected area.

Treatment is indicated if the patient becomes symptomatic, there is colposcopic or cytological suspicion of invasive or glandular disease, the colposcopy is unsatisfactory and abnormal cytology persists, the histology is reported as invasive or glandular disease, the patient requests treatment, turns 25 years old without demonstrating persistent regression, or is unable to attend further follow up and the lesion persists.  If treatment is performed a trial Completion Form is filled in and the patient subsequently managed as per normal practice.

If CIN2 or 3 persists, or cytology is reported as ASCH or HSIL, colposcopy should be repeated at 6 monthly intervals to 2 years.  If CIN2 or 3, or ASCH or HSIL cytology persists, at this point, the patient should be treated.  At this point, a trial Completion form is filled in.

- CIN 3 colposcopy but normal/low grade cytology, normal/low grade histology
- if a lesion is present and a biopsy not taken 
- if cytology is ASCH or worse or 
- a smear is not taken or unsatisfactory

If regression is documented women must have a follow-up at 6 months with;
- a repeat colposcopy and smear and
- a biopsy if a lesion is present 

If following the repeat colposcopy, criteria for regression is again met, the lesion has demonstrated persistent regression.

Following persistent regression and after discussion between the colposcopist and the woman, the patient may be discharged from the colposcopy clinic.  If this is the case, a trial Completion Form is filled and follow-up is then as per National Cervical Screening Programme (NCSP) guidelines following high grade abnormality with a smear in 6 months (by primary smear taker).  If the woman is not discharged from colposcopy clinic, a repeat colposcopy occurs at 6-12 months and completion form is filled at follow-up visit 24 months following initial biopsy.  Management should be based on the NCSP guidelines.

If regression is demonstrated at the 24 month follow up for the first time, the colposcopist will discuss either immediate treatment or follow up at 6 months.  However at this point, a trial Completion form will be filled in, and the patient subsequent management should be based on the results of this colposcopy and the NCSP guidelines.

ACTRN12617000975392,Does an integrative Tai Chi program affect outcomes for breast cancer patients undergoing cancer therapy?,"For those participants randomized to the intervention group, they will receive an integrative Tai Chi (ANITA) program that consists of peer support, health education, and Tai Chi Ruler exercise, in addition to breast cancer conventional treatments as described below, This program will run from 4 weeks post-surgery through to participants breast cancer treatments.

1) Peer support groups 
After group allocation, participants in the intervention group will be invited to join peer support groups hosted by the Otago/Southland Division of the New Zealand Cancer Society. This well-established group is held once per month, being made up of breast cancer patients who have completed cancer therapy and the ones undergoing treatment. The group is formed to be an interactive environment, and provides support and understanding for participants. Furthermore, it serves as a regular social activity and networking opportunity among breast cancer patients.

2) Health education seminars
Seminars will provide participants knowledge for effective self-care and improving quality of life. These seminars will be held every two months at the Otago/Southland Division of the New Zealand Cancer Society, prior to the routine peer support groups. Each seminar will last for 40 minutes, and be delivered by guest speakers with different, relevant expertise such as general practitioner, nutritionist, physiotherapist, and psychotherapist. These sessions will provide participants and their families with knowledge on post-surgery self-care, nutrition, sleep and fatigue, stress management, and social support.

3) Tai Chi Ruler exercise
The 24-weeks exercise program consists of a 12-week instructor-led Tai Chi Ruler class, followed by a 12-week Tai Chi Ruler home-based practice. Tai Chi Ruler is selected as the exercise form as it is easier to learn for beginners than the longer and more complex traditional forms. For the first 12 weeks, participants will be advised to attend a group-based Tai Chi Ruler exercise class at the School of Physiotherapy, twice per week. Class times will be decided at the participants convenience to accommodate work and/or treatment schedules, and cohort classes will be provided if necessary. Classes will be instructed by a trained Tai Chi instructor with two years experience of leading Tai Chi classes in people with chronic health issues and post-surgery. Exercise protocol for the Tai Chi program will be developed by reviewing previous Tai Chi studies (for breast cancer survivors), and through consultation with an experienced Tai Chi expert at the School of Physiotherapy. Each class will take 60 minutes, consisting of a 15-minute warm-up, 35-minutes of Tai Chi Ruler movements, and a 10-minute cool-down. Participants will be informed that all movements can be performed in a sitting position if necessary; modifications will be made for individuals with range of motion limitations.

On completion of the classes, each participant will receive a CD containing practice music of the Tai Chi Ruler exercise to facilitate their home practice. Participants will be asked to practice Tai Chi Ruler exercise at home (at least) twice per week for 12 weeks; practice will follow the same procedure of the classes. Adherence with the home practice will be captured using a structured activity logbook provided to participants at discharge. Participants are asked to complete the logbooks, and return these logbooks to the blinded research assistant by post on completion of the 12-weeks Tai Chi Ruler home practice. The Tai Chi instructor will follow-up participants by emails or phone calls every two weeks, reinforce the value of exercise adherence, and answer any queries and concerns participants may have.",CODE: Rehabilitation,"Participants will be eligible to participate in this trial if they are: (1) patients diagnosed with breast cancer of stage I, II, or III; (2) over 4 weeks since completing surgical treatment; (3) waiting for, or currently undergoing adjunct cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or hormonal therapy; (4) judged as either Grade 0 or 1 of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; (5) willing to be randomized to and to attend the ANITA program at the School of Physiotherapy; (6) able to read and communicate in English.","Participants are excluded from participation in this trial if they have: (1) regular practice of Tai Chi, qigong, or yoga within the past 3 months; (2) a history of health conditions precluding participation in an exercise regime (e.g. severe cardiovascular, liver, or kidney diseases, and severe dementia)."

Olaparib will be administered for 28 days before starting durvalumab on day 1 of cycle 2. Patients will receive a fixed dose of 1500 mg durvalumab via IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 13 cycles (28 day cycles). Patients will be treated until they are no longer deriving benefit in the opinion of the treating clinician or the patient. Treatment will stop short of the 13 cycles if there is disease progression, intolerable toxicity or patient withdrawal for another reason.

Retreatment with durvalumab is allowed (once only) for patients meeting the retreatment criteria below. The same treatment guidelines followed during the initial 13-cycle treatment period will be followed during the retreatment period, including the same dose and frequency of treatments and the same Schedule of Assessments.

Patients who complete 13 cycles of treatment and achieve disease control (ie, CR, PR, or SD) through to the end of this treatment period may restart treatment with durvalumab upon evidence of progression, with or without confirmation according to RECIST 1.1.

Before restarting treatment with durvalumab, the Investigator must ensure that the patient:

a)	Does not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate treatment will not further benefit the patient

b)	Still fulfils the eligibility criteria for treatment, including consenting to restart durvalumab

c)	Has not received an intervening systemic anticancer therapy after their assigned treatment discontinuation.

d)	Has had a baseline tumor assessment within 28 days of restarting durvalumab. All further scans will take place 8 weekly from the date of first treatment.

Treatment through progression is at the Investigators discretion, and the Investigator must ensure that patients do not have any significant, unacceptable, or irreversible toxicities that indicate that continuing treatment will not further benefit the patient.

Patients who the Investigator determines may not continue treatment will enter follow-up.

Total treatment on this study will be approximately two years with further treatment to be discussed with the treating clinician.

Participating institutions will maintain a record of drug dispensed for each patient and record any unused drug returned to the pharmacy.

Clinicians  will  deliver propofol via weight-based technique (mg/kg/hour) or via target controlled infusion models (TCI; µg/ml  effect  or  plasma  concentration)  or  titrate  volatile  anaesthesia  at  a  minimum  alveolar concentration (MAC) to attain BIS values in the range of 40-60. FiO2 will be maintained at 40% following induction and the admixture with air titrated to maintain SpO2 >95%.

The volatile anaesthetics to be used in this study are Sevoflurane, Isoflurane and Desflurane. They are all volatile anaesthetics approved for clinical use in Australia and used routinely for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Volatile anaesthetic dose is titrated by the treating anaesthetist in response to level of sedation, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and Bispectoral index monitoring, using a vaporiser connected to an anaesthetic circuit. 

Anaesthetists are trained to use both intravenous and inhaled anaesthetic techniques. The decision to use one technique over another is based on multitude of patient, anaesthetic and surgical factors. These include, but are not limited to: patient preference, allergy or contraindication to an agent, history of severe postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical status of patient at time of surgery, availability of equipment to perform TIVA, preference of treating anaesthetist, type, duration and location of surgery.

ACTRN12617001070325,A pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a non-pharmacological intervention to prevent delirium for people with advanced cancer in hospital.,"Routine delirium screening and diagnostic assessment and a multi-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention intervention will be implemented in four oncology/palliative care inpatient units. 

Bedside nurses will complete the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC) for all patients at admission and at the end of every shift. Within 24 hours of the patient assessed as having their first NuDESC score >2, the treating physician, will apply Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for delirium, operationalised by the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-1998 (DRS-R-98). The DRS-R-98 will be completed by either a physician or nurse trained in its use. These processes are currently not routine in the setting and therefore are an addition to usual care.

The multi-component non-pharmacological delirium prevention intervention has five care domains and will be delivered to all patients from admission until discharge or death by members of the interdisciplinary team and volunteers. The domains and their associated strategies are: 
1. Preserve natural sleep: Offer ear plugs to patients who have low risk of falls; Offer eye shades to patients who have low risk of falls; Reduce noise outside patient rooms during 21:00-06:00; Normal day-night variation in room and unit lighting; Exposure to natural light during daylight hours; Schedule care activities to allow uninterrupted sleep during the night; Avoid caffeine after 4pm.
2. Maintain optimal sensory perception: Assess hearing; Assist with and re-inforce use of hearing aids and special communication techniques; Ear wax clearing as needed; Assess need for visual aids (glasses, magnifying lenses); If needed, ask family to provide for the patient; Assist with and reinforce use of visual aids.
 3. Optimise hydration; Encourage oral fluids; Physical assistance with drinks and meals, as required; Drinking aids, as required; Be alert and respond to reversible causes of poor oral intake within 24 hours e.g. nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, sore mouth.
4. Promote communication, orientation and cognition; Interpreter and translation for people with NESB; Greet the patient by name; Introduce self by name and role; Refer to person, time and place when talking with the patient; Time aids in room e.g. watch, personal or wall clock; wall, desk or electronic calendar; Update in-room whiteboards daily with date, day, place, reason for admission, team member names, schedule; Minimise number of transfers to other beds or rooms within the unit; Discuss current events with the patient; Encourage the patient to reminisce and talk; Encourage the patient to engage in cognitively stimulating activities.
5. Optimise mobility;Minimise use of tethers e.g. intravenous line, indwelling catheter, drain, oxygen; 	Minimise use of physical restraints e.g. bed rails, lock-in chair tables, vest restraints, limb restraints; Encourage and/or assist the patient to undertake physical activity throughout the day according to their capacity (Level 0: No activity planned (state reason), 	Level 1: Active range of movement exercises in bed and/or sitting position in bed (e.g. regular bed adjustment, assistance with re-positioning); Level 2: Assistance to sit on the side of the bed; Level 3: Sitting out of bed in a chair, standing, Level 4: Walking (marching in place, independent or assisted walking around room and unit), Level 5: Attend inpatient gym, walking outside of unit.
6. Family partnership: Ask family about the patients baseline cognition; Inform the patient and family about delirium risk; Inform the patient and family about delirium prevention strategies and invite participation.

Site teams will tailor the delivery of the intervention according to their human, material and environmental resources and capabilities. The intervention will be implemented at a site level and all patients with advanced cancer admitted to a participating site during the study period will be included in de-identified data collection, regardless of the intervention strategies received. The intervention will be embedded into routine daily clinical practice and tailored to each patients needs and preferences, using usual procedures of assessment and consent for clinical interventions. For example, while all patients will be assessed on admission for hearing and vision impairment, only those who require a sensory aid will receive that intervention. Likewise, family caregivers will be encouraged to be partners in care according to their capacity. Patients can therefore choose to opt-out of participating in any of the intervention elements; substitute decision makers may also opt out for patients with a cognitive impairment; and family caregivers can choose to not be involved in the family partnership domain. The intervention phase will continue until data is collected for 40 patients overall with at least 20 in the intervention sites.

Engagement of site interdisciplinary teams will be guided by Michies Behaviour Change Wheel. Education and training of site team members relevant to delirium screening, diagnostic and non-pharmacological prevention will be interdisciplinary and based on Biggs educational model. Frequency, duration and mode of administration of education and training will be determined prior to implementation of delirium screening, diagnosis and prevention strategies in collaboration with participating sites, then standardised for each. Education and training will take place during a two month training interval prior to the commencement of data collection. Staff and volunteer training will be evaluated through feedback about training and audit of delirium measure completion prior to commencement of data collection at each site.

Adherence and fidelity to the intervention are also study outcomes of this pilot trial. Site research nurses will collect data from the medical record on adherence to each strategy within the multicomponent delirium prevention intervention and record these in the case report form (CRF). If the patient received the strategy in the 24-hour period, a Yes will be recorded. If the patient does not receive the intervention, a No will be recorded, as will the reason according to the following categories: 
	Not required
	Patient choice
	Not clinically appropriate 
	Not possible with current resources

ACTRN12617001102369,Health Technology Assessment of the Clarity Autoscan system: Motion correction and margin reduction in the radiation therapy treatment of prostate cancer,"The Clarity Autoscan ultrasound system allows radiation therapists to track the position of the prostate in real time by the application of an ultrasound probe against the perineum during treatment delivery daily. An alert is generated if the prostate moves beyond a pre-specified parameter, allowing the radiation therapist to suspend treatment and take
corrective action to ensure accuracy is maintained. The Clarity Autoscan system is non-invasive and does not utilise any additional radiation. In this study, all patients (both control and intervention groups) will have fiducial markers inserted as per standard practice, in addition to the Clarity Autoscan monitoring. 

In the radiation therapy treatment of the prostate with Clarity Autoscan, the margin around the prostate for treatment delivery will be reduced to 5mm (with 3mm in the posterior). The prostate shall be monitored for any motion using ultrasound by qualified radiation therapists during treatment delivery, and if it moves greater than the defined margin (i.e. 5mm, with 3mm in the posterior), the treatment will be paused and the patient position corrected for.

ACTRN12617001115325,Comparing Pre-prostatectomy and Post-prostatectomy Exercise Intervention for Prostate Cancer Patients.,"A randomized controlled trial study design will be used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of a 6- week comprehensive individually supervised pre-surgical exercise program, with assessments conducted at Edith Cowan University Exercise Medicine Institute (EMRI). The exercise group (PresurgEx) will exercise prior to surgery and receive usual care after surgery. The delay-exercise usual care control group (Delay) will only be provided with the current usual care prior to surgery and offered 6 weeks of exercise post-surgery. Testing will be conducted at baseline, pre-surgery, 6 weeks post-surgery (6PS), and 12 weeks post-surgery (12PS). In addition, a 24-hr pad test will be undertaken after discharge from hospital. The Delay group will start exercise after 6PS. The intervention involves resistance (chest press, leg press, seated row, leg curls, leg extension, bicep curls, and calf raises) and aerobic training (Treadmill) undertaken thrice weekly in an exercise setting. Patients will be invited to participate by their attending specialists, who are part of this project. This replicates an existing collaboration between EMRI and the urologist at the participating hospitals. Information about the program will be provided and those that express interest will be contacted by the research team. A sample size calculation (2-tailed, alpha = 0.05 and power = 95%) based on expected effect size differences in muscle strength reported in previous studies and using G*Power indicated that each group requires a sample of 16 participants. It is estimated that we will be able to recruit approximately 20 participants per group (factoring in a 30% attrition rate) over a one year period. The eligibility criteria to participate includes: localised PCa; at least seven weeks between diagnosis of cancer and surgery date; absence of any acute illness or any musculoskeletal, cardiovascular or neurological disorder that could inhibit the ability to walk 400m unassisted and undertake upper- and lower-body exercise; medically cleared by their physician; and written consent.

Exercise intervention
Each supervised exercise session will be ~90 minutes in duration. Sessions will commence with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of a moderate level of aerobic exercise (~60% heart rate maximum (HRmax)), as well as stretching exercises of the major muscle groups. This will be followed by a previously used resistance-training regime targeting upper- and lower-limb exercises. Progression of resistance exercise will follow guidelines previously outlined. Specifically, training phases were: week 1  2 (two sets 12 repetition maximum (RM)), week 3 (three sets of 10 RM), week 4  5 (three sets of 8 RM), and week 6 (four sets of 6 RM). This will be followed by 15 minutes of exercises focusing on the trunk stabilising muscles which includes three sets of three different exercises [planks (anterior abdominals), reverse bridge on Swiss ball (back extensors) and side planks (oblique abdominals)] with a rest of 30 to 60 seconds between sets. Finally the session will conclude with 20 minutes of aerobic exercise at 60  80% (intensity) of the estimated HRmax (220  age in years) followed by a 5-minute cool-down. All sessions will be conducted by an accredited exercise physiologist (RA) to ensure safety and adherence (number of sessions attended, number of sessions missed will be compiled).

ACTRN12617001181392,"A Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study of the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of A-337 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors","The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add 3
additional patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied
for dose escalation and MTD determination. 
A DLT is defined as a toxicity according to Section 7.1.1 (d) that occurs during the DLT
assessment window (Cycle 1, 4-week treatment period plus 2-week rest period) and
determined by the investigator or by the Sponsor to have a reasonable possibility of
being related to A-337.
Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the maximum dose at which no more
than one of six evaluable patients in a single cohort experiences a DLT in the first cycle
(Cycle 1, 4-week treatment period plus 2-week rest period).
This trial will evaluate six adaptive dose levels: 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.6 µg/kg. For Cohort 1, patients will receive a dose of 0.15 µg/kg of A-337 twice (on day 1 and day 4) via IV infusion at 6-hour constant rate during the first week, followed by 3 weeks treatment with A-337 at 0.15 µg/kg with 6-hour IV infusions twice weekly. For all subsequent cohorts, patients will receive a conditioning dose of 0.3 µg/kg of A-337 twice (on day 1 and day 4) via IV infusion at 6-hour constant rate during the first week, followed by 3 weeks
treatment with A-337 at one of the following dose levels (0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.6
µg/kg) with 6-hour IV infusions twice weekly. Dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg
will be given 1 hour prior to the first conditioning dose of A-337 and the first rampup
dose (0.15 µg/kg to 3.6 µg/kg). Administration of Dexamethasone on subsequent
doses is given at either 20 mg or 10 mg based on clinical judgement regarding the potential toxicity of A-337. After completion of the dose escalation, up to 12 patients
may be enrolled in cohorts at dose levels up to the MTD to obtain additional
information on the safety, PK, and PD of monotherapy A-337. Dexamethasone can be administered as either oral or intravenous infusion at the discretion of the investigator.
3+3 Rules for Dose Escalation:
A minimum of 3 patients will be enrolled and observed for toxicity in each dose
cohort. If the 3 patients initially enrolled in a dose cohort complete the DLT
assessment window (Cycle 1, 4-week treatment period plus 2-week rest) without
experiencing a DLT, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next higher dose level.
There will be a minimum for 72 hours between patients being dosed in each cohort.
If 1 of the initial 3 patients enrolled at any dose level experiences a DLT during the
DLT assessment window, additional patients will be enrolled at that dose level for a
minimum of 6 evaluable for DLT. If a DLT is observed in 1 of the 6 evaluable patients
at this dose level, dose escalation will proceed to the next pre-defined dose level. If DLTs are observed in 2 or more of the 6 evaluable patients at a given dose level, the
dose escalation will be halted. If this dose level is > or equal to 50% higher than the previous dose level, an intermediate dose level may be evaluated for toxicity in the same manner as described above. If the dose level is < 50% higher than the previous dose level,
additional patients will be enrolled at the previous dose level, if necessary, to provide a
minimum of 6 evaluable patients.
Dose escalation beyond 3.6 µg/kg will be determined jointly by investigators and
sponsor based on the clinical safety, pharmacokinetic, and preliminary efficacy data.
There will be a minimum for 72 hours between patients being dosed in each cohort.
Each treatment cycle will be composed of a 4-week treatment period (the first week
with the conditioning doses of 0.15 µg/kg (Cohort 1) 0.3 µg/kg (Cohorts 2-6) on Day
1 and Day 4, 3 weeks with the ramp-up doses from 0.15 to 3.6 µg/kg on Day 1 and

Trifluridine/tipiracil will be administered orally (PO) twice a day (BD) on Days 1-5 of every 14 day cycle. Trifluridine/tipiracil will be supplied as 15 mg (comprising 15 mg trifluridine/6.14 mg tipiracil) and 20 mg (comprising 20 mg trifluridine/8.19mg tipiracil)  immediate-release film-coated tablets and the number of tablets needed to achieve the assigned dose will be determined according to the patients body surface area.
Dosing of trifluridine/tipiracil in the dose escalation phase (phase Ib) will be as follows:

Dose Level	Trifluridine/tipiracil
 1 (starting dose)	25 mg/m2 orally, BD
 2	                  30 mg/m2 orally, BD
 3	                  35 mg/m2 orally, BD

The dose escalation phase (phase Ib) will recruit participants who have received and failed one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). It is anticipated that this phase of the study will take 6 months to complete.
The maximum (MTD) will be assessed during the dose escalation phase, where participants will be enrolled in cohorts. Each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 newly enrolled evaluable patients.  If there is no dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first 3 patients within a cohort, a new cohort at the next dose level will commence. 
If safety data show one patient in a cohort experiencing a DLT, then the cohort will be increased to a maximum of six evaluable patients. If no more than one of the six patients experiences a DLT, then the next dose level may be evaluated. If two or more patients entered in any cohort experience a DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded, and the previous dose level will be considered the MTD. If no dose level has 2 or more DLT`s, then dose level 3 will be considered the MTD. A minimum of 6 evaluable patients will be treated at the dose level before the dose can be declared as the MTD and enrolment into the phase II component can begin.
Cohorts may also be expanded at any dose level to further assess safety parameters as required. If a dose level is opened and patients in the previous cohort subsequently develop unexpected toxicities the cohort will be closed and the previous cohort will be re-assessed with further patients enrolled into the previous cohort as required. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of tipiracil/trifluridine will be the dose level administered in the expansion phase (phase II). The expansion phase (phase II) will recruit participants that have received no prior treatment for mCRC, and is anticipated to take up to 18 months to complete.
Treatment will continue until disease progression or withdrawal criteria are met.

An information sheet will be provided, and each subject will be given the opportunity to seek medical advice or to discuss the study with friends or family prior to involvement. Each volunteer will give written, informed consent, in accordance with the attached form, and the subjects will be free to withdraw from the study at any time.
All patients who are referred to the principle investigator for EUS FNA will be seen in outpatient clinic for the procedure and will also be approached for the current study.  All patients will be given information about the study and the agreement of participation in the study will be clarified on the day of the procedure. The patients will have the opportunity to raise any issues with the study by the provided phone number or in person on the day of procedure (prior to the procedure).
All patients will undergo standard preparation for EUS and will be kept nil per oral for 6 hours before procedure. EUS would be performed under conscious sedation or monitored anaesthesia. The lesion, including the regional vasculature, would be examined by EUS using the colour Doppler function to locate a site suitable for FNA. The lesion would then be punctured with a 19G Nitinol needle under EUS guidance. On site cytopathologic assessment would not available in any of the cases. 
Macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) would be performed by the following technique. EUS-FNA would be performed with a 19-gauge needle. The lesion is punctured and the needle is moved to and fro approximately 3-5 times within the lesion under 10cc of suction. After each pass, the needle is removed and the stylet would be introduced into the needle to extrude any aspirated material on a glass slide for inspection of the presence of a macroscopic visible core (MVC). MVC is defined as whitish or yellowish pieces of tissue with an apparent bulk. Paste-like or liquid-like specimens would not be included. The total length of the MVC is measured with a ruler before placement into a formalin bottle. When a MVC of 4mm or more is obtained, EUS-FNA is completed. If the obtained MVC is less than 4mm, then another pass of the lesion with the 19-gauge needle repeated. The procedure is repeated for a maximum of 7 passes until a MVC of 4mm or more is obtained.
Any remaining partially paste-like material after removal of MVCs would be sent in a separate formalin bottle for histology; liquid material will be fixed in alcohol and sent for cytological analysis. Adequacy of this additional cytological material would not be macroscopically assessed.
One dedicated pathologist in each hospital will evaluate the obtained samples in terms of quantity (Grade 0: scant; Grade 1: inadequate; Grade 2: adequate), quality (Grade 0: poor; Grade 1: moderate; Grade 2: good), and blood contamination (Grade 0: significant; Grade 1: moderate; Grade 2: low), and provide a pathological diagnosis.
The final diagnosis would be based on the followings:
1. Surgical specimen for resectable cases.
2. Positive FNA diagnosis for malignancy with a compatible clinical course.
3. Negative FNA diagnosis for malignancy with a lack of deterioration or spontaneous resolution on radio-logical studies with a minimum clinical follow-up time of 3 months.

All staff for this study participating in this study have been trained and understand the study protocol, and will report any adverse events to the Human Research Ethics Committee within 24 hours.

ACTRN12617001215314p,"The effectiveness of Complete Decongestive Therapy including an occupational therapy lymphoedema exercise protocol for individuals recovering from head and neck cancer treatment 

","Participants with head and neck cancer-related lymphoedema (HNCRL), attending the Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital (SCGH) will be purposively recruited for this study. Upon recruitment, participants will be asked to undertake a demographic questionnaire including questions regarding age and gender. Medical information which will be obtained will include primary tumor type, type of treatment for tumor, dates since treatment and other health professionals being seen. All participants will then undergo pre-intervention assessments (measured using the ALOHA protocol (tape measurement), lymphoedema will be graded through MD Anderson lymphoedema grading scale) and complete self-reported questionnaire ( EORTC-H&N 43). Photographs will be taken of lymphoedema for patient satisfaction. After baseline measures are taken, participants will be randomly allocated through a blocking system, to CDT protocol group or Ex protocol group. Both groups will receive SCGH usual treatment of CDT. Ex protocol group will receive an added head and neck lymphoedema specific exercise program to complete 3-5 times a day at home on top of usual care for 6 weeks. Both CDT protocol and Ex protocol will recive their therapy by the treating lymphoedema occupational therapist at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. 
Once allocated to a specific group, either Ex or CDT protocol group, the treating occupational therapist. will tell participant which arm of the study they have been allocated to. OT will then administer treatment and education about what they are expected to do at home 

The CDT protocol group will only receive the usual head and neck lymphoedema treatment provided by Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. Usual care involves one face to face CDT training session for self-administration and education techniques, including (1) self-managed manual lymph drainage (MLD); (2) education on functional movement; (3) use of compression garments (CG) to reduce swelling from treatment; (4) skin care (scar management and hydration). 
Pre-intervention evaluation, training session, and post-intervention evaluation will be performed at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital in the cancer clinic. All participants will perform self-managed- CDT at home for the duration of the study. Treating OT will educate each participant on self-managed MLD techniques. Self-managed manual lymph drainage will be performed by the participant daily to redirect lymphatic fluid from the cervical region to the bilateral axillary lymph node beds. Based on scar patterns and severity, anterior and lateral neck drainage channels will be used if scarring is absent or insignificant and posterior neck and trunk channels will be used for participants with marked scarring. Current protocol at SCGH implements exercise in the form of functional movements. Participants are directed to move their head and neck when performing functional tasks within pain and range of motion limitations. Sir Charles Gardener Hospital (SCGH) current protocol uses a commercially available Marena recovery facial mask (compression garment). Education will be provided on how to don and doff compression garment. Participants will be instructed to wear the compression garment (CG) for a minimum of two to four hours per day after completion of self-managed MLD to maintain even pressure. Participants will be instructed to wear CG as much as possible when at home including when sleeping. Participants will be advised they are not expected to wear CG away from their home. Participants will then be educated regarding skin care principles to minimise risk of infection. Education is given on ensuring the skin is kept clean, well moisturised and to avoid sunburn. Each participant is treated on individual need basis. If scars are present, the use of contact media such as silicon is applied and scar massage techniques are taught. A participant diary will be given to each participant in CDT protocol for recording time use in CG and types of exercise performed. Participant diary is expected to be filled out daily for the six-week period.

Participants allocated to intervention group will receive usual care outlined above and introduced to Ex protocol to perform daily while wearing the compression garment. The Ex protocol includes 15 exercises comprising of deep breathing, shoulder movement, neck movements (flexion; extension; lateral flexion), tongue movements, facial movements, and mouth movements with voice activation. Below is the exact Ex protocol 
1.	Deep breathing: five deep breaths, each held for a slow count of 2 
2.	Shrug shoulders up and down. Repeat five times
3.	Shrug shoulders back (to expand chest) and relax. Repeat five times
4.	Face forward, then turn head to left as far as it will go, then back to the centre and round to the right as far as it will go and back to centre. Repeat five times
5.	Facing forward, tilt head back as far as you can comfortably go and then bring chin down to chest (squashing the collar) and back to start point. Repeat five times
6.	Tilt left ear to shoulder and then right ear to shoulder. Repeat five times
7.	Shrug shoulders up and down. Repeat five times
8.	Shrug shoulders back (to expand chest) and relax. Repeat five times
9.	Poke tongue out slowly, as far as it will go, and slowly pull tongue back in. Repeat five times
10.	Mouth (whisper) vowel sounds, slowly and exaggerated = a, e, i, o, u. Repeat five times
11.	Smile (as if having portrait photo taken) and hold for 2, then relax. Repeat five times
12.	Scrunch eyes tight, hold for 2 and relax. Repeat five times
13.	Shrug shoulders up and down. Repeat five times
14.	Shrug shoulders back (to expand chest) and relax. Repeat five times
15.	Deep breathing: five deep breaths, each held for a slow count of 2
The treating lymphoedema OT will demonstrate the full ten-minute Ex program facing the participant. Each exercise will be demonstrated to ensure each participant feels comfortable performing Ex at home. The Ex protocol is to be completed 3-5 times per day at home for 6 weeks by the participant. 
A participant diary will be given to each participant in Ex protocol group and told to record time use in CG and amount of Ex performed each day. Participant diary is expected to be filled out daily for the six-week period. At the end of six weeks, all participants (CDT protocol and Ex protocol) will return to SCGH and perform post intervention evaluation. Participants will return completed diary after post evaluation. Post intervention, exercise protocol will be available to participants in CDT protocol group. 
intervention will span over a 6 week period. Participants are expected to attend 2x 1-hour sessions over the 6 week period. one at 0 weeks ( pre intervention) and 6 weeks (post intervention. 
Patient adherence will not be assessed in this trial. Education at initial appointment will be given to participant to ensure that they understand adherence is important to the study process.

All aspects of the study will be discussed with each subject during a phone interview or screening visit. An information sheet will be provided, and each subject will be given the opportunity to seek medical advice or to discuss the study with friends or family prior to involvement. Each volunteer will give written, informed consent, and the subjects will be free to withdraw from the study at any time.
Consenting patients will have the procedure under deep sedation (Propofol), administered by qualified anaesthetists.  After the lesion is evaluated by EUS, the endoscopist will perform the tissue sampling using all needles consecutively.  The order of the needle passes will be pre-determined in a randomized fashion using a computerized program. Each patient will have a single pass using the Shark Core, Acquire and ProCore needles (3 passes total).
All aspirated material will be placed in formalin (separate pots for each needle) to undergo direct histological processing (filtered through a microcassette, immersed in Ponceau S tinted neutral buffered formalin and processed as standard histological blocks).  
All patients will be observed in recovery for a minimum 2 hours following the procedure for any complications. Trained cytologists and pathologists (who are blinded to the needle type used) will assess the final processed samples from each group in order to determine the diagnosis.
In order to objectively quantify the tissue acquired from each needle, the slides will be scanned using the NanoZoomer (Hamamatsu Phototonic, Japan) and high definition images stored electronically.  Using the associated software (NDP.view2, Phototonic, Japan), the characteristics of the diagnostic tissue will be examined for the presence of tissue-core (defined as tissue showing preserved architectural integrity, in which the length of the core is at least twice of the nominal inner diameter of the used needle).  The tissue-cores will then be objectively quantified by measuring the total core surface area, length and diameter.  The quality of the specimen obtained was also assessed by measuring the surface area of diagnostic tissue in each core.

Inclusion criteria: Maori women who have not had a cervical smear screen in the last 4 years. 
Brief title
Offer of self -testing HPV swab to under-screened Maori women 

1)	Educational Intervention for clinicians and community workers
Materials - Educational material (written/presentation/teaching sessions) given to doctors, nurses, community workers by experts in HPV from research team
Who will deliver intervention -  Research team (Professor oncological gynaecology, professor Obstetrics and Gynaecology,  sexual health physician/ senior research fellow,  family physician/ researcher with expertise in womens health) will provide educational material and sessions for nurse, doctors and community workers
Mode of delivery - Educational sessions to clinicians will be offered to groups of clinicians from intervention primary care practices in small tutorial setting
Number of times intervention offered - Education sessions will be offered twice to groups of clinicians over 3 months - 2 x 1 hour sessions 
Location- Education sessions will be offered in primary care setting/clinic/local community hall

2)	Intervention for participants   under-screened Maori women offered self taken vaginal swab for HPV

Materials - Instructions and diagrams for women being offered HPV self-testing will be co-designed by research team plus input from primary health clinicians, community workers and the women themselves (focus groups) ( draft HPV information and consent is attached to ANZCTR registration form)

Procedures -Women will receive verbal, written and /or pictorial instructions from a doctor, nurse or kaiawhina (community health worker) about how to perform the HPV self-test, a self-collected vaginal sample. Women will self-collect a vaginal sample using a swab. The instructions will detail how to insert the swab into the vagina and place it into a collection container that has been labelled by the healthcare worker with the name, date of birth and unique NHI (National Health Index) number.   Specimens are transported at room temperature to local Laboratories, who have agreed to handle the transportation of the samples, with their daily shipments, to national central Laboratories. HPV genotyping will be carried out using Real-time High Risk HPV assay validated for the use of dry swabs.  This distinguishes HPV-16 and HPV-18 from other high-risk types and from negative samples. 

Who will deliver intervention  the (participants) womans usual primary care clinician (family doctor or nurse) or community health worker will deliver the information to participants

Mode of delivery - HPV swab testing will be offered by doctor, nurse or community worker, face-to-face individually 

HPV self-testing will be offered between 1 - 5 times over one year to under-screened Maori women

Location- HPV self- testing will be offered in patients home, community venues such as local meeting houses (Maraes) if facilities allow, primary care clinic

Results  results of self- testing for HPV will be given by the womans usual primary care clinician ( doctor or nurse.) This can be done by phone or text if the result is negative or if results positive for high risk HPV an appointment will be made for the woman to obtain result and explanation face to face.  Results will be available 7-14 days after test has been taken.
Results will also be entered into the National Screening Unit data base (as per usual cervical smear results). This process has been discussed with the screening unit CEO and clinician in charge of cervical screening database. 
Any positive result will be followed up and referred for colposcopy by the womans usual primary care clinician.

Our study site is Northland where Maori women have almost twice the incidence of cervical cancer compared to non-Maori but almost four times the mortality. In Northland, cervical screening for Maori is approximately 66%. Women fulfilling inclusion criteria will be identified by primary care and matched with the National Screening Unit (NSU) on NHI to confirm screening history. All primary care clinics in the geographical area will be approached and recruited and randomised to intervention or control (usual care). We will recruit until target met.

Exercise sessions will be conducted in small groups of up to 10 participants under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. The exercise intervention will involve resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 3 times per week at various exercise clinics/gyms throughout Melbourne. Specifically, the aerobic exercise component will include 20 to 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular exercise (~60-85% of estimated maximum heart rate) using a variety of modes such as walking or jogging on a treadmill, cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer. Participants will be encouraged to undertake additional home-based aerobic exercise with the goal of achieving a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise each week.

ACTRN12617001268336p,Direct Isolation Chemotherapy for Liver Metastases,"Description of Intervention/Exposure

The treatment proposed in this clinical investigation plan is to repeatedly administer intra-arterial chemotherapy to hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer when the blood flow to and from the liver has been isolated via balloon catheters. The objective of this study is to evaluate the tumour response, progression-free survival, morbidity and mortality of repeated and isolated intra-arterial hepatic infusion of oxaliplatin compared with the gold standard 5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) treatment.

The treatment proposed in this study is based on the hypothesis that direct arterial infusion of chemotherapy to metastatic tumours of the liver whilst the blood flow to the organ is isolated could potentially yield benefits that cannot be achieved with existing treatment regimens.

There are three treatment stages; implantation of a vascular access device (known as the AVAS), intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions, and explantation of the AVAS.

Implantation: the participant is admitted to hospital and the AVAS is surgically implanted under general anaesthetic. The AVAS is an implantable large bore cannula with one end that can be anastomosed directly onto a peripheral vessel and the opposite end exiting the patients skin. The device can be opened to access the patients vasculature when required and closed when the device is not in use.  In accordance with the manufacturers Instructions-For-Use (IFU), the AVAS will be implanted in the axillary artery (i.e. the upper pectoral area) or in the common femoral artery (upper thigh) by a trained vascular surgeon. The implantation procedure takes around 2 hours. After implantation, the participant is monitored overnight.

Intra-arterial chemotherapy infusions: the participant is admitted to the angiography suite and under general anaesthetic or conscious sedation, intra-arterial hepatic isolation chemotherapy infusion is administered by an interventional radiologist. The first infusion can be administered 2 days after device implantation and infusions are spread out over an 8-week period at a maximum such that the patient receives 5 to 7 infusions in total, has at least 2 full calendar days between each infusion, and there are no more than 2 infusions over any 7 consecutive days. Each infusion can take between 2-3 hours during the first few infusions but should only take 1-2 hours for the remaining infusions as the radiologist becomes familiarised with the patients vascular anatomy. During the Phase Ib stage, the starting dose of the oxaliplatin infused will be 50mg/m^2 and this dose will be escalated by 5mg with each patient until an optimal dose is established. The optimal dose will be used for all patients enrolled during the Phase II stage. 

Explantation: the final infusion session is followed by the device explantation immediately, or at a later time depending on the availability of operating rooms and the condition of the participant. The surgical removal of the device takes approximately 1-2 hours, the participant is monitored overnight and discharged the next day.

In addition, capecitabine will be administered orally as per standard care (1000 mg/m^2 twice daily in 2 week cycles) throughout the study treatment period (from enrolment to 4-5 weeks after the AVAS explantation) as a form of systemic disease management. The oncologist may modify the capecitabine dose/frequency based on the patients response to the medication. ",CODE: Treatment: Drugs::||::CODE: Treatment: Devices,"1.

The intervention implements the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for people with cancer (Schmitz et al Med Sci Sports Exer 2005;14). The program consists of two appointments with a physiotherapist. These will be 15 to 45 minutes in duration (depending on the needs of the participant). The first one occurs before surgery at the hospital in the outpatient setting and the second appointment occurs after surgery just before hospital discharge. These sessions include 1) assessing the patients readiness for physical activity behavioural change, goals and confidence; 2) verbal education with the patient +/- carers and family about physical activity; 3) provision of resources to support physical activity (including an activity monitor, exercise diary and pamphlet); 4) setting personalized physical activity goals with the patient and a home program; and 5) identifying barriers and enablers for the patient to achieve the physical activity goals. All participants will be prescribed a home walking program and this will be progressed towards performing 150 minutes per week at a moderate intensity based on the American College of Sports Medicine Physical Activity Guidelines for people with cancer (Schmitz et al Med Sci Sports Exer 2005;14). In addition participants will be prescribed a home resistance training program, using body weight, that are targeting major muscle groups and progressed towards performing this two to three times per week. The exercises including type of exercise, repetition number, frequency and duration are tailored to the individual patient's ability. The intervention is personalised to the individual participants needs because patients with lung cancer present with other comorbid disease, including depression and COPD, and therefore to improve efficacy a targeted approach to physical activity is required that addresses the participants individual goals and that can be prescribed from their current physical activity levels.
The patient will receive weekly phone calls to promote adherence to the set physical activity goals, discuss barriers/issues and progress exercise. The phone calls occur weekly between the first physiotherapist face to face appointment until hospital admission for surgery (duration depends on wait list for surgery), and weekly after hospital discharge to 3 months post-surgery. The duration of the phone calls will be 5 to 20 minutes each depending on the needs of the participant.

 ","Medicinal cannabis imported from overseas. 
NB: CBD is cannabidiol, THC is Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol 

Arm 1: Oral medicinal cannabis oil: CBD:THC (1:1) plus standard treatment for 12 weeks
Starting dose will be 0.25mL of whole extract oil which is equivalent to 1.75 mg/mL of THC; and 2.25 mg/mL of CBD 

Arm 2: Oral medicinal cannabis oil: CBD:THC (1:4) plus standard treatment for 12 weeks
Starting dose will be 0.25mL of whole extract oil which is equivalent to 7 mg/mL of THC; and 3.75 mg/mL of CBD

Dosing for this trial will start at 0.25 ml (of either arm 1 or 2 of the combined THC:CBD whole plant extract oil) of the oral medicinal cannabis oil per day and titrated up according to participants weight and symptoms. As oral ingestion has to be processed by the liver, effects will be slower than smoking or vaporizing of cannabis.  It can take anywhere from 1-1.5 hours for effects to be noticed and can take 2-4 hours to reach its peak effect.

Dose will start at 0.25mL at night. If the person is able to function normally the next day, the dose will be increased 0.3mL, if they were not able to function as normal, the dose will be decreased to 0.2mL next night. Each night, the dose will either go up or down by 0.05mL depending on how the participant feels. The research nurse/assistant will be phoning the participant each morning to assess how the person is feeling to determine if they should titrate up or down or stay at that dose. 

Previous trials on oral administration of medicinal cannabis have shown that dose escalation or titration is best choice for the participants. Previous trials, although not on patients with cancer have documented the first dose as 2.7mg THC:2.5mg CBD. These trials increased a dose every 2-3 hours over 24 to 48 hour period till the person felt they were affected by the dose. The dose is then stabilized at that amount for that person and the dose documented. The maximum dose documented in this trial was 48 administrations over 24 hour period. 

Adherence or fidelity will be assessed by blood pathology tests for THC and CBD levels in the blood at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. The blood pathology results will be assessed by the primary investigator and the research team. If there is poor adherence or fidelity, the research team will contact the participant to inquire about taking the dose. If they are having difficulty taking the drug, different strategies will be suggested such as putting it in a capsule (which we would supply) or apply it rectally.

ACTRN12617001318370,"The PUMP Trial - Comparison of diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET/MRI, USS MRI Fusion Biopsy and ""Prolaris"" genomic risk stratifier in reclassification of men on Active Surveillance with low risk prostate cancer","Each participant will attend a 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR scan (combining PET and mpMRI), a transperineal template saturation prostate biopsy, a Biojet MRI USS Fusion transperineal prostate biopsy when having transperineal biopsy if lesions of interest are identified on the 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR scan, and will have a Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression test on previous samples.

[68Ga]Gallium-labelled prostate specific membrane antigen HBED-CC ligand (68Ga-PSMA)
It is an intravenous (IV) solution. The strength is 150MBq. One infusion is needed for the scan. The infusion of the 68Ga-PSMA ligands takes about 45 mins. Then, 68Ga-PSMA PET/MR scan will be performed. The scan will take 1-2 hours.

Multi Parameteric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI)
This type of scan does not use radiation. As in standard MRI, mpMRI uses magnetic signal to build up a picture of the prostate. However, in addition to this, mpMRI uses additional types of magnetic signals to build up more complete images of the prostate. This gives an overall assessment of the prostate and identifies areas of suspicion that can be targeted specifically for biopsy. Use of mpMRI approach increases the accuracy of the scan result and subsequent biopsy but we cannot be sure if this is the best approach without doing the study.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
PET scans are often used in the management of cancer and for diagnosis of suspected cancer conditions. This type of scan involves the use of a PET scanner and a radiotracer (radioactive agent). The PET radiotracer used in this study is 68Ga PSMA ligand which is a radioactive protein marker. PET scans may be performed with low dose whole body computer tomography or MRI.

The new imaging we are proposing is a hybrid of the above two described techniques. Both will occur at the same within the same machine. As the images are taken at the same time, there is a potential for significant improvement in the quality of the imaging with improved higher grade cancer detection rate on subsequent biopsy.

Biojet MRI USS Fusion Transperineal Prostate Biopsy 
It is a technology used to assist in biopsy the prostate. With the advent of mpMRI of the prostate, identification of lesions suspicious for high-grade cancer in the prostate for targeting is now possible with high accuracy. The Biojet technology allows fusion of the MRI and PSMA PET imaging previously performed to live Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in real-time (via a computer and provided software) in order to more accurately target lesions of interest. The biopsies are also performed via a transperineal approach (through the skin of the perineum between anus and base of scrotum) which allows more accurate localisation of lesions and better access to the anterior zones, with decreased potential infectious complications as a transrectal biopsy approach is avoided. These biopsies are performed under general anaesthetic at the Princess Alexandra Hospital within 3 months after the  68Ga-PSMA PET/MR scan. The biopsy procedure will take 45 min and will be performed by Urologists.

Prolaris Cell Cycle Progression (CCP) Score
It is a commercially available genetic test performed on the cancer sample obtained from the prostate biopsy. This test looks at the expression of 31 genes (termed cell cycle progression genes) normalized to 15 housekeeping genes in the cancer sample. This expression along with clinical information are used to calculate the CCP score which indicates how aggressively the individual cancer may behave in the future in comparison to other patients with similar clinical criteria. This may assist participants and the surgeon in the decision to continue on an Active Surveillance (AS) protocol or proceed with active treatment (surgery or radiation). This new test has never been compared with PSMA PET MRI imaging and fusion biopsy in its ability to accurately identify men with more aggressive cancer who are on an AS protocol.

For this study, both psychologists will use the same set of guidelines detailing adaption of ACT activities and schedule for a group-based ACT intervention. The ACT intervention program focuses on providing participants with strategies based on the six core processes of ACT(Acceptance, Defusion, Self as Context, Values, Contact with the Present Moment, and Committed Action) aimed at enhancing their psychological flexibility and wellbeing through improving management of distress, mood and quality of life. 

Participation will also involve completing an ACT workbook and practicing ACT outside group sessions. Each participant will be provided with a printed ACT workbook. During each sessions they will be invited to complete relevant session items in their workbooks. At the end of each session, they will be encouraged to complete home-based activities and practice ACT individually before the next session. After 6 weeks in the ACT intervention program, participants will cross-over to a usual care control program.

Intervention adherence will be assessed, at the end of the study, by examining participant engagement with the ACT program as measured through auditing ACT workbooks and a thematic analysis of journal entries.

This tracer is injected (2ml) into the tumour by the operating surgeon in theatre after the patient has been placed under general anaesthetic. A specialised handheld magnetic probe (Sentimag®) is then used to localise the sentinel nodes that have taken up the magnetic tracer. The probe is an approximately 25cm thin cylindrical device that makes a noise when it is close to the magnetic tracer. It is similar to the standard technique currently used when radioisotope is injected and a handheld gamma probe is used, the probe making a noise when it is close to the radioisotope tracer. For study participants they are not aware of the use of these probes as they are under General Anaesthetic. The duration of the procedure can vary from 20minutes to an hour depending on how difficult it is to localise the sentinel node.

The exercise training will consist of three phases: Phase 1 (exercise during chemotherapy: 4 months), Phase 2 (exercise rehabilitation following chemotherapy: 2 months) and Phase 3 (a step-down maintenance program: 6 months).

Phase 1 (Structured Exercise During Anthracycline Chemotherapy, 0-4 months):
Patients will be provided with an individualised training program in which they will be prescribed three 60-minute sessions of structured exercise per week at a local health and fitness centre throughout the Melbourne metropolitan region and supervised by qualified exercise trainers. Exercise training will be prescribed by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AI Foulkes) and will include a brief warm-up and cool-down, moderate-continuous (60-80% maximal capacity) progressing to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) of approximately 4 x 4 minutes of cycling at >80% of maximal capacity separated by 2 minutes of active recovery, and 20-25 minutes of progressive resistance training consisting of 5-6 exercises targeting major muscle groups. Participants will perform 1-2 sets at 55-85% of their 1 repetition max (RM; equivalent to 8-15 RM). Exercise volume will be increased by 2-10% (via increases in exercise intensity and/or duration) per week with the exception of each week of chemotherapy administration. A 5-10% reduction in exercise volume will be scheduled for the week following chemotherapy administration individualised to each participant based on their heart rate reserve and rating of perceived exertion responses to exercise. This allows for increased recovery whilst participant symptoms are at their peak.

Phase 2 (Structured Exercise Rehabilitation Following Anthracycline Chemotherapy):
Participants will be continue with structured exercise training for a further 2 months following the completion of anthracycline chemotherapy. This will consist of two supervised sessions consisting of HIIT and the progressive resistance training as outlined above, and two sessions of moderate-intensity continuos training (45-60 minutes at 60-70% VO2peak) being performed by the participants without supervision. Unsupervised sessions will be performed at a local health and fitness centre (YMCA) or as a home-based exercise session. During the supervised sessions, participants will receive feedback and guidance on structuring and performing their independent exercise sessions in order to increase their self-efficacy towards exercise. There will also be an emphasis on motivational interviewing and goal setting to assist participants in incorporating a regular exercise routine into their lifestyle and to assist in the transition to phase 3 of the exercise program. 

Phase 3 (Step-down Maintenance Program, 6-12 Months):
Participants will be provided with ongoing support for the final 6 months of the study via the prescription of a structured, individualised program for the subject to complete in an unsupervised environment, along with fortnightly telephone- and weekly text reminders. This program will consist of continued aerobic and resistance exercises focused on maintaining improvements in fitness, strength and physical function obtained in phase 1 and 2. Participants will attend up to five 60-minute supervised sessions in order to discuss their progress and update their training program. The frequency of these sessions will be determined in consultation with each participant based on their personal goals and confidence in performing exercise independently. In addition to their five supervised sessions, participants will also receive remote feedback on their training program via an online exercise prescription platform (Physitrack®). Participants will be provided with written feedback by their trainer each week, however participants have the ability to send direct messages to the trainer regarding any queries or issues related to the exercise program that require more immediate follow-up.

- Who will deliver the intervention? How will be delivered? The intervention will be delivered individually and on an online basis.

- The number of times the intervention will be delivered and over what period of time? The intervention is accessible any day, any time. The intervention is self-paced, thus, time will vary for each participant. Each module should take approximately 1 hour to complete.

- The intervention will be personalised depending on participants relationship status, side effects profile and baseline treatment goals. These elements will be identified through the baseline questionnaires. According to the participants responses (partnered or not), the intervention will show a few different content/resources in the corresponding modules. This is important because the experience of testicular cancer survivors and its impact on social and sexual relationships can be different based on relationship status. The side-effects profile and baseline treatment goals are different for each participant, so the intervention needs to provide them with relevant specific resources accordingly.
