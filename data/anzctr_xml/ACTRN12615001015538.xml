  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iChooseWell program. People taking part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program, or delayed access (8 week delay).

The iChooseWell eHealth program consists of forty biological, psychological, social, and wellness strategies, all designed to increase mind and body health (e.g., brain &amp; gut nutrition, emotional regulation strategies, problem solving, sleep hygiene, social connectedness, practising gratitude). Participants will be able to choose from the array of biopsychosocial strategies available within iChooseWell. The number of strategies implemented over the course of the trial is self determined by the participant, so they are free to undertake as few or as many as they wish. Background information is also provided on health and wellbeing (e.g., the stress response, brain/neural plasticity) and useful resources are provided (e.g., self monitoring, On the Go mobile tools). Each individual wellness strategy is 2-6 webpages in length (taking between 5-20 minutes to read) and its user friendly and interactive components are designed to keep the user engaged. To consolidate learning, participants will be given activities (10 minutes per day on average) to complete offline to practise the principles of the chosen wellness strategies. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions during the study period to monitor their progress. The iChooseWell program includes text, graphics, audio, video, quizzes, and downloads. iChooseWell can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants randomised to the iChooseWell eHealth immediate access group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 3) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 5) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 9 and Week 17). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to the iChooseWell eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 9). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iChooseWell program (Week 13) and a 1 month follow-up (post program) (Week 17). Access to iChooseWell will be provided for the entire trial period. Adherence will be measured by the number of strategies visited by post assessment (measured via passive analytics) as well as questions regarding engagement levels.

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to register for the study on the iChooseWell website where they will be taken to the Plain Language Information Statement and must provide informed consent to proceed. Following account creation, participants are asked to complete the pre-intervention online questionnaires. Once completed the participant is informed as to which condition they have been randomly allocated to (sent an automated email).

    <statisticalmethods>Pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to repeated measures MANOVA/ANOVA to determine significant changes over time and between groups; Correlational and multiple regression analyses will be used to determine significant correlates of wellbeing and to determine any potential predictors and discriminators of attrition and adherence; Cluster analysis will look at whether particular subgroups (e.g., males vs. females) prefer certain health and wellbeing strategies over others; Open ended data obtained from intervention satisfaction questionnaires may be analysed using protocols of content analysis to identify common themes.

Assuming a small-medium effect (i.e., GPower f test = 0.40), significance set at 5% (p = .05), power at 80%, a total sample size of 107 (this figure also accounts for an expected attrition rate of 40%) will be required to demonstrate statistical significance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iChooseWell program. The iChooseWell program will be placed within the Federation eHealth Platform.

People visiting the website, in response to advertisements or through self interest, will be informed of the availability of the iChooseWell program and invited to participate in the study. People who consent to take part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program condition or a delayed access condition (8 week delay). 

The iChooseWell eHealth program consists of forty biological, psychological, social, and wellness  strategies, all designed to increase mind and body health (e.g., brain &amp; gut nutrition, emotional regulation strategies, problem solving, sleep hygiene, social connectedness, practising gratitude). Participants will be able to choose from the array of biopsychosocial strategies available within iChooseWell. Background information is also provided on health and wellbeing (e.g., the stress response, brain/neural plasticity) and useful resources are provided (e.g., self monitoring, On the Go mobile tools).

The iChooseWell program includes text, graphics, audio, video, quizzes, and downloads. iChooseWell can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants randomised to the iChooseWell eHealth immediate access group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 3) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 5) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 9 and Week 17). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to the iChooseWell eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 9). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iChooseWell program (Week 13) and a 1 month follow-up (post program) (Week 17). Access to iChooseWell will be provided for the entire trial period. Adherence will be measured by the number of strategies visited by post assessment (measured via passive analytics) as well as questions regarding engagement levels. 

It is expected that people who undertake iChooseWell will show increases in mental health and wellbeing and optimism and reductions in negative affect at post and the 1 month follow-up time points.
