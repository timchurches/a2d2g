    <interventions>This is a single-center, controlled, study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) challange inoculum to characterize the effectiveness of Piperaquine against early blood stage Plasmodium falciparum infection. 1800 viable Plasmodium falciparum infected human erythrocytes will be administered intravenously. A single dose of Piperaquine will be administered when the level of parasite in the blood rises above 800/mL. The study will be conducted in up to 3 cohorts (n= 8 in each) using different oral doses of Piperaquine. Subsequent cohorts will not commence until at least after day 15 of the previous cohort and review by Safety Review Team following day 14 of the previous cohort. The first dose of Piperaquine that will be investigated will be a single dose of 960 mg (as piperaquine phosphate). Subsequent doses in subsequent cohort(s) will be determined following a review of observed Piperaquine safety, and pharmacodynamic outcome as well as the activity of the drug as defined by parasite clearance kinetics. It is anticipated that subsequent doses will be between 320 and 640 mg (as piperaquine phosphate). The doses will be determined following review by the Safety Review Team, and will be selected based on patient safety and volunteers tolerability and by defining the desired broad concentration response profile. If no safe alternative dose can be determined the option exists to curtail the study to less than three cohorts.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no comparator/control treatment group. Data from each study cohort will be compared to data obtained in previous and subsequent studies. Data has been collected over the past 3 years. The source of the specific historical data that will be used as a comparator in this study is:

    <statisticalmethods>Parasite clearance will be determined by characterising the log-linear decay in the middle of the decay profile (slope of the log-linear relationship of parasitemia over time). The parasite reduction rate (PRR) will be calculated using the slope of the log-linear relationship of the parasitemia based on the optimal fit of the log-linear curve. The optimal fit will be derived after dealing with potential outliers, dealing with values below the limit of detection (LOD) and non-detectable values (ND), and obtaining an appropriate summary of replicate parasitemia values. The optimal fit of the log-linear parasitemia by time relationship is determined by using left and right censoring to systematically remove the potential lag phase and tail phase of the parasitemia decay. </statisticalmethods>
