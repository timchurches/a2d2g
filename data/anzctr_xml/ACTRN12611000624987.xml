  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention. Exhaled breath sampling during and after Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). Collection of exhaled breath via facemask into a reservoir, and subsequent analysis of volatile organic compund profiles by electronic nose. This is a novel 32 sensor device which records a VOC "pattern" which can be used for discrimination of samples. Also characterisation of patients into infected / non-infected groups by use of sputum and blood cultures, nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus screen by PCR, serology etc. 1-2 years. Also analysis of exhaeled breath by PTR-MS. Exhaled breath samples are taken at exacerbation and again at recovery (approx 6 weeks later) in the patients group, and only once in the control group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Otherwise well patients with stable COPD recruited from pulmonary rehabilitation courses. No interventions made, sampling only.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The electronic Nose detects and analyses volatile organic compounds in a gas sample. It has previously been used in the food industry and to detect explosives. By sampling exhaled air in a single breath from a patient, the technology can be used to provide a profile which may define underlying pathology in the airways and lung. In this study we will obtain recordings using the Nose from otherwise well patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (n=50) and patients experiencing an acute exacerbation of COPD (n=50). We will compare the Nose signal between these groups, and assess them for the presence or absence of bacterial infection, to see whether there is a nose signal which is characteristic for bacterial infection (which might indicate the need for antibiotic therapy). The aim is to develop bedside technology which is easy to use and provides clinicians with practical information as to whether or not an acute exacerbation is or is not caused by bacterial rather than viral infection. Patients will receive best standard care and the results of the Nose sampling will not alter their standard treatment in any way.</summary>
