  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of BMS-754807 in
      patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In addition, the study is expected to
      identify the recommended dose or dose range of BMS-754807 for Phase 2 studies</summary>
