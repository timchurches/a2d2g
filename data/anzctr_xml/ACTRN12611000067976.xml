  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rapid visual information processing task (accuracy) - measure of sustained attention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 40mins and 120mins post dose</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other cognitive tasks:
- Rapid visual information processing task (as above) - reaction time and false alarm rate
- Inspection Time task - measure of visual information processing speed
- Serial sevens - measure of concentration and working memory
- Serial Threes - measure of concentration and working memory
- Jenson Box reaction time task - measure of reaction time performance whereby decision time and movement time are separated
- N-back task - measure of sustained and selective attention and impulsivity
- Emotional face recognition task - measure of emotional processing and attention</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 40mins and 120mins post dose</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mood questionnaires:
- Bond &amp; Lader Visual Analogue Scales (Bond &amp; Lader, 1974) - subjective measure of mood and alertness 
- Caffeine Research Visual Analogue Scales - subjective assessment of feelings of "relaxed", "alert", "jittery", "tired", "tense", "headache", overall mood", and "mental fatigue".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Once before and once after all the cognitive tests (baseline, 40mins and 120mins post dose)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants come for one practice visit where they go through the screening questions and provide informed consent. They also practice on all cognitive and mood tasks they will be doing on their subsequent testing sessions. Participants come for 3 testing sessions at least 1 week apart. At each testing session, they first complete baseline 'mood, cognitive, mood' assessments and doppler ultrasound followed by treatment administration. They complete 'mood, cognitive mood' assessment at 40mins and 120mins post dose and doppler at 90mins post dose</summary>
