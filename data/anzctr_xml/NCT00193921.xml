  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Histologically or cytologically proven non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Planned high dose palliative radiation therapy for locoregional control. Examples
             include patients with:

               1. Stage I - IIIB disease with

                    -  disease technically unsuitable for radical therapy, or Â· weight loss in
                       excess of 10%, or

                    -  concurrent medical illness

               2. Patients found to have a locally advanced thoracic disease suitable for radical
                  therapy but on work up are found to have a FDG-PET only solitary metastasis.

          -  All potential patients, prior to registration, must be reviewed at a multidisciplinary
             lung oncology meeting attended by medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and
             radiologists.

          -  No prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1.

          -  Adequate hepatic, bone marrow and renal function.

          -  If patient is female of child bearing potential, she must not be pregnant or
             lactating. Males and females of reproductive potential must practise adequate
             contraception.

          -  Written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patient unable to receive all therapy as an outpatient.

          -  Significant medical conditions which in the opinion of the investigator would
             compromise the planned delivery of the chemotherapy and radiotherapy or which may be
             potentially exacerbated by these modalities.

          -  History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix) unless in complete remission and off all therapy for that cancer for at
             least 5 years.

          -  Receiving treatment with another investigational agent.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study compares 2 different methods of combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the
      treatment of localised lung cancer in patients not suitable for surgery.

      Hypothesis(es) to be tested:

        1. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy is superior to gemcitabine +
           high dose palliative radiotherapy in terms of efficacy in a multi-institutional setting

        2. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy is superior to gemcitabine +
           high dose palliative radiotherapy in terms of feasibility in a multi-institutional
           setting

        3. Vinorelbine + cisplatin + high-dose palliative radiotherapy has a favourable toxicity
           profile relative to gemcitabine + high-dose palliative radiotherapy</summary>
