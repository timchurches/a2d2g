  <interventions>
    <interventions>Telerehabilitation- Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive telephone support once a week for 12 weeks. Telephone support will be 15-25 minutes in duration and will be focused on pressure ulcer management. Specifically, participants will receive education and advice about seating, pressure-relief, support surfaces, nutrition, wound dressing, self-care activities and other issues related to their pressure ulcer. The participants will also receive advice about when to seek further nursing or medical attention. 

Participants allocated to the intervention group will continue with their usual care and receive a pamphlet containing information about pressure ulcer management.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive usual care. This typically involves care provided by the family. They will also receive a pamphlet containing information about pressure ulcer management. 

Participants allocated to the control group will be free to seek any other type of help or medical assistance they deem appropriate or have access to. </comparator>

    <concealment>Potential and interested participants will be informed about the trial both verbally and in writing using a participant information sheet (PIS) as per the Good Clinical Practices guidelines. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask any question and discuss their participation with their doctor and family. A signed and dated copy of the PIS and informed consent form (ICF) will be given to participants for their records. Participants will be given an English or Hindi version of the PIS and ICF as appropriate. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups using the principle of concealed allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A blocked randomisation schedule will be used.  This will be computer-generated prior to commencement of the study by an independent person located off the study site.  Concealment will be ensured by placing each participant’s allocation into a sealed, opaque and sequentially numbered envelope. The envelopes will be kept off site by an independent person. Once a participant has completed the baseline assessment and his/her details are lodged, the researcher will contact the independent person to open an envelope and attain the participant’s allocation. The participant will be considered to have entered the trial at this point. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pressure ulcers are common and severe complications after SCI. They hinder rehabilitation and have many deleterious consequences like contractures, permanent scarring, deformities, osteomyelitis, loss of limb, and sepsis often requiring hospital admissions. In addition, they affect a persons family and social life, and are costly and difficult to manage. Pressure ulcers can also lead to death. It is estimated that they are responsible for 7 to 8 per cent of deaths in persons with SCI in developed countries. This figure is probably much higher in low and middle-income countries although accurate data about the extent of the problem is not currently available. So while the exact extent of the problem in low- and middle-income countries is not known, there is general consensus that pressure ulcers are a major and life-threatening problem. On the other hand, the main strategy for the treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers is education. In the community, pressure ulcer management requires weekly assessment in persons with SCI. In vast geographic and low resourced countries like India, it is difficult to follow patients up on a weekly basis. Hence, pressure ulcers are commonly neglected leading to widespread misery. Telerehabilitation is the delivery of rehabilitation services using communication and information technologies. It increases accessibility and enhances continuity of care for people with disabilities.
Telerehabilitation is increasingly available in India with the popular use of mobile phones. This might provide an inexpensive way of managing pressure ulcers from a distance through reinforcing measures for prevention &amp; management. The trial will be called - the TeleREhabilitation program for managing Pressure Ulcers in persons with SCI (TREPUS) trial.

It will be the first, large, prospective, randomised, single blinded trial to investigate this question. There will be two groups; Intervention and Control. Participants in the Intervention group will receive telephone support on a weekly basis for 12 weeks and participants in the Control group will receive usual care alone. The purpose of the trial will be to provide precise estimates of the effect of the Intervention on the size of pressure ulcers compared to the Control group.
