    <interventions>artemether-lumefantrine in fixed combination tablet each containing 20 mg of artemethr and 120 mg lumefantrine.  Tablets will be given twice daily for three consecutive days.  The number of tablets per dose is according to body weight. Children between 5 and 14 kg body weight will receive 1 tablet, between 15 and 24 kg, two tablets, between 25 and 34 kg, 3 tablets, and over 35 kg 4 tablets per dose.  This dosing regimen is as per natioanl policy for this indication.</interventions>

    <concealment>Study subjects will be screened  from the outpatient department of the sentinel health centers.  Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receiving either artemether-lumefantrine or amodiaquine-artesunate. Computer generated randomization lists will be created for each of the 3 sentinel site and sent in a sealed envelope to the study nurse of each site. Only study nurse will have access to the randomization list.  To allocate subjects to the appropriate treatment group, the study nurse will select the next available number and corresponding study drug.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To estimate the clinical and parasitological efficacy of two artemisinin-based combination therapies (artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine) included in the national policy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children. The study will be conducted in three Uganda Malaria Surveillance Project sentinel sites.  The results will be used to formulate recommendations enabling the Ministy of Health to make decisions about the possible need for updating the current national antimalarial treatment policy.</summary>
