    <interventions>Comparing the effectiveness of Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) as treatment of childhood-trauma related PTSD in adults
ImRs: ImRs is a technique where an individual imagines a different course of the trauma events that helps to satisfy the needs of the person. This in turn leads to a change in the meaning of the events. ImRs is considered especially suited for events of an interpersonal nature where an individuals trust of others was violated, where there is an inappropriate degree of level responsibility for the event, and where core needs of dependency and safety were threatened. 
EMDR: A psychotherapeutic treatment approach which uses a sequence of eye movements to facilitate emotional-cognitive processing of disturbing experiences. EMDR asks individuals to recall their trauma experience into their minds while at the same time tracking the back and forth movements of the therapist's finger. The effect of this treatment process is it helps to alleviate lingering effects of the trauma, allowing the individual to reprocess the traumatic experience, and to develop more adaptive coping skills.
The research will follow the treatment protocol for each of these treatments. Random allocation using random number tables controlled by central researcher in Holland. Participants will receive a maximum of 12, 90 minute sessions twice a week in either ImRs or EMDR. Individual treatment sessions will be with a registered psychologist or psychiatrist.</interventions>
    <comparator>An estimated natural wait list of 6 weeks for treatment. At the conclusion of the wait time each participant will be offered ImRs or EMDR.</comparator>

For diagnostic outcome mixed logistic regression analysis will be used, for skewed distributions mixed gamma regression, for medication use Poisson or negative binomial regression. 
With a sample size of N=128 the study is powered at 80% to detect a medium effect size of Cohens d = .5 at a two-tailed significance level of .05. To replace early dropouts (estimated 10%) the sample size is increased to N=142. Actual power will be higher because of the use of mixed regression (taking all available data into account) and use of covariates that reduce standard error.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Comparing two treatment approaches, Imagery Rescripting (ImRs) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR), for adults with PTSD related to childhood based trauma. ImRs is where the individual imagines a different ending to the trauma memory, so that the person can change the meaning of the event. EMDR uses a sequence of eye movements to help an individual to reprocess thoughts and feelings associated with trauma experiences.
This purpose of this research is to compare the effectiveness of these two approaches and to test if the element of the treatments that facilitate change is the same for both approaches.
