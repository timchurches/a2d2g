  <interventions>
    <interventions>Parents in the intervention group will receive an individually-tailored feedback report on their current drinking and the alcohol-related attitudes and behaviours based on their responses to a brief online survey (adapted from the Parenting Strategies: preventing adolescent alcohol misuse parent survey; Yap, Jorm &amp; Lubman (2015). What are parents doing to reduce adolescent alcohol misuse? Evaluating concordance with parenting guidelines for adolescent alcohol use. BMC Public Health, 15:114). The feedback report highlights where parents are doing well (i.e., concordant with the Guidelines), as well as ways they can improve in specific behaviours that are not currently concordant with the Guidelines (based on their responses to corresponding survey questions about these behaviours). The messages in the feedback report are brief, with practical strategies provided in dot point form, and are designed to motivate behaviour change. The feedback report is presented on the website immediately after parents submit their baseline assessment and are randomly allocated to the intervention group. They then receive the Modelling module of the Parenting Strategies Program (www.parentingstrategies.net), which provides specific tips and trouble-shooting ideas to help parents modify their attitudes and behaviours regarding alcohol so as to be more in concordance with the Parenting Guidelines for Adolescent Alcohol Use. This online module takes about 20 minutes to complete. Parents are invited to complete the module immediately after they have completed their baseline survey and received their feedback report. Thereafter their access to the module will remain open indefinitely.
Parents also receive a copy of their feedback report and the Parenting Guidelines for Adolescent Alcohol Use via email. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Upon completing a short online survey (same survey as intervention group), participants randomly allocated to the control group will receive a non-tailored summary of the Australian Guidelines for Reducing Health Risks from Drinking Alcohol (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009) for a healthy adult and a young person under 18 years of age. The feedback report is presented on the website immediately after parents submit their baseline assessment and are randomly allocated to the control group.  Parents also receive a copy of their feedback report via email.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental alcohol consumption as measured by the total score from the 3 Consumption questions from the WHO Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C). The third question was adapted from "6 or more drinks' to '4 or more drinks' to align it to the NHMRC Guidelines recommendation that drinking no more than four standard drinks on a single occasion will help reduce the risk of alcohol-related injury.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and again at 12 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7 parental modelling questions developed to assess the behaviours regarding alcohol that parents are modelling to their adolescent, against the Parenting Guidelines for Adolescent Alcohol Use.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and again at 12 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adolescent Intention to Drink Alcohol as measured by 2 questions: 
For the next two questions, please answer, Yes, No, or Maybe.
1.	Do you think you would drink alcohol:
a)	When you are aged between 15-17 years old? 
b)	After you turn 18? 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured at 3 months and again at 12 months after the adolescent's parent had completed their baseline survey.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>When parents submit their baseline assessment on the trial website, the website will generate an automated random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group. Parents will find out which group they have been assigned to when they receive their feedback report immediately after submitting their baseline assessment. As such, allocation is concealed from both participants and researchers prior to assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The trial website is programmed to run a random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group, as soon as parents submit their baseline assessment online.</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>"The people administering the treatment/s" are "masked" because the interventions are programmed to be fully automated by the trial website, which cannot be biased.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on an expected medium effect size, we need 64 per group = 128 parents + adolescents. Allowing for 15% attrition, we need to recruit 150 parent-adolescent dyads at baseline.

Required sample size:
Based on a power analysis, for a repeated-measures design with a power of 0.80, an expected medium effect size, and alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 64 per group = 128 parents + adolescents dyads is required.
Allowing for an attrition rate of approximately 15%, we aim to recruit 150 parent-adolescent dyads (75 dyads per group) at baseline.

Data analysis:
The main analyses will be intent-to-treat. To assess group differences in changes in parental drinking and modelling (primary outcomes) across timepoints (baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 12-month follow-up), a series of mixed effects analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) will be conducted. Adolescent age and gender will be used as covariates.
Little's MCAR (missing completely at random) test will be used to analyse the extent and pattern of missing data.

To assess group differences in adolescent intention to drink at 3 month and 12 month follow up (secondary outcome), a Discriminant Factor Analysis will be conducted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate whether the use of an  individually tailored intervention (adapted from the Parenting Strategies Program, www.parentingstrategies.net/alcohol) is more effective at: a) reducing parental alcohol consumption, b) modifying parental attitudes and behaviours toward alcohol use (so as to be more in concordance with the Parenting Guidelines for Adolescent Alcohol Use), and c) reducing intention to drink in adolescents of parents within the intervention group, as compared to a control group whereby the parent participants receive a non-tailored summary of the Australian Guidelines for Reducing Health Risks from Drinking Alcohol (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2009).  </summary>
