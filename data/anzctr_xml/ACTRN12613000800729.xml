  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm1: The trial tests an intervention involving a telehealth program supported by a handheld respiratory device (COPD-6)[copyright].  The intervention group will be provided with a COPD-6 and a specifically designed Breathe-easy [copyright] application installed on their mobile phone. They will be asked to measure their lung function (FEV1 and FEV6) using the COPD-6 device twice daily and to record their asthma symptoms and medication usage in Breathe-easy [copyright]. The lung function data (FEV1 and FEV6) will be transmitted to a central server and reviewed by the researcher daily. The data will also be sent to participants General Practitioners (GPs). Participants and the research team will have secure access to the online portal. Any clinically significant reduction in lung function will be brought to the attention of the participants' GPs in order for them to determine if any medication changes or unscheduled visit related to asthma are needed. The total duration of the intervention will be 7 - 9 months depending on when the participants had their first antenatal visit.
Arm 2: Usual care
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual medical care provided by the antenatal clinics and/or their health professionals. If during the follow up, their asthma control becomes a concern (two or more documented exacerbations without resolution i.e. increase in preventer dose) since prior assessment, we will notify the participant and her General Practitioner (with participants permission). The control group will be given a summary version of the Asthma and Pregnancy brochure from the National Asthma Council of Australia to provide information on the risks of poorly-controlled asthma.</comparator>

    <concealment>To ensure that sample size is reached efficiently, the following recruitment methods will be used:  (1) A list of new pregnant women who have had their first outpatient antenatal visit will be generated weekly from the BOS/IPM (registered trademark) database (a medical recordsâ€™ database which stores antenatal information for all hospital patients).  One day before the clinic, the researchers will search the outpatient files and screen the medical records for pregnant women with asthma based on the GPs referrals(2) The researchers will also search for potential participants in the antenatal clinics by screening their medical records once the women have been seen by the midwives or physicians   (3) Advertisement posters about the study will be placed in the outpatient department alongside a short explanation about the study and an expression of interest box where participants can leave their contact details.  Simple computer generated randomisation will be carried out using the sealed opaque envelope method to conceal allocation of participants to the Telehealth program supported by a handheld respiratory device group (intervention) or the usual care group (control).</concealment>
    <sequence>Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control groups with the help of an independent person who is not involved in the project. Participants will be randomised to the control and intervention group using a random allocation software.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 28 women per arm using an estimated standard deviation of 0.66 will have 80% power with a two sided 5% significance level to detect the Minimal Important Difference (MID) in ACQ score of 0.5 or more between groups. To allow for 25% attrition, 35 participants will be recruited in each arm.
An intention-to-treat analysis will be performed for the main analysis.  A per protocol analysis will also be undertaken as a sensitivity analysis. Pre-specified changes in outcome measures between groups from baseline will be compared using appropriate univariate analysis (t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, etc. depending on the distribution of data). We will compare the change in ACQ scores between baseline, 3 months and 6 months, proportion of participants whose ACQ score improves more than 0.5 (the Minimum Clinically Importance Difference [MCID]) over the study period, the proportion in whom asthma remained not well controlled (ACQ score is 1.5 or greater) and those whose asthma was well controlled (ACQ score is less than  1.5)  at each time point.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy may harm both the baby and the mother, causing an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, prematurity, low birth weight and perinatal mortality . More than half of pregnant women do not take their preventer medications on a regular basis before and during pregnancy leading to asthma exacerbations. Evidence shows that better asthma control will be achieved if patients are involved in self-management, including regular self-monitoring of symptoms and/or lung function. This study will examine the potential for enhanced telehealth support for asthma in pregnancy. Telehealth may provide an attractive alternative to standard medical care for pregnant women with asthma. As well as providing accessibility and flexibility for patients, other potential benefits include reduced time to access healthcare services, reduced travel costs, earlier detection of worsening asthma such as exacerbations and reduced healthcare visits/hospitalisations. However, there are only a few well conducted studies in Australia providing evidence on the applications of telehealth for any condition.  
Aims: To develop a telehealth program for asthma management and to trial its effectiveness in pregnant women with asthma. We hypothesise that  telehealth for supporting management of asthma during pregnancy will result in better asthma control, better quality of life, better maternal and better neonatal outcomes compared to the usual care
Methods: A mobile phone application (Breathe-easy [copyright]) will be developed to facilitate communication between patients and their health professionals. Patient lung function data (measured using the COPD-6[copyright] device) will be transmitted daily via a mobile phone to a central server. Patients will receive automatic feedback on their mobile phones according to an individualised algorithm. The GP/Obstetrician will be notified when an unscheduled visit and/or change in medication is needed.
