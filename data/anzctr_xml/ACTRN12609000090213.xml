  <interventions>
    <interventions>whole body vibration training. Patients will be required to stand on the vibration platform with a knee angle of 150 degrees, 3 days a week for four weeks. Frequency is 20Hz for the first 2 weeks, and 22 Hz for the remaining 2 weeks, with a 1mm amplitude maintained throughout. Patients wear socks while on the platform, and each training session goes for 30 minutes in total, with intermittent exposure of 1 minute vibration, 1 minute rest (standing on the platform). The proceeding washout period is also four weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>no treatment. The first four weeks of the three month study is the control period whereby the patients maintain normal levels of physical activity as reported at baseline, and recieve no active intervention. This is to assess the changes that occur in the population due to growth, learning and maturation prior to including the intervention.

The subjects act as thier own controls. The first month is the control period. The second month is the intervention of vibration training. The third month is a washout period where detraining effects may be observed.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>muscle strength. Dynamic muscle strength will be assessed on Keiser pneumatic-resistance training equipment with K400 electronics (Keiser Sports Health Equipment, Inc., Fresno, CA) using one repetition maximum (1RM) in three bilateral exercises: knee extension, chest press and horizontal leg press.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, one month (post control), two months (post training), three months (post de-training)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>muscle power. Power will be measured at 60% of the patients current 1RM, as peak power has been observed between 50-75% 1RM. Three maximal explosive efforts were performed with 1 minute rest in between. The highest power achieved for each of the three exercises (knee extension, chest press, leg press) will be recorded and used in analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, one month (post control), two months (post training), three months (post de-training)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>muscle endurance. 90% of the patients baseline 1RM will be used to assess endurance, once again on the same machines (knee extension, chest press, leg press), with the number of completed repetitions performed with the load being recorded and used in analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, one month (post control), two months (post training), three months (post de-training)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximal aerobic capacity will be assessed with a treadmill walk protocol. Measures will include peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES)</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, one month (post control), two months (post training), three months (post de-training)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>respiratory function will measure forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced midexpiratory flow rate (FEF25-75%) and using spirometry and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), vital capacity, residual volume, total lung capacity will be measured by body plethysmography;</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, one month (post control), two months (post training), three months (post de-training)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-Related Quality of Life assessed by Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutritional status will be assessed by a three day food diary completed at home</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well known that certain exercises can help increase muscle strength, power and endurance, but a lot of these exercises can prove hard to complete for some people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent research has been looking at this new form of exercise (vibration training), and its been proven to have positive impacts on muscle in animals and certain human populations. It has not yet been tested with CF patients. It is hoped that the vibration platform training will not only benefit muscle strength and power, but also respiratory function and overall quality of life in CF patients.</summary>
