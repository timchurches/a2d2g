    <interventions>This is essentially a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study in healthy subjects. 

This study is divided into three parts.

The second part explores the effect of DSM265 on an induced malaria infection study in a single cohort. This part of the study will run as open-label.

There will be 1 cohort of 10 subjects enrolled. All participants will receive a malaria inoculum injection of ~ 1,800 viable P. falciparum infected human erythrocytes. 8 subjects will receive a single dose of the maximum tolerated dose (determined from Part 1) of DSM265 via an oral suspension 7 days after malaria inoculation. 2 subjects will receive Mefloquine tablets (250 mg). The effects of DSM265 will be observed for 16 days before compulsory treatment with Riamet.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will undergo the malaria induced infection. 2 subjects will receive one dose of Mefloquine tablets (250 mg) 7 days after receiving the malaria inoculm. The Mefloquine control group  is included to ensure that parasite growth and clearance with a drug of known activity is as expected.</comparator>

2. Healthy male and female (of non-childbearing potential) subjects age 18 to 45 years  in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening.
a. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had at least 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels at the local laboratory levels for post-menopause; or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six months ago. Women on oral contraceptives are to be excluded from the study, also women who have had a tubal ligation.
3. At screening and baseline, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least three (3) minutes and again when required after three (3) minutes in the standing position.

Vasectomised males to use a condom for the entire study and 12 weeks following drug administration.
9. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will be measured during screening and at each baseline for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL. For light smokers (defined as less than 5 cigarettes per day) to pass the cotinine test, smoking should be stopped at least 24 hours prior to reporting to the centre (i.e., Day -2, early morning). Smoking will not be allowed during the study.

a. Any single parameter may not exceed 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A single parameter elevated up to and including 1.5 x ULN should be re-checked once more as soon as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to enrolment/randomisation, to rule out lab error.
b. Any elevation of more than one parameter excludes a subject from participation in the study unless otherwise agreed by the medical monitor. Testing may be repeated once more as soon as possible, but in all cases, at least prior to enrolment/randomisation, to rule out lab error.
Re-check results must not be clinically significant in order for subject to qualify and confirmed and agreed by the medical monitor.

    <designfeatures>This study is an ascending dose study being studied in 3 parts, and depending on the results of the previous parts, the study can then move on to the next part. It uses an adaptive design. After the completion of Part 1, if the pharmacokinetic parameters in Part 1 attain levels acceptable to the sponsor and Safety Review Team, the study will proceed to the induced malaria infection study (Part 2). Screening for Part 2 will begin 21 days prior to the end of Part 1.  Likewise, if the pharmacodynamic parameters attain levels acceptable to the sponsor and Safety Review Team (SRT), the study will proceed to the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase (Part 3).</designfeatures>
