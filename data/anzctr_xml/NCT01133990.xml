Experimental: E7820 - FOLFIRI Alone Versus FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab Versus FOLFIRI Plus E7820

Experimental: FOLFIRI plus Bevacizumab - 


Treatment: drugs: FOLIRI
The FOLFIRI regimen consists of irinotecan at 180 mg/m2 (IV infusion) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28-day cycle, leucovorin at 200 mg/m2 (400 mg/m2 if using d,l-racemic mixture of leucovorin) by IV infusion on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, and 5-FU at 400 mg/m2 as an IV bolus injection followed by a total of 2400 mg/m2 by CIV infusion over 46 hours over Days 1 and 2 via an ambulatory programmable pump (the use of an ambulatory pump is optional). The 5-FU IV bolus (400 mg/m2) and CIV infusion (2400 mg/m2) over 46 hours is repeated on Days 15 and 16 of each cycle.

Treatment: drugs: FOLIRI plus E7820
E7820 is administered orally in tablet form once daily, every day of each 28-day treatment cycle. For the Phase Ib portion, the doses will be 40 mg/day, 70 mg/day, and 100 mg/day, and for the Phase II portion, the dose will be the MTD recommended Phase IB dose in combination with FOLFIRI, as determined during the Phase Ib portion of the study.

Treatment: drugs: FOLFIRI plus Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg (IV infusion) on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle
