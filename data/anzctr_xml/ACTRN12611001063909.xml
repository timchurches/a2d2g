    <interventions>Research suggests that music can reduce arousal and that reducing arousal can reduce Self-Injurious Behaviour. The intention of this research is to conduct three studies designed to test whether arousal mediates the relationship between music and SIB, hence defining the 3-Stage Mediating Model. Study 1, the first stage of the 3 -Stage Mediating Model,  involves the selection, performance and provision of music performed in Rondo, Theme and Variations and Sonata forms rated by primary carers of males with autism from most to least sedate. The first 2 minutes of 6 musical performances, two from each Rondo, Theme and Variations and Sonata forms (appearing in a randomised order) will be rated by primary carers of males with Low Functioning Autism from 1 = least calming to 6 = most calming or that none were calming. Ratings from at least 30 primary carers will then be analysed to reveal the single muscial performance that is agreed to be most calming. This piece of music will be applied to Study 2, the second stage of the 3 -Stage Mediating Model, and Study 3, the third stage of the 3 -Stage Mediating Model.

Study 2: the second stage of the 3 -Stage Mediating Model,
A laboratory based randomised control trial will test if Receptive Music Therapy (listening to music selected in Study 1 as most calming) can reduce salivary cortisol levels and Self Injurious Behaviour frequencies for children with Low Functioning Autism when exposed to 13 minutes video footage of a school bus ride (a Trier Social Stress Test). 
Frequency: the participant will attend Curtin University Laboratory once per week for 2 weeks.
Duration: 13 minutes watching a TV playing video footage of a school bus ride. The total time of preparation and collection of saliva for anaylsis will be less than 45 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Study 2 is a Randomised Control Trial : 
Phase 1: 
Pre-Test all 30 participants will sit on a bus chair in a laboratory room and watch 13 minutes footage of a school bus journey displayed on a television. Participants will be alone in the closed door laboratory, however, the researcher and primary carer will observe via closed circuit television to ensure that the participants SIB frequency does not escalate to dangerous levels and the RMT is effectively delivered. 
At the conclusion of the footage, the primary carer will enter the room to collect saliva samples. Saliva will be analysed for cortisol and video footage will be analysed for SIB frequencies.

Phase 2: 
Randomised allocation of 30 participants aged between 6 and 11 years. Non-Music Group (15 children with Low Functioning Autism) or Music Group (15 children with Low Functioning Autism). A simple random allocation technique will be used for this phase.

Phase 3: 
Two groups will be formed. Non-Music Group (15 children with Low Functioning Autism) or Music Group (15 children with Low Functioning Autism). 

Phase 4: 
Exposed to the same conditions as detailed in Phase 1, participants will return to the laboratory one week later, sit on the bus chair in and watch 13 minutes footage of a school bus journey displayed on a television. Participants will be alone in the closed door laboratory, however, the researcher and primary carer will observe via closed circuit television to ensure that the participants SIB frequency does not escalate to dangerous levels and the RMT is effectively delivered. These conditions mirror those of Phase 1.

Participants allocated to the Music group will have headphones applied by the primary carer and listen to music (rated as most calming from Study 1) whilst footage of a school bus journey is displayed.
Participants allocated to the Non-Music group will not listen to music.
For both the Music and Non Music groups, at the conclusion of the footage, the primary carer will enter the room and collect saliva samples. For the Music group, the primary carer will cease the music and remove the headphones.</comparator>

    <concealment>State Child Development Centre, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Disability Services Commission (DSC), Western Australian Autism Diagnosticians Forum (WAADF), Autism Association of Western Australia, specialist schools that provide educational services for children with autism and a school bus service and parent groups will be emailed to inform of and provide information required to contact Mr Jeremy Marriott. Once primary carers have contacted Jeremy Marriott, he will record and transcribe a telephone interview for each participant to determine eligibility and consent. Allocation concealment will be adhered to via a simple random sampling method whereby Jeremy Marriott will create pieces of paper marked with a de-identified 3-Digit Code representing each participant. These 30 pieces of paper will be shuffled and drawn out of a hat whilst blind folded. A result, participants in Study 2 will be randomly allocated to either the Non Music or Music groups. Even though primary carers will be aware of the group allocation results, participants will be blinded to this in addition to potential limited comprehension as a result of intellectual disability.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of Study 2 is to explore the effect of Receptive Music Therapy (RMT) on salivary cortisol and SIB frequency from children with LFA and SIB within a randomised control trial laboratory setting, exposed to a Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The randomised control trial will include a pre-test for salivary cortisol and SIBs, the random allocation of participants into no music and music groups whilst undergoing the TSST and a post-test for salivary cortisol and SIB frequency. Study 2 is designed to investigate the potential relationship between music and SIB as the mediated by level of arousal as illustrated in the 3-Stage Mediating Model. The laboratory environment used in this study provides the controls needed to establish support for the model prior to testing in a naturally stressful setting, the school bus.</summary>
