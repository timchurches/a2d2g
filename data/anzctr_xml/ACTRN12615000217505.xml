    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions: immediate access to Cool Little Kids Online (intervention group), or delayed access after a 24-week period (control group). The Cool Little Kids Online program aims to help parents of shy young children who at risk of developing anxiety problems. The program has 8 interactive online modules containing a mix of written information, videos, audio narration, activities and parent experiential stories. The modules contain the same content as in the Cool Little Kids parenting group program developed by Rapee et al (2005). Modules take about 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The modules are designed to be completed sequentially at weekly intervals, with a new module becoming available each week. This means the program can be completed in 8 weeks, or participants can use the program at their own pace, as they will have access for 24 weeks. Just like the group parenting program, Cool Little Kids Online sets parents home practice tasks to work on with their child between modules. To encourage program adherence, participants receive automated emails when they complete a module and when each new module becomes available. Parents in the intervention group will be offered telephone support from a psychology clinician upon request only.</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed access control group. The control group will receive access to the Cool Little Kids Online program after a delay of 24 weeks, once they have completed the 24-week questionnaire. The program will be provided 'as-is' with no support offered from a psychology clinician.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will complete an online screening questionnaire to see if they are eligible to participate. This online screening questionnaire is automatically scored, and those who are ineligible will be automatically informed and will exit the survey. Those who are eligible will be invited to participate after reading more about the study, and will give their informed consent online. They will then be asked to complete the rest of the baseline questionnaire online. Randomisation to group occurs at the end of the baseline questionnaire, and is calculated automatically using a computer script. Parents in the immediate-access condition will be emailed instructions on how to log-in to the program once they have completed the baseline questionnaire. Parents in the delayed-access condition will be emailed these instructions once they have completed the third questionnaire after a waiting period of 24-weeks.
