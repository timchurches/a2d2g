  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A trial to examine whether a new heart failure blood test can improve the outcome of patients
      presenting to the Emergency Department with shortness of breath.

      We hypothesise that a BNP test performed in real-time in patients presenting to the Emergency
      Department with shortness of breath will help identify additional patients with CHF and
      consequently to change practice and allow more patients to recieve correct treatment earlier.</summary>
