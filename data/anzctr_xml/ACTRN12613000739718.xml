    <interventions>Participants will provide 2 blood samples during the course of the study for validation of a blood-based test for EGFR mutation.  
Blood samples will be collected before drug therapy and another taken between 14 to 21 days after drug therapy has commenced.
Blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory where DNA is extracted and analysed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is exploring whether a blood test might be a feasible additional or alternative diagnostic test to a biopsy in patients with lung cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma of the lung. You should have had a lung tissue biopsy that is archived and available for testing, or be a candidate for a new biopsy.

Trial details
All participants in this study will provide 2 blood samples (one before drug therapy and another taken between 14 to 21 days after drug therapy has commenced) to be tested for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation using a new test kit. The results of this test will be compared to the EGFR mutation status reported via tissue testing for those patients where this information is available.  Knowledge of EGFR gene status (positive or negative) can help guide treatment decisions.

Based on these results we aim to determine whether the blood test is a feasible alternative or additional approach to a 'traditional' biopsy in evaluating EGFR mutation status.</summary>
