  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pressure oscillation (PO) superimposed to a standard continous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for the treatment of sleep apnoea.
a) Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the standard treatment for obsructive sleep apnea.  CPAP is a pressure applied through a mask by a constant flow that allows to open the upperairway during sleep. In this study we will test if small fluctuations in air pressure superimposed to a standard CPAP allows a better control of apneas during sleep. Thus, participants will undergo polysomnography for 2 consecutive nights.
b) Patients will sleep one night in the sleep laboratory with their standard CPAP and one night with the new device, incorporating a superimposed  pressure oscillation to the CPAP, in a random order. A polysomnography will be performed during the studied nights to monitor sleep and respiratory parameters. Participants will undergo polysomnography for 2 consecutive nights
c) During the CPAP night patients will receve their habitual pressure. During the PO-CPAP night they will receive their habitual CPAP pressure +/- 1 cmH2O
d) The duration of the study will be 2 nights: participants will be using standard CPAP for one night and PO-CPAP in one night. 
e) Patients will be monitored and assisted during the entire night by a specialized polysomnography technician</interventions>
