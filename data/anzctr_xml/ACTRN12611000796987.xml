  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common problem in the elderly and undertreatment is a concern due to the perception by clinicians with regard to side-effects.  Amongst Geriatricians the cognitive side-effects are of particular concern and these drugs are relatively contraindicated in cognitive impairment. Treatment is often tailored to individual needs and comorbidities and there is no standard treatment for overactive bladder for this cohort.

Where the drug is clinically indicated, there is anecdotal evidence that Geriatricians will prescribe solifenacin rather than oxybutynin due to theoretically less impact on cognitive function.  Unfortunately trial evidence examining the cognitive impact of these drugs is lacking. 

This investigator initiated pilot study is designed to explore the cognitive effects of two different treatment licensed treatments for OAB, namely solifenacin and oxybutynin patch.  Efficacy and tolerability will be assessed as secondary outcomes.  The oxybutynin patch has been chosen over oral oxybutynin as the frequency of side-effects is recognised to be lower.  There is no placebo as such, but cognition and bladder function will be assessed following significant washout periods during the study.

A cross-over design has been chosen over a parallel group study for this pilot study as the numbers for a parallel group study would be prohibitively large and our design allows good within subject comparisons of cognition.  It is reasonable to conduct this pilot as currently there is only one cognitive study looking at single doses of solifenacin in healthy elderly people, which showed solifenacin was not associated with cognitive impairment. We speculate that solifenacin will have less effect on cognition than oxybutynin patch with repeat dosing in healthy elderly female volunteers.  

The proposed dose of solifenacin used is based on available clinical data that shows most of the dose-response is achieved at 5mg while the use of 10mg dose is more likely associated with adverse effect .  There is minimal additional clinical benefit from 10mg compared to 5mg. The use of 3.9mg transdermal patch is supported by a placebo, controlled dose escalation trial.

Subjects will be recruited from the Womens Health Centre outpatient clinic at the RAH or through advertisement.  To participate in this trial, all subjects will meet criteria for treatment with these agents.  They will be female, age 60 or above with overactive bladder syndrome who have not been on treatment or been off treatment for one month.  There will be periods with no treatment during the initial run-in and between treatments in order to establish baseline bladder and cognitive function - this will be discussed with patients prior to commencing the clinical trial.  The subjects will have the opportunity to try two different treatment for OAB. 
 

Possible risks that can occur in subjects include the following:
Study drugs: Adverse effects listed in product information for solifenacin and oxybutynin
Blood sampling: Discomfort, bruising or infection on the venipuncture site 
Cognitive testing: Mental fatigue and potential distress</summary>
