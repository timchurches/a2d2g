          -  Recovered from any surgical procedure(s).

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 55 ml/min using the Cockcroft-Gault formula: Cr Cl

             computer tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan may be included only
             if he/she is asymptomatic on neurologic exam and is not receiving corticosteroid
             therapy to control symptoms.

          -  Concurrent active cancer, including cancer stable on adjuvant therapy.

          -  Prior immunotherapy, biological therapy or chemotherapy for SCLC.

          -  Radiotherapy: Prior radiation to non-symptomatic or non-life-threatening sites.Prior
             radiation therapy to all potential indicator lesions. Prior radiation therapy to some
             but not all indicator lesions is allowed.

          -  Class III or IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association
             Classification.

          -  History of allergic reactions to appropriate diuretics or antiemetics (e.g., 5-HT3
             antagonists) to be administered in conjunction with protocol-directed chemotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To demonstrate an increase in overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed extended
      stage small cell lung cancer when treated with SR48692 versus placebo, after an initial
      response (complete or partial response or stable) to first line cisplatin plus etoposide.

      Primary objective: comparison of overall survival between patients in the control arm and the
      meclinertant arm.

      Secondary objectives: comparison of the progression free survival, the time to progression,
      the clinical benefit, the quality of life, the toxicity and safety between patients in the
      control arm and the meclinertant arm.</summary>
