    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of metformin. As such, it is not specifically powered to assess efficacy. However, assuming a clinically meaningful response to metformin therapy with a 3 point reduction in the Mayo score compared to a 1 point reduction in the placebo group, assuming a standard deviation in both groups of 1, a power of 80% and confidence interval of 95% recruitment of 20 patients in the active arm and 10 in the placebo arm is adequately powered to detect if there is a meaningful clinical response to metformin treatment in UC.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assess the safety of Metformin and how well it works in patients with active Ulcerative Colitis. Metformin is approved in Australia to treat Type 2 Diabetes and has been used for over 50 years. 
In addition its effect on blood glucose metformin has more recently been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, which are important in the activity and severity of ulcerative colitis. Metformin may have a therapeutic benefit in ulcerative colitis via this anti-inflammatory effect.
