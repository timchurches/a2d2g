  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Participant contracts the quadriceps muscle and scores their experienced pain according to VAS.
Arm 2: Participant contracts the quadriceps muscle and scores their experienced pain according to VAS.
Arm 3: Participant contracts the quadriceps muscle and scores their experienced pain according to VAS.
Arm 4: Participant contracts the quadriceps muscle and scores their experienced pain according to VAS.
Each contraction will be held for 5 seconds and the contractions will be performed 3 times for each arm.
There will be a 15 minute wash-out period between each arm.</interventions>

The experimentally-induced deep tissue pain will be induced by inducing DOMS in our subject's quadricep's muscles. This will be done at the first session, 48 hours prior to the testing session. DOMS will be achieved by taking the subjects through a specific protocol involving several repetitions of eccentric contractions of the quadricpes muscle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Testing will involve the participants contracting their affected quadriceps muscle, and reporting their experienced level of pain. This will be done at 15 minute intervals for the duration of one hour, 48 hours after the eccentric exercise protocol.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prior to our research study, we need to perform a pilot study to ensure the stability of the intensity of the DOMS in our subjects over a period of 1 hour, so that any changes recorded in intensity of DOMS during the main study may not be attributed to the factor of time. These data will be used to calculate the sample size in the main study.</summary>
