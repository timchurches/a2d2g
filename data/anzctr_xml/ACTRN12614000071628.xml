    <statisticalmethods>There will be two strata  infratentorial (vertebrobasilar +/- PCA territories) and supratentorial stroke. The primary outcome will be the absolute growth in diffusion MRI lesion volume between initial (post-endovascular therapy) and 3-5 day MRI, adjusted for baseline volume (median regression analysis). The volumetric measurement of diffusion MRI lesions will be performed by a blinded investigator. Given the lack of data to estimate effect size we have calculated sample size based on precision estimates. The standard deviation of absolute growth measures in similar patients (EPITHET study) was approximately 20mL. With 16 patients in each arm of the study, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in infarct growth would be +/- 10mL which we believe to be reasonable precision for this study. 
Secondary safety outcomes include symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (blood clot with mass effect occupying &gt;30% of infarcted territory (PH2) associated with =4 point increase in NIHSS occurring within 36hr of treatment) and radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Exploratory analyses will include correlation of infarct growth with area under curve of the temperature actually achieved during the 48hr of hypothermia, median change in NIHSS from baseline to day 3-5 and day 90 and ordinal analysis of the mRS at day 90 for the purposes of power calculation for future studies.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothermia has great promise as a cytoprotective therapy after stroke given clinical benefit in other brain injury scenarios and animal models of stroke. THAIS is a pilot randomized trial of hypothermia (cooling) versus standard care that focuses on patients with major stroke who have undergone rapid, successful recanalization. This group often demonstrates initial improvement in brain imaging (diffusion MRI) followed by later re-appearance of the lesion which likely reflects a secondary injury. If hypothermia can reduce this secondary injury it has great potential to improve patient outcomes after severe stroke  a patient group that currently have very few treatment options.  </summary>
