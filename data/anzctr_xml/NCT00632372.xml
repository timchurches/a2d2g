  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to collect and analyze electrical measurements, timing, and
      signals from a CRT-D device in heart failure patients who either already have an implanted
      left atrial pressure sensor or will undergo a simultaneous implantation of a left atrial
      pressure sensor and a CRT-D device. These devices may be placed at the same time or
      separately (staged procedure) at the discretion of the investigator. A comparison will be
      made between the information gathered from the CRT-D system and the information gathered by
      the left atrial pressure sensor.</summary>
