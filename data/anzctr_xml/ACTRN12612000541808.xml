    <healthcondition>Pain and discomfort in relation to the fitting of orthodontic fixed appliances (braces) to patients between the ages of 14 and 19</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Analgesic medications (provided as as a single oral tablet for each dose)

NOTE: All tablets prepared in this study will be identical in size, shape and colour (ibuprofen, acetaminophen and placebo tablets)

400mg Ibuprofen 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)

500mg Acetaminophen 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group takes placebo tablet (identical in size, shape and colour to the other tablets in the analgesia groups) 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To ascertain a difference firstly between the placebo and the analgesics for the prevention of orthodontic pain in relation to fitting of braces.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will record their level of discomfort on a 100mm visual analogue scale over a 7 day period

T1: 2 hours after fitting of braces
T2: 6 hours after fitting of braces
T3: At night of fitting of braces
T4: 24 hours after fitting of braces
T5: 2 days after fitting of braces
T6: 3 days after fitting of braces
T7: 7 days after fitting of braces

To collect the number of patients it is anticipated it will take approximately 18months.

The collection of 185 patients, allowing for drop out, after performing a power calculation factoring in studies of similar design, will more than provide a statistical significance in relation to the primary outcome.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondly, to detect a difference between the two analgesic medications (ibuprofen and acetaminophen) for the prevention of orthodontic pain in relation to fitting of braces.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will record their level of discomfort on a 100mm visual analogue scale over a 7 day period

T1: 2 hours after fitting of braces

To collect the number of patients it is anticipated it will take approximately 18months.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>It is anticipated at least 185 subjects will be recruited. Consecutive patients who meet the following criteria will be recruited:

1. subject to be between the ages of 14 and 19 years old at the commencement of treatment

2. subject agrees, with consent of parent/guardian, to follow a strict analgesia protocol (see inclusion criteria 6.) during the first 48 hours of full fixed orthodontic therapy;

3. subject agrees, with consent of parent/guardian,  to complete a 100mm VAS at predetermined intervals within the first week of full fixed orthodontic therapy as follows:

T1: 2 hours after fitting of braces
T2: 6 hours after fitting of braces
T3: At night of fitting of braces
T4: 24 hours after fitting of braces
T5: 2 days after fitting of braces
T6: 3 days after fitting of braces
T7: 7 days after fitting of braces

4. subject to begin full orthodontic fixed appliance therapy as per the following appliance protocols:

0.022-inch slot MBT Low Profile Victory Series brackets
014 inch NiTi RMO Thermalloy plus archwires
Elastomeric modules

5. subject to have had no dental extractions in the previous two weeks prior to the fitting of fixed appliances

6. subject and parent/guardian consents to a randomly assigned analgesia protocol  according to the following groups:

A) 400mg Ibuprofen 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)

B) 500mg Acetaminophen 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)

C) Control group takes placebo 1hr prior to ligating the orthodontic arch wire to the braces using elastomeric modules (taking appoximately 5mins) and continuing on regular dosages as prescribed (as per therapeutic guidelines 4 hourly) for first 48hrs after band-up (the process of attaching the orthodontic braces or brackets to the teeth - takes approximately 30 minutes)</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Each subject will be informed of the study at the time of inital orthodontic consultation.  After which, the subject and parent/guardian(s) will be asked at their next appointment if they are happy and consent to participating in the study.

After completing the patient consent form, patient's will be assigned a "Patient study number".

The Pharmacy preparing the medications has been given a randomisation table (block randomisation) for 185 patients.  The pharmacy will return the medications to the orthodontic practice without a description of the patient's allocated medication (blinded) just their patient study number and their name / DOB.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>All patients will receive the same type of orthodontic treatment from the same practice. Three orthodontists will provide this treatment. The medicines produced by the pharmacy will be in tablet form; all the same size, colour and shape.</designfeatures>
