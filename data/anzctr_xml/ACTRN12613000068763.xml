  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although intramuscular injections of androgen's are known to be effective, they result in varying degrees of pain at the injection site that may last for a day or two. These injections need to be given into a precise location of the buttocks and require staff with expert training. 
 
Unlike many other injections these cannot be self-injected due to the difficulty of safely injecting into the buttocks. A SC injection, if effective, may be given by yourself in your own home, which would be more convenient to avoid extra medical visits as well as saving GP and hospital resources.

Many men who require androgen replacement therapy may have bleeding disorders or are on medications that may intentionally slow the ability of their blood to clot. These men have a theoretical risk of bleeding and a very large bruise deep in an important muscle may later become infected and cause significant disability. As a result men using these anti-clotting drugs are usually prescribed other forms of androgen replacement therapy that are not always optimal. A SC injection, if effective, may be used in these men.
 
Nandrolone decanoate (ND) Subcutaneous (SC) will be trialed in healthy volunteers,with a historical, intramuscular (IM) control data set.
This is the first stage of a 2 stage research study
