    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Folic Acid 4 mg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Folic Acid 4 mg - Folic Acid 1.0 mg x 4 tablets will be taken daily by oral administration. The majority of women in the study will routinely take 1.0 mg folic acid in a prenatal vitamin supplement, as recommended by their primary obstetrical provider; the study requirements do not require that participants change their practice. Therefore the actual total daily dose may be up to 5.1 mg of folic acid

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Women will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to folic acid 4.0 mg or placebo


Treatment: drugs: Folic Acid 4 mg
Folic Acid 1.0 mg or placebo x 4 tablets will be taken daily by oral administration. The majority of women in the study will routinely take 1.0 mg folic acid in a prenatal vitamin supplement, as recommended by their primary obstetrical provider; the study requirements do not require that participants change their practice. Therefore the actual total daily dose may be up to 5.1 mg of folic acid
