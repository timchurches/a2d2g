    <interventions>Ninety patients  20-60 yr old American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) physical status I or II, scheduled for femur surgery  under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups of 30 each. The magnesium group (groupM) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with 0.5ml magnesium 10%,The fentanyl group (group F) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with0.5 ml fentanyl[25microgram] and The placebo group (group  P) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water(intrathecally) for each three groups 5 minutes prior to surgery)</interventions>

    <concealment>Enrollment is decided and permission of the patient is obtained by two of the anesthesiologists during preoperative rounding,.This is a double blinded clinical trial, with blinding of both the patient and the administrating practitioner to the anaesthetic type. Allocation will be managed by a Resident external to the project. The blinding will occur through use of equal amounts of pretreatment drugs (3.5mlâ€™s) Each syringe will be labeled A ,B,C according to its contents. . The drug syringes are handed over to anesthesiologists blinded to the patient allocation to carry out the spinal of anesthesia</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective :Magnesium has been suggested that NMDA  (N-methyl D-aspartate)receptor antagonists induce preemptive analgesia when administrated before tissue injury occurs, thus decreasing the subsequent sensation of pain.
 Methods:Following Ethics Committee approval and informed patients consent, Ninety patients  20-60 yr old ASA physical status I or II, scheduled for femur surgery  under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups of 30 each. The magnesium group (groupM) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with 0.5ml magnesium 10%,the fentanyl group (group F) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with0.5 ml fentanyl[25microgram] and the placebo group (group  P) received bupivacaine 15mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water intrathecally . Time to first requirement of analgesic supplement, Sensory block onset time, maximum sensory level , onset of motor block, duration of blockade, hemodynamics variables, the incidence of hypotension, ephedrine requirements, bradycardia ,hypoxemia [Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2)&lt;90], postoperative analgesic requirements and Adverse events, such as sedation, dizziness , Pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded.   Patients were instructed preoperatively in the use of the verbal rating scale (VRS) from 0 to 10 (0no pain, 10maximum imaginable pain)  for pain assessment. If the VRS exceeded four and  the patient requested a supplement analgesic, methadon5 mg intravenously , was to be given for post-operative pain relief as needed .</summary>
