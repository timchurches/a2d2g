  <interventions>
    <interventions>Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) with dual focus magnification are endoscopic imaging technologies which can be utilized with a switch of a button on the endoscope. Images can then be obtained which may enable better visualization of the Barretts segment. These are non invasive technologies where the light at the end of the endoscope changes to a more narrow wave length light which could improve visualization of vasculature which can be more pronounced in early neoplasia. Patients will either receive the white light endoscopy (WLE) examination followed by examination with NBI or examination with the NBI followed by WLE. Any suspicious areas detected by both modalities will be documented (location and distance from incisors) and subsequently further assessed with Narrow Band Imaging with Dual Focus (NBI-DF) where optical biopsies/ interpretation of the histology will be made in real time. Targeted biopsies will then be taken. This will then be followed by random 4 quadrant biopsies on WLE. The time taken to perform the examination on NBI and NBI-DF as well as time taken to perform the examination on WLE will be documented. All images with all modalities will be recorded and stored in high definition files. All biopsies corresponding to the imaged areas on all modalities will be documented, labeled separately and sent for blinded histopathological examination. 
The addition of Narrow Band Imaging and dual focus magnification (to white light endoscopy) may increase the procedure time by up to 5 minutes in addition to the standard of care (see below comparetor/control treatment).
The number of times that the test will be undertaken by the patient, will be only once at the baseline procedure. </interventions>
    <comparator>White light endoscopy and random biopsies are the standard of care for patients who undergo surveillance endoscopy. The duration of the procedure is no longer than what is practiced presently and can vary from patient to patient. The procedure generally takes about 5-10 minutes. </comparator>

    <concealment>All suitable patients with known Barrett's Oesophagus (BE) presenting for surveillance or referred for further workup of dysplasia and early cancer will be initially seen in the outpatients clinic, informed of the study by the Endoscopists performing the procedure and a research nurse/assistant and be provided with a patient information sheet and consent form. Demographics such as age, gender, indication, duration of BE diagnosis will be collected once consent is obtained.
 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation)will be utilised in the study.
Randomization (1:1) with opaque sealed envelopes will then be performed by the research nurse/assistant who will be present throughout the procedure documenting the relevant data.

    <statisticalmethods>The calculated prevalence of dysplasia with a cohort of patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy and referred for further assessment of dysplasia and early cancer is 17%.  For a power of 80% with a 0.05% significance and an incremental gain of 30% with NBI and NBI-DF (note: WLE: presumed 60% of dysplasia detected, NBI+NBI-DF: 90%); a total of 182 patients will need to be recruited (Controlled Clin. Trials, 1997; 18:274). 
Analyses of the data collected will then be conducted using the SPSS and STATA software.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> This project will examine the utility of a novel endoscopic imaging device (Narrow Band Imaging  NBI) and compare this technology against the present standard of care in patients with a chronic premalignant condition known as Barrett's Oesophagus. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18-85 years and are scheduled to undergo surveillance endoscopy for Barretts Oesophagus (BE), or have been referred for further assessment of dysplasia/early cancer in BE. 
Study details: Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive standard care, which consists of white light endoscopy (WLE) and random biopsies followed by examination with NBI and NBI and dual focus magnification (NBI-DF). Participants in the other group, will receive an examination with NBI and with NBI-DF in addition to standard care. NBI and NBI-DF are endoscopic imaging technologies which can be utilized with a switch of a button on the endoscope. Images can then be obtained which may enable better visualization of the Barretts segment. These are non invasive technologies where the light at the end of the endoscope changes to a more narrow wave length light which could improve visualization of vasculature which can be more pronounced in early neoplasia. Targeted and random biopsies will then be taken. Endoscopy results will be compared to histology to determine whether NBI and NBI-DF can improve the detection of precursors of cancer or early cancer which may enable earlier and less invasive interventions for these patients. 
All patients will receive the same treatments,but in a random order.</summary>
