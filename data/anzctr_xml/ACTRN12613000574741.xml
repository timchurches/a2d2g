  <interventions>
    <interventions>The education is based on an comprehensive literature review for current best evidence and identification of key resources and will cover topics surrounding health literacy, including definitions of health literacy, how it affects consumer healthcare and the healthcare system, why it is important for pharmacists and pharmacy staff to be aware of health literacy. The education will also cover methods to overcome health literacy problems with consumers, including particular communication techniques and strategies that allow for more effective information exchange to improve consumer understanding. Training will employ the use of computer based presentations and paper handouts which will be delivered in workshops run both on university premises and within the pharmacy premises. A select number of participants will receive computer-based training.
The initial training will occur once, with a duration of 4 to 5 hours. 
For both Groups 1 and 2, the in-house pharmacy training will be delivered in six 30 minute sessions over a period of 12 weeks. This training will commence within 1-2 weeks after the initial training has occurred for the in-pharmacy trainers.
The pharmacist leading the training will be asked to keep a log of staff attending the training. The research assistants will also monitor the frequency of training sessions within the pharmacy.
Group 1 is the face-to-face group which will receive the initial health literacy training as a face-to-face class. Group 2 is the computer-based group which will receive the initial health literacy training in a computer based, self-directed format. Group 3 is the control group, and will have access to the education program following the completion of the trial
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group (Group 3) will receive no intervention (ie the Health Literacy education program) during the study period. They will be offered the educational program after data collection for the intervention groups is complete. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the extent of the application of universal precautions for pharmacy consumers by pharmacy staff. This will be assessed using both consumer entry and exit questionnaires assessing consumer understanding of the information supplied to them by the pharmacist or pharmacy assistant. The second method of assessment will use four simulated patient visits (mystery shoppers) to act out scripted case vignettes in the pharmacy, then completing an evaluation form at the conclusion of the interaction. Two visits will occur prior to training, and two following the completion of all training.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed for 1 month before the intervention (May/June 2013)and for 1 month following the completion of the intervention (November 2013).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome is the measure of health literacy "friendliness" of the pharmacy as an organisation. This will be measured using an existing  questionnaire developed by the United States Agency for Healthcare Research Quality that the pharmacists in charge or managing pharmacist will complete as a self-assessment. This will be conducted prior to receiving the training and following the completion of all training. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed for 1 month before the intervention (May/June 2013)and for 1 month following the completion of the intervention (November 2013).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A further secondary outcome is the perception of the pharmacy as an organisation and its capacity to deliver services to people with limited health literacy. It will also gauge both knowledge and attitudes around health literacy.  This will be measured using a questionnaire that the pharmacists in charge or managing pharmacist will complete as a self-assessment. All other pharmacy staff will also complete a similar questionnaire as a self-assessment. This will be conducted prior to receiving the training and following the completion of all training.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed for 1 month before the intervention (May/June 2013)and for 1 month following the completion of the intervention (November 2013).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The study has been powered to detect a 10% increase in the use of universal precautions (5% to 15% of interactions). With a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05, it has been calculated that the study will require 480 consumers across the three arms. The sample size will be increased by 10-20% to take into account attrition. Intra-pharmacy clustering will also be taken into account.Relative risk measures of behavioural change after educational package delivery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pharmacists and pharmacy staff frequently deal with customers who have limited ability to understand information about their medicines and health care.  This project aims to adjust the services and counselling provided by pharmacists and pharmacy staff to accommodate the needs of people with low levels of health literacy without necessarily detecting health literacy issues.

The hypothesis for the study is that Australian pharmacists lack the ability to effectively communication with consumers who have health literacy issues, and are unaware of particular communication techniques to overcome health literacy barriers when interacting with consumers</summary>
