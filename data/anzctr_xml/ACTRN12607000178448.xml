    <interventions>The participants will be asked to consume 30g of three different forms (ground, sliced, whole) of hazelnuts each day for twelve weeks. For the first two weeks of the study, the participants will consume their normal diet (Baseline). After this two-week period, they will be randomly allocated to receive one form of the hazelnut for a four-week-period. This will be followed by a two-week washout period where they will not consume any study hazelnut or other nuts. They will then be allocated to receive a second form of hazelnut for four weeks. This again is followed by a two-week washout period. Lastly, they will receive the third form of hazelnut for a period of four weeks. The study lasts 18 weeks in total.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diets high in nuts with favourable fatty acid profiles and other bioactive substances such as phytochemicals can lower plasma cholesterol, and thus reduce the risk of CVD. Epidemiologic studies have consistently demonstrated an inverse association between nut consumption and CVD in different population groups. Numerous clinical studies have shown the cholesterol-lowering effects of several nuts, such as almonds, macademia nuts, peanuts, pecans, walnuts and various nuts. To date, there are only two human intervention trials that have investigated the effect of hazelnut supplementation on plasma cholesterol levels. 

Furthermore, the physical form in which the nuts are consumed may be important. One study has suggested that the cell walls of intact almond seeds hinder the release of lipid available for digestion, which could lead to a reduction in lipid bio-availability.  It is possible that the different forms of nuts may differ in lipid bio-availability and total antioxidant capacity, and thus, have differing effects on lipid and lipoprotein mediated risk factors for CVD.  Therefore, the aim of the FLASH study is to investigate the effects of incorporating three different forms (ground, sliced, whole) of hazelnuts into the usual diet on plasma lipids using a randomized, multiple crossover design.</summary>
