  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Prophylactic Antibiotic Regimens in Tumor Surgery (PARITY) trial is the first ever
      international multi-center randomized controlled trial in bone cancer surgery. In order to
      avoid amputation for bone cancer in the leg, complex limb-saving operations are performed.
      However, infections with devastating complications following surgery are common. Surgeons
      from across the world will randomize patients to receive either short- or long-duration
      antibiotic regimens after surgery with the goal of identifying the best regimen to reduce
      these infections.</summary>
