  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Ability to provide informed consent.

          2. Between 18 and 75 years of age.

          3. Have a primary melanoma that is cutaneous (including head, neck, trunk, extremity,
             scalp, palm, sole, subungual skin tissues).

          4. Have clear margins following WLE.

          5. ECOG performance status 0-1.

          6. Life expectancy of at least 10 years from the time of diagnosis, not considering the
             melanoma in question, as determined by the PI.

          7. Willing to return to the MSLT-II center for follow up examinations and procedures as
             outlined in the protocol.

          8. Randomization and/or CLND (as appropriate to randomization arm) must be completed no
             more than 120 days following the diagnostic biopsy of the primary melanoma.

          9. Have a melanoma-related tumor-positive SN, determined by either of the following
             methods:

               1. Diagnosis of tumor-positive SN by MSLT-II center institutional pathologist by
                  either H&amp;E or IHC (using S-100, Mart-1, and HMB-45).

               2. Diagnosis of tumor-positive SN by RT-PCR analysis performed at JWCI, provided the
                  primary melanoma fits into one of the following categories:

                    -  Breslow thickness of 1.20 mm or greater and Clark Level III

                    -  Clark Level IV or V, regardless of Breslow thickness

                    -  Ulceration, regardless of Breslow thickness or Clark level</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>75</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. History of previous or concurrent (i.e., second primary) invasive melanoma.

          2. Primary melanoma of the eye, ears, mucous membranes or internal viscera. (Primary of
             the skin of the external ear is acceptable.)

          3. Physical, clinical, radiographic or pathologic evidence of satellite, in-transit,
             regional, or distant metastatic disease.

          4. Any additional solid tumor or hematologic malignancy during the past 5 years except T1
             skin lesions of squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, or uterine cervical
             cancer.

          5. Skin grafts, tissue transfers or flaps that have the potential to alter the lymphatic
             drainage pattern from the primary melanoma to a LN basin.

          6. Allergy to vital blue dye or any radiocolloid.

          7. Inability to localize 1-2 SN drainage basins via LM (e.g., no basins found, more than
             2 basins found, proximity of the primary melanoma to the regional draining basin,
             etc.)

          8. CLNDs or SLs (before evaluation of the current melanoma) that may have altered the
             lymphatic drainage pattern from the primary cutaneous melanoma to a potential LN
             basin.

          9. Organic brain syndrome or significant impairment of basal cognitive function or any
             psychiatric disorder that might preclude participation in the full protocol, or be
             exacerbated by therapy (e.g., severe depression).

         10. Melanoma-related operative procedures not corresponding to criteria described in the
             protocol.

         11. Primary or secondary immune deficiencies or known significant autoimmune disease.

         12. History of organ transplantation.

         13. Oral or parenteral immunosuppressive agents (not topical or inhaled steroids) at any
             time during study participation or within 6 months prior to enrollment.

         14. Pregnant or lactating women.

         15. Participation in concurrent therapy protocols of alternative local nodal basin
             therapies that might confound the analysis of this trial is not permitted. For
             example, radiation of a non-resected node basin is not acceptable because it might
             influence outgrowth of residual melanoma in that nodal basin. However, systemic
             adjuvant therapy or clinical trial adjuvant protocols after the finding of a positive
             node on LM/SL or delayed nodal recurrence in the ultrasound observation arm are both
             acceptable according to the standard of care at the multicenter site. Patients with
             positive sentinel nodes or thick primary melanomas who are considered by the
             multicenter site's investigator as high-risk may receive systemic adjuvant therapy
             according to the standard practice of that particular site.

         16. SLND pathology shows, on microscopic examination, that melanoma extends through the
             lymph node capsule into the adjacent soft tissue.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>Subjects must be diagnosed with melanoma. All subjects receive sentinel lymphadenectomy. If
      the subject is sentinel node positive and meets study requirements, the subject is randomized

      Subjects are then followed for 10 years.</summary>
