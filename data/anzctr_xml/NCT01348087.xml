  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - AFQ056

Experimental: AFQ056 100 mg (Bid) - All patients initiated treatment with AFQ056 at a starting dose of 25 milligram (mg) twice daily. The dose was titrated from 25mg bid to 50mg bid, 75mg bid and 100mg bid at weekly intervals. Dose adjustments (up- and down titrations) were permitted as needed to manage any tolerability issues and to ensure that patients reach their highest tolerated dose not to exceed 100mg bid.


Treatment: drugs: AFQ056
The investigational drug, AFQ056, will be provided as hard gelatin capsules. Two different oral dosage strengths, identical in appearance, will be used.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). - Adverse events were summarized for the open-label treatment period, where the open-label treatment period is defined based on how AEs were collected and reported according to the manner in which patients entered the current study and which treatment (AFQ056 or placebo) they were receiving in the previous study. AEs which were continuing from the core study or that started after the end of core study but prior to first dose of open-label study medication in the extension study for Category 1 patients are shown under ('Prior to Ext. first dose'). AEs which started during the open-label treatment period are presented based on the last AFQ056 dose taken on or before the onset date of the AE (25 mg bid; 50 mg bid; 75 mg bid; or 100 mg bid). No efficacy data presented as study was terminated</outcome>

          -  Had to have completed the CAFQ056A2212 study or another study of AFQ056 which included

          -  Females of child-bearing potential had to follow protocol requirements with respect to
             contraception.

          -  Have a caregiver or caregivers who spent, on average, at least six hours per day with
             the patient, who were willing and capable of supervising treatment, providing input

             with FXS but enrollment into the current study was delayed for more than a week.

          -  Discontinued prematurely from Study CAFQ056A2212 or another study of AFQ056 which
             included adult patients with FXS due to intolerability of the dosage in the patient's
             assigned treatment group.

             contraception.
