    <interventions>This is a patient reported outcome study using a validated questionnaire as instrument. Patients have had cataract removal and intraocular lens implantation (these include any commercially available models used at the study recruitment sites) at least 3 months prior. Patients will be asked to observe their vision quality for 1 week and answer questions that provided to them by the questionnaire. </interventions>
    <comparator>The same questionnaire will be used on randomly selected patients with intraocular lenses of various types and models. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Quality of Vision (QoV) questionnaire is a validated Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument. It consists of 10 questions on different types of visual disturbances (e.g. blurring, haloes, double vision, etc.). Each item has 3 corresponding questions regarding the Frequency, Severity and Bothersome, resulting in a 30-item questionnaire.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>The instrument will be presented and explained to the subjects at minimum of 3 months after cataract removal and intraocular lens implantation surgery. They will then be send home with the questionnaire. They will be asked to return to the clinic 1 week after and the questionnaire will be administered at the clinic by the study staff for 3 times. First for the left eye, second for the right eye and third for binocular experience. After this visit, it is considered that patient completed the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The QoV measures positive dysphotopsia but not negative dysphotopsia which is pertinent to any IOL study. A separate part of questionnaire composed of 3 questions will be used to measure negative dysphotopsia." These 3 questions have been designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The instrument will be presented and explained to the subjects at minimum of 3 months after cataract removal and intraocular lens implantation surgery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cataract surgery with Intraocular lens implantation is one of the most common surgical procedures. In the past several years, the development of new technology IOL has added optical design features to help improve patient visual functions. There have been associated visual disturbances with some of these design features hence it is important to characterize the patients quality of vision after cataract surgery and IOL implantation.
In this study, we evaluate vision quality of subjects with different IOL systems using a validated quality of vision questionnaire* as the main outcome measure. </summary>
