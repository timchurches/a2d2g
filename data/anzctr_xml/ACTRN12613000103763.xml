  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete 5 lessons of an Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)-based program (the Wellbeing Course) focusing on the management of symptoms of anxiety, depression and disability. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people who are doing dialysis with symptoms of depression and anxiety, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive email and weekly reminder phone calls by a clinical psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails and phone calls is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Screening questionnaires will be administered at recruitment.  Study questionnaires will be administered at pre-program, post-program, and at 3-months post-program. These will take about 10-20 minutes to complete.</interventions>
