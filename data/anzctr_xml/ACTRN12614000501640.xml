  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will enrol patients into the study. At enrolment the patient will have an ultrasound to see if they have a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). If they have a DVT they will be excluded from the study. They will have a second ultrasound at discharge to look for an upper limb DVT.  If a patient is found to have an upper limb DVT, they will be treated with the standard DVT protocol. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size estimates were based on the results of previous studies conducted on the prevalence of upper limb DVT in patients with malignancy who received central lines and PICC lines. We estimated that the expected prevalence of DVT is 20%. Using the sample size calculation, it was estimated that for a 95% confidence interval of 15-25% a sample size of 246 participants was required. For 95% CI of 10-30% a sample size of 62 participants will be our aim.

Data analysis will be performed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics will be generated. Parametric data will be expressed as means +/- standard deviations while the non-parametric data will be expressed as medians and quartile ranges.
Dichotomous variables will be analysed using the chi squared test. Dichotomous versus continuous variables will be analysed using the t tests if the data is parametric, and Mann-Whitney if the data is non parametric.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To investigate the relationship between dorsal hand/forearm cannulas and the development of an upper limb
DVT in high risk surgical patients.
Our sample size population will include 75 high risk patients (sample size of 62 + 10% for attrition) . Inclusion
criteria are patients with an underlying malignancy, thrombophilias, previous surgery/trauma and over 65 years of
age. As part of the inclusion criteria all patients will receive standard DVT prophylaxis surgery and have baseline
bloods performed including a FBC,LFT, U+E and INR.Patients with a previous upper limb DVT, previous neck
surgery/mastectomy/axillary clearance and thoracic outlet syndrome were excluded. Ultrasounds will be performed
at enrolment (which is part of normal patient care) and at discharge to identify an upper limb DVT. Patients
found to have an upper limb DVT will be placed on DVT protocol for treatment and will be followed up for 30 days for continuing management and monitoring of complications.</summary>
