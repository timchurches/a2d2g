    <interventions>Other interventions - Administration of the malaria inoculum
Treatment: drugs - Piperaquine Phosphate 480 mg

Experimental: Piperaquine Phosphate after infected blood malaria challenge - Volunteers will receive a dose of 480 mg piperaquine phosphate (PQP) approx. 7 days after a challenge with P. falciparum infected red blood cells. The effects of PQP on gametocyte carriage (assessed by PCR) and infectivity to mosquitos after direct and indirect feeding on blood from volunteers will be assessed.


Other interventions: Administration of the malaria inoculum
Each participant in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~2,800 viable parasites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously. The threshold for commencement of treatment will be when PCR quantification of all participants is = 5,000 parasites/mL.

Treatment: drugs: Piperaquine Phosphate 480 mg
When PCR quantification of all participants is = 5,000 parasites/mL, participants will receive a single dose of 480 mg Piperaquine Phosphate

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Successful infection of vector mosquitoes following both direct and indirect feeding on the blood of infected participants - Seven to ten days after blood feeding, mosquitoes will be dissected to check for oocysts in midgut preparations. For permanent preparations, oocysts will be stained with 0.1% mercurochrome in PBS for 5 to 60 mins then fixed in 1%glutaraldehyde or formaldehyde. Oocysts will be counted per mosquito dissected and recorded. Relationship between parasitemia, gametocytemia and mosquito infection (both oocyst prevalence and intensity) will be determined using generalized-linear mixed models. The number of mosquitoes dying prior to dissection will be recorded.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-centre, open-label study using P. falciparum-induced blood stage malaria
      (IBSM) infection to assess the infectivity of sexual life cycle stages of the malaria
      parasite (gametocytes) to mosquito vectors. Previous clinical studies have shown that
      treatment of participants with the antimalarial drug piperaquine, in addition to effectively
      clearing asexual (pathogenic) stages of the malaria life cycle, induces the production of
      gametocytes in the blood. The propensity of piperaquine to induce gametocytemia will be
      employed in this study to assess gametocyte infectivity to Anopheles mosquitoes. For this
      purpose, experimental mosquito feeding directly on participants and artificial membrane
      mosquito feeding will be performed. The study will be conducted in 3 cohorts (n=2 per
      cohort). Subsequent cohorts will not commence until at least after day 28 of the previous
      cohort and review by Safety Review Team. This interval will also allow cohorting of
      experimental infection of mosquitoes to optimise logistics and enable iterative improvements
      in the system if applicable.</summary>
