  <interventions>
    <interventions>MoodGYM is an online, interactive program delivering cognitive behaviour therapy. The program consists of five modules which take between 20 and 40 minutes to complete. However, participants can choose to spend as much or as little time as they which in a given session. Module 1: Feelings. Helps participants identify negative thinking patterns. Module 2: Thoughts. Helps people identify inaccurate and biased ways of thinking. Module 3: Unwarping. Helps participants change their negative and biased habitual thinking patterns. Module 4: De-stressing. Provides participants with stress management and relaxation techniques. Module 5: Relationships. To help participants cope with difficult relationships, and the ending of relationships.

Throughout the program, participants also complete depression and anxiety questionnaires with feedback so they may see their progress. Participants complete one module per week at their own pace. Each module must be completed before participants can go on to the next module.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current project is a randomised controlled trial of online cognitive behaviour therapy (MoodGYM) to prevent postnatal depression in at-risk women. To date, there have not been broad scale, cost-effective prevention programs for postnatal depression that have been effective. While the MoodGYM is effective in the wider community, it has never been used in a postnatal population. Although women will need an internet connection to access MoodGYM, major barriers, such as childcare, lack of time, stigma and low clinician availability are all overcome with this intervention. The prevention of postnatal depression in a way that is acceptable to mothers could have the potential to reduce the burden of the most common complication of the perinatal period. Prevention of this illness will result in better outcomes, not just for mothers, but for their infants and families as well.</summary>
