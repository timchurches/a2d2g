    <interventions>Placebo-controlled, First-In-Human study assessing the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PRN2246.  

Part A
Up to 48 participants in 5 cohorts will take part in Part A of the study.  Participants in Part A will receive a single dose of PRN2246 liquid formulation. Planned doses in Part A are Cohort A1 7.5mg, Cohort A2 15mg, Cohort A3 30mg, Cohort A4 60mg, and Cohort A5 120mg..  Participants in Part A will receive the liquid formulation whilst fasting with the exception of 1 cross over cohort that will receive the liquid formulation administered with and without food (with up to a 7 day washout between doses).

Part B
Up to 50 participants in up to 4 cohorts will take part in Part B of the study. Participants in Part B of the study will receive one dose of PRN2246 liquid formulation per day for 10 days (doses to be assigned based on data from Part A).  Planned doses in Part B are Cohort B1 7.5mg, Cohort B2 15mg, Cohort B3 30mg, Cohort B4 60mg.

Dose escalation to subsequent cohorts in Part A and B will occur following review of the safety, tolerability, and available PK/PD information from the previous dose level.  Dose levels may be adjusted based on emerging safety, tolerability, and PK data.

Study subjects will be domiciled during the study and adherence to the dosing regimen will be monitored by study staff observations, notes.  Accurate dose and accountability will be checked before and after dosing.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Placebo oral dose solution is an aqueous solution of 15% Hydroxypropyl Betadex, 1.0% sucralose and sterile water.  Placebo for PRN2246 will be administered to subjects assigned to placebo treatment in Part A and Part B in the same volume at each dose level as active PRN2246.  Subjects will be randomized to Active or Placebo in a 3-to-1 ratio.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability, including the assessment of physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory results, and adverse events</outcome>
      <timepoint>Part A - Single dose administration

Safety and tolerability of PRN2246 will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs and AEs at regular intervals for 7 days following administration of a single dose of PRN2246

Adverse Events will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, immediately following dosing and at 15 and 30 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 (Day 2), 36, and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and Day 7. 

Vital Signs will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 (Day 2), and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and Day 7. 

ECGs will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, 15 and 30 minutes, and 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 (Day 2), and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and Day 7. 

Clinical Laboratory Test Results will be assessed pre-dose (Day 1), and at 24 and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and Day 7. 

Part B - Repeat dose administration

Safety and tolerability of PRN2246 will be assessed by monitoring vital signs, laboratory tests, ECGs and AEs at regular intervals for 7 days following administration of a single dose of PRN2246 daily for 10 days.

Adverse Events will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, immediately following dosing and at 15 and 30 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 (Day 2), 36, and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and throughout dosing on Day 4 through Day 10, and on Days 11, 12 and Day 17. 

Vital Signs will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 (Day 2) hours post-dose, and on Days 3 through 12 and Day 17. 

ECGs will be assessed pre-dose Day 1, 15 and 30 minutes, and 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 (Day 2), and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and on Day 10 at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 (Day 11), and 48 (Day 12) hours post-dose and Day 17. 

Clinical Laboratory results will be assessed pre-dose (Day 1), and at 24 and 48 (Day 3) hours post-dose, and Days 4, 7, 10, 12, and Day 17.
