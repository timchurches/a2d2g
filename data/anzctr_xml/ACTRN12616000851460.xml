  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of 8 sessions of systematically progressed exercises/activities synchronised to rhythmic auditory stimuli including music. 
The 8 intervention sessions will be no more than 1 hour in duration and will be delivered by experienced physiotherapists two times/week for 4 weeks in participants' own homes.
Each session will consist of 5 Sections of about 8 minutes each including rests (listening to music) as often as needed.
Auditory cues will be set at the comfortable pace cadence from the baseline gait assessment.
1.) Warmup - gentle range of motion exercises
2.) Seated "walking" +/arm swing
3.) Stand and toetap/step
4.) Walk on the Spot
5.) Walk in a straight line
Over the course of the 4 week intervention period the activities may be varied according to participant progress/tolerance.
Variations may include verbal or tactile cues, different musical pieces, auditory cues set at 10% faster than baseline cadence and cue fading with the participant aiming to maintain the rhythmic movement as cue volume is turned down.
Auditory cues will be played through an MP3 player and portable speaker with the volume determined by the participant but capped at a maximum level of 94 dB which has a safe continuous exposure time of one hour. 

Independent Practice Sessions
During the first intervention session, each participant will be given an MP3 player and headphones preloaded with about 15 minutes of music (some chosen with reference to personal preference). Participants will be asked to listen to this music for 15 minutes each day of the 4 week intervention period. They will be seated in their own comfortable chair and asked to focus on the rhythm of the music pieces and then move their arms and/or tap their toes to the beat. They will be asked to record their practice sessions on a diary record sheet.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to explore the effects of rhythmic music as an external cue for walking in people with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Music cued exercise has been shown to be effective in improving walking in people with Parkinson's disease and stroke. People with other degenerative neurological disorders may also benefit from this approach.
Twenty people (10 PSP / 10 AD) will undergo measures of walking using a pressure sensitive carpet at Latrobe University before and after an intervention which will consist of 8 home visit sessions of systematically progressed exercises synchronised to rhythmic music conducted by experienced physiotherapists.</summary>
