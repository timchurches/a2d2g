  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an observational study that is being carried out at King Hamad University Hospital (KHUH) in Bahrain.
Participants for the study included all patients scheduled to undergo Bariatric Surgery with a BMI of &gt;35. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 years old, or had a BMI of &lt; 35.

Data collected included patients age, gender, weight, height and comorbidities. Pre-operative Anaesthetic Assessment involves noting the procedure the patient is scheduled to undergo, concurrent illnesses, previous surgeries and history of receiving anaesthesia. Patients current medications and allergies are noted. Along with standard pre-operative Assessment, anaesthesiologists ensured recording different measurements including, Neck circumference, Mouth opening (Inter-incisor distance) and any teeth abnormalities. 

During the procedure, the position of the patient was noted, along with the induction agents used and size of scope used. Intra-operative assessment was assessed using the Intubation Difficulty Scale. The following factors were recorded and scored: number of attempts, number of operators, number of alternative techniques, Cormack grade, Use of lifting force, Need for laryngyeal pressure and Mobility of vocal cords.
