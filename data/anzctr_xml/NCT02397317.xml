  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The SPARK trial is testing the use of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring in prostate cancer
      patients being treated with Stereotactic Prostate Adaptive Radiotherapy. The researchers
      expect this trial to result in better targeted prostate cancer patient outcomes with lower
      toxicity. The potential application of Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring to other tumour
      sites will pave the way for additional trials with Australasian radiation oncology leading
      the world.</summary>
