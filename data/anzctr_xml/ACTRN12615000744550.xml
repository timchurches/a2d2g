    <studytitle>Effect of timing of kiwifruit ingestion relative to consumption of a breakfast cereal on the glycaemic response to the breakfast cereal</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Kiwifruit will be consumed by healthy subjects at different times before and after consuming a breakfast cereal in order to determine at which time point relative to the cereal ingestion, the kiwifruit is most effective at reducing the blood glucose response to the cereal</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be asked to consume a glycaemic (GI &gt; 70) breakfast cereal (60 g) after an overnight fast. They will also be asked to consume the edible portion of two gold kiwifruit (200 g) either at 11 h, or 90 min or 30 min before, or at the same time as, or 30 min after consuming the breakfast cereal (ie at 10 pm,  or 7.30 am or 8.30 am or 9.00 am or 9.30 am, with the cereal consumed at 9.00 am. Each time interval will be in a different session, with at least two days between sessions. Baseline blood glucose measurements will be taken immediately before the first food intake in the morning and at intervals afterward to allow blood glucose response profiles to be constructed for each occasion.
All consumed food is supplied and experimenter follows postprandial responses.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine how much the proximity of kiwifruit ingestion to ingestion of a glycaemic breakfast cereal affects the ability of the kiwifruit to reduce the blood glucose raising effect of the breakfast cereal. Kiwifruit (200 g edible portion) will be consumed 11 h, 90 min, and 30 min before, at the same time as, and 30 min after consuming the breakfast cereal. Blood glucose responses will be measured to allow calculation of the blood glucose response as the area under the blood glucose response curve.</summary>
