  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete moderate-intensity exercise on a treadmill. 
Exercise will last for 45 minutes (moderate intensity at 65% of VO2peak) and will last for 12 sessions over a two-week period at the Murdoch University exercise physiology laboratory.

An oral glucose tolerance test will be completed pre and post-training with blood samples taken every 30 minutes. Blood samples will also be used to measure immune related cells such as regulatory T cells. 

Familiarisation will preceed training with a VO2peak test, body composition analysis and anthropometrics measured. 

Exercise will be supervised by the PhD student who is running the project.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current evidence suggests exercise plays an important role in the management of blood glucose levels for individuals with T2DM. The frequency of consecutive exercise session over a two-week period on glucose regulation is not well understood and limited. Previous research have investigated either combined exercise or a single mode of exercise on glucose tolerance, However the comparison of 12 consecutive session of exercise remains limited, especially in a clinical population of type 2 diabetes. We seek to determine how effective treadmill exercise is in managing glucose tolerance since walking/running is freely accessible without the need to sign up to a gym. It is now understood that type 2 diabetes is associated with a chronic state of inflammation. Recent evidence have shown that exercise is beneficial in improving inflammation along with reducing insulin resistance. We aim to identify the influence of exercise on the level of inflammation and glucose tolerance following a two-week training period. Findings of this study may help inform future exercise prescription to improving health status in this population.</summary>
