  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intervention include four different front of pack nutrition labelling schemes that will be shown to study participants via a smartphone application. The study intervention duration is four-week. 

The labelling schemes that will be tested in the study are:
*Colour-coded multiple traffic-light labels (the current public health gold standard). Traffic-light label uses green, amber and red colours to indicate the relative levels (low, medium and high) of four nutrients (fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium).

*Monochrome daily intake guide labels (the current food industry option). This label provides information on the level of energy, fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium per serve and the percentage of each on the average Australian daily intake. 

*The energy stars based front-of-pack nutrition label format selected by the Federal Government. The label assigns a rating from 0.5 (less healthy) to 5 (most healthy) stars to foods basing on their Health Star Rating score, calculated from energy, fat, sugar and salt content, and adjusted for other components, such as fruit and vegetables.

*Advisory labels that warn against the purchase of less healthy products and encourage the purchase of more healthy products. In addition to information available on the standard nutrition information panel, this standard label will provide a green sign indicatig a food being a healthy choice or a red sign indicating the food being unhealthy and suggesting consumer to avoid. The warning signs are calculated basd on the food nutrition profile score in each category. 

participants will be able to use the smartphone app to view nutrition labels as often as they wish. To view a nutrition label, users scan barcodes of packaged food products using the smartphone camera, and assigned labels instantly appear on the phone screen.

Automated reminder messages via the smartphone app will appear three times per week on their smartphone screen to prompt the participants to use the app. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be shown the nutrition information panel that is currently available on the back of all food packages in Australia. The control treatment will be provided using the same mode, frequency as the intervention treatment using the smart phone app. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Healthiness of food purchases as evaluated by the mean nutrient profile score of all food and beverage products purchased over the four-week intervention period. Mean nutrient profiling score will be calculated using the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) nutrient profiling standard. Food purchase information is collected via electronic records (participants will be asked to scan barcodes of purchased items and take photos of the till receipts using the smartphone app and send to the study investigators. The app will then transmit the data to study database. Participants will also be asked to send in the hardcopies of their till receipts in a reply-paid envelop provided by the study. Food purchase information will later be collated from both electronic  and paper sources for analysis. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>mean concentrations of total fat, saturated fat, sugar, salt and energy of food purchased during the 4-week study  period. Food purchase information is collected using the smartphone app as described in the primary outcome section. Nutrient information of food purchased will be obtained from te Australian processed food composition database that contains comprehensive annually-updated information on Australian packaged and fast foods.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once a participant completes the one week run-in period of the study, they will be randomised at the backend of the smartphone app. Participants will be randomised according to the blocked randomisation list generated by a statistician. Only the person who is directly responsible for programming the randomisation list at the smartphone app developer company will have access to this list.  Neither the study investigator nor the study participant has any way to find out the treatment allocation before and during the study. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized using blocked randomization. Blocking is used to ensure that comparison groups will be generated according to the predetermined ratio of 1:1:1:1:1. Blocking can be used to ensure close balance of the numbers in each group at any time during the trial. The sequence of group allocation within each block will be at random.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The goal is to have power to detect small effects even after allowing for multiplicity adjustments.  With a sample size of 2500 randomised individuals, assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the four intervention groups or control, the study will have 90% power (at alpha=0.05) to detect a 2 unit or greater difference in the mean nutrient profile of purchased foods (healthiness score derived from the FSANZ nutrient profile system) between the specified pairs of groups.  The power estimate assumes a standard deviation of 9.9 of the nutrient profile score, which is the statistic obtained from the foods included in the Australian branded food composition database. Power for the primary analysis has been calculated conservatively assuming data from a single shopping episode will be available from each randomized participant.  It is, however, anticipated that multiple shopping episodes will be submitted by most participants and this will increase the study power through the use of mixed models.

The baseline characteristics will be summarised and tabulated with means (and ranges) and proportions presented for comparison.  Estimation of the effects of each intervention will be done according to the principle of intention to treat with the mean nutrient profile (food healthiness) scores compared between the groups.  Comparisons between the effects of the interventions will be made using mixed models that are able to incorporate data from the multiple shopping episodes that will be reported by most participants.  A p-value of 0.05 or less will be deemed to indicate a significant finding with the significance level maintained at 0.05 using a Bonferoni correction to control for the four primary comparisons that will be made between the energy stars format, each alternative labelling strategy and control.  A series of subgroup analyses will be undertaken to explore possible modifying effects of factors such as age, gender, socio-economic group and baseline understanding of front-of-pack labels.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A large scale randomised controlled trial conducted using a smartphone application to evaluate the comparative effects of four different forms of front-of-pack nutrition labelling against the current back-of-pack nutrition information panel on the healthiness of foods purchased. The four front-of-pack nutrition labelling formats tested will be: 1. Colour-coded multiple traffic-light labels; 2. Monochrome daily intake guide labels; 3. The "energy stars" based front-of-pack nutrition labels; and 4. Advisory labels. The findings will feed directly into the ongoing policy debate about the format of front-of-pack nutrition labelling to be introduced in Australia.</summary>
