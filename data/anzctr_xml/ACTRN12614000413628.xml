  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After approval of the ethical committee in  Benisuef university hospital (Egypt), a written informed consent will be obtained from 90 ASA I males  and  females patients aged 20-50 years old, planned for  percutaneous nephrolithotripsy under general  anesthesia.

Patients will be  excluded from the study if they had history of
hypertension, coronary artery disease, thyroid
dysfunction, diabetes, peptic ulcer, or on prolonged steroid
therapy, those with history of  use of antidepressant  drugs ,epilepsy ,a known allergy to the study drugs, expected blood transfusion during surgery, BMI &gt;30 or an initial body temperature&gt;38 degree C or &lt;36 degree C.
 
On arrival to the operating theatre, 18 G intravenous cannula will be  inserted and IV warmed crystalloid fluids will be infused at a rate of 8 ml/kg

The patients will be  randomly divided using closed envelope
technique for randomization to one of three groups: 

Group S, ( n =30) will receive 10 ml normal saline IV.
Group H, ( n =30)  will receive IV hydrocortisone 2 mg/ kg.
Group T , (n =30) will receive IV tramadol hydrochloride 1 mg/ kg

The studied drug will be  diluted in 10 ml coded 
 all will be given as an i.v. bolus just before induction of general anesthesia by an anesthesiologist who is unaware to the drugs given.
With adjustment of the temperature in operating room at
22 degree C -24 degree C, the monitor will be  attached to the patients to take preoperative readings of heart rate, non-invasive arterial blood pressure,Spo2.
General anesthesia will be induced after preoxygenation for 3- 5 minute with 100% oxygen by facemask, then induction of anesthesia in all patients will be  with the use of    i.v.propofol 2 mg/ kg, fentanyl 2 microgram / kg, atracurium (0.5mg/kg) and will be  ventilated manually  with sevoflorane  2 volume % ,oxygen 100% via a face mask then  oral cuffed endotracheal tube.Muscle relaxation  will be  guided by nerve stimulator ( Life-Tech EZstimII), anesthesia will be  maintained with oxygen 100%, sevoflorane, ,additional doses of atracurium, mechanical ventilation with maintenance of endtidal carbondioxide 35-40mmHg. 
The patients will be  well covered with sheets and  sterile surgical drapes. 
 And all intravenous fluids and irrigation fluids will be   warmed.
At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade will be  reversed with IV neostigmine 0.04mg/kg  and atropine 0.02 mg/kg, the trachea will be  extubated when the patient respond to commands, all patients will be   transferred to PACU,  where they received oxygen via face mask 3-4 L/min and will be   monitored and covered with cotton blanket .

The following parameters  will be evaluated and recorded by  senior anesthesia  resident unaware of the  study protocol:

1. Patient characteristics and operation time.
2. Core temperature before induction of anesthesia then every 15 minutes after induction of anesthesia , and every 30 minutes in the PACU bye 
(tympanic membrane temperature by Rossmax medical infrared ear thermometer, radiant innovation inc,Taiwan) 
3. Shivering intensity in  the first 2 hours postoperative will be  graded by using a five-point scale that was used in the study of Honarmand and Safavi.

 (Grade 0: none; Grade 1: one or more areas of
piloerection but without visible muscular activity;
Grade 2: visible muscular activity confined to one muscle
group; Grade 3: same as Grade 2 but in more than
one muscle group; and Grade 4: gross muscular activity
involving the entire body). If shivering grades P 3 was
observed after anesthesia  the patients were treated with
i.v. meperidine 25 mg 
4. The incidence of shivering.
5. Number of patients requiring meperidine.
6. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and peripheral
oxygen saturation recorded (intraoperative before
\anesthesia and every 15 min after anesthesia,
and every 30 min in the recovery room).
7. Side effects:
 nausea and vomiting 
 hypotension (decrease in MAP&gt; 20% from preoperative
reading and was treated by i.v. fluids and ephedrine
5 mg i.v.)
 hypertension (increase in MAP &gt;20% from preoperative
reading),
 tachycardia (increase in HR &gt; 20% from preoperative
reading,
