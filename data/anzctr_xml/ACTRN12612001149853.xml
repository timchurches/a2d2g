  <interventions>
    <interventions>This semi-tailored intervention is designed to deliver psycho-education and counselling to clients with MCI or early dementia and their primary caregivers in the weeks following diagnosis. The objective of the intervention is to teach a range of new strategies to help manage cognitive impairment in daily life.
The content will be based on a set of information handouts recently developed by our project team at La Trobe University and Kingston Centre (www.latrobe.edu.au/aipca/projects/mci). An adapted problem solving approach will be adopted in which clients and caregivers will be encouraged to participate in the process of developing the goals for the therapy, and finding the most appropriate strategies to manage cognitive impairment in their day-to-day lives.
Session will be face-to-face with the client and their primary caregiver, administered by an Alzheimer's Australia counsellor;
Duration/frequency of the intervention: 1 hour session administered weekly for 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care consists of careful assessment and provision of a diagnosis. At the Cognitive, Dementia and Memory Service (CDAMS) final feedback session efforts are made to provide recommendations and written materials to support clients and their family supporters to manage cognitive difficulties and to link them into community-based services.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Consecutive clients and primary caregivers eligible for the study will be approached at their CDAMS feedback session (i.e., the final session provided by the clinic in which a diagnosis is provided as well as assistance with ongoing management and links to community-based services). If interested, CDAMS key workers will provide information about the study and obtain written informed consent from the client and primary caregiver. One to two weeks after the feedback session, baseline data will be collected (in person) by a MONARC researcher. Following baseline data collection, participants will be randomly allocated to the MAXCOG intervention or usual care by a person not involved in data collection (the MONARC researcher responsible for data collection will be blind to group allocation). The MONARC researcher will collect follow up data two weeks post-intervention (via telephone). (Ideally we would also undertake longer-term follow up; we will seek additional funding for further follow up data collection). Losses to follow up will be minimised and data quality maximised by collecting follow up data via telephone (rather than mail). Attrition will be monitored and reasons for withdrawal will be recorded.</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a central allocation process to randomize participants, using a computer programme and a random block size algorithm to prevent imbalance between the allocation groups - stratified by MMSE score (20–23; 24–30), diagnosis (MCI; early dementia), and use/non-use of anti-dementia drugs.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently few services aim to support people in the community who are
experiencing mild cognitive difficulties or who have early dementia. However,
the experience of cognitive difficulties and worry about the future can be very
stressful for the person and their close family members; and may make
everyday tasks, such as interacting in a group or managing finances, much
more difficult. In this project we will develop and evaluate a new face-to-face
psycho-educational and counselling program for people with cognitive
difficulties and their close family members. The aim of the intervention is to
help people implement practical strategies to manage cognitive difficulties in
their day-to-day life. By increasing strategy use, we also hope to reduce the
anxiety and depression that people with mild cognitive difficulties and their
family members can experience. We will evaluate our counselling program by
comparing the outcomes for people who undergo the program with those of a
comparison group who receive service as usual (a randomised controlled
trial).</summary>
