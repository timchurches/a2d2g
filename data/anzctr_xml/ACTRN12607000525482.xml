  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial is using the Neurocom Balance Master force platform for early detection of balance problems amongst older community ambulant Veterans.  For Veterans who are assessed as having balance outside of normal limits for their age, they will be randomised to either receive usual care or an exercise program.  The exercise program will be a targeted balance and strength training program developed by a physiotherapist (based on the Otago exercise program that has been shown to reduce falls).  After six months a follow-up balance assessment will be undertaken to determine whether the exercise program has brought balance back to within normal limits.  This study will provide a better understanding of the types of early balance problems that occur, the frequency of undetected balance problems in a reasonably well sample, and the response of a targeted exercise program in addressing the early presence of balance problems in community ambulant Veterans.  The study is due to be completed in the later half of 2008.</summary>
