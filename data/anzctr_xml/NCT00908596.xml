  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scan and injection with a contrast agent, Primovist/Eovist, will be asked to
      participate.

      The administration of contrast agents that contain gadolinium such as Primovist/Eovist might
      increase a potential risk to develop a rare condition called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis
      (NSF) in patients with renal impairment. This study is to assess the potential risk to
      develop NSF in patients with renal impairment after the administration of Primovist/Eovist.

      Patients who are enrolled in this study will receive a Primovist/Eovist enhanced MRI scan
      which was prescribed by the referring doctor. After the MRI scan the patient will be included
      in a two year follow-up period to assess if signs or symptoms suggestive of NSF have
      appeared.</summary>
