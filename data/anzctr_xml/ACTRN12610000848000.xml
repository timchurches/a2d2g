  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pre-operative and post-operative treatment with gabapentin for 24 hours. Preoperative dose would normally be 600 mg orally 30 minutes prior to surgery with 300 mg being given orally 8 hourly for 24 hours following completion of surgery. The doses would need to be reduced if a patient with moderate or worse renal failure was recruited.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gabapentin is a drug that is officially used to treat chronic pain. This study looks at whether it can help with the more acute pain from having broken bones in the wrist or ankle repaired with screws and plates. This is very painful for a relatively short period and if we find that gabapentin can help with this pain then this could become part of normal treatment.</summary>
