  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves a peer-peer play-based intervention involving self-, therapist, and peer modelling. All intervention sessions will be video-recorded to facilitate self-modelling. The researcher will begin each clinic session by showing the children video footage of themselves playing from the previous week. During the self-modelling, children will observe and reflect on edited video footage of their social play from the previous week. The researcher will use video feedback techniques by discussing the segments of their past play performance. The researcher will then use video feed-forward techniques by facilitating a problem-solving discussion with the children, helping them to develop strategies to pre-empt the changes required for future social skill development to occur. To conclude, the researcher will present the children with three key summary points to remember and pre-empt as they enter the playroom. The parent/caregiver will observe these sessions through use of a computer monitor in an adjoining room. The researcher will discuss the techniques they used with the caregiver to ensure skills transfer. The duration between treatments for the treatment and control group is 3 months. The intervention involves a clinic component which includes 1x1 hour session per week for 10 weeks and a home component which involves 1x1 hour session per week for 10 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomized pairwise wait-listed control group. The children will be allocated to either a control or intervention group through pair-wise randomisation after they enter the program. To minimise bias, randomisation will be concealed from the investigator. A person not involved in the study will hand the researcher an envelope determining group membership; the concealed envelope will be given to the family at the end of the baseline assessment to find out their group membership. The group membership will have been unknown to both participants and the researcher until this point. The control group will be offered the intervention after a 3 month waiting period. The will receive standard care during the intervention period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have a number of limitations that contribute to social play and pragmatic language restrictions. Effective social play skills and pragmatic language are necessary for psychosocial development. Well developed social emotional skills and good quality relationships are protective factors that promote resilience and quality of life. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer-to-peer play based intervention to improve social play skills and pragmatic language in children with unilateral (i.e. affecting one side of the body) CP. It is expected that following the intervention children with UCP will have improved social play and communication skills and improved ability to establish and maintain friendships. Findings from this study will be directly translated into clinical practice. </summary>
