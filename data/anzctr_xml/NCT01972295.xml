  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an observational, prospective, non-randomized, multicenter study with the following
      objectives: (1) to compile real-world clinical outcomes data for WATCHMAN Left Atrial
      Appendage Closure Technology in patients who are implanted with the WATCHMAN device in a
      commercial clinical setting and (2) to collect health care usage data that may be needed for
      reimbursement of WATCHMAN technology in certain countries.</summary>
