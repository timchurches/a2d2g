  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Surgical release of iliotibial band and excision of trochanteric bursa (control)

Arm 2: Surgical release of iliotibial band and excision of trochanteric bursa with single intraoperative injection of platelet-rich plasma into gluteus medius musculotendinous junction

The procedure is performed with the patient lying on their unaffected side. If the patient is to receive PRP, 55ml of blood is extracted from a patient's vein while they are anaesthetised and spun down using a device to gain 6ml of platelet-rich plasma which is injected immediately after the surgical intervention is complete, via the endoscopic portals. The procedure involves a longitudinal split of the ITB and excision of the bursa and take approximately 30 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Our hypothesis is that a single PRP injection into the gluteus medius tendon at the time of surgery for recalcitrant GTPS will result in a clinically relevant improvement in patients pain and function. We have selected a sample size (total 128, 64 each group) that will be viable for recruiting from a single surgeon while being powered enough to detect a 25% difference between groups with an alpha value of 0.05 and a beta value of 0.2.

Continuous data such as VAS, OHS, iHOT33 score, age and BMI will be reported in terms of the mean and 95% confidence interval. The means of continuous data between intervention arms will be compared using the t-test.

Dichotomous data such as gender, diabetes and smoking will be compared using the Chi2 test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a parallel randomised controlled trial analysing the effect of adding a singular intra-operative platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection into the gluteus medius tendon to current surgical standard of care consisting of endoscopic iliotibial band release and trochanteric bursectomy for recalcitrant greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The singular PRP injection will be administered at the time of surgery while the patient is anaesthetised. The study aims to investigate whether adding PRP injection to surgery confers any additional reduction in pain and improvement in function compared to surgery alone.

This study will be conducted as a randomised controlled trial with the control arm receiving the current surgical standard of care, consisting of endoscopic iliotibial band release and trochanteric bursectomy, without PRP. The experimental arm will receive the same surgical intervention but with an additional single PRP injection into the gluteus medius tendon.

Our hypothesis is there will be an improvement in the experimental group with the addition of PRP. We are hoping this will result in a change in standard practice for this group of patients, whereby patients who undergo this operation receive PRP concurrently.</summary>
