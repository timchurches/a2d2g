  <interventions>
    <interventions>For preoperative TACE group, a vascular catheter for TACE was inserted through the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique, and hepatic angiography was performed. The catheters tip was inserted selectively into the left and right hepatic artery, or the tumor-feeding artery when technically possible. An emulsion of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 gm), mitomycin C (MMC) (20 mg), cisplatin (5 mg) and lipiodol 10-30 ml (1 to 2 ml/cm diameter of the tumor) was injected. Preoperative TACE was begun within 10 days after randomization. TACE was repeated up to 3 times at an interval of 4 to 9 weeks. Partial hepatectomy was performed within 8 weeks from the last session of TACE.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Following curative liver resection for HCC, 50%-90% of postoperative death is due to recurrent disease. Any neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy which decreases or delays the onset of recurrence, improves the results of liver resection. However, there is still no effective neoadjuvant therapy or adjuvant therapy for HCC. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of preoperative TACE on survival after resection of HCC.</summary>
