  <interventions>
    <interventions> All patients underwent spinoepidural anesthesia. The patients ' demographic data recorded. The patients were divided into two groups. Patients distributde to groups with closed envelope technique.
Group P (n=66): Peritubal infiltration group was given 0.25% bupivacaine [Bustesin(R), Vem, Ankara, Turkey]  20 mL + 5 mg morphine (0.5 ml) [Morphine HCl(R), Galen, Istanbul, Turkey] into the renal capsule, peripheral fat tissue, muscle tissue, subcutaneous tissues and skin after a nephrostomy tube was inserted using a 22G spinal needle advanced towards 6 and 12 Oclock positions as guided by a fluoroscopy along nephrostomy catheter by urologist at the end of the surgery. The anesthetic solution was observed by fluoroscopy, which was evenly distributed throughout the nephrostomy catheter.
Postoperative pain control was achieved with epidural patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)(CADD-Legacy(R) PCA, Smiths Medical, St Paul, USA) for the first 24 hours post surgery. Epidural PCA was prepared including 40 mL 0.5% bupivacaine + 500 mcg fentanyl +
110 mL 0.9% NaCl, to a total of 160 mL epidural solution as postoperative analgesic for all
patients . Without a basal infusion,
bolus dose was set as 5 mL, key duration as 20 min and hourly limit as 15 mL. 
In first 24 h pain scores, time of the first analgesic demand, the mean number of analgesic demands and postoperative complications were compared between groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: We aimed to investigate the effect of peritubal local anesthetic and opioid infiltration on pain scores and analgesic consumption through the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device in patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy combined with spinoepidural anesthesia.
Material and Methods: Patients aged between 18 and 65 years and ASA I-III were included in this double-blind, randomized study. The patients were divided into two groups. All patients underwent spinoepidural anesthesia. 20 mL of 0.25 percent bupivacaine + 5 mg morphine (0.5 mL) in Group P (n=66), were infiltrated the renal capsule, perinephric fat, muscles, subcutaneous tissue and skin with a 22G spinal needle under fluoroscopy. In Group C (n= 64), none of the patients received a peritubal injection. Postoperative pain control was achieved with epidural PCA. In first 24 h pain scores, time of the first analgesic demand, the mean number of analgesic demands and postoperative complications were compared between groups.
Results: The mean Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score at postoperative 8, 12, 24 h and dynamic VAS score at postoperative 4, 8, 12, 24 h were significant lower in Group P.  VAS score at postoperative 4 h was not significant. Time of the first analgesic demand (262.2 min) was significantly longer in Group P. 
Conclusion: Our study results suggest that peritubal infiltration of bupivacaine with morphine after percutaneous nephrolithotomy is an effective method for postoperative pain control and reduces analgesic consumption.
