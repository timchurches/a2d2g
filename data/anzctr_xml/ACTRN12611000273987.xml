  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim is to investigate the variation in size of the lacrimal punctum in a normal adult population. The lacrimal puncta are the openings on the inner aspect of your eye which drains tears from the eye into the nose. 
This opening is important for correct drainage of tears and abnormalities in its size can lead to problems such as watery eye, or dry eye disease.
The punctum will be observed and measured once only during one clinic visit to the hospital.
The Punctal shape and Punctal parameters including the diameter, horizontal and length and cross-sectional area will be measured and recorded
The shape of the punctum when open which has been described as either round, oval or slit-shaped
The diameter of the punctum  measured using a Ramsden eyepiece consisting of a fixed transparent graduated scale with resolution 0.03mm positioned at the field stop fitted to the slit-lamp with magnification of the optical arrangement fixed at 32x
For oval puncta  both maximum and minimum lengths will be taken
For slit-shaped puncta  both length and breadth will be taken
The area of the punctum 
Photographs of all four puncta will be taken using slit lamp biomicroscopy
A computer cursor assembly probe and digitalizer will be used to map the borders of the puncta and the area will be calculated using a photo editing computer program.
Recruitment period duration is aprroximately 1 month.</interventions>
