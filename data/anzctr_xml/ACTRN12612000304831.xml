  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a high velocity, low amplitude thrust manipulation, applied to the mid part of the spine (thoracic spine). It will take approximately 2 minutes to position the volunteer for this manipulation, and will take seconds to deliver the thrust. Volunteers will receive the manipulation during each physiotherapy appointment (i.e. twice weekly, for a total of 4 weeks). 
The physiotherapy appointments will take about 20 minutes each, and during this time eccentric exercises will be monitored and modified as appropriate, and secondary outcome measures (blood pressure and pulse rate) will also be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will receive eccentric exercises only. Eccentric exercises are a special type of exercise known to be beneficial for the rehabilitation of Achilles tendinopathy. For both groups, these exercises will be completed twice daily, for a total of four weeks. All participants will receive education and an information sheet, outlining how these exercises are to be preformed. The comparator group will attend for physiotherapy twice weekly, for four weeks. During these 20 minute appointments they will receive education on the exercise regime, and secondary outcome measures (blood pressure and pulse rate) will be recorded.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment - Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A) score will be the primary outcome. This questionnaire is designed to assess Achilles tendinopathy severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be assessed before the initial intervention and after the final physiotherapy appointment, at the end of 4 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) will be the other primary measure taken. The scale assesses the intensity of pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be assessed before the initial intervention and during each physiotherapy appointment, for 4 consecutive weeks. This outcome measure will also be taken after the final physiotherapy appointment, at the end of 4 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured using an electronic blood pressure cuff.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Twice weekly for the first four weeks.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Volunteers will be recruited through an advertisement in the local paper. The lead investigator will assess volunteers against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Concealed allocation will be carried out; volunteers will be asked to draw from 20 sealed opaque envelopes. The envelopes will contain the volunteers number and allocation group. The clinic receptionist will then organise the volunteerâ€™s appointments for the following 4 weeks.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this trial is to assess if spinal manipulation, in addition to eccentric exercises, has an impact on the functional recovery of Achilles tendinopathy. The hypothesis is that both groups will improve after 4 weeks of eccentric exercises, and that the intervention group (receiving the spinal manipulation), will improve more than the group receiving eccentric exercises alone.</summary>
