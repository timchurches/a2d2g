  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who require supplementary feeding when undergoing an Allogeneic transplant will be randomised to supplemental nutritional support by parenteral nutrition (PN) versus enteral nutrition (EN) on a 1:1 basis. PN will be administered through a central venous catheter using a standard central parenteral nutrition solution including intravenous vitamin supplementation. EN will be a standard 1.25kcal/ml ready to hang formula administered through a nasogastric tube inserted at the onset of supplemental feeding. The feeding rate and goal to meet requirements will be as per the ward Dietitian. Feeding will continue until  patients are able to meet 60% of requirements through oral intake for atleast one day. If a patient does not tolerate their mode of feeding they can be changed to the alternate mode of feeding at any time.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is Parenteral feeding. Parenteral feeding is standard practice at this hospital currently and this study will evaluate the tolerance of enteral versus parenteral feeding. Parenteral feeding will be administered through a central venous catheter using a standard central parenteral nutrition solution including intravenous vitamin supplementation. Feeding will continue until patients are able to meet 60% of requirements through oral intake for atleast one day or a patient does not tolerate their mode of feeding.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of neutropenia. Neutrophil count is monitored daily in a blood test which is part of standard care during a transplant.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). This will be assessed through a medical chart audit and if GVHD is diagnosed and documented by the patients Haematologist in the chart it will be recorded as an outcome.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients are informed about the study by a transplant coordinator pre admission and are consented to the study by their haematologist in clinic pre admission. Patients are randomised to enteral or parenteral feeding by a computer generated randomisation list if they require supplementary feeding. The primary investigator contacts another member of the research team to randomise the patient to a type of feeding when it is required.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing a Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) often have difficulty eating adequately due to the side effects of treatment and malnutrition can occur which is associated with poor outcomes post transplant. The best type of nutrition support to be given during a SCT is controversial and Parenteral Nutrition/ Intravenous feeding (PN) is usually given over Enteral Nutrition/ Nasogastric feeding (EN) despite the increased cost, infection risks and other complications associated with PN. This project aims to determine whether PN or EN is better tolerated by SCT patients who are unable to eat adequately. If EN is successfully tolerated this will eliminate the risks, complications and cost associated with routine use of PN. This research will directly improve future patient care and will result in changes to current nutrition support practices and lead to improved outcomes for cancer transplant patients.</summary>
