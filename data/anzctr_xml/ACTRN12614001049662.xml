  <interventions>
    <interventions>Analysis of Toshiba's rapid diagnosis of nasal or throat swabs to detect Influenza virus A or B by new point of care testing (POCT) device using optical attenuation caused by reflection or scattering at formed immune complexes, the accuracy of results will be compared with an existing rapid influenza POCT device. 
Diagnosis of influenza will only be made from the sample analysed by the Australian accepted standard RT-PCR test.
Participants will provide 3 samples in total at the one visit from either nose or throat. One for each of the devices and one for the RT-PCR test
Participants will be asked about the onset of their influenza symptoms and what those symptoms are and have their temperature taken. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects who present with influenza symptoms in the opinion of their doctor, will be asked to participate as will the parent or legal guardian of minors. They will be given a patient information sheet to read and time for their questions to be answered. Only if they willingly agree to participate will they be asked to sign a consent form. They will be randomly assigned to either 3 nasal or 3 throat swabs collection of nasal or throat discharge material for analysis of influenza A or B or negative results. 
first swab will always be taken for the rt-PCR test as this is the accepted test for influenza diagnosis. Only this result will be used for the diagnosis and the patient will be notified of this result.
The second swab will be randomly assigned to the Toshiba POCT device or the Quick Navi POCT device used as a comparator in this trial. The third swab will be the reverse of the second swab,  for example if the Quick Navi is randomised as swab 2 then the Toshiba POCT device will be used for testing swab 3. 
computerised sequence generation used to generate randomisation
</concealment>
    <sequence>Physician or trial nurse will open sealed packet which will indicate Nasal or throat swab to be taken. In this study patient samples will be further randomised in a 1:1 fashion to either the Toshiba device or to the quicknavi device per the order in which  the devices are to be used to analyse swabs 2 and 3
Swab 1 will always be for rt-PCR be it nasal or throat swab
Swab 2 could be for Toshiba POCT or Quick Navi
Swab 3 would be reverse order of swab 2</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>In each type of sample, testing results obtained by product under investigation will be compared to that of the control product. Sensitivity, specificity and the overall concordance rate will be calculated. If the result of the product under investigation does not match the control device results the result will be compared with the rt-pct results. If these results match the investigative product will be considered as valid
For device approval in Japan, a new reagent test kit should achieve more than 90% correlativity between the new test kit and existing test kite/established methods the study is powered to test this requirement.
The Japanese Authority (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency) requests a clinical trial which tests more than minimum sample size (50 people) for each target and achieves more than 90% accordance rate in comparing with the incumbents for each target all venders which want to enter the Influenza test kit market. To test more than 50 positives (each A and B), we suppose that we need to recruit around 1.5 to 2.0 times of minimum number of participants</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Toshiba medical systems have developed a new rapid diagnostic test device kit for influenza using new technology from current rapid tests available. The device is able to detect influenza virus in a much smaller sample and provide a result in around ten minutes. It will be compared with the Denka Seiken QuickNavi POCT device already marketed for use overseas for accuracy of results however neither device will be used to make a diagnosis. The diagnosis will be made from the accepted RT-PCR (separation culture) test. Participants will have 3 samples taken from either the nose or throat. 1sample for the culture and 1 sample for each device.
