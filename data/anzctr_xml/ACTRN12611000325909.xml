      <outcome>Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) will use hand-held computers running data collection software, programmed specifically for this study. Participants will indicate on the phone each time they smoke a cigarette. The device will log and store the time and date of these events. 
Following 4-5 randomly selected cigarette reports per day and 4-5 randomly-selected non-smoking assessments per day, participants will complete an assessment of current mood, withdrawal severity, craving and contextual and situational details. Response data will be stored on the mobile phone device.</outcome>

    <concealment>Smokers who are interested in participation will be invited to call a dedicated the study telephone number for more information. During this call, the caller will be screened for eligibility. Eligible callers will then have the study requirements explained to them, and, if they are interested in participating, they will be scheduled for an enrolment session at the study site.  During this first study session, interested and eligible individuals will have the study explained to them by a study staff member and, after having an opportunity to ask any questions and to review the study information sheet, they will be asked to provide written informed consent.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised centrally using a computer generated permuted-block randomisation strategy.
The computer program used to record participant data will direct research staff to supply a particular hand-held study device after obtaining informed consent and completion of baseline measurements. The study devices will be pre-loaded with either the active or control materials. Similarly training materials will be supplied in a blinded fashion. Allocation concealment will be accomplished using pre-numbered study devices.</sequence>
