    <interventions>This is an observational study. The study consists of two stages. In the first stage, corneal sensitivity will be measured using the liquid jet aesthesiometer in participants over 5 days at similar time points over the 5 days. The liquid jet aesthesiometer uses tiny droplets of saline of variable size to generate a mechanical stimulus on the cornea without inducing a thermal component. Using a staircase method, participants will respond with a can or can't feel response to determine corneal sensitivity threshold. 
In the second stage, corneal sensitivity and subjective ocular comfort ratings will be collected in the morning and afternoon (2 visits separated 6 hours apart) over 3 separate days. Ocular comfort ratings will be collected via a questionnaire prior to corneal sensitivity measurements using the Liquid Jet Aesthesiometer. </interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control treatment in this study. In Stage 2, we will be comparing corneal sensitivity and ocular comfort ratings in participants who are soft contact lens wearers compared to those who are not. </comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would affect corneal sensitivity.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Previous rigid gas permeable (RGP) or Orthokeratology lens wear
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for dispensing studies and 48 hours between in-house studies.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Corneal sensitivity threshold will be recorded on an interval scale and summarised as means +/- standard deviations. Corneal sensitivity will be compared between five repeated days using repeated measures ANOVA or linear mixed model. The effect of contact lens wearers and its interaction with repeatability will also be assessed in this model.
Subjective ocular comfort will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 100 in increments of 1 unit. Ocular comfort and corneal sensitivity will be compared between time of day (morning vs. evening), contact lens wearers and repeat days. Ocular comfort and corneal sensitivity will be analysed using repeated measures ANOVA or linear mixed model. The correlation of corneal sensitivity with ocular comfort will be analysed using Pearson correlation and also assessed as a covariate in the model that includes time of day, 

Approximately 15 soft contact lens wearers and 15 non-lens wearers are required for this study (adjusted for a 20% dropout rate). This was based on calculations on pre-clinical data, to demonstrate a statistically significant difference at the 5% level of significance and 80% power. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the repeatability of an investigational instrument (Liquid Jet Aesthesiometer) and its application in contact lens related comfort. The instrument is used in optometric research to assess corneal sensitivity (i.e. measuring the smallest amount of stimulus for the anterior eye to detect sensation). To achieve this we wish to take measurements using the instrument over several days. Approximately 30 participants (15 contact lens wearers and 15 non-contact lens weares) will take part in each stage of the study. In Stage 1 of the study, we wish to assess the repeatability of the instrument in measuring corneal sensitivity over the course of 5 days. Once this stage is complete and pending data analysis of Stage 1 we may invite you to Stage 2, if you choose to participate, where we aim to assess the correlation between corneal sensitivity measurements and comfort over the course of 3 days. You do not have to participate in both stages of the study.</summary>
