  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adding 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) which,in other cancers, is better able to pick up cancer spread than other tests are. This scan will be done once at the time of diagnosis and staging.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard or routine pre-operative investigations. This may include
 	Dual phase Computed Tomography (CT)
	USS (ultrasound)
	Endoscopic ultrasound
	MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
	ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) with or without stenting
	MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogrophy
	Percutaneous biliary drainage/ stenting
	Laparoscopy [ ideally, (but not necessarily) this will take place just prior to surgery and after all other pre-operative investigations including PET/CT, have been performed ]</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Define the percentage of patients in whom, as a result of FDG PET/CT, there is an appropriate change of management plan, treatment strategy or staging.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of staging, at operation or during follow up which is scheduled to occur at 1,3,6,9,12,18,24,30 and 36 months post surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the staging accuracy of standard imaging alone with the staging accuracy of the combination of standard imaging and PET/CT scanning</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In addition to the standard pre-operative investigations you will also
undergo a PET scan. Your results will be compared to people who only
receive the routine pre-operative investigations, to see if the use of
the PET scan changes the treatment plan.

A PET scan is a non-invasive nuclear imaging test. In other cancers,
particularly lung cancer, this scan can detect the spread of cancer
better than other tests. If you have a suspected pancreatic cancer, the
usual tests might include a CT (computed tomography) scan, ultrasound,
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan and an ERCP (endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography). If a PET scan helps show the extent of the
cancer better, your diagnosis will be more accurate and this might spare
you unnecessary major surgery.</summary>
