  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of theta-burst stimulation (TBS), a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TBS will be delivered at a low intensity (80% of active motor threshold of the target muscle) with a 90 mm wing diameter, figure of 8 flat coil connected to a Magstim Rapid 2 stimulator (MagStim Co., Whitland, Dyfed, Wales). The paradigm consists of 10 bursts of triplets of pulses (50 Hz) applied at 5 Hz every 10 seconds, a total of 600 pulses. The stimulation will not take longer than a total of 3 minutes. Participants will receive TBS to the ipsilesional hemisphere four times a week for two weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham theta burst stimulation.
The paradigm of the sham intervention is identical to the TBS intervention paradigm (10 bursts of triplets of pulses every 10 seconds, a total of 600 pulses). Sham TBS will be applied with a sham coil identical to the real coil that generates the same noise but does not emit a magnetic pulse to maintain blinding. Like in the TBS intervention group the control group will receive sham TBS to the ipsilesional hemisphere four times a week for two weeks and each session will not take longer than a total of 3 minutes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spasticity affects more than half of stroke survivors and can severely impact on functional independence, quality of life and caregiver burden.Recently non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has been proposed as an alternative approach to promote the recovery of motor impairments after stroke. This type of intervention aims to alter brain excitability and may have potential as a therapeutic intervention to enhance neuroplasticity after stroke. There may be benefits in combining this novel intervention with standard therapies. Therefore in this study we will assess the effect of NIBS on upper limb spasticity in individuals with stroke concurrently treated with botulinum toxin. We anticipate that this study will guide us to develop a novel intervention program to improve spasticity in stroke survivors and in turn motor control and upper limb function. </summary>
