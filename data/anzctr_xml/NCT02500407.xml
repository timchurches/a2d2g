  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - BTCT4465A
Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab

Experimental: BTCT4465A: Dose Escalation - Participants will receive BTCT4465A via intravenous (IV) infusion as a single-agent or with concurrent administration of atezolizumab. Dose escalation will be guided by the observed incidence of DLTs at each dose level.

Experimental: BTCT4465A: Dose Expansion - Participants will receive BTCT4465A at the RP2D as a single-agent or with concurrent administration of atezolizumab.


Treatment: drugs: BTCT4465A
Participants with B-cell NHL and CLL will receive BTCT4465A via IV infusion.

Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab
Participants assigned to an atezolizumab combination arm will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg administered as an IV infusion concurrently with BTCT4465A.
