  <interventions>
    <interventions>Large population studies place the prevalence of low back pain as affecting 20-49% of the low risk obstetric population (Albert et al, 2002). This study aims to evaluate, in a randomised controlled trial, whether the Belly Bra is associated with a reduction in back pain in pregnant women compared to a more generic support in the form of tubigrip. The Belly Bra, designed by Linda Turner, is alleged to provide support for the lower back and abdomen during pregnancy. Worn like a singlet, the nylon/spandex Belly Bra has a one-way stretch panel acroos the back that offers support and improves posture, whilst a wide elastic band sits below the abdomen to lift weight off the pelvis. One hundred women will be randomised, either to the intervention (Belly Bra - 50 women) or to the control (tubigrip - 50 women) by means of computer generated numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. Each participant will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire on enrolment and a follow-up questionnaire upon completion of their trial three weeks later.</interventions>
