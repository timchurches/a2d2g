  <interventions>
    <interventions>The open preperitoneal approach to the inguinal region was performed under general or regional anesthesia, as originally described by Nyhus . Through a lower abdominal transverse incision, the anterior rectus sheath was incised and the rectus muscle reflected medially. The preperitoneal space was cleaved with blunt dissection, exposing the myopectineal orifice. The cord was explored and the hernias were reduced. A 15x15 cm polypropylene mesh with a slit was inserted in the preperitoneal space and fixed with nonabsorbable sutures to pubic tubercle and Cooper's ligament. The mesh was passed behind the cord and manipulated to lay flat against the posterior inguinal floor overlapping the entire myopectineal orifice. The mean operative time was 71.6 minutes .</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention: Open preperitoneal approach Comparator/Control: anterior inguinal approach. 
The anterior tension-free repair, as defined by Lichtenstein was performed using 6 x 11 cm polypropylene mesh.  The mean operative time in group A was 71.6 minutes . In group B , the mean value was 94.7 minutes  .
The time of hospital stay and  the time off from work were less in posterior preperitoneal repair groups.
Chronic postoperative pain,scrotal swelling and testicular atrophy were less in preperitoneal approach</comparator>
