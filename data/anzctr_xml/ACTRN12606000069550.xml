  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients will be randomized to  I treatment group. 

I.  10 mg od of Bay 59-7939 tablets active substance (10 mg tablet) from Day 1 to Day 35 plus a placebo syringe of enoxaparin from Day 0 - Day 12

Day 1 will be defined as the day of the elective total hip replacement. On Day 1 the first dose of BAY 59-7939 or matching placebo and the second dose of enoxaparin or matching placebo will be administered post-operatively 6-8 hours after wound closure. Active treatment period for the Enoxaparin arm is day 0 to day 12. The active treatment period for BAY 59-3979 arm is from Day 1 until day 35.

On day 36 a bilateral ascending venography is mandatory for all patients. If symptoms of DVT occur earlier, an ultrasound may be allowed. If the DVT is confirmed by ultrasound, a bilateral ascending venography is mandatory for all patients. No further study medication will be administered after the venography. 
If symptoms of pulmonary embolism occur during the study (including follow-up of 30 days post study treatment) a lung scintigraphy with chest X-Ray or a spiral CT or a pulmonary angiography should be performed. Symptoms of DVT occurring during follow-up should be verified by ultrasound or venography.</interventions>

II.  One placebo tablet of BAY 59-7939 from Day 1 to Day 35 plus one syringe of enoxaparin active substance at a dose of 40 mg from Day 0 to Day 12.</comparator>
