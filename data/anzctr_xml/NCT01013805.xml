Week 1: Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 Day 1 (over 2 hours), leucovorin 200mg/m2 Day 1 concurrent with oxaliplatin over 2 hrs (then 5-FU).
Weeks 3 to 5: radiotherapy 25.2 Gy in 14 fractions over 3 weeks with 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin on the first day Week 6: as per Week 1, Weeks 8-10: as per Weeks 3-5 Weeks 11: as per Week 1.

Treatment: drugs: Fluorouracil

Weeks 3 to 5: radiotherapy 25.2 Gy in 14 fractions over 3 weeks with 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin on the first day and continuous infusion 5-FU 200 mg/m2/day on the days of radiotherapy Week 6: as per Week 1, Weeks 8-10: as per Weeks 3-5 Weeks 11: as per Week 1.
Leucovorin 200 mg/m2 Day 1 concurrent with Oxaliplatin over 2 hrs, then 2nd: 5-FU 400 mg/m2 bolus Day 1, then 3rd: 5-FU continuous infusion 2.4 g/m2 over 46 hours from Day 1

Treatment: drugs: Leucovorin
Week 1: Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 Day 1 (over 2 hours), leucovorin 200mg/m2 Day 1 concurrent with oxaliplatin over 2 hrs (then 5-FU) Week 6: as per Week 1, Weeks 11: as per Week 1.

Treatment: surgery: Surgical Resection
Surgery is to be performed according to the standard procedure for locally advanced rectal cancer 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the integrated preoperative radiotherapy with FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen.

    <summary>The aims of the trial are (1) to determine the tolerability rate in the setting of a
      multi-centre study and (2) to determine secondary tolerability endpoints, toxicity rates and
      complete pathologic response rate in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are
      treated with an integrated preoperative radiotherapy with FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen.</summary>
