    <studytitle>Comparision of two new ocular scanning refraction instruments</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A prospective, open-labelled, multiple group, randomised, instrument validation clinical trial measuring central and peripheral refractive errors and higher order aberrations in healthy volunteers using two instruments: EyeMapper and HS Scanner with undilated and dilated pupils.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be required to attend one visit. For the EyeMapper instrument, the participants head will be positioned on a chin rest and look at an internal fixation target. No contact will be made with the eye at any time. Following alignment, measurement is taken. Five consecutive measurements will be performed per instrument. Overall duration of measurements will be 10 minutes</interventions>

      <timepoint>Refractive error and high order aberration measures will be carried out with two non-invasive novel instruments (EyeMapper and Hartmann-Shack Scanner) before and after the dilation.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent.
Be at least 18 years old, male or female.
Willing to comply with the clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal.
Spherical equivalent refractive error between +1.50D and -4.00D (with astigmatism less than 4.00D)</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 
NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.
Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Rigid gas permeable or orthokeratology lens wear in the past month. 
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 24 hours for dispensing studies and in-house studies.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Diagnosis</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The planned number of participants is minimum of 48; of which, 24 participants will be recruited with spherical equivalent refractive errors ranging between +1.50D and -0.25D, and another 24 participants will be recruited with spherical equivalent refractive errors ranging between -0.50D and -4.00D. 

Allocation concealment will be by means of central randomisation by computer.

Enrolment will take place over approximately 1 month.
Participants will be screened for general clinical trial suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health. Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures.  Both experienced contact lens wearers and neophytes (participants with no prior lens wear experience) will be enrolled into the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised for the order of examination with the two new instruments.

The randomisation plan will be generated from http://www.randomisation.com</sequence>
