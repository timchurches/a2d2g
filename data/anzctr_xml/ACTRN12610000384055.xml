  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have had chest drains inserted for various indications including thoracic surgery, spontaneous pneumothoraces or following drainage of pleural effusions and who are ready to undergo drain removal will be included in the study. The drain will be removed during a Valsalva manoeuvre, performed in forced expiration against a closed airway (by instructing the patient to put their thumb in their mouth and blow as if blowing a whistle). The procedure takes approximately 5 seconds and is a one-off event.</interventions>
    <comparator>Similar to the intervention group, except that the removal of the chest drain is during a maximal inspiration.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the presence (yes) or absence (no) of a pneumothorax, to be determined by the treating physician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 hours and 24 hours after removal of chest drain.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum distance between the chest wall and the pleural surface of the lung (0-X cm), to be determined by the treating physician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 hours and 24 hours after removal of chest drain.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Degrees of difficulty in the performance of the two breathing holding techniques being studied; this will be recorded as a simple 4 variable score of no difficulty, slight difficulty, moderate difficulty and severe difficulty as rated by the participant undergoing chest drain removal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of chest drain removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patients who have a single intercostal chest drain in situ and which the treating clinician has determined requires removal.
2. Willingness to give written informed consent and willingness to participate in and comply with the study.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>0</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1.Patients who have any radiological evidence of a residual pneumothorax prior to chest drain removal.
2.Patients who have more than 200mls of residual pleural fluid prior to chest drain removal as estimated on plain chest radiograph.
3.Patients who have had an air leak into the underwater seal within 24 hours prior to chest drain removal.
4.Patients with resting hypoxaemia (defined as a partial pressure of oxygen - PaO2 - of less than 55mmHg or saturation - SaO2 - of less than 90% on room air prior to the removal of the chest drain).
5.Patients who have undergone a pleurodesis procedure.
6.Patients who have more than one chest drain in situ at the time when one drain is to be removed. This applies to bilateral drains in patients who have undergone bilateral lung or heart-lung transplantation as these patients have a continuous communication between right and left hemithoraces; however once there is only one remaining drain for removal these patients would then become eligible for inclusion in the study.
7.Patients who are unable to clearly understand or comply with the nurses instructions with regard to the technique of breath holding during the removal of the chest drain.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Consecutive patients who have had chest drains inserted for various indications including thoracic surgery, spontaneous pneumothoraces or following drainage of pleural effusions and who are ready to undergo drain removal will be assessed prospectively for suitability for inclusion in the study. The decision to remove the chest drain will be made exclusively by the attending clinicians and prior to and independent of any consideration as to the patient’s suitability for inclusion in the study.
The attending physician or registrar will explain the purpose of the study and discuss possible risks with the patient. In addition each patient will be provided with an information brochure. Consent will be entirely voluntary. The patient will be reassured that non-participation in the study will in no way affect their ongoing medical management. Written, informed consent will be obtained. Patients who do not have the capacity to provide written informed consent to participate will be excluded, as it is assumed they will not have the capacity to follow commands required to perform the techniques for chest drain removal.
The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed and the participant has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The participant will receive a study enrolment number and this will be documented in the participant’s medical record and on all study documents.
The participant will be randomised in a concealed manner on the day that the decision is made to remove the chest drain and after they have met the randomisation criteria. At this point the participant will be randomised to study procedure A or Study procedure B.
Allocation will be concealed by using sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate whether one method of removing a chest drain is better than another with at reducing complications such as pneumothorax (collapsed lung) which can occur when a chest drain is removed. Chest drains are commonly removed in one of two ways  either after the patient has taken a deep breath in, or whilst the patient is blowing out. Pneumothorax is a known complication following removal of chest drains, but it is not clear which of these two methods of chest drain removal results in a lower incidence of pneumothorax.</summary>
