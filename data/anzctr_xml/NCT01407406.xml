  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rationale for the Study: Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) data is needed in Chinese and Japanese
      populations to support future clinical development of BIIB023 in China and Japan.

      Study Design: This is a single-dose study to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of
      BIIB023 administered intravenously (IV) to adult Chinese, Japanese, and Caucasian healthy
      volunteers. The Caucasian group is included to allow comparison of PK data from different
      groups using data from the same study under the same controlled conditions.

      Subjects will be in the clinic for 48 hours around the time of dosing and in the study for up
      to 100 days.</summary>
