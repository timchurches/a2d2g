  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single centre, randomised, double blind, two-way crossover study, to investigate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled dry powder
      GW685698X (800?g) containing magnesium stearate. Magnesium stearate is an excipient added to
      improve the physical stability of inhaled dry powder formulations. Male and female patients
      with mild/moderate asthma will be randomised to determine which order they receive a single
      inhaled administration of GW685698X (800?g) with and without magnesium stearate. There will
      be a wash-out period of at least 5 days between doses.</summary>
