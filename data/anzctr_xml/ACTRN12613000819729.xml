  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the usability and functionality of the MoMe continuous ECG monitoring and arrhythmia detection system. The device is intended for patients who have a demonstrated need for cardiac monitoring to detect arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms and rates) which could pose a danger to the patients health. The MoMe device records electrical signals from the heart through a series of electrodes attached to the chest, providing a range of information including the heart rhythm, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure and motion activity level. Standard of care ECG monitoring devices used only monitor heart activity for a short duration (24-48hrs) and because of this, transient arrhythmias can go undetected. The diagnosis by the doctor is also delayed as the device data has to be sent to a lab for review and analysis before he/she can receive it. The technology of this new MoMe device overcomes the issue of a missed or delayed diagnosis by facilitating heart monitoring for a longer period and by providing real time data to the physician for review at the current moment that the patient is wearing the device.  The study will involve up to 40 patients at up to two New Zealand sites. Participants will be aged 18-85 and will have a previously diagnosed known arrhythmia for which no treatment or intervention is medically required during monitoring.  Participants will have the device attached in the hospital by a trained technician and wear it for up to two weeks. The data will be continuously analysed for arrhythmias and transmitted to a cloud application where it can be viewed in real time. For the purposes of minimising bias in this research study, the investigator will be blinded to the patients data. The investigator will be informed by the Sponsor if any new arrhythmias are detected by the device. The patient will return to the hospital at the end of the monitoring period and have the device disconnected, at which point they will exit the study. </summary>
