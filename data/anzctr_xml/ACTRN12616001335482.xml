    <interventions>Patients received a one off dose of Lignocaine 5% + Phenylephidrine 0.5%, two actuations in each nostril (100 microlitres /spray), and within 6-36 hours two actuations of Lignocaine (4.8%) + Phenylephidrine (0.48%)+ vanilla concentrate additive (L-132184) and masking flavour (50105AB) titrated to a 4% concentration (2ml of additives added to make 50ml of solution) in each nostril (100 microlitres/spray) or vice versa.

    <statisticalmethods>As per the Biostatistician. It is estimated that 37 subjects (74 samples) will be needed to test the hypothesis based on a similarly constructed study by Varshney et al. Although the methodology states that they used the Likert score to measure subject satisfaction no Likert results were provided by which to derive a sample size estimate.  Results were provided for overall preference and these were used to estimate a sample size 12.  This was felt to be underpowered as the null hypothesis: 100% no preference, was highly unrealistic and a test uninformative.   In the absence of actionable information it was decided to replicate the original study sample size of 37 subjects (74 samples). A two tailed p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. 

Anticipating a maximum 15% loss to follow up due to people being unavailable on day 2, the sample size has been adjusted to 86.

To analyse the statistics SPSS statistics version 23 was used. The data was analysed using a one simple t-test, Fischer's Exact test and a Mann -Whitney U test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CoPhenylcaine Forte Nasal Spray is routinely used in the field of Otorhinolaryngology during ward rounds, clinics and theatre. The active ingredients, lignocaine and phenylephrine hydrochloride anaesthetise and cause vasoconstriction of the nasal passage to allow a clearer visual field for endoscopy with less discomfort for the patient. Multiple studies along with anecdotal evidence almost universally supports the notion that the spray has a distinctly unpleasant taste for patients. As is often done with medications that have an unpleasant taste, we are aiming to improve the overall taste profile and tolerability of CoPhenylcaine for patients, without affecting its efficacy, by adding a concentrated flavour and masking agent to the spray</summary>
