Abstinence from smoking was assessed through weekly self-reports in conjunction with biochemical validation (carbon monoxide) conducted once per week at random times and days</interventions>
    <comparator>For the 1) control condition participants were provided with cessation support, including information about different cessation products and service. Cessation support was provided by the research assistant at face-to-face meetings as well as telephone support during each weekly contact. Duration of each contact will be as long as required by each participant, on average a few minutes for the phone contacts and 15-30minutes for face-to-face contacts.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data were entered and analysed using Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and simple descriptive statistics were produced, with means and standard deviations presented for normally distributed continuous data and medium and inter quartile ranges (IQR) presented for non-normally distributed continuous data, and simple proportions reported for dichotomous outcomes.  Participants were considered to be smokers if they reported smoking during the previous week or if they had a CO measure greater than or equal to 7ppm for one or more months. Drop-outs were assumed to have relapsed back to smoking. 

No sample size was calculated for this study given it was a pilot study that aimed to determine the likely effect size to help power a larger trial.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of many adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the unborn child. Indigenous people often have a higher smoking prevalence during pregnancy than non-Indigenous populations. In New Zealand (NZ), the smoking rates among indigenous Maori women who are pregnant have reduced over the last 20 years, however the prevalence still remains high. In NZ the number of pregnant smokers who use smoking cessation interventions is low. In other populations of pregnant women, financial incentives have been shown to increase the attractiveness of smoking cessation programs and increase the number of quit attempts. </summary>
