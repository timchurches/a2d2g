  <interventions>
    <interventions>History taking, physical exam, blood test, stool test are involved in patient selection to ensure suitability by qualified gastroenterologists or gastroenterology trainees. Patient information sheet is provided. Research Nurse specialist or above mentioned clinicians will go through consent form with eligible patients. Consented inflammatory bowel disease patients in remission with low ferritin level without anaemia will then be randomly assigned patients to either treatment with intravenous (Arm 1) or oral iron (Arm 2). All patients will complete two questionnaires at baseline, one on quality of life and the other on fatigue. 
Arm 1: one off visit for administration of intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose (Ferrinject) 1000mg
Arm 2: oral ferrous sulfate 1x 325mg tablet once dailyi for 6 weeks. Tablets will be counted at the end of study to assess adherence. 

At the end of six weeks, all patients will be seen by clinicians to assess inflammatory bowel disease activity through history taking, physical exam, blood test. The same questionnaires on quality of life and fatigues will be completed at end of intervention.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in the quality of health scores including both Shortened IBD Questionnaire (SIBDQ) and SF 36. This is a composite primary outcome. Both questionnaires assess quality of life. SIBDQ is disease specific to IBD, and SF 36 is a general quality of life questionnaire. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in fatigue score using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Fatigue Score (IBD-F).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Six weeks post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease activity as indicated by Harvey Bradshaw and Simple Colitis Disease Activity Score will be assessed compared to baseline to assess safety of oral iron supplementation (ie if increased risk of flare with oral supplementation)</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Previously a mean improvement in the main outcome measure (IBDQ) of 20 points (standard deviation 24.8) was seen in non-anaemic patients.. A clinically significant difference in IBDQ improvement between two groups would be considered to be 20 points. This gives a required sample size of 52. Because the original data was non-parametric and potentially skewed an allowance of 10% will be given, resulting in a total target sample size of 58 patients.

Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to compare repeated measurements in the groups, before and after treatment, and Mann Whitney U to compare measurements between groups, using the SPSS statistical package.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is to compare the effect of Intravenous Iron Infusion Compared with Oral Iron Supplementation on the Quality of Life in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Patients with low iron level without anaemia. The hypothesis is intravenous iron is superior to oral supplementation in improving the quality of life and fatigue of IBD patients. Patients eligible will be randomly assigned to receive either intravenous iron or oral iron for 6 weeks. Questionnaires on quality of life and fatigue will be completed by all participants at the start and 6 weeks after given iron supplementation. The change in the quality of life and fatigue scores will be assessed at the end of the study.
