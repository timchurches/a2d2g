  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of an external sound. Prevalence in the
      general population is 10 to 15%, with tinnitus severely impacting quality of life in 1-2
      percent of the population. Tinnitus therapy is based on counselling, cognitive and
      behavioural therapies in combination with sound therapies which mostly rely on masking.

      For cochlear implant candidates, the ability to use hearing aids and maskers is limited by
      the degree of their hearing loss. Reports of tinnitus prevalence in this group range from 67
      to 100% with a mean of 80%.

      In cochlear implant (CI) recipients, tinnitus suppression primarily occurs during active use
      of the cochlear implant system. In some CI recipients residual inhibition of tinnitus occurs
      when the implant is switched off. While the benefits of CI implantation on tinnitus are well
      documented, there is a group of recipients where tinnitus remains a concern in the implanted
      ear post-operatively.

      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the benefits of using tinnitus masking via a
      CI sound processor that optimises tinnitus suppression with minimal annoyance to the user.
      Furthermore a questionnaire will be employed to capture the prevalence, degree and nature of
      tinnitus in recipients.</summary>
