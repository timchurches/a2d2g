    <studytitle>Risk analysis of larger gauge line insertion relating to  Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters compared to smaller gauged lines</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A comparison of thrombus rates of tapered versus non tapered peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) in adult patients 18yrs or older able to receive a PICC for intravenous therapy: A review of the thrombus rates in patient groups receiving tapered component versus non tapered component of PICC will be compared.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a study review ulilitsing a PICC line with tapper that is larger proximally.  Usually the line is inserted and it is decided by the inserter whether to use the larger proximal part of the line or not.  This study is going to compare pateints that have had the larger part of the line inserted into the vessels with patients who have not had the tapper inserted.  Both patient groups are going to be followed up 7 days post insertion with ultrasound.  This study is a pilot comparative study.</interventions>
    <comparator>Adult patients not receiving reverse tapered device, no tapper will be inserted into this patient population.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether utilising reverse taper catheter increase patients risk of thrombosis.  The outcome will be assessed using ultrasound to scan the patients and record outcomes</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days post insertion</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether there is a reduction in catheter migration.  Seven days post insertion the catheter will be observed for migration at the follow up ultrasound scan.</outcome>
      <timepoint>7 days post insertion</timepoint>
