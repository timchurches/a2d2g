  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Symptomatic Haemorrhoids are a commonly encountered in the colorectal clinic.
Rubber band ligation is a simple treatment that can be performed easily in the
office with minimal equipment. However, pain is common following banding
and is sometimes associated with vasovagal symptoms. There have been some
reports of using local anaesthetics in banding to reduce post-procedure pain but
the results were conflicting. The purpose of this study is to prospectively verify
the efficacy of local anaesthetic injection in reducing the pain associated with
using our present technique of suction banding. The prospectively collected data
will also be examined for possible contributing factors to patients pain
experience following banding.</summary>
