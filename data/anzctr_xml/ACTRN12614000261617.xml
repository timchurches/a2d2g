  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approved name: Ascorbic Acid
Trade name: Vitamin C
Dosage regimen: 1000mg orally per day for 6 weeks

Known adverse effects:Nausea/vomiting, heartburn, abdominal cramping and headache - these tend to be very minor and of low incidence

Known contra­indications/warnings: Haemachomatosis  increases iron uptake from gastro-intestinal tract. Can lead to iron overload.

Patients will commence the intervention within 24 hours of surgery or conservative management.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Audit of wrist fractures at Mackay Base Hospital which will include mechanism of fracture, type of fracture, type of fixation and number of days between injury and fixation. This secondary outcome will allow us to see if any of these factors influence pain at the 6 week mark</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>We will exclude multi-trauma, patients with diagnosed pain or functional issues with the involved wrist or chronic pain patients. Exclusion of patients who require washouts post initial surgery or require prosthesis removal/readjustment prior to 6 week mark will also be conducted. Because of Vitamin Cs side effect of increasing iron uptake we will also exclude any patients who have a diagnosed or documented history, or family history of iron uptake disorders, eg. Haemachromatosis. Patients under the age of 18 an those with an intellectual or mental impairment will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

Sample size calculation requires 46 patients for the study.

For pain using VAS or Numerical 11 point pain score
Group sample sizes of 21 and 21 achieve 82% power to detect a difference of 2.0 between the null hypothesis that both group means are 4.0 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 2.0 with estimated group standard deviations of 2.0 and 2.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.02500 using a two-sided two-sample t-test.

For Function using DASH:
Group sample sizes of 21 and 21 achieve 82% power to detect a difference of 20.0 between the null hypothesis that both group means are 40.0 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 20.0 with estimated group standard deviations of 20.0 and 20.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.02500 using a two-sided two-sample t-test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Distal radius fractures are one of the most common orthopaedic injuries encountered in Australia. Vitamin C has been identified to potentially decrease the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome post distal radius fractures, however the evidence is still inconclusive regarding pain. It is our intention to identify if implementing daily vitamin C post distal radius fixation reduces pain at 6 weeks.</summary>
