             CTEPH as demonstrated by ventilation/perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary
             angiography.

          -  Treatment for pulmonary hypertension within 1 month prior to randomization, excluding
             calcium channel blockers if present for at least 1 month before randomization.

          -  Treatment with calcineurin-inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine A and tacrolimus),

    <summary>The present trial investigates a possible use of oral bosentan, which is currently approved
      for the treatment of symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), to patients suffering
      from inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) because of (i)
      peripheral localization of thrombotic material or (ii) persistent or recurrent pulmonary
      hypertension after pulmonary endarterectomy.</summary>
