  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are two primary objectives in this study:
The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate that the response to the treatment, measured in terms of Disease Activity Index (DAI) after 4 weeks of treatment, is not inferior in Beclomethasone Dipropionate (BDP) group, compared to the one detected in the Prednisone group.

The primary safety objective is to demonstrate a better safety profile in terms of steroid toxicity and reduction of endogenous cortisol production of BDP treatment compared to Prednisone treatment.</summary>
