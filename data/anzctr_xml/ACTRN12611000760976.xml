  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a computerised referral system, the Referral Writer (RW), to improve the quality of GP referral letters and the ability of specialists to prioritise patient appointments and make a diagnosis. Phase 1: 10 Actor-patient consultations based on a pre-determined script will be video recorded and posted onto a secure password protected website. 'Patients" will present with symptoms of one of six cancers. The 88 Participants (GPs) will asked to view the 10 video consultations, decide whether to refer the patient and produce referral letters to specialists. This is envisaged to take a period of one month. Phase 2: Stratified randomisation of the 88 Participants (GPs) will occur and they will be split them into two groups of 44. These groups will be asked to view, over one month, 14 new different video consultations of actor patients presenting with symptoms of one of the six cancers. One group of GP participants, will decide whether to refer the patient and produce referral letters to specialists using their standard system of generating letters. The second group of GP participants decide whether to refer the patient and produce referral letters to specialists using the RW software. The ability of specialists to triage patients using referral letters produced by standard systems will be compared with triage from referral letters written using the RW software. It is envisaged that phase 2 will take one month. This randomised control trial hopes to provide evidence needed to support the integration of RW into existing clinical systems to enhance the referral process and improve outcomes for patients.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of subjects able to be triaged with confidence by 2 specialists working independently (Phase 2) will be compared using multiwariable logistic regression, taking into account cluster randomisation and after adjusting for possible confounders such as demographic variables. The effect of Referral Writer as compared with Standard Practice will be presented as odds-ratio and associated with 95% confidence interval. P-values less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. SAS (Version 9.2) and Stata (Version 11) will be used to perform the analyses of all data in this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At two months from the start of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondarily; multivariable linear and logistic regressions will be used to determine if any identifiable subgroups of GPs have a high chance of referring patients who cannot be triaged with confidence, taking into account cluster randomisation and possible confounders. These identifiable subgroups will be determined for each arm and compared. Prior to randomisation, all practitoners will be operating under Standard Practice (Phase 1), the data from which will be instrumental to establish the baseline and determine identifiable subgroups of GPs writing letters that cannot be triaged with confidence.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be general practitioners (GPs) working in community based practices across Australia and will be recruited through email via the primary researcher's contacts (who is a practicing GP and has links to various GP networks) using purposive sampling methods (snowball, volunteer, convenience sampling). Allocation is not concealed. A flyer will be emailed to GPs with information on the study asking for their reply if they are interested in participating. To be eligible, participants must be available for the duration of the study (Phase 1 and 2). Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Phase 2 of the study will involve randomisation of  GP participants to two arms - the RW arm and standard referral arm. Simple randomisation will occur in Phase 2 using a randomised table created by computer software (i.e. computer sequence generation).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The data in this study offer evidence for the value of the referral writer, a computerised, interactive pro forma in improving the utility of referral letters when patients are referred for a specialist opinionby general practitioners. Comprehensive referral letters, based on the evidence for the predictive value of various elements of the history and examination have a significant value in ensuring that the patient is seen by the right specialist at the right time.</summary>
