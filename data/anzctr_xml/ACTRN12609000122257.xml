  <interventions>
    <interventions>Any women who had an ultrasound examination requested on their fetuses at gestational age of 15-35 weeks in the period 1/1/2007 to 31/10/2007 were included. A routine 3D ultrasound volume of the fetal face was taken and reviewed by the authors. The 3D ultrasound volume was manipluated to reveal the fetal soft and hard palates in the oblique axial plane, the oblique sagittal plane and the targetted reverse face view. The visualization of the fetal soft and hard palate in these planes were compared at each gestational period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Not applicable - this is an observational study.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The routine 3D ultrasound volume of the fetal face would be examined and manipulated by the observers (sonologist and ultrasound reviewer), to reach the oblique axial plane, oblique sagittal plane and the targetted reverse face view. The visualization of the fetal soft and hard palate in these planes were noted and the results compared within the same gestational age.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The ultrasound examination was taken at one point at a gestational age of 15-35 weeks' gestation, on request by the pregnant women's medical practitioners. A routine 3D ultrasound volume of the fetal face would be taken during the ultrasound examinations and reviewed by the obsevers (sonologist and ultrasound reviewer).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether the fetal uvula could be visualized in the 3 examination planes on manipulation of the three-dimensional ultrasound volume of the fetal face was noted by the observers (sonologist and ultrasound reviewer).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is examined at one point on review of the 3D ultrasound volume of the fetal face, which was taken at an ultrasound examination requested by the pregnant womens' medical practitioner at a gestation between 15 and 35 weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the period of 1/1/2007 to 31/10/2007, a 3D ultrasound volume of the fetal face was taken as a routine at antenatal ultrasound examination. The 3D volume was reviewed retrospectively in those fetuses examined at 15-35 weeks gestation, and later confirmed to have normal palate at birth. The fetal secondary palate was examined in the oblique axial, the oblique sagittal and the reverse face views targeted at the uvula. The possibility of viewing the fetal hard and soft palate at various gestations in these planes was analyzed and it was concluded that the fetal secondary palate (hard and soft palate) could be viewed from 15 weeks and onwards but consistently in all three views at or above 19 weeks gestation.</summary>
