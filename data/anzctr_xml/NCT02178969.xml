  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Written informed consent is provided. Patients 18 years of age and older, and
             parent(s)/legal guardian(s) of patients younger than 18 years of age, must provide
             written informed consent prior to participating in the study; additionally, informed
             assent will be obtained from patients younger than 18 years of age as specified by
             local requirements.

          2. Patient must have a documented diagnosis of DEB based on genetic analysis showing a
             mutation in COL7A1 or, in the opinion of the investigator, a confirmed diagnosis of
             DEB based on histologic criteria (antigen mapping or electron microscopy).

          3. Patient must have at least 5 wounds that are suitable for imaging, in the opinion of
             the investigator, at the time of enrollment.

          4. Patient is willing and able to undergo the protocol-specified procedures.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patient has used or is currently using experimental treatment for DEB including, but
             not limited to, bone marrow transplantation, systemic immune suppression, or
             experimental procedures that involve live cells, with potential for systemic spread
             such as gene transfer, stem cell infusions, or other cell type injections such that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, inclusion poses an unacceptable risk to the
             patient or interpretation of these study data.

          2. Patient has squamous cell carcinoma with evidence of locally invasive disease or
             distant metastases.

          3. Patient is pregnant.</exclusivecriteria>
