  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be requested to perform the functional reach test 3 times with each arm (arm parallel to the floor)  in front of a Kinect camera in standing.  A wash out period of 5 minutes between trials will be used to ensure no fatigue.

Participants will then be requested to stand from a sitting position as many times as they can in 30 seconds, with the number of repetitions counted by the camera software.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be requested to perform the functional reach test 3 times with each (arm parallel to the floor) while standing next to a tape measure in standing.

    <concealment>Participants will draw a coloured chip from a hat (eyes closed) and select either a blue or red chip.

    <statisticalmethods>Bland altman plots will be generated from the mean data to determine limits of agreement for the two methods of data collection (manual and electronic). As well, co-efficient of variation will be generated for the novel data collection tool - the Kinect camera. Sample size is based on previous research examining normative data for functional reach (13.8Â±2.2 inches) with a clinically relevant difference of 10% (1.3 inches) and a  reported a power of 80% indicates a sample of 23 people is required.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Data collection using new technology has the capacity to improve the efficiency of data collection and reduce transcription errors in large data sets.  As well, it has potential clinical relevance for management of client assessment and re-assessments.
Functional reach is a validated measure of dynamic balance  that is used for measuring limits of stability in response to a self-generated perturbation. It is widely used for a variety of clinical populations and compares well with other balance measures for clinical utility. Traditionally values are measured by a clinician reading values from a tape measure or ruler adjacent to the client.  New motion capture software and cameras has the capacity to improve efficiency in both research and clinical contexts by accurately measuring, recording and storing information.  As well, costs for this commercially available technology have reduced dramatically in recent times, making it cost-effective for a wide range of practical applications. The Kinect camera has been validated for range of motion, and several functional tasks like Timed Up and Go, however, to date no validation studies have been done using the Kinect for windows to compare its accuracy and clinical utility in a dynamic balance task.  Recent advances in camera technology (last 5 months) have increased the sensitivity of motion capture and allowed us to test it in this way.  Previously published validation studies using this technology are typically small 
Potential advantages include:
*Reduced time for data collection
*Improved storage of data 
*Reduced data collection time
*Easy ability to securely gain and store data
The aim of this project is to determine if the new camera technology is 
*accurate and 
* reliable</summary>
