  <interventions>
    <interventions>A brief speech and language screening assessment (including a receptive language task, an expressive language task, and a speech task) will be administered to the subjects under 2 telehealth conditions: 
a) via real-time video videoconferencing - with visual and audio information transmitted over videoconferencing, and with printed information (e.g., assessment stimulus items) being transmitted from the therapist's computer to the childs computer using remote access software.
b) via internet-based real-time video  with visual information transmitted over the internet, audio information transmitted over speaker phone, and printed information (e.g., assessment stimulus items) being transmitted from the therapists computer to the childs computer using remote access software.
The children will also complete the screening assessment in-person (comparator condition).  The order of these 3 conditions will be random.

Each screening assessment will take approximately 15 minutes, and the child will be assessed under all both telehealth conditions and also the in-person condition (comparator) on one day.  All conditions will be simulated at the Royal Children's Hospital (for the videoconferencing and internet-based conditions the therapist will be located in another part of the hospital).  The parent or caregiver will be present in the room with the child during all conditions.  Similar but different receptive and expressive language screening tasks will be administered in each condition to avoid the test-retest effect.  As each assessment is very short (15 minutes duration), there will be no wash-out period and the children will be assessed in each of the 2 telehealth conditions and also the comparator condition (in-person) consecutively.

Children will be divided up into two groups: the preschool-aged group (3  5 years) and the school-aged group (6  12 years).
The screening assessment for the preschool-aged group will consist of:
a) The Diagnostic Screener and Oromotor Assessment subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in both telehealth conditions and also the in-person (comparator) condition.
b) The Preschool Language Scale  4th Edition Screening Test (PLS-4 Screener) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in 1 condition only (random selection - may be administered in either of the telehealth conditions or the in-person (comparator) condition).
c) Selected items from the Preschool Language Scale  4th Edition (PLS-4) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  Selected items will be chosen to mirror similar items in the screening test.  Two different sets of items will be administered in the other two conditions (random selection).

The screening assessment for the 6  12 years age group will consist of:
a) The Diagnostic Screener and Oromotor Assessment subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in both telehealth conditions and also the in-person (comparator) condition.
b) The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals  4th Edition Screening Test (CELF-4 Screener) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  This will be administered in 1 condition only (random selection - may be administered in either of the telehealth conditions or the in-person (comparator) condition).
c) Selected items from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals  4th Edition (CELF-4) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).  Selected items will be chosen to mirror similar items in the screening test.  Two different sets of items will be administered in the other two conditions (random selection).

Following assessment under all 3 conditions the child will return on another day (within one month of the first day) for a comprehensive speech and language assessment.  This will be administered in-person.
The comprehensive assessment for the preschool-aged group will consist of:
a) The Articulation and Phonology subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).
b) The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals Preschool  2nd Edition (CELF-P2) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).

The comprehensive assessment for the school-aged group will consist of:
a) The Articulation and Phonology subtests from the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).
b) The Comprehensive Assessment of Spoken Language (CASL) (Pearson Clinical Assessment).</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is the traditional in-person speech and language screening condition.  The speech and language screening assessment will also be administered in this condition (assessment items described above in descriptions of intervention/exposure).  This screening assessment will take approximately 15 minutes.  The order of conditions will be randomly selected.</comparator>

      <outcome>Quality of audio and visual information.

Measured by: 
a) number of times the patient or caregiver requests a repetition during assessment
b) number of times the clinician requests repetition from the patient or caregiver
c) number of breaks in audio signal
d) number of breaks in visual signal
e) total time to complete assessment.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost.

Measured by: a cost and feasibility analysis will be performed based on the participant accessing the assessment service via telehealth from their residential address or local hospital, or in-person at a tertiary centre, including accommodation and travel costs from their residential address.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately following assessment via telehealth and in-person.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient, caregiver and therapist satisfaction.

Measured by: a survey will be developed specifically for use in this study.  Patients, caregivers and therapists will be asked to complete the survey after each condition, and then after all 3 conditions have been administered they will be asked to rate their preference.  The children will be asked to rate different aspects of the assessment as either ?good? ?ok? or ?bad?.  The caregivers and therapists will be asked to rate different aspects of the assessment out of a 5 point scale, with 1 = strongly disagree, and 5 = strongly agree.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assess the usefulness of telehealth technology for speech and language assessment.  The specific aims are:

a) to compare the quality of visual and auditory information during an in-person assessment versus assessment via two telehealth methods (custom-built telehealth equipment, and internet-based videoconferencing).
b) To compare the cost and feasibility of these three methods.
c) To compare the patient, caregiver and therapist's preference for these three methods.

Two groups of children will be recruited from the existing speech pathology caseload at the Royal Children's Hospital: 20 pre-school aged children (3 - 5 years) with a history of cancer, and 20 primary school-aged children (6 - 12 years) with a history of cancer.  Both groups of children will complete a speech and language screening assessment under 3 conditions (in-person, and via custom-built telehealth and internet-based videoconferencing).  All conditions will be simulated at the Royal Children's Hospital. Data collected will include the number of requests for repetition, number of breaks in visual and auditory signal, and total time to complete the assessment.  At the end of each assessment the patient, caregiver and therapist will rate the assessment against a standard checklist.  After all 3 assessments the patient, caregiver and therapist will rate their preference.  A cost and feasibility analysis will be performed based on the participant accessing the different options while living at their residential address.</summary>
