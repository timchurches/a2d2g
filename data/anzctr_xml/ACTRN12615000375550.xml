  <interventions>
    <interventions>60 patients will be enrolled in the study with laparoscopic abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Patients will be divided into two groups according to body mass index (Group I: if BMI is equal ot greater than 30 and Group II: if BMI is below than 24.9). In all cases, to avoid errors in body temperature measurements arising from the
diurnal rhythm, body temperature measurements were taken in the morning between 08:30 and 13:00 hours.
After preoxygenation with 100% O2, intravenous induction of anesthesia was obtained with 2-2,5 mg/kg propofol 0.6mg/kg rocuronium and 0.1 mcg/kg remifentanyl. After endotracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with 5-6% desflurane in 50% air-50% O2. Respiration was continued mechanically
and was adjusted to 30 to 40 mmHg ETCO2. In addition, to partially humidify and heat inhaled gases, a disposable humidifier was added to the breathing circuit. When necessary, patients were given additional doses of remifentanyl infusion and rocuronium. To remove the residual
muscle relaxant effects during recovery from anesthesia, 0.04 mg/kg neostigmine, and when required, 0.01 mg/kg intravenous atropine was used. When laryngeal reflexes and adequate spontaneous breathing returned, the patients were extubated.
The patients's temperature will follow every 5 minutes during operating room and postanesthetic care unit. Temperatures will record from central temperature, axillary, wrist, finger, thigh, cruris.  </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will perform using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) version 20. Data distribution was analyzed using the analysis of variance. Parametric data was expressed as the mean Â± standard deviation. Following the assessment of age, weight, height, BMI, duration of surgery and all parametric data with variance analysis, an independent t test was used for between-group comparisons. Within-group comparisons were performed with paired sample t test. ASA risk class within the groups was assessed using chi-square test.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Hypothermia is the most common thermoregulatory disorder encountered during anesthetic methods and it can cause complications. Subcutaneous fat tissues increse in the obese. Therefore, aim of this study has observed whether anesthesia induced thermoregulatory respones changes in the obese.

Methods: Our study will include 60 patients aged 18-60 years within the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-III risk group who will scheduled for laparoscopic abdomen surgery. Patients will divide into two groups according to body mass index (in Group II, BMI&lt; 24.9 and Group I &gt; or equal 30). Probes for measuring the nasopharengeal membrane and peripheral temperature will place in patients, and their mean skin temperature and mean body temperature will assess immediately before the induction of anesthesia and 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the induction of anesthesia. Shivering score will record at postanesthesia care unit.
