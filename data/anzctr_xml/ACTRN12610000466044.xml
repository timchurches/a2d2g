  <interventions>
    <interventions>The subjects will assigned randomly to one of 3 groups: 
1) TENS High frequency, will receive conventional TENS of 100 Hz, pulse width of 100 microseconds;
2) TENS Low frequency, will receive TENS of 4 Hz, pulse width of 100 microseconds; 
3) TENS Placebo. 
The treatment will be performed in a single session, and the TENS will be applied for 30 minutes. Each subject will notified the investigator upon onset of her pain. The treatment will be administered when the subject notifies investigator that she is experiencing pain during a menstrual cycle or 3 days before the menstruation.The subjects will instructed to take no pain medication for at least six hours before treatment. Two electrodes will placed on the low back area (L3, L4), and the others two over suprapubic area.</interventions>
    <comparator>The TENS placebo, there was no perceptible sensation, because the TENS unit was switched on to display an active indicator light without any electrical stimulation. The placebo treatment will be applied for 30 minutes and he treatment will be performed in a single session. Two electrodes will placed
on the low back area (L3, L4), and the others two over suprapubic area.</comparator>

    <concealment>The method in which allocation concealment was performed, i.e. the person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed and it was done by central randomization by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical study that compares three study groups; high-frequency TENS, low-frequency TENS and placebo TENS. The aim of this study will be to determine the effectiveness of high and low frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation when compared to placebo for treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.</summary>
