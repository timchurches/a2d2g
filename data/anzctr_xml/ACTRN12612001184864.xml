    <studytitle>A pilot randomised controlled trial of outpatient balloon catheter priming for induction of labour.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In low risk pregnant women undertaking cervical priming for induction of labour, where there is no evidence of maternal or fetal compromise,  will outpatient management, in comparison to inpatient management, result in comparable clinical outcomes, interventions, maternal satisfaction and complications?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women in the experimental group having cervical priming for induction of labour will be allowed to go home after insertion of a balloon catheter, providing that a 20 minute cardiotocography (CTG) monitoring is satisfactory. They will return the next day for induction of labour, or for prostaglandin (PGE2) repriming. If they go into labour overnight or if there are any complications such as bleeding or rupture of membranes, they will return to the hospital overnight. Women in the control group will recieve the same management, except they will remain in hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>Outpatient (experimental group) compared to inpatient management (control group). Inpatient management is standard care, with insertion of balloon catheter and CTG monitoring, then facilitation of overnight rest. Catheter is then removed the next morning, and induction of labour undertaken (as per outpatient management)</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Known intra uterine growth restriction (&lt; 10th percentile for gestational age), suspected intra uterine growth restriction, Gestational Hypertension and Pre-Eclampsia.*Conditions specific to catheter priming including: placenta previa, low placenta, unDx vaginal bleeding, known latex allergy, active vaginal infection, active genital herpes.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The woman and her attending clinician will decide that induction of labour is indicated. The clinician will perform a vaginal examination to decide whether cervical priming is
necessary. If the clinician feels that induction is necessary and she meets the eligibility criteria for the study, the woman will be referred to the research coordinator. The researcher (who is not involved in providing care) will then see her, and confirm her eligibility for the study. The trial will be explained and if she consents to participate, then the researcher will consent her into the trial. The woman will not be randomized until she is admitted for cervical priming.This computer generated randomization table will be generated and the randomization status will be designated in individual sequentially numbered sealed envelopes which are blinded to the researcher and participants until assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is 2:1 experimental to control stratified for primiparity and multiparity. 
Thus, two randomization lists generated, allocation ratio of 2:1.
List  for first time births (nulliparous) n=84.
List for women who have given birth before (parous) n=36.
Computer-generated list from: www.sealedenvelope.com
(to generate unequal allocation of 2:1, we needed to use the same treatment twice, ie: Group A, Group A, Group B. Block size divisible of sample size and treatment groups.</sequence>
