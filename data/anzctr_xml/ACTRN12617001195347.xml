  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group (PIPPA group): 
Infants at increased risk of peanut allergy under 12 months of age who have not previously eaten peanut will be invited to attend a clinic for medically supervised introduction of peanut (PIPPA Clinic). Infants will consume their usual solids foods they eat at home such as pureed/mashed apple, sweet potato, yoghurt etc. 2 teaspoons of peanut butter will be added to this food and it is intended the infants will consume a maximum of 1/4 cup of food (with the peanut butter added) over a 15-30 minute time period.

Prior to consuming peanut butter, a small amount of peanut butter will be rubbed on the mucosal side of the lower lip of the infant.  The infant will be observed for 15 minutes to assess whether any local angioedema occurs, which would be considered to represent an allergic reaction to peanut.  If there is no local angioedema of the lip, the consumption of peanut butter mixed with the infant's usual food as described above will proceed.</interventions>
    <comparator>he control group will consist of infants at 12 months of age who did not attend a PIPPA clinic to introduce peanut for  the first time.  These infants will be recruited from community settings such as General Practices and Community Immunisation Clinics when attending for their routine 12 month immunisation visits, or from hospital clinics when coincidentally attending for other medical appointments.  Infants will be included in the control group if they have one of the identified risk factors for peanut allergy, namely eczema treated with over the counter or prescription steroids, any other food allergy, a first degree relative with nut allergy, or any 2 first degree relatives with one or more atopic disease (food allergy, hayfever, eczema and/or asthma).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of infants regularly consuming peanut at 12 months of age in the PIPPA versus control group, as assessed by telephone questionnaire at 12 months of age.  Infants will be defined as regularly consuming peanut if parents report that they have been eating an average of 1 teaspoon of peanut butter (or equivalent) per week over the preceding month.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of infants with parent-reported peanut allergy/peanut reactions at 12 months of age in the PIPPA versus control group. Infants in both the PIPPA and control group will be contacted and will complete a telephone questionnaire to determine any parent reported adverse reactions to peanut (including the nature, severity and timing of reactions that were experienced at home).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months of age.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of allergic reactions to first ingestion in the PIPPA versus control group.  Reactions in the PIPPA group will be determined by direct observation of study clinicians, as first ingestion of peanut in the intervention (PIPPA) group will occur in the PIPPA clinic under supervision.  Reactions to first consumption of peanut at home in the control group will be assessed by telephone questionnaire at 12 months of age.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The parent reported type and severity of reactions to peanut at home in the PIPPA versus control group.

The questionnaire has been specifically designed for this study.</outcome>

Infants between 4 and 11 months of age who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited to the intervention arm of the study (i.e. invited to attend a PIPPA clinic for first consumption of peanut under supervision).

The control group will be randomly selected infants who are already 12 months of age, and meet the inclusion criteria for the control group (i.e. they have one of the identified risk factors for developing peanut allergy).  As infants in the control group are already 12 months of age, they would not be eligible to participate in the intervention which is limited to 4-11 month old infants.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peanut allergy is the most common cause of severe food allergic reactions in children, and rates of peanut allergy appear to be rising.  Some infants are at an increased risk of developing a peanut allergy due to the presence of eczema, other food allergies or a family history of allergy. For these high-risk infants, early introduction of peanut with regular consumption starting before 12 months of age significantly decreases the incidence of peanut allergy. However, parental apprehension to introduce peanut early leads to only 1 in 5 high risk infants starting peanut within the recommended window.
Recent guidelines released by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy suggest at risk infants should see their doctor for advice on introducing peanut, however uncertainty remains amongst health care professionals about how and where high risk infants should introduce peanut. The aim of the Promoting Introduction to Prevent Peanut Allergy (PIPPA) project is to develop a safe and efficient parent-led, clinician-supported model that promotes early introduction of peanut. This intervention study will examine the efficacy of a new model of care, where parents with high risk infants will introduce peanut in a supported environment. The primary outcome of the PIPPA project will be to compare the number of high risk infants consuming peanut before 12 months of age, between families who attend the PIPPA clinic (intervention group) and families who receive the current standard of care, and the proportion of infants who have an allergic reaction to first consumption of peanut in the PIPPA clinic. Secondary outcomes will examine whether there is any difference in the incidence of peanut allergy between the intervention and standard care group. 
The PIPPA project will provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of a new model of care to be implemented in a wide range of settings across Australia.  The key components of the PIPPA project can be replicated in almost any healthcare environment, including primary care and rural/regional hospitals, ultimately reducing the incidence of peanut allergy in the community.
