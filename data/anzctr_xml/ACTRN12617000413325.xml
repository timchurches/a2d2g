  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group will receive the START intervention therapy.
Start Caring for Carers is a manual based therapeutic intervention designed to improve coping skills, depression and anxiety in carers of people with dementia by teaching the carer to manage the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as the stress associated with caregiving. It has been adapted from the Strategies for Relatives or START (developed by UCL) to suit the Australian context. 
START Caring for Carers is comprised of 8 sessions delivered one on one over 8 to 16 weeks, either in person or via telehealth video conferencing.  Mode of administration (either in person or via telehealth video conferencing) will be determined by participant preference and will be considered in acceptability of interventions. Each session takes approximate one hour to deliver and concludes with a relaxation component.  Carers will have the flexibility to attend weekly or fortnightly sessions. Each carer will be issued with a copy of the Carer manual that includes in session material, between session tasks and support resources. Between session tasks comprise of practicing what is covered in session e.g., noting down behaviours observed and trying to generate antecedent to behaviour. It is estimated that between session tasks will be approximately 15 minutes in duration. The intervention will be provided by provisionally registered psychologists currently enrolled in the Master of Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle. The therapists will be supervised by a Senior Clinical Psychologist. Each therapist will partake in a full day pre-intervention training session in the new intervention and weekly supervision. Therapist competency to deliver the program will be evaluated pre-intervention. Each therapist will receive a copy of the Leader Manual. 
Sessions will be recorded and used by the supervisor to assess treatment fidelity.
Therapist will complete surveys pre-intervention, post session and post study to assess acceptability of the new intervention.

    <comparator>Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT): an evidenced based intervention used for the treatment of depression and anxiety in Australia. CBT will comprise up to 12 sessions, 1 hour per session, weekly ideally, though could occur fortnightly, either in person or via telehealth video conferencing.  Mode of administration (either in person or via telehealth video conferencing) will be determined by participant preference and will be considered in acceptability of interventions. The intervention will be provided by provisionally registered psychologists currently enrolled in the Master of Clinical Psychology at the University of Newcastle. The therapists will be supervised by a Senior Clinical Psychologist. Sessions will be recorded and used by the supervisor to assess treatment fidelity.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimations were not conducted due to this research being in its pilot phase. However, we aim for a sample size of at least 30 participants per group based on pilot clinical feasibility trial recommendations in the literature (Johanson &amp; Brooks, 2010).

Data will be analysed using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative feasibility data (e.g., affective symptoms and carer burden) will be analysed by examining treatment effects and individual reliable change indices. Given randomisation procedures are likely to result in inequality between groups pre-treatment, any observed differences will be taken into account in analyses. Qualitative feasibility data will be collected by survey instruments and analysed using thematic analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many carers of people with dementia develop affective symptoms of depression and anxiety as a result of their carer role. The START program has been shown to be effective in the UK context in improving these symptom in carers. This study seeks to: 1. Examine the acceptability of the START program in an Australian context as reported by therapists and carers of people with dementia including examination of: a) Adherence of therapists to the treatment manual and their perceptions about the value of the program and potential generalisability in the Australian context; b) Carers perceived acceptability of the program as reflected by their self-report and completion of all 8 sessions; c) Benefit to carers as measured by a decrease in depression, anxiety and carer burden, relative to the control (CBT) group. 2. Examine the feasibility of the START program in an Australian context by examining the practicality and viability of intervention delivered by provisionally registered psychologists from within an Australian university psychology clinic.</summary>

    <publicnotes>Study is not powered for an RCT as it is a feasibility and acceptability study.
People receiving, assessing and analysing data will be blind to intervention type.  All collection of data is blinded, the person assessing outcomes and analysing data will be blinded to quantitative data, but not blinded to qualitative data because some of the questions themselves (even though administered by qualtrics) may alude to which treatment was received. Also it is difficult to really ensure that qualitative data is interpreted 'objectively'. </publicnotes>
