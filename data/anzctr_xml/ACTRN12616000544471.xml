  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group ward nursing staff will receive the standard implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) plus the Facilitation Intervention for Practice improvement (FLIP). The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care published a CPG titled "A guide to support implementation of the National Consensus Statement: Essential elements for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration". This CPG will be dissemination to all wards (both intervention and control wards). All wards will receive standard education support provided by the hospital related to this topic. Standard education consists of in-service presentations during work time to update staff on policy or practice changes, information on the CPG, its availability online as well as notification of the free online educational courses available to increase their knowledge and understanding about the identification and management of deteriorating patients. Information will be disseminated via posters on ward noticeboards and emails  sent by the Nurse Unit Manager to all nursing staff. 

In addition to the standard implementation, the intervention wards will receive additional educational support (FLIP) specifically targeting identified areas requiring practice improvement. FLIP comprises individuals in facilitator roles using facilitation methods (face to face contact) and processes in a flexible way to tailor implementation strategies to the local ward context, according to identified barriers and enablers. There will be two types of facilitator roles: hospital facilitators (HFLIP) and ward facilitators (WFLIP). A hospital facilitator (HFLIP) will be appointed to cover 4 or 5 intervention wards in each of the four hospitals, acting as the overall facilitation lead and a coordinator and mentor for the ward facilitators. In each intervention ward, two ward facilitators will be appointed to support and enable ward nurses to implement the CPGs into practice. Each HFLIP will work with 8-10 WFLIPs. The intervention wards will receive half a day per week support from the HFLIP for 6 months, reviewing barriers and enablers to implementing CPGs into practice during the intervention period and in discussion with the WFLIPs. The HFLIP will also review ward specific systems, processes, routines and audit practices in order to align systems of care to enable implementation of CPGs into daily practice. Training and a toolkit of methods and techniques will be given to all FLIPs to promote the transfer of CPGs into daily practice. At ward level, the 2 WFLIPs will work with the HFLIP to audit practice, identify barriers, strategies and areas for improvement; they will provide cover for each other during leave and support ward staff during practice hours, receiving one day per fortnight of protected time for conducting audits and meeting with the HFLIP to agree to tailored strategies to improve adherence to guidelines. The intervention will commence following the completion of training and when the HFLIPs can commence on the wards in the role. The intervention will last 6 months.

HFLIPs will have prior experience (e.g. in practice development or an education role) so that they can support and mentor the WFLIPS and deal with the more challenging contextual barriers that may arise. 

Standardised procedure manuals will be provided to all facilitators with specific detail on roles and responsibilities. All facilitators will undergo monitoring procedures to ensure intervention fidelity. All Hospital and Ward FLIPs will receive training for a single day together and then the HFLIPs will continue for a further two days on advanced facilitation skills. Training will be conducted jointly by an investigator and a nurse educator. They will also receive mentoring and support during the trial consisting of monthly teleconferences for an hour with an investigator and support via a discussion blog asynchronously throughout the intervention period. The intensity of intervention will be assessed and monitored across sites. Examples of practices in the CPGs include documenting clinical assessments accurately; completing scope of practice activities such as administering medications; escalating care to the appropriate staff. All facilitators will enter data into the Electronic Activity and Communication Log (eACL). Data will be collected at time of activity and throughout the duration of the intervention on ward communication. Data captured will include methods and techniques outlined in the Facilitator Manuals, enablers and barriers, and measures of impact.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group ward staff will receive the standard implementation of Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs). The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care published a CPG titled "A guide to support implementation of the National Consensus Statement: Essential elements for recognising and responding to clinical deterioration". This CPG will be dissemination to all wards allocated to Arm 2. The ward will receive standard education support provided by the hospital related to this topic. Standard education consists of in-service presentations during work time to update staff on policy or practice changes, information on the CPG, its availability online as well as notification of the free online educational courses available to increase their knowledge and understanding about the identification and management of deteriorating patients. Posters will be posted on ward noticeboards and emails with the information will be sent by the Nurse Unit Manager to all nursing staff. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations are based on 15% incidence of documented abnormal vital signs(VSs). To detect a 20% difference between (control and intervention) groups immediately following completion of the intervention and 6 months post-intervention, or an odds ratio of at least 1.8, using a two-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with 90% power, 270 documented abnormal VSs per time point per study arm are required. Our sample size has been inflated to allow for a design effect of 1.5, accounting for within hospital clustering effect. Type I error is set at 1% significance level accounting for multiple comparisons. For secondary outcomes, we have 80% power to detect a 5% difference (7% vs 25%) in unplanned ICU admissions, a 7% difference (9% vs 2%) for MET calls, and 2 day (SD=10) mean difference (26 VS 24) for hospital LOS. Due to a low incidence of cardiac arrests and hospital mortality, power analysis is based on combining 6 and 12 month data in intervention and control wards, resulting in 80% power to detect a 2.5% difference (3% VS 0.5%). 

Quantitative methods will be used to analyse patient outcomes. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare the proportions of documented abnormal VS between groups. The CMH test takes account of the hospital clustering effect and allows for variation between the strata in the underlying rates. The common odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval will also be reported as well as the results of the Breslow-Day test for homogeneity of the odds ratios across the strata. If there is significant heterogeneity in the odds ratios, the treatment groups will also be compared, using Chi-squared tests, in three separate subset analyses, one for each of the hospitals. Similar analysis will be performed for all other secondary comparison of proportions. In supportive analyses, generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) will be used to compare the proportion of documented measurement of vital signs at baseline, immediately following the completion of the intervention and 6 months post-intervention after adjusting for baseline measurements. Analogous linear mixed models will be used to analyse the continuous-scale secondary endpoints. A series of exploratory analyses will be conducted on subgroups and the impact of covariates, on estimates of the effect of the intervention, will also be examined. Hospital LOS will be considered as time to event data. Survival rates will be calculated and illustrated by the KaplanMeier method and further analysed by the log-rank test for univariate analysis (stratified by hospitals). Variables that revealed prognostic or effect modifying potential on the outcome as suggested by univariate analysis were subsequently evaluated by the proportional Cox regression for multivariate analysis. Hazard ratios with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported. P-values &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. Data will be analysed using stata version 13 or later. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA): Patients will be identified through the patient record audit over three separate 24 hour periods and at three time points (baseline, 6 and 12 months). Identified patients will be assumed to be part of their ward allocation (intervention or control) for their entire hospital LOS. This will enable comparison of total costs and patient outcomes (unplanned ICU admissions, mortality and HLOS) between intervention and control groups in the pre-intervention period (baseline) and at immediate post intervention(6 months) and 12 months. Patient level data will be retrieved from hospital admission and clinical costing systems for the entire hospital episode for each identified patient. Costs will be attributed to ICU admission and ward LOS through the hospital clinical costing system, therefore any between group differences in unplanned ICU admissions and/or total hospital length of stay will be reflected in the mean total cost. Costs will be attributed to the FLIP intervention based on the additional costs of the KT process (staff time) over standard in-hospital CPG training. In addition to CEA from a health system perspective based on change in mortality rates, cost minimisation or savings due to the FLIP intervention can be determined by changes in HLOS and ICU admissions between groups, offset by cost of FLIP. 
Process Evaluation: Interviews, field observations and focus group transcripts will be analysed thematically. Analysis will be iterative, refining emerging themes, then comparing themes and relationships through a process of pattern matching to examine for data consistency. Themes and relationships will be re-examined and recoded by two members of the research team. Analysis will continue until no new themes emerge and agreement on themes.
