  <interventions>
    <interventions>Epidemiological, environmental, cultural, social, economic and microbiological determinants of health.
Children are enrolled at the time of presentation for any reason and followed monthly for a period of 12 months. If a child develops an ARI they are followed weekly for 28 days and parents complete a daily cough diary. Demographic, clinical, social, environmental, cultural and economic factors are collected via researcher-administered questionnaires, clinical histories and datasets, telephone interviews or home visits if required. Multivariable modelling will be used to examine the relationship between potential explanatory factors and ARI incidence and outcomes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute respiratory infection: For the purpose of this study, an ARI is defined as any acute illness (ie less than 14 days duration) with cough as symptom.Children that present with ARI or develop ARI during the study period will have weekly follow-up for, four weeks including weekly nasal swabs, and parent completed cough diary cards. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Any episode within 12 months of enrolment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chronic cough.
chronic cough (defined as &gt; 4 weeks duration) and/or  hospitalisation for ARI.</outcome>
      <timepoint>each child on the study is followed for 12 months
28 days post onset of acute respiratory illness if a child has a persistent cough at day 28, he/she will be reviewed by a paediatric respiratory fellow. Once seen by  the paediatric respiratory fellow, if  cough resolved the child will go back into the study on monthly follow ups. If cough not resolved at time of paediatric respiratory fellow review child will stay on weekly follow up until any further investigations by paediatric respiratory fellow are completed once completed child will go back onto monthly follow up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dental caries.
at enrolment a oral health screen questionnaire is completed by research staff and a stage of dentition questionnaire is completed by dentist or oral hygiene therapist</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Direct and indirect cost of acute respiratory illness.
To calculate the direct and indirect economic cost of ARI in urban children to the family, community and health-care sectors. Economic endpoints will include both direct and indirect costs for ARI incurred as follows
Costs incurred by the Primary health care service
Costs incurred by the family
Costs incurred by other aspects of the health sector
Costs borne by other sectors of the economy
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Total cost calculated over 12 months of active study period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nasal carriage of respiratory viruses and bacteria.
Nasal swabs are tested for 7 bacteria and 17 viruses via multiplex PCR methods at the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory. Descriptive statistics were used to estimate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and nasal carriage of 7 bacteria and 17 viruses</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, monthly for 12 months and weekly during an acute respiratory illness episode.
Participants will be in the study for 12 months following enrolment.
Monthly routine follow-up for 12 months includes,Determine willingness to continue in the study,completion of  monthly study questionnaire,collection of monthly nasal swab,collection of any relevant clinical data from medical records at the medical centre or hospital if applicable.

    <statisticalmethods>Broadly, descriptive and analytical statistical methods will be utilised including univariate and multivariate logistic and Poisson regression to identify independent predictors of study endpoints. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, socio-economic and risk factor data will be tabulated and expressed as proportions and/or means of the selected characteristics with the corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). 
Economic analyses will be done according to established methods , including detailed subanalyses of data that account for epidemiological, social, cultural, risk factor and microbiological variables. 

The primary analysis will be the incidence density of ARI over a 12-month period. Differences in demographic, clinical, laboratory and risk factor data between children who do and do not develop ARI will be assessed by the normal test for comparisons of means and Chi square tests for comparison of proportions. The incidence of ARI and the predictors for episodes will be assessed assuming a Poisson distribution and multivariate analyses performed using Poisson regression methods. The denominator will be child weeks of observation, with the number of days of ARI experienced for each child removed from person-time at risk calculations.

To estimate the cost of ARI illness, the costing approach will involve following three steps a) Identification of the appropriate resources used, b) Measurement of resources used; and c) valuation of such resources used. Identification of the resources or inputs used, such as health care personnel, transport, consumables, will be guided by the ARI clinical or care pathway, which will be used to identify key care activities and associated unit costs. The pathway will reflect the purpose of the exercise, identify all the components or elements of the program/service in a linear manner, and may involve disease progressions. Some or all of the following type of activities will be included in the costing, which may differ from costs in non-ACCHS services: Co-payments for the pharmaceutical products; transport of clients to and from clinic /or services, social and cultural issue that clinic staff with on behalf of clients e.g. economic hardship, legal issues. The units of measure of costing data will then be combined with the unit costs to estimate the cost of each activity.  The costs of the activities will be aggregated to estimate the cost of illness </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the burden of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) among  children being a substantial cause of childhood morbidity and associated costs to families, communities and the health system, data on disease burden in urban children are lacking. Consequently evidence-based decision-making, data management guidelines, health resourcing for primary health care services and prevention strategies are lacking. This study aims to comprehensively describe the epidemiology, impact and outcomes of ARI in urban  children  in the greater Brisbane area. </summary>
