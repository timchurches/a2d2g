  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a single intervention, where participants will be asked to consume 30g of hazelnuts daily for four weeks. The study will be carried out to assess the effects of incorporating hazelnuts into the usual diet on blood lipids and lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, hs-CRP, glucose and insulin among Maori and European participants. This study will also examine the effects of repeated exposure to hazelnuts on participants' acceptance.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood lipids and lipoproteins, apolipoproteins. Plasma total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations will be measured by enzymatic methods using a Cobas Mira Plus analyser. Plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration will be calculated using the Friedewald formula. Apolipoproteins A1 and B100 concentrations will be determined by immunotubidity using commercial kits from Roche Diagnostics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 4 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma hs-CRP will be measured by using a Cobas Mira Plus Analyser.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 4 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood glucose and insulin. Plasma glucose will be measured by using a Cobas Mira Plus Analyser. Plasma insulin will be measured by using Elecsys 2010.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 4 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate using an Omron pressure monitor (Model HEM-907).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 4 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition. This will be measured by using a bioelectrical impedance analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 4 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptance for hazelnuts. This will be determined by using a 150mm visual analogue scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, at 4 weeks after intervention commencement and daily during the exposure period.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the public health recommendation to consume 30g of nuts per day, there is limited data investigating whether the recommended amount of nuts is considered acceptable to the consumer. One study reported that consuming the recommended 30 grams per day of nuts was found to be achievable and acceptable. The study population used in this research was largely European, therefore whether the results can be extrapolated to other ethics groups e.g. Maori, is unknown. 

In addition to measuring the acceptability of nuts, it is of equal importance to investigate the health properties of nuts. To date, there are five human intervention trials that have investigated the effect of hazelnut supplementation on plasma cholesterol levels. As the study population in the previous studies was largely European, it is of interest to compare the health effects of regular nut consumption in European and other ethnic group, i.e. Maori.

The NATINATI study therefore aims to compare the acceptability of hazelnuts and the effects on blood lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, hs-CRP, glucose and insulin after consuming 30g of hazelnuts per day for four weeks among matched (age within 1 year, sex, BMI for 2 BMI points) Maori and European participants.</summary>
