  <interventions>
    <interventions>Muscle Energy Techniques: The shortened muscle is placed in a midÂ­ range position about halfway between a fully stretched and a fully relaxed state. The patient contracts the muscle isometrically, using a maximum degree of effort for 5-10 seconds while the effort is resisted completely. On release of the effort, a rapid stretch is made to a new barrier, without any 'bounce', and this is held for at least 10 seconds. The patient relaxes for approximately 20 seconds and the procedure is repeated up to complete session.
Active Isolated Stretching: Targeted muscle was identified patient was guided to actively contract the opposite muscle. At the end of patient range of motion the therapist stretch the targeted muscles by adding stretch force of less then 1 pound so that muscles are not excessively irritated. The duration of stretch should not be more then 2 seconds. The patient is now supported and guided back?to the starting position. This step is called the recovery phase. The protocol of the stretch and recovery phases is repeated for complete session. Each successive repetition usually allows for an incremental gain of a few degrees of motion of the stretch. The client should breathe out during the stretch phase and breathe in during the recovery phase.
Patients full filling Inclusion criteria were randomly assigned into two equal groups (30 in each). Group A got treatment of Muscle Energy Techniques (1 set of 10 repetitions per session, 3 sessions per week on alternate days) and Group B got Active isolated stretching (1 set of 10 repetitions per session, 3 sessions per week on alternate days). The patients were treated for the period of six weeks. Pre and post assessment was done using Inclinometer for cervical Range of Motion, Neck Disability index for disability and Visual Analogue Scale for pain.
10 Minutes Individual one-on-one Sessions for each group in the clinic performed by Manual Therapist (MS Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy ) having at least 1 year experience.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical therapy treatment for the neck pain is utilized around the globe. There are many treatment protocols for management of the neck pain. Among these techniques our study is focused on the two famous techniques Muscles energy technique (MET) and Active isolated stretching. This study will bring information for the practitioners to use most up to date management techniques, which would prove more useful and helpful for the patients in the long run. Due to advancement in education around the world, the modern world is prone to rely on more evidence based treatment protocols. The study would add extra strength to the modern techniques.</summary>
