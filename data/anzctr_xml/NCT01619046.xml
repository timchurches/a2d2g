Active Comparator: PK substudy - A cohort of 13-18 subjects will be included in the pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation of GreenGene F and an approved recombinant Factor VIII product (Refacto AF); a minimum of 13 of these subjects will be re-evaluated at study end (50 exposure day).

Experimental: Prophylaxis safety and efficacy substudy - Hemostatic efficacy of GreenGene F will be assessed by its effectiveness in controlling spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes and by the rate of breakthrough bleeding during prophylaxis over = 50 exposure days.

Experimental: On-demand safety and efficacy substudy - Hemostatic efficacy of GreenGene F will be assessed by its effectiveness in controlling spontaneous or traumatic bleeding episodes and by the rate of breakthrough bleeding in a minimum of 10 on demand treated subjects during 50 exposure days.

Experimental: Surgical substudy - Peri-operative hemostatic control of GreenGene F in surgery or invasive procedures will be assessed in at least 10 surgeries, some of them major, in at least five subjects


Other interventions: GreenGene F and an approved recombinant Factor VIII product

Other interventions: GreenGene F
intra-venous infusion, 30 ± 5 IU/kg infusions 3 times per week with dose escalation to 45 ± 5 IU/kg if appropriate, for 50 exposure days

Other interventions: GreenGene F
intra-venous infusion,
On-demand safety and efficacy substudy:
minor bleed = 10-20 IU/kg moderate bleed = 15-30 IU/kg major bleed = 30-50 IU/kg

Other interventions: GreenGene F
intra venous infusion,
Surgical substudy:
Minor surgery including tooth extraction = Post in fusion FVIII level of 60-100% of normal. A single bolus infusion (30-50 IU/kg) beginning within one hour of the operation. Optional additional dosing every 12 to 24 hours as needed to control bleeding.
Major surgery = Pre- and post infusion FVIII level 80-120% of normal. Preoperative bolus infusion: 40-60 IU/kg. Verified 100% activity prior to surgery. Maintenance bolus infusion (40-60 IU/kg) repeat infusions every 8 to 24 hours, depending on the desired level.
