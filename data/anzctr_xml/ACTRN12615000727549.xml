    <statisticalmethods>For the 1st primary objective, the number of patients who demonstrate an adverse response judged to be related to 64Cu-SARTATE administration, and its 95% CI will be reported. 
For the 2nd and 3rd primary objectives, basic descriptive statistics (mean, median and range) will be provided for the % of injected dose and the absorbed dose for each organ of interest, as well as for the whole body dose.
As a Phase 0 trial, up to 10 patients is considered to be sufficient to determine proof of concept.

    <summary>
The primary purpose of this study is to examine the safety and potential effectiveness of a drug molecule called 64Cu-SARTATE as a potential new way to detect neuroendocrine cancers.
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over, have a life expectancy of 8 weeks or more and Low and Intermediate Grade (Ki-67 index &lt;20%) neuroendocrine tumors (NET). Study details: All participants in this study will be injected with a single dose of 64Cu-SARTATE (a drug molecule). The study lasts for one week and the patient is administered 1 dose of the drug followed by whole body PET scans at 30mins, 1hr, 4hrs, &amp; 24hrs. Complete safety evaluations will occur during visit 2 (day 2) &amp; visit 3 (day 8). 
These scans will be compared to the current PET imaging standard called 68Ga-DOTATATE which you will have recently received as a standard procedure.
It is hoped that this research will help to develop a product which is more accurate for the diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumours in patients.
