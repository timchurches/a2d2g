* Taking orlistat, cholesterol-lowering drug called bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine and cholestipol or other drugs known to reduce vitamin D absorption.
*Those with gastrointestinal abnormalities that may affect nutrient absorption such as, those who are unable to swallow oral medication, those who have clinically diagnosed malabsorption syndrome with evidence of malabsorption, or those who have had prior surgical procedure affecting absorption.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome for the trial is the change from AS to active therapy by 24 months. This is currently estimated to be ~35% at 2 years for intermediate-risk patients on AS. Using Simons two-stage design, a sample size of 80 patients in the group receiving the vitamin D supplement would have &gt; 80% power with 95% confidence to exclude a success rate of 65% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77.5% (i.e. active therapy rate of 22.5% rather than 35%). If 8 of the first 24 (33.3%) patients in the intervention group have progressed after 2 years of therapy, consideration will be given to modifying the intervention or stopping the study for futility. In order to obtain contemporary estimates for the control group it is proposed to randomise patients 2:1 resulting in a total sample size of 120 patients (80 vitamin D supplementation, 40 placebo controls). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of progression in men with prostate cancer who have an immediate risk of progression.

Who is it for?
Men are eligible to participate in this trial if they are aged 50 to 75 and have been diagnosed with localised prostate cancer with intermediate risk of progression, for which they have chosen to go on active surveillance.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either vitamin D tablets, or to receive inactive sham tablets. Tablets in both groups will be taken orally, once per month, for two years. Participants will be followed up at the end of this period to assess for incidence of disease progression and commencement of active therapy.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether vitamin D supplementation is effective for preventing disease progression in men with prostate cancer.
