  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention forms Phase 2 of a two-phase research project. In Phase 1, students, teachers and parents affiliated with participating secondary schools will be invited to complete online questionnaires regarding perceived rates of mental health problems in adolescence, options for treatment for mental health problems in adolescence, and (for students only) their experiences with mental health difficulties and whether they had sought treatment for those difficulties. Phase 1 will last approximately 2 weeks, with participants being able to complete questionnaires online on one occasion at any point during those 2 weeks.

After this initial phase, schools will be randomly allocated to an immediate Phase Two condition or a delayed Phase Two condition.

The Phase 2 process will include the following:
1. Students, teachers and parents will be provided with feedback from the first phase of the research. In particular, they will be given information on rates of mental health problems in adolescents and how these compare to estimated rates by students, parents and teachers. They will also be given information on evidence-based treatment options for mental health problems. This feedback will occur via school assemblies and newsletters. The information presented will not identify any individual participants from Phase 1, and will make use of pooled data only.

2. Student councellors and other key teachers at the participating schools will be invited to attend a meeting with the Investigator about current management strategies for mental health problems in the school. The Investigator will provide summaries of guidelines on screening for eating disorders, depression and anxiety in adolescents; how to manage the physical and mental health-related risks associated with these conditions; and how to approach students and/or their parents with concerns. The Investigator will also provide self-help treatment materials for use with students if they are interested in, and suitable for, management within the school system.

3. After this meeting, teachers will be invited to contact the Investigator if they have any queries or questions over the coming months. A follow-up meeting will be scheduled for 2-3 months after the initial meeting. 

Phase 2 will last for approximately 5 months in total. 

At the conclusion of Phase 2, students, parents and teachers will be re-invited to complete online questionnaires regarding perceived rates of mental health problems in adolescence, options for treatment for mental health problems in adolescence, and (for students only) their experiences with mental health difficulties and whether they had sought treatment for those difficulties. These questionnaires make use of questions / items used in previous research in this area, as well as two formal, stand alone questionnaire measures: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire. These latter two questionnaires assess mental health related difficulties and are for student completion only.

Participants in the immediate intervention group will complete online questionnaire measures on 2 occasions: at baseline (Phase 1) and approximately 5 months later at the end of Phase 2. At each time point, questionnaires may be completed by participants in their own time and on a computer of their choosing, and should take no more than 15 minutes (for parents and teachers) to 30 minutes (for students).</interventions>
    <comparator>The waitlist control condition involves a gap of approximately 5 months between Phase 1 (completing online questionnaires) and Phase 2 (as outlined above; a school-based intervention designed to increase rates of mental health literacy and treatment-seeking).

The Phase 2 process will be identical to that for the immediate intervention group, but participants at schools allocated to the waitlist control condition will be asked to complete online questionnaires after the 5 month waiting period (immediately before they start Phase 2) as well as at the end of the Phase 2 intervention. Thus, they will complete measures on 3 occasions: at baseline (Phase 1), 5 months later before starting Phase 2, and 5 months after that at the end of Phase 2. At each time point, questionnaires may be completed by participants in their own time and on a computer of their choosing, and should take no more than 15 minutes (for parents and teachers) to 30 minutes (for students).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for students will be rates of mental health treatment amongst adolescents with elevated eating disorder, depression and/or anxiety symptoms.

This will be assessed in the following way:
(i) For students with above-average scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, the number of "yes" responses to "In the last 3 months, have you experienced any mental health difficulties?" will be considered.

(ii) For students who respond "yes" to "In the last 3 months, have you experienced any mental health difficulties?", the number of students saying "yes" to "Did you seek or receive help from anyone else for these difficulties?" will be considered.

"Yes" responses to both questions would be expected to increase if the intervention is successful.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Phase 1) and at the end of Phase 2.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for parents and teachers will be self-reported ability to (i) access information about mental health problems in adolescents and (ii) access support for their child or a student if they were concerned about their mental health.

This will be assessed in the following way:
(i) Proportion of "yes" responses to the item "Would you know where to find information about mental health difficulties in adolescents, if you wanted to do so (e.g., pamphlets, books, information leaflets, options for treatment)?"

(ii) Proportion of "yes" responses to the item "If your adolescent / a student you taught was experiencing mental health difficulties, would you know how to help them access treatment or support for those difficulties?"

"Yes" responses to both questions would be expected to increase if the intervention is successful.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Phase 1) and at the end of Phase 2.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mental health literacy, as indicated by the number of "agree" responses to a set of questions regarding mental health problems, their treatment and their effects. Examples of items include "Mental illness can happen to anybody" and "I would be happy to have a person with a mental illness become a close friend".

This outcome applies to students, parents and teachers.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research has the overall aim of identifying strategies to facilitate the detection and early treatment of eating disorders and related mental health problems in adolescence. It is being implemented in two phases.

Phase 1 aims to identify barriers to the detection and treatment of eating disorders and related mental health difficulties in adolescence, with reference to data from adolescents, parents and teachers. This phase involves online questionnaire completion.

Phase 2 aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a school-based intervention designed to facilitate the early detection and treatment of eating disorders and related mental health difficulties. This second phase takes the form of a randomised controlled trial comparing a 5 month school-based intervention to a waitlist control group. The waitlits control group will receive the intervention after a 5 month waiting period.</summary>
