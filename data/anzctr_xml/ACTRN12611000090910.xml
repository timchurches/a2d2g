  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Five weekly consecutive parent mediated group sessions (with up to 8 parents, 1.5 hours in duration each, totaling 7.5 hours) for parents of children with serious childhood illnesses/injuries (with one booster session - 1.5 hours in duration one month following the fifth session). The program is based on social learning principles and will utilize an acceptance and commitment therapy approach. Arm 2: Wait list control - these parents will receive the Take a Breath Intervention (Arm 1) approximately 2 months following the completion of Arm 1. Approximately 240 participants were recruited at the hospital wards prior to the screening process which determines eligibility into the parent groups. 

Arm 2: Wait list control - these parents will receive/be offered the Take a Breath Intervention (Arm 1) following the completion of their Pre and Post questionnaires (where they serve as a comparison group to Arm 1), which is likely to be approximately 2 months after Arm 1. </interventions>

    <concealment>Intake worker will assess key inclusion and exclusion criteria and approach families on the ward to complete the Screening Process to determine current level of distress. Results from this screening questionnaire will determine eligibility into the RCT. Three months following Screening, consented parents, will be contacted via telephone and will be invited to take part in the parent intervention group. Ineligible parents will be sent an email outlining their eligibility status as well as providing potential supports should they require them. Written information statement and consent forms will be emailed/mailed to eligible and interested parents. Upon receipt of the forms a research assistant blind to recruitment and delivery will allocate participants to condition.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will evaluate the efficacy of the Take a Breath Parent Program, which targets parents from three months following a traumatic event (their child's diagnosis of a serious childhood illness/injury). The overall aim is to assess if the Take a Breath Parent program leads to improvements in psychosocial distress for parents exhibiting early signs of posttraumatic stress. Specifically the trial will assess if participation results in: improvements in parental psychological flexibility, committed actions, valued living and quality of life and reductions in parental posttraumatic stress symptoms, experience of the illness/injury as distressing, and referrals to additional supports (e.g., mental health/counselling). Secondly improvements in child quality of life and child behaviour, family functioning and postive outcomes of the illness/injury will be assessed.</summary>
