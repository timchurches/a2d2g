  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is the First Time In Human study for the motilin receptor agonist, GSK1322888.
      GSK1322888 is a potent and selective small molecule motilin receptor agonist, distinct from
      the motilide compound structures. The aims of this study are to assess the safety, tolerance,
      and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of GSK1322888 and to identify a well-tolerated and
      safe dose that will accelerate gastric emptying of a 13C stable isotope-labeled test meal in
      healthy volunteers.

      The study will include assessment of ECGs, vital signs, safety laboratory sampling, adverse
      events, pharmacokinetics, and the 13C-Octanoic Acid Breath Test to measure gastric emptying.</summary>
