  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exercise training consisting of either:
High intensity exercise (HIT) or continuous moderate-intensity (CME)

HIT - 6 bouts of high-intensity intermittent exercise @ 100% VO2max, on a stationary cycle ergometer with a work-to-rest ratio of 1:4 over a period of 30-minutes. Active recovery consists of cycling @ 50% VO2max and performance will be monitored on the software associated with the cycle ergometer. 

CME - Moderate-intensity exercise @ 60% VO2max over a period of 30-minutes on a stationary cycle ergometer.

3 sessions per week
12 weeks 
Group session 
The researcher will administer the intervention. Dr. Timothy Fairchild is an ESSA Accredited Exercise Physiologist and Aaron Raman is a PhD student in exercise science.

Exercise adherence will be noted with an exercise log. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will consist of a no-exercise group. 
Only lifestyle advice will be provided. Participants will also be offered a training program after first 12-weeks of control.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>40 participants will be recruited to complete a 12-week exercise training intervention which consists of either high-intensity intermittent exercise or continuous moderate-intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer.  This study aims to determine the effect of exercise training on the changes in insulin sensitivity and the immune system as a result of a training adaptation over the 12-week period. This will be a parallel randomised group design which will include male participants between the age of 18-44 years old who are overweight (BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) but otherwise healthy (no previous history of type 2 diabetes or other immune-related diseases).</summary>
