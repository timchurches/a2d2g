  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The role of tepid sponging to promote fever control in children is controversial. We did not find studies reporting the effectiveness of tepid sponging in addition to dipyrone. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of tepid sponging plus dipyrone with dipyrone alone in reducing fever. 
This randomized clinical trial will take place at Instituto Materno-Infantil Professor Fernando Figueira, Teaching Hospital, Recife, Pernambuco.  
Children from 6 months to 5 years old with axillary temperature &gt; 38 C in the emergency ward between January and July 2006 are eligible. One hundred-twenty children will be randomly assigned to receive oral dipyrone (20 mg/Kg) or oral dipyrone and tepid sponging during 15. The primary outcome is the mean temperature reduction after 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes. Secondary outcomes are  crying and irritability.</summary>
