  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomized to receive either blinded encapsulated oral methotrimeprazine (6.25mg ) or oral haloperidol (1.5mg ) both given once daily (od), for three intervention days. All other regular antiemetics will be discontinued. Metoclopramide 10mg every 6 hours subcutaneous or oral (max dose 30mg/24hrs taken at any time during the intervention as long as it is 4 hours apart) will be available as a rescue antiemetic as well as Domperidone 10-20mg up to four times per day, per oral as an alternative to metoclopramide (taken when needed during intervention period). In the absence of response at 24 hours or 48 hours, the dose of the study drug can be increased to twice daily (total daily dose 12.5mg methotrimeprazine or 3mg haloperidol). All study drug/bottles to be returned at completion of study or study withdrawal/exit.	</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out if a drug called Nozinan (methotrimeprazine) works better in treating nausea that is cancer related than the standard drug Haloperidol. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have cancer related nausea to a certain level of nausea that is not from cancer treatment. Study details Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive Nozinan tablets once daily (up to twice daily if necessary) for 3 days, whilst participants in the other group will receive Haloperidol tablets once daily (up to twice daily if necessary) for 3 days. Neither you nor the research team or Doctor will know which drug you will get. You will also have access to two other 'rescue' nausea medications as a back-up for your nausea. You will be required to fill out questionnaires related to your nausea/symptoms before the study drug starts, every 24 hrs after the drug is taken, when the study drug finishes, and for four weekly follow-ups. You can be an in-patient or an outpatient to complete this study.
