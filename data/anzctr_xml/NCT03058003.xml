    <interventions>Diagnosis / Prognosis - Posturography Evaluation
Other interventions - Central Sensitization Inventory

Patients - subjects suffering from chronic pain undergoing Posturography Evaluation and Central Sensitization Inventory

Healthy - subjects self assessed to be in good health undergoing Posturography Evaluation and Central Sensitization Inventory


Diagnosis / Prognosis: Posturography Evaluation
Posturography testing using the extended modified Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (ext_mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be required to stand on a hard or compliant surface in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing normally, with head straight, turned right or left, flexed or extended

Other interventions: Central Sensitization Inventory
Standard chronic pain questionnaire: the subjects will be required to score each of the 25 items on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stability Score - The Stability Score (calculated as percentage ratio of the actual sway and the theoretical limit of stability) will be used to investigate if there is any difference between healthy controls and subjects affected by chronic pain. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used for assess if there is a difference between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CSI - The sum of all the answers to the Central Sensitization Inventory will be used to investigate if there is any difference between healthy controls and subjects affected by chronic pain. Statistical tools such t-tests and correlation coefficients will be used for assess if there is a difference between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>immediately after data collection</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>CSI-SS - Correlation between the Stability Score and the CSI result for each individual to determine if balance is an indicator of Central Nervous System Sensitization</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate the use of balance as a screening tool for Central Sensitization, a condition
      of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic
      pain. This is done by comparing the scores of a gold standard screening tool (the Central
      Sensitization Inventory) with balance data.</summary>
