  <interventions>
    <interventions>Potential participants will be patients of the Investigator who have decided to trial neurostimulation during a consultation discussion regarding treatment options for their pain. Trialling Spinal cord stimulation involves implanting one or two spinal lead which normally takes less than an hour. Minimal sedation will be used during the procedure. The patient needs to be alert and communicative ensuring intraoperative testing to ensure proper positioning of the leads.
If they patient decided to trial the spinal cord stimulation, they will then be told about the study and given the Participant Information Sheet and Consent Form to take home and read. If they agree to participate in the study, they will be tested using experimental stimulators. This experimental neurostimulator will either be a multi-channel system (MCS) used in the operating theatre and clinic, or an external trial system (ETS) that they will wear at home. A second form of the ETS is the body worn system (BWS) that would only be used for testing in the clinic for ambulatory tests. Following the minimum 3 day trial with their commercial stimulation, patients will be programed with feedback control and they will go home with this program using ETS. Patients can have ETS for up to 25 days. The intensity of stimulation automatically adjusted to the comfort level of the patient using the feedback control loop. Patient can choose to have the stimulation ON all the time during the trial or for some certain time during day. In each follow-up visit (every 5-7 days), their wound will be checked and they will be asked to answer some basic questions about their pain level and their experience with stimulation. At the final visit, ETS will be disconnected from the lead and lead will be removed by a clinician.
Patients may have another visit for some neurophysiological measurements using the experimental stimulators. This is an optional visit which can be done at any time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is demonstrating the effectiveness of feedback control on neural stimulation in patients with chronic pain with regard to pain relief and stimulation side effects in an extended trial.
A new technique has been developed to measure Evoked Compound Action Potentials (ECAPs) or neural responses to neural stimulation, on the same lead that delivers the stimulation. Three devices have been developed to measure ECAPs and provide feedback control of stimulation current in patients undergoing a trial of SCS for the relief of chronic pain: Multi-Channel System (MCS), Body Worn System (BWS) and an External Trial System (ETS). All the participants may be tested with all these devices. MCS is not a portable system and is used in the operating room or at the clinic. BWS and ETS are similar and used for ambulatory testing, however due to short battery life of the BWS, this device will be used for ambulatory testing at the clinic and ETS is used as a take home device for an extended trial.

This research will help advance neurostimulation technology.</summary>
