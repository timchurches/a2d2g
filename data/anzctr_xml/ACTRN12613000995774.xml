    <interventions>Transcranial direct current stimulation
Dose: 2mA  
Duration: 30min

    <comparator>Sham transcranial direct current stimulation
Dose: 2mA
Duration: The device is turned off slowly, out of the subjects field of view, after 30 seconds of 2mA tDCS. The stimulating electrodes, however, remain on the stimulation site for a total of 30 minutes. 
Mode of administration: 5 consecutive daily sessions (1 session/ treatment day). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensitivity to electrical body pain stimuli: Electrical stimuli will be delivered to the subject's hand using a constant current stimulator. The subject will be asked to state when they can first detect the electrical stimulus. The current intensity (mA) will be recorded. The electrical stimuli will be delivered until the subject can first confidently perceive the stimulus as being painful. The current intensity (mA) will again be recorded. The trial will be repeated for a total of three times. The mean of 3 electrical detection and pain detection thresholds will be calculated. 


</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured before and after intervention session 1, after intervention session 5 and 4 weeks after intervention session 5.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensitivitiy to pressure body pain stimuli: Pressure stimuli will be delivered to the subject's hand using a pressure algometer. The pressure stimuli will be delivered until the subject can first confidently perceive the stimulus as being painful. The pressure (kPa) will be recorded. The trial will be repeated for a total of three times. The mean of 3 pain detection thresholds will be calculated. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured before and after intervention session 1, after intervention session 5 and 4 weeks after intervention session 5.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sensitivity to thermal body pain stimuli: For the cold pressor test, the subjects hand will be immersed in ice saturated water (0-1 degrees celcius) to the wrist level, for a maximum of 2 min. The subject will first be asked to state when they can first confidently perceive the stimulus as being painful. This time duration will be recorded. The subject will be instructed to withdraw the hand when they feel the pain as intolerable. This time duration will also be recorded.  A single pain detection threshold and pain tolerance threshold will be calculated. 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured before and after intervention session 1, after intervention session 5 and 4 weeks after intervention session 5.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Human salivary biomarker (e.g. BDNF) will be collected and measured using immuno-histo-chemical techniques. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a power analysis (calculated by G*Power software) providing 80% power with one sided alpha =.05 and an effect size (f) of =.2 for the repeated measures study, and allowing for 25% dropout rate, we aim to recruit a total of 46 volunteers (i.e. 23 volunteers / group) for the study.


Tests conducted will be examined using a statistical software package (SPSS v. 20). 

We aim to examine differences in detection and pain thresholds before and after the application of brain stimulation protocols and between treatment groups using paired t-tests and ANCOVA. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques has provided further insight into human nervous system function. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is one such technique, which involves delivering mild electrical current to the brain via surface electrodes. Further research, however, is required to evaluate the effects of consecutive daily application of tDCS on human sensory function. Consequently, the aim of this research project is to investigate whether five consecutive daily sessions (1 session / treatment day) of tDCS can improve sensory function in a healthy human population. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of human sensory function modulation.</summary>
