  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Firesetter Treatment Program utlises cognitive behaviour therapy to address risk factors for firesetting.  Participants will work through a number of exercises, with specially trained clinicians, which have been designed to change their thinking patterns, resolve interpersonal issues and increase skills in problem solving, communication, mood management, and self control. The program involves 14-16 sessions of two hours duration, and number of sessions is determined by the complexity of treatment needs identified in the assessment phase.  Sessions are usually conducted weekly, however the flexibility of the program allows clinicians to vary this regime as required.  It is expected that all participants will complete the program within a 20 week period.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>As this is a repeated measures design, a sample size of 50-100 participants has been deemed sufficient to investigate significant treatment effects from baseline to post-intervention using participants' own data for statistical comparisons.
Data analysis will utilise ANOVA to investigate the significant effects of time of assessment (pre and post assessments) on the treatment area of interest (eg fire interest, social competency, anger). Age, and social desirability will also be co-varied out of analysis to control for possible confounds. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies of the treatment of firesetters are limited, being largely focussed on juveniles or conducted in inpatient psychiatric settings. Consequently, there are currently no standardised treatments for adult firesetters in use in the UK, the United States or Australia. Research indicates that predisposing factors for deliberate firesetting include poor interpersonal functioning and poor communication skills, and difficulties regulating emotion (particularly anger) and behaviour. Less is known about specific fire-related beliefs that contribute to this type of offending, however it is likely that, as with other types of offending, firesetters have specific beliefs that allow them to justify, rationalise and minimise their firesetting that arise from underlying
schemas and attitudes supportive of such antisocial behaviour. Jacksons model  has previously informed treatment programs for incarcerated mentally disordered offenders, and intellectually disabled firesetters, although both programs are group-based and tailored to specific
settings that are not easily replicated in Australia. The proposed research aims to develop and evaluate a treatment program that can be delivered to an array of firesetters in a variety of settings, and which closely adheres to established  principles of effective offender treatment. Thus it will address the core components relevant to risk of offending generally as well as delivering fire-specific interventions targeted at the hypothesised pathways to arson offending. Both aspects are considered integral to a successful application of risk management and offending treatment for firesetters.
The aims of this project are:
1.	To investigate the psychological and psychiatric characteristics of individuals who engage in deliberate firesetting. 
2.	To develop and trial a psychological intervention to reduce the risk of repeat firesetting.
3.          To examine clinical, attitudinal, behaviour change monitoring as a result of involvment in treatment.
