    <interventions>Observation of cerebral oximetry parameters during pre-hospital care of patients suffering traumatic injury patient management and transport to hospital. The duration of observation will vary depending on the nature of the pre-hospital accident, treatment time and distance for transport to hospital. Historical experience indicates the average time elapsed from the time of arrival of the treating team until the patient is in hospital is approximately 40 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis is challenging as pre-existing data sets are not available. Using data under analysis for publication relating to traumatic brain injury, the incidence of mortality vs poor or good outcomes on Glasgow Outcome Score was utilised to calculate numbers of severe brain injury patients required for recruitment at 242, with total numbers required therefore 1210. 
For primary outcomes, area under the curve for cerebral oximetry value less than or equal to 45% will be used to allow grouping and ocmparison to EGOS outcome assessment at 6 and 12 months. Time series analysis will also be undertaken. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A lot of the things we do when looking after patients with significant injuries after accidents relies on using monitors to provide us with information. When it comes to the brain, we often measures things elsewhere in the body and assume that if those things are normal, we're doing the best we can for the brain, but we can't be sure. 

This study is designed to look at a kind of monitor that you can apply to the skin which gives you information directly about oxygen balance in the brain. The hypothesis is that there is an association between the values shown by the monitor in injured patients and how well they recover after their injury - meaning that if the numbers are abnormal, it correlates with worse recovery later.</summary>
