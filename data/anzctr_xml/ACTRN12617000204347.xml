    <interventions>A behavioural intervention targeting reducing sedentary behaviour and increasing physical activity will be rolled out across Victorian primary schools. This is a scale up of a previously registered successful trial: Transform-Us! an intervention promoting childrens health (ACTRN12609000715279).
The program encourages schools and teachers to integrate active strategies into the classroom, school grounds and via students in the home setting to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour. Strategies include:
CLASSROOM:
* Teachers delivering class room lessons. Lessons teach children strategies to reduce sitting time and increase physical activity at school and at home. Example lesson templates are provided to schools. There will be 9 x 30-40 minute class lessons delivered per year for children in grades 3-6. 
* Teachers are asked to deliver one 30-minute standing/moving lesson each day. These are included as part of normal planned lessons. The content of the lesson remains as planned, rather it is the delivery of the lesson (standing) that changes. Examples of ways to incorporate standing lessons are provided to schools.
* After every 30-minute teaching session sitting, teachers are asked to incorporate short (two-minute) light-intensity classroom-based breaks. For example standing, stretching or walking around the room. Examples of activities are provided to schools.
SCHOOL GROUNDS:
* Schools can install asphalt line markings in the playground to encourage children to be active. 
* Teachers are asked to display signage/posters promoting physical activity in areas where students play at recess and lunchtime. I.e. in the school grounds, classroom and staffroom. Examples of signage are provided to schools.
* Use of and providing access to equipment. This includes class sets of pedometers, timers, easels, soft indoor sports circus equipment, such as: balls, bats, ropes and ribbons to use during recess and lunchtime. Schools can use existing or purchase additional equipment.
* Teachers are asked to encourage and praise children for being active during recess and lunchtime through staff supervision and use of the sports and activity equipment, signage and asphalt line markings. Examples are provided if needed by schools.
AT HOME:
* Teachers are asked to modify childrens homework tasks to include a moving/standing component, and set physical activity as homework with parents/family. Existing homework tasks can be used, just modified. 
* Parents are provided with nine newsletters per year matched to the nine class lessons. Newsletters reinforce the class lessons, as well as engaging with childrens families. Newsletters are provided to schools, but they can embed the messages into their existing school newsletters.

This intervention will commence in grade 3 and continue until children complete grade 6 i.e. The total duration of the intervention period is four years.

As this is a real-world trial, teachers and schools will choose which components of the program they wish to adopt. The aim of this trial is to determine the real world effectiveness and maintenance of the Transform-Us! roll out. This will be assessed from 20 Victorian primary schools who intend on adopting the Transform-Us! program.
</interventions>
    <comparator>All schools in Victoria will be eligible to adopt the program; therefore, a suitable control group cannot be established in Victoria. 
A current practice, control arm consisting of 20 NSW primary schools matched for similar size and area level disadvantage will act as the comparison group. These schools will not be implementing similar health or physical activity-related programs.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Physical activity will be objectively assessed using hip-mounted ActiGraph accelerometers. Children wear the accelerometers during waking hours for eight days at each measurement point. Movement count thresholds (based on age-specific energy expenditure prediction equations) will be used to calculate the average time spent being sedentary, number of breaks to sedentary time, and time spent in moderate- and vigorous- intensity activity. Accelerometry data from specific times of the day (eg, after-school hours, during class time) will be extracted to identify when changes in physical activity or sedentary behaviour occurred.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2), obtained via height and weight assessments without shoes, using a portable stadiometer and digital scales, performed by trained research staff privately at school. BMI will be calculated and converted as recommended for analysis of longitudinal adiposity data. Children will also be categorised as healthy weight or overweight/obese based on International Obesity Task Force definitions.

    <statisticalmethods>We aim to recruit a total of 1,094 children, in year 3 (n=547 in Victoria, n=547 in NSW) across 40 primary schools (n=20 intervention schools in Victoria, n=20 matched-control schools in NSW). 
Based on estimates from the original cluster-RCT, to account for the design effect, an ICC of 0.03 for children within clusters was used, with a conservative correlation of 0.015 assumed between two different pupils within a cluster at different time points and a correlation of 0.22 between the same pupils at different time points. Assuming alpha=0.05, 80% power will be available to detect a 16-minute difference in sedentary time (two-thirds that observed in the efficacy trial as differences may be smaller at scale) between intervention and control, 1094 children are required (547 from intervention and control schools, assuming 28 students/school sampled). This number is sufficient to detect as small an effect as a 6-minute difference in physical activity between the control and intervention schools.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A behavioural intervention targeting reducing sedentary behaviour and increasing physical activity will be rolled out across Victorian primary schools. This is a scale up of a previously registered successful trial: Transform-Us! an intervention promoting childrens health (ACTRN12609000715279).
To determine real world effectiveness and maintenance (at the individual level), a quasi-experimental pre post non-equivalent group design with follow up will be used. A sub-sample of 20 schools from different socioeconomic urban and rural areas of Victoria will be selected and 20 schools of similar size and area-level disadvantage in NSW not implementing similar health or physical activity-related programs will be recruited as matched controls.
Our findings will determine the effectiveness of implementing an efficacious program at scale so that it can be rolled out nationally and become part of routine best practice.
