  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients diagnosed with a primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate, breast, oesophagus or stomach (n=100 per diagnosis), and who attend clinic appointments at Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital, will be enrolled into the study after obtaining informed consent.
Blood will be collected through venepuncture (2 x 9mL K3-EDTA tubes and 1 x 8mL serum clot activator tube) by trained nurses prior to any type of cancer treatment (ie. prior to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery). Whole blood samples will be centrifuged, and plasma and serum will be isolated and stored in cryovial aliquots at -80 degrees until analysis for concentrations of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 and other novel biomarkers.
For patients that undergo cancer resection prior to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, consent will be asked to obtain some tissue samples from any excess specimen from surgery (a cancer specimen and adjacent normal tissue). The collection of this tissue will be stored in the joint Flinders Medical Centre and Repatriation General Hospital tissue bank. Tissue will have DNA extracted for analysis of biomarker levels to allow direct comparison to blood biomarker levels within the same patient.
Cancer pathology details (including stage of disease, pathological features, and Gleason Score for prostate cancer) will be recorded. Other blood indicators that have been taken as part of clinical care prior to surgery (such as PSA for prostate cancer) will be recorded. Patients will be interviewed by nurses to record current medications and other medical conditions, as well as any previous cancers.
Levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 in the blood and surgical tissue will be determined for each cancer type and stage.</interventions>
    <comparator>The levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 in the blood and surgical tissue for each cancer type and stage will be compared to established levels in the blood and tissue of colorectal cancer patients, as well as the established blood levels in people with no cancer. These historical levels were established in the study ACTRN12611000318987 from 2011-2015.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be the levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 in the blood of people diagnosed with prostate, breast oesophageal and stomach cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood will be collected at a single timepoint for each participant shortly after enrollment. All collected blood samples will have plasma extracted and frozen at -80 degrees. All frozen plasma samples will be stored until the completion of enrollment (approximately 24 months), and then will be analysed for the levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 and other novel biomarkers.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome is to compare the methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 levels between blood and surgical tissue samples in people with breast, prostate, oesophageal cancer or stomach cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood will be collected at a single timepoint for each participant shortly after enrollment. All collected blood samples will have plasma extracted and frozen at -80 degrees. If the participant undergoes surgery (prior to undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy), any spare cancer and normal tissue at surgery will be collected and will be frozen at -80 degrees. All frozen plasma samples will be analysed for the levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 and other novel biomarkers at approximately 24 months (at completion of enrollment). All frozen tissue samples will be analysed for the levels of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 and other novel biomarkers at approximately 30 months (at completion of surgery). Comparison of blood and tissue biomarker levels will then be performed at approximately 30 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome is to assess the blood and surgical tissue samples from prostate, breast, oesophageal and stomach cancer for new DNA and RNA biomarkers specific to these cancers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will occur following the surgery of all eligible patients (approximately 30 months).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether a blood test can be used to detect prostate, breast, oesophageal and stomach cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are male or female aged 25-85 years and have a known diagnosis of primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate, breast, oesophagus or stomach (of any pathological stage), for which you have not yet received any treatment. You must also be willing to undergo a venepuncture procedure. 

Study details
All participants in this study will have blood collected through venepuncture (i.e. directly from the vein) by trained nurses prior to any type of cancer treatment. Blood will be collected only at one time point for this study. For patients that undergo cancer resection prior to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, consent will be asked to obtain some tissue samples from any excess specimen from surgery. Blood and tissue samples will then be analysed for specific biomarkers of interest. Other information about the cancer (e.g. stage of disease), current medications, and other medical conditions will also be collected.

Our research may lead to the development of improved non-invasive diagnostic tests for the detection of adenocarcinomas, including prostate, breast, oesophageal and stomach cancer. This would have beneficial health outcomes as early detection can contribute to early intervention and better prognosis.</summary>
