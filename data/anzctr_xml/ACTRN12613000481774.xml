  <interventions>
    <interventions>Neonates in group 1 receive a new powdered hydrolyzed formula. Formula will be oral liquid administered, divided in 8 feed/day, by enteral route, for the first 4 weeks of life. Daily volume will be adjusted on body weight (150 ml/Kg/day).

Macronutrients formula composition is reported below per 100 ml of product:
whey protein 3.1 (g), lactose 4.6 (g), maltodextrins 4.2 (g), medium chain triglicerides 0.6 (g), linoleic acid 710 (mg), linolenic acid 80 (mg), arachidonic acid 18 (mg), docosahexaenoic acid 18 (mg).
 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Neonates in group 2 receive a standard formula. Formula will be oral liquid administered, divided in 8 feed/day, by enteral route, for the first 4 weeks of life. Daily volume will be adjusted on body weight (150 ml/Kg/day).


Composition of this formula is reported below per 100 ml of product:
whey protein 3.1 (g), lactose 5 (g), maltodextrins 2.8 (g), medium chain triglicerides 0.6 (g), linoleic acid 603 (mg), linolenic acid 85 (mg), arachidonic acid 17.5 (mg), docosahexaenoic acid 17.5 (mg).

    <concealment>All neonates observed in NICU with a body birth weight  &lt; 1500 g will be considered eligible for the study. Enrolled subject will be randomly allocated to group 1 (hydrolyzed powdered formula) or group 2 (standard formula for preterm). The two powdered formula will be provided in identical boxes without indication of group identity or content. Each box will be labeled with a unique serial number according to the randomization list, which was not available to the investigators until the data had been obtained,entered in the database and analyzed by a blinded statistician. After randomization, nurses, blinded to the study aims, gave the assigned preparation as liquid formula after specific dilution

    <statisticalmethods>The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to determine if variables are normally distributed. For continuous variables, groups will be compared using the test of equality of means, the Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test. The chi-square test and Fishers exact test will be used for categorical variables. For two related dichotomous variables, the McNemar test will be used to detect differences between study groups. We will perform a multivariate analysis (binary logistic regression) to evaluate whether PDA closure would be influenced by GA, modality of delivery, multiple birth, BW, sex, Apgar score at 5 minutes, or by study group assignment. The level of significance for all statistical tests is 2-sided, p&lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed, per intention-to-treat, by a statistician blinded to patient group assignment with SPSS Version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
To demonstrate a reduction in the time to reach full enteral feeding of 5 d (15 +/- 5 d vs. 10 +/- d) in subjects receiving hydrolyzed formula with 97% power and type 1 error = 0.05 (2-tailed test), a minimum sample size of 30 patients for each group was required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of total parenteral nutrition is necessary to ensure the survival of very low birth weight (VLBW) infant in the first weeks of life, given (due) to the intestinal immaturity and to the lack of formulas able to adequately meet nutritional needs using the enteral route. The formulas for preterm infants, although characterized by a high intake of calories and protein, help meet the nutritional needs when administered at high volumes. However, delayed gastric emptying, typical of the first weeks of life of the preterm infant, limits the use of enteral nutrition as the sole source of energy and protein. On the other hand, prolonged use of parenteral nutrition is associated with an increased risk of infectious complications, metabolic and liver. Several studies show that the hydrolyzed formulas promote gastric emptying and provide better tolerance of enteral nutrition in adults and children. In the preterm infant, however, the use of this type of formulas is limited by poor nutritional value of the products currently available on the market.
Therefore, the use of a hydrolyzate formula high in energy and protein, may improve tolerance while respecting nutritional needs.</summary>
