  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine (20 mg artemether and 120 mg lumefantrine in a tablet) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The doses of artemether+lumefantrine are based on weight bands: one tablet to those weighing 5 to14kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for greater than or equal to 35 kg. The treatment will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. Eligible subjects will be treated twice daily for three days and followed up for 28 days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of treatment failures (early treatment failure + late clinical failure +late parasitological failure). This is a composite primary outcome.
Enrolled patients will be assessed for parasitological (using microscopy) and clinical responses during the 28 days follow-up and treatment outcomes will be classified according to the latest WHO protocol.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 following initiation of artemether+lumefantrine treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of adverse event will be documented. 
The known adverse events of artemether+lumefantrine are abdominal pain, asthenia, cough, diarrhoea, dizziness, fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, loss of appetite, rush, nausea, vomiting.
Parents or guardians of all enrolled patients will be asked routinely about previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form.

    <statisticalmethods>The treatment failure rate to artemether+lumefantrine in the study areas is estimated to 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients will be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients per site will be included in the study. A total of 352 patients will be enrolled.
The WHO excel software programs will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and 
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum will be evaluated.
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections in four sentinel sites.
Study Sites: study will be conducted in 4 sites: in Bangui: (i) Complex Pediatric of Bangui ; (ii) Centre de sante of Lakouanga and (iii) Centre de sante of Bede Combattant; and in Boali: (iv) Centre de sante de Boali. 
Study Period: The study will be conducted from November 2016 to December 2017.
Study Design: A one arm prospective study.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 12 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled.
Sample Size: 88 patients per site giving a total of 352 patients. 
Treatments and follow-up: artemether+lumefantrine (twice daily for 3 days) will be given. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.
Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
