  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The initial pilot study for this trial was registered with ANZCTR (ACTRN12610000532000) and completed in July 2010. The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether oral garlic tablets reduce vaginal colonisation of Candida (the yeast that causes thrush) when taken in the second half of the menstrual cycle, in women of childbearing age. Women will be asked to take three garlic tablets (or placebo) for two weeks, as well as send daily vaginal swabs to the laboratory for analysis, and complete a daily diary. This will give information not yet known about colonisation patterns of Candida in the second half of the menstrual cycle, as well as whether or not oral garlic tablets may be helpful in reducing recurrences of episodes of vaginal thrush.</summary>
