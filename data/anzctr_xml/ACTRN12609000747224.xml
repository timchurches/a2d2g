    <interventions>For the MA22460 extension study:
Tocilizumab (TCZ) 8 mg/kg Intravenous (IV), 60-minute infusion period, every 4 weeks until Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) reimbursement in Australia. 
The last visit at week 24 of the MA21573 core study is considered the Screening and Day 1 visit of the extension study if study drug is administered at this visit. In case the study drug administration cannot occur at the Week 24 visit, it can be delayed by a maximum of 2 weeks.
