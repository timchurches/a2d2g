  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group to wear sternal brace garment (Qualibreath) post median sternotomy, during inpatient hospital stay. A median sternotomy is wear the breastbone is divided with a sternal saw to access the chest cavity and is then reapposed with a series of sternal wires. Chest supports can be grouped in two major types of products: 1. passive, non-elastic (rigid) bands, 2. semi-rigid or elastic bands (abdominal bands). Type 1 helps patients when they cough, sneeze etc, but cannot give any continuous breathing support. Type 2 may give continuous breathing support but cannot help patients when they need extra help for extra pain. The Qualibreath device combines all advantages in one product: it gives continuous breathing support and it enables patients to get extra tightening support when needed. The sternal brace will be worn continuously and removed temporarily for showering. It will be worn for the duration of the patient's inhospital stay which is approximately 7 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment will be routine sternal precautions post-operatively which includes holding a pillow against the chest when coughing. This will last for the duration of the patient's in-hospital stay which will be approximately 7 days.</comparator>
