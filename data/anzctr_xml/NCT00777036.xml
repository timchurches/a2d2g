    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether dasatinib is safe and effective in children
      and adolescents with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or in children with Ph+
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), accelerated or blast phases CML who relapse after
      imatinib or who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib. The side effects of this oral
      investigational drug in children and adolescents will be evaluated</summary>
