  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response by RECIST Criteria v 1.1 - Response rates will be calculated as the number of evaluable patients who are responders. Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions, Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD, Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started and Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 cycles (168 days)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival According to RECIST Version 1.1 - Progression-free interval (PFI) will be calculated as the date of enrollment until the end PFI date, where that date is calculated as the date of disease progression, date of death, date of removal of all tumors by surgery or last patient contact, whichever occurs first.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of enrollment to the date of disease progression, date of death, date of removal of all tumor by surgery or last patient contact, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity as Assessed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Parameters of Sorafenib Tosylate - The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, including means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit).</outcome>
