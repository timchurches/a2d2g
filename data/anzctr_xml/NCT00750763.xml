    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess which bowel preparation provides the best colon cleansing using a validated score and is best tolerated by patients.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>

      <outcome>To assess the incidence of mucosal inflammation/ulceration induced by each colon cleansing agent.</outcome>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  All patients who are referred to undergo ambulatory colonoscopy at Kaleeya Hospital
             would be entered into the study</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>75</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or suspected inflammatory bowel disease,
             or patients on current non steroidal antiinflammatory medication (excluding low dose
             aspirin). These patients may have mucosal inflammation/ulceration which would prevent
             analysis of mucosal abnormalities due to the colon cleansing agent and so would not be
             studied.

          -  Patients with heart failure (NYHA &gt;2) or renal failure (GFR&lt;30) (since fluid shifts
             associated with sodium phosphate bowel preparation have been reported).

          -  All patients over the age of 75 due to potential dehydration and hyperphosphatemia
             from the bowel preparations.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation for assessing the lining of the colon. Colon
      cleansing preparations are required to be taken prior to colonoscopy to provide effective
      visualisation and identification of any abnormalities and different types of colon cleansing
      preparations exist.

      Some colon cleansing preparations have been shown to cause visible changes in the lining of
      the bowel which may cause confusion and incorrect diagnoses to be made.

      This audit aims to assess the ability of different colon cleansing preparations to clear the
      colon of faeces. The tolerability of each will also be assessed, as will any changes in the
      lining of the bowel to assess if one type of colon preparation is more likely to cause
      visible changes than another.</summary>
