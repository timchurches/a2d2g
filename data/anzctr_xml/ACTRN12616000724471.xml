  <interventions>
    <interventions>Upon inclusion in the study, all participants will receive an oromotor examination assessment to evaluate the function of the muscles and structures used for swallowing, as per routine speech pathology practice.  

Cough reflex testing Group:
Following the initial oromotor assessment, all participants randomly allocated to receive the cough reflex testing will undergo cough reflex testing according to the procedure that was developed by Miles et al (2013). Details of this procedure are as follows:

1.	Administration procedure
Participants will be seated upright in a bed or chair. A total volume of 3ml of citric acid (which is diluted by the pharmacy department in 0.9% sodium chloride, to obtain a concentration of 0.6M) 
will be administered for a maximum of 15 seconds via a facemask  using a nebuliser or medical air (not oxygen) with a predetermined free-flow 
\output of 7L . A sterile facemask and tubing will be provided for each participants. 
The assessing speech pathologist will say to the participant, Im going to give you some air to breath, keep breathing normally. The test is repeated three times with a 30-60 second rest interval between each presentation.

Cough evaluation
The speech pathologist will record the strength of each cough response using the following criteria:

Strong 	Two or more strong coughs
Weak	Two or more weak coughs
Absent	One or no cough

Criteria for positive or negative response to cough reflex testing include:

Positive result	                   Two strong cough responses out of three trials
Positive but weak result	Two weak cough responses out of three trials
Negative result	                  Two absent responses out of the three trials


Clinical pathways following cough reflex testing
There are three pathways that will be followed, depending on the outcome of the cough reflex testing. (1) If the patient produces a positive result, the clinician will then proceed with an oral trial of food or fluid as part of the initial assessment. (2) If the patient produces positive but weak results, the clinician will proceed with oral trial of food or fluid in the intial assessment but will also refer the patient for a video-fluroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) as soon as possible (this may vary depending on when the clinic has an available appointment), as bedside indicators of aspiration may be inaccurate (i.e., patient may be silently aspirating). (3) If the patient produces a negative result, the clinician will not proceed with oral trials and will refer the patient for a VFSS prior to any oral trials, as bedside indicators of aspiration are likely to be inaccurate, with the patient having a high risk of silent aspiration. 

Documentation
The cough reflex test will be documented on the patients medication chart, as follows: Citric Acid 3 ml 0.6M solution via nebulizer per speech pathology cough reflex procedure signature date printed name. The cough reflex test results will also be included speech pathology assessment notes in the electronic medical record (eMR).

2.	Video-fluroscopic swallowing study
As per the aforementioned clinical pathways, patients who either fail the cough reflex testing or have a weak result will be referred for an objective instrumental assessment of swallowing via VFSS. The VFSS is a dynamic x-ray that permits the visualisation of bolus flow in relation to structural movement throughout the upper aero-digestive tract in real time. The VFSS also permits detection of the presence and timing of aspiration, i.e., entry of material below the level of the true vocal folds into the trachea, and assists in identifying the physiological and often treatable cause(s) of the aspiration. Furthermore, an VFSS allows clinicians to observe the effects of various bolus volumes, bolus textures, and compensatory strategies on swallowing physiology.

If patients are not able to access a VFSS due to unforseen mechanical breakdown, the cough reflex testing procedure will be repeated on the next day and data will be analysed separately.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard practice Group
Following the initial oromotor assessment, all participants in the standard practice group (2) will undergo a clinical bedside swallowing assessment performed by the ASU speech pathologist This assessment will involve assessment, of the oral and pharyngeal phases (including assssment of cranial nerve function and palpation of hyo-laryngeal excursion) of the swallow, and a trial of appropriate diet and fluids consistencies in order to determine recommendations. If the patient is observed to not tolerate an oral diet, or if they show any indicators of aspiration pneumonia, they may then be referred for a video-fluroscopic swallowing study. Requesting a referral to VFSS will be left to the clinical judgement of the assessing speech pathologist.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS computer software program (version 21, IBM, USA). The independent variable will be whether or not cough reflex testing was performed), with the dependant variables being the service and patient outcomes which are largely quantitative in nature (e.g., length of stay in days, total cost of stay). For these quantitative variables, normality of data will be assessed and parametric tests employed where normality is upheld. Nonparametric statistical analyses (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test) will be performed where normality is not upheld. Chi square tests will be used to assess the associations between categorical data (i.e., presence/absence of pneumonia) between the two groups. For patient level of comfort and clinician questionnaire data, results will be reported descriptively, with themes in clinician questionnaires free form response sections being evaluated qualitatively. The sample size was determined by a convenience sample, it was also modelled on similar research in the area of CRT that achieved statistically significant numbers with a comparable (slight smaller) sample size.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the present project is to determine whether introducing cough reflex testing, when embedded into an established clinical pathway, will reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia and subsequent length of stay for acute stroke patients in comparison to patients who did not receive the testing. The secondary aims are to evaluate to the clinical feasibility of implementing cough reflex testing as part of standard initial swallowing assessment for all new stroke patients, the patients tolerance and clinician satisfaction.

It is hypothesised that individuals who receive the testing will demonstrate reduced rates of aspiration pneumonia and decreased average lengths of stay in comparison to patients who did not receive the testing. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that those at a high risk of silent aspiration, will be identified from the cough reflex testing prior to receiving any oral diet or fluids, thus preventing aspiration from occurring. It is also hypothesised that implementation of the cough reflex testing will result in minimal cost to the organisation, high patient tolerance and high clinician satisfaction. Therefore it is anticipated that cough reflex testing will be a clinically feasible and viable tool when implemented as standard practice for all swallowing assessment in stroke patients.
