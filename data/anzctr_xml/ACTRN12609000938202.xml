  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the experimental group will complete a 10-week progressive resistance training program. They will be taught 7 exercises: three exercises for the upper limbs, three exercises for the lower limbs and one exercise for the trunk. All exercises will be completed on weight machines in a local gymnasium. The training program is based on the recommendations of the American College of Sports medicine and will comprise 3 sets of 12 repetitions of each exercise at a training intensity of 12RM. The weight lifted in each exercise will be increased when 3 sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise can be completed. Two-minute rest periods will be given between each exercise set. The program will be conducted twice weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Participants will complete the program with a physiotherapy student mentor.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will complete a 10-weeks art and social program. The program will comprise art and recreational activities that would not be expected to have a fitness or training effect, such as painting, printing, music or social activities that do not incorporate a physical activity component. The program will be conducted once a week for 10 consecutive weeks. Each session will run for 90 minutes, approximately equal to the time spent in the 2 gymnasium sessions each week in the intervention group. Participants will complete the program with a physiotherapy student mentor.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial will compare the outcomes of a 10 week, twice a week community based exercise programme for young people with Down syndrome aged 14-22 years. It will establish if a student mentored intervention can improve the work performance, muscle strength and level of physical activity undertaken by young people with Down syndrome.</summary>
