  <interventions>
    <interventions>The independent variable is the intake of free sugar, which is definned by the WHO as all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.

Each participant completed two 24-hr recall, with at least eight days apart, using the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM) developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). If permission was granted by a parent or guardian, children aged 15 years or above were interviewed in person. For those without parental consent or under the age of 15, an adult living in the same household with the children responded on their behalf.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intake of the following micronutrients: dietary fiber, vitamin A (as retinol equivalents), thiamin, riboflavin, dietary folate equivalent, vitamin C, vitamin E, calcium, iodine, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, long chain omega-3 fatty acid, saturated fat, and sodium. These intake data were translated from the dietary intake data collected from two 24-hr recalls using the AUSNUT2011-13 food composition database.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intake data of the following food groups: non-alcoholic beverages, cereal grains and products, cereal-based products, fats and oils, fish, seafood and products, fruit and fruit-based products, eggs and egg-based products, meat, poultry and game and their products, dairy products, dairy alternatives, soups, seeds, nuts, and their products, sauces, vegetables, legumes and legume-based products, formulated foods, herbs and spices, infant foods, non-alcoholic beverages, savory snacks, sugars, confectionery, and alcoholic beverages. These intake data were translated from the dietary intake data collected from two 24-hr recalls according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating 2013.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There has been an increasing concern on the possible negative effects of excessive sugar intake, particularly added sugar, on the quality of diet and health status. Added sugar was found to be associated with poorer nutrient intake. A similar impact on micronutrient dilution was expected from free sugar as an estimation of approximately 10 g difference between added sugar and free sugar intake was found in the Australian population. The hypotheses of the current analysis include: a) the WHO cut-offs were not suitable for assessing micronutrient dilution; and b) micronutrient dilution is not evident until
%energy from free sugars reaches 25% or above.</summary>
