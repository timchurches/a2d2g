Experimental: LY3039478 + Dexamethasone (Adult) - Part A: LY3039478 administered orally three times per week (TIW) at escalating doses and dexamethasone administered orally on days 1-5 every other week during 28 day cycles. Participants receiving benefit may continue until disease progression.

Experimental: LY3039478 + Dexamethasone (Pediatric) - Part B: LY3039478 administered orally TIW at escalating doses and dexamethasone administered orally twice a day (BID) on days 1-5 every other week during 28 day cycles. Participants receiving benefit may continue until disease progression.

Experimental: Phase 2: LY3039478 + Dexamethasone - LY3039478 administered orally TIW and dexamethasone administered orally BID on days 1-5 every other week during 28 day cycles. Participants receiving benefit may continue until disease progression.

Placebo Comparator: Phase 2: Placebo + Dexamethasone - Placebo administered orally TIW and dexamethasone administered orally BID on days 1-5 every other week during 28 day cycles. Participants receiving benefit may continue until disease progression.
