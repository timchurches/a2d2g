  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will help us answer the question: Should children with acute or chronic cough be given inhaled corticosteroids to promote faster recovery and improve ability for children to return to their normal daily routines? This study will also look at what viruses may be contributing to cough in children and how cough impacts on the quality of life of children and their families.</summary>
