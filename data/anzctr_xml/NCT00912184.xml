             renal failure

          -  The patient is on noradrenaline infusion for haemodynamic support

          -  The patient was commenced on noradrenaline or haemofiltration within the last 12 hours

             conferred by treatment with different membranes

             least 72 hours

          -  Informed consent has been obtained

          -  The patient fulfils ONE of the following clinical criteria for initiating
             haemofiltration:

          -  Oliguria (urine output &lt; 100 ml/6 hr) that has been unresponsive to fluid
             resuscitation measures.

          -  Hyperkalemia ([K+] &gt; 6.5 mmol/L)

          -  There is a strong likelihood that the study treatment would not be continued in
             accordance with the study protocol

          -  The patient has been treated with haemofiltration or other dialysis previously during
             the same hospital admission

          -  The patient was on maintenance dialysis prior to the current hospitalisation

          -  Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, will substantially

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial aims to study the effect of combining continuous and a new polyamide membrane with
      larger pores in the treatment of critically ill patients with acute renal failure and low
      blood pressure (shock) requiring noradrenaline. The investigators wish to compare the
      clinical effect of this new therapy to that of haemofiltration with a standard membrane.</summary>
