  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if fibre/ probiotic supplementation can reduce inflammation in women with PCOS. The two chosen markers of inflammation are serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Lipopolysaccaride Binding Protein (a marker of immuno-stimulatory endotoxin exposure), assayed by an ELISA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Inflammatory markers will be assessed at study entry and then again 4 weeks later</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Reproductive hormones Anti Mullarian Hormone (AMH), Testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).
AMH will be assessed "in house" using an ELISA and testosterone/ SHBG measured by a commercial pathology laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study entry and then again 4 weeks later (completion of 4 week course fibre/ probiotic)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Blood biochemistry including glucose, insulin, calculated insulin resistance, cholesterol, low and high density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL), homocysteine. These will all be assessed by a commercial pathology laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study entry and then again 4 weeks later (completion of 4 week course fibre/ probiotic)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Assessment of ovulatory function based on menstrual calender, serum estradiol and progesterone measurements. These will be assessed using a ADVIAR Centaur XP assay platform system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Entry and day 21 of the study. If ovulation has not been confirmed (serum progesterone &gt; 15 nmol/l) on day 21 sample, a further estrogen and progesterone assessement will be taken on days 28, 35 and 42. If progesterone exceeds 15 nmol/l on either day 28 or 35, nil further blood tests will be taken.  The timing of onset of the menstrual period will be followed out to 6 weeks (42 days) after commencement of fibre/ probiotic treatment.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants with PCOS and IBS will be invited by newspaper and online advertisements to be screened for their involvement in the trial. Provided they meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria they will all then be allocated to 4 weeks (28 days) of fibre and probiotic supplementation. No placebo will be used and therefore allocation concealment is not required.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common cause for women experiencing menstrual irregularity and anovulation (not releasing an egg each month), affecting up to 10% of the population. While the cause for PCOS is not fully understood, certain probable links have been identified. Almost half the individuals with PCOS have an excess of adipose (fat) tissue stored around their waist, impaired sugar metabolism (insulin resistance) and high levels of fats / cholesterol in their blood stream (dyslipidemia). The excess fat tissue is believed to activate the bodies immune system, causing inflammation which then stops ovulation and increases the ovaries production of testosterone. It is this raised testosterone that may cause acne and excess body hair- a common feature of PCOS. 
Being over weight and a diet high in saturated fat have both been independently linked with inflammation. Furthermore, women with PCOS are known to have signs of increased inflammation in their body compared to healthy women without PCOS. Work by our group has shown that individuals with PCOS have less than ideal diets, with high intakes of saturated fat, and a higher body mass index (BMI) than aged matched fertile counterparts. Other groups have also shown that PCOS patients have a high saturated fat intake. We have previously proposed that a high fat / low fibre diet will create disturbances in bowel bacteria, with an overgrowth of bad bacteria which can then pass across the gut wall into the blood stream and activate the womans immune system. The resulting inflammation is known to produce insulin resistance with resulting high blood levels of insulin interfering with normal egg development and ovulation, while driving up the ovaries production of testosterone, potentially causing acne and excess body hair.
Probiotics are good or beneficial bacteria that are present in food sources such as yogurt, fermented milk drinks or can be taken as powder and capsule supplements. Probiotics are useful treatments for gastro-intestinal conditions such as constipation, antibiotic associated diarrhoea and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All of these clinical conditions are linked with an increase in bad bacteria in the gut and have been shown to cause inflammation in the gut and in the rest of the body. Probiotic good bacteria have the ability reduce the number of bad bacteria in the gut, while also helping stop these bad bacteria passing through the gut wall into the blood stream where they can activate inflammation. Therefore, we propose that by giving probiotic good bacteria supplements to women with PCOS and symptoms of excess bad bacteria in their gut (bloating, pain, constipation or diarrhoea) we may be able to reduce inflammation in the body, thereby reducing insulin and testosterone levels and re-starting ovulation. This is the primary research question of this study.</summary>
