  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participantswill perform whole body vibration training (WBVT) four times a week for 20 weeks. Each training session consists of three 3 minute WBVT with 3 minute short breaks between each WBVT. WBVT requires the participant to stand on a vibration plaque that moves rapidly (10-20Hz) up and down over a small distance (up to 10mm) generating vibration stimulus. The vibration causes the muscles in the legs and body to contract. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common disability in childhood. CP is characterized by reduced muscle mass, impaired mobility and low bone density. Therefore, one of the major focuses of therapy in CP children is to increase muscle mass and power, thereby increasing mobility, weight bearing and bone health. Unfortunetely, there is a void in therapeutic interventions aimed at increasing muscle mass, muscle function as well as bone mass in CP children. Whole body vibration training (WBVT) has the potential to fill this therapeutic void. WBVT studies in healthy adults and postmenopausal females have been shown to enhance muscle function and bone health. However, it is unclear whether children with CP would benefit from WBVT. By maintaining muscle mass and bone mineral accrual during growth; WBVT can maximize mobility and bone strenght into adult life improving both mobility and quality of life. The proposed study aims to determine the effect of 20 weeks of WBVT on muscle and bone in children with CP. This should lead to improved health and well-being of children with CP. Further, it would open the way to improve the quality of life of a large number of disabled children with other disorders associated with reduced muscle mass.</summary>
