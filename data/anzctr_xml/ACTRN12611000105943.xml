  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over 3 days, Year 10 students will receive leadership training by an experienced physical educator that will enable them to successfully implement the GLAMA &amp; BLAST programs.

The leadership training will be administered during classtime initially over 2 days, with a following day "refresher" course. The format will include an informal lecture environment with discussion and activities to reinforce concepts. Feedback will be provided. Leaders will have their own manuals to work through.

The leadership training focuses on the following topics; communication, leadership skills, problem solving, decision making, bullying, assisting year 7 transition and the actual GLAMA and BLAST activities.

The leadership training will be followed by supported implementation of the GLAMA and BLAST program whilst Year 7 students are on camp. It is during this 2 hour session that leaders will visit camp and introduce themselves, the program and commence the first session of leading their own groups. The ratio is one leader to 4-5 students- all of the same gender. Leaders will have the opportunity to debrief and discuss following this implementation.

Following this initial 2 hour implementation, leaders will lead groups for 6x 48 minute sessions throughout Term 1. Debrief and feedback will be provided after each session to assist with the independent implementation.

Year 7 participants will be involved in a total of 7 sessions, including the initial introductory session with their leader whilst they are on camp. Then 6 sessions of the program with their leader over term 1. All sessions will be supported by an experienced physical educator and normal classroom teachers.

The sessions run by leaders include activities that are a combination of physical, cognitive and team building activities based on amazing race and adventure racing concepts.</interventions>
