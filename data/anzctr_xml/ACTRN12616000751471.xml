    <interventions>This pilot compares CogEx (a new intervention integrating Cognitive Stimulation Therapy and the UpRight Exercise Programme into one programme) with CST in older people with mild to moderate dementia living in the community and in residential aged care facility.  Two groups of CogEx (one in the community and one in a residential aged care facility) will be compared with two groups of CST (one in the community and one in a residential aged care facility). The usual size of a CST group is 8-10 people and this will be used for all groups. The group sessions will be held for 1.5hours twice a week for 7 weeks in a residential aged care facility and in a community aged care group. Both groups will be facilitated by a health professional (occupational therapist or nurse or physiotherapist) who has completed the CST Master training day. At the Master training day each facilitator will be given an CST manual that outlines the content of activities within each of the group sessions. 
The structure of a CST session is:
Introduction (Welcome, group name, theme song, orientation discussion current affairs); Main Activity (Level A  seeking opinion, social interaction; Level B  less complex relaxed exercise. The manual dictates the topic e.g. childhood; food; sound); Finally (thanks for attending and contribution; theme song; Reminders re next session and content; farewells). The resources used within the group sessions vary depending on topic such as music, food or art supplies. The newspaper of the day is used for the orientation discussion.
The CogEx structure is the same as CST but also included are a combination of exercises aimed at challenging the different physiological systems involved in the maintenance of balance (muscle strength, visual integration, vestibular adaptation, balance strategy retraining, and sensory integration). All exercises can be started at a simple, low level and progressed (The exercises can be performed at a low, moderate or hard level through decreasing the amount of support used (2 hands to 1 had to no hands) or increasing the challenge). 
Examples of the exercises are:
Normal stance to unsupported to decrease base of support
Normal stance weight shift to moving hips in a figure 8 to marching on the spot
Step forwards/backwards/sideways/diagonally to walk on spot on heels/toes to  walking forward/backwards on heels/toes
All the exercises have been piloted and found to be safe and acceptable in a residential care setting. The exercises are progressed according to the abilities of the group. The intensity of the exercise is mild to moderate depending on the abilities of the group. The exercises and progressions are also manualised.
The instructor will complete an attendance log to monitor adherence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to pilot test CogEx (a new programme integrating Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (Cog) and the UpRight exercise programme (Ex) into one programme) in 2 groups (one in a residential aged care facility and one in a community aged care group) comparing them to 2 groups undertaking usual CST in similar settings (the usual size of one group is 8-10 people).  
Objectives: To establish the feasibility of all aspects of a RCT: recruitment rate; delivery of the programme; acceptability of the programme to participants, their families and facilitators; estimate the distribution of the outcomes for analysis, planning and sample size computation.
Design: Pilot study comparing CogEx with usual CST. Pre and post intervention outcome measures of cognition and physical function will be used as well as video recorded observations and group discussions to ascertain the acceptability of the programme to the participants and facilitators.
Settings: Residential aged care facilities and community-based aged care groups. 
Participants: Adults aged 65 years or older with a diagnosis of mild to moderate dementia.
