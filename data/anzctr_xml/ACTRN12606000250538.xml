    <interventions>This randomised, case-controlled project aims to aid in developing a performance test battery that can be utilised by sleep physicians in order to assess an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subjects performance and sleepiness level after they have been treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).                                                                                                        Subjects will be given an 'Autoset' CPAP machine and sleep-wake activity will be assessed for 7 days using actigraphy. Subjects will then report to the laboratory where they will undergo two overnight polysomnographies (PSG) whilst using CPAP. During the waking hours subjects will complete a variety of neurocognitive tasks and questionnaires. After a washout period of 28 days subjects will repeat the protocol, except following the first PSG they will complete a 41 hours and 55 min sleep deprivation period. A recovery night will follow the sleep deprivation period. </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary variables include the total number of lapses (defined as reaction time (RT)&gt;500ms) during a 10 min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PVT will be measured whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory at 2 hourly intervals from 0730 to 2330 hrs whilst electroencephalogram (EEG) will be recorded concurrently.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary variables include the mean slowest 10% metric of the PVT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PVT will be measured whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory at 2 hourly intervals from 0730 to 2330 hrs whilst electroencephalogram (EEG) will be recorded concurrently.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary variables include EEG power spectral analysis, subjective alertness and functioning capabilities; other measures of neurocognitive assessments, including working memory function, cognitive throughput, driving simulator performance (AusEd Driving Simulator); measures of sleep, including symptoms of sleep disordered breathing, sleep architecture, sleep latency and duration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These outcome variables will be recorded whilst subjects are reporting to the laboratory between 0730 and 2330 hrs, except symptoms of sleep disordered breathing which will form part of overnight PSGs.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to developing a performance test battery that can be utilised by sleep physicians in order to assess an obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) subject's performance and sleepiness level after they have been treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). To facilitate this OSA subjects' performances will be assessed by a number of psychomotor tasks, cognitive tasks and objective measures of sleepiness. OSA subjects and also controls will be tested during their normal state and also during a sleep deprived state so that comparisons can be made between the two groups and across the two different conditions.</summary>
