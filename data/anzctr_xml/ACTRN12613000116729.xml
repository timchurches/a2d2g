  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled, cross-over designed trial will be performed. Each participant will complete 2 intervention periods of 1 week each in random order. These will be separated by a 2 week washout period. The two 1 week intervention periods will correspond to:
1.	Active  high nitrate intake: consumption of 1X70 ml/d (35 ml with breakfast and 35 ml with dinner) of a concentrated beetroot juice beverage containing approximately 200 mg of nitrate per dose (400 mg total for the day)
2.	Placebo  control: consumption of 1X70 ml/d (35 ml with breakfast and 35 ml with dinner) of a concentrated beetroot juice containing &lt;5 mg of nitrate (&lt;10 mg total for the day)
Participants and researchers will be blinded to treatment. The 400 mg dose of nitrate represents an upper level of nitrate intake achievable via dietary means.
At the end of each 1 week intervention period, participants will collect a 24 h urine sample, then attend School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital in the morning (after a 12 h fast) for approximately 3 h. During this time:
*	A fasting blood sample will be collected for measurement of nitrate and nitrite concentrations, and biochemical markers related to vascular function. 
*	Participants will then be provided with a standard low nitrate breakfast to be consumed over 20 minutes. 
*	Participants will consume one 70 ml dose of the assigned beverage with breakfast. 
*	An ambulatory blood pressure monitor will be fitted 30 minutes after breakfast. The monitor will record blood pressure every 20 min during the day and every 30 min overnight for the following 24 h.
*	A saliva sample will be collected 2 h after breakfast for measurement of nitrate and nitrite concentrations.
*	Participants will then go about normal daily activities, avoiding vigorous physical activity. 
*	A second dose of the assigned beverage will be taken with dinner, and a third dose will be taken with breakfast the next morning. 
*	For each participant, the timing of the visits will be on the same day of the week at the same time of day as far as possible.
*	Participants will return to the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit the next morning, after breakfast, to have the blood pressure monitor removed.
In addition, daily throughout each 1 week intervention period participants will perform home blood pressure monitoring. These measurements will be performed between 2 and 3 hours after the dinner meal, shortly before going to sleep. Five home blood pressure measurements will be performed at this time each day. This will provide information regarding the time-course of any effects on blood pressure. Throughout the study period the background diet will be the participants usual diet.

    <concealment>There are two treatments in the cross-over design study. The treatment order for eligible individuals will be randomly assigned using computer generated random numbers. The treatment order allocation will be sealed in numbered envelopes. The envelopes will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered into the study. The envelopes will be held by an independent person within the University of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the independent person to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is now consistent and convincing evidence that dietary inorganic nitrate plays an important role in the physiological control of blood pressure. Clinical trials have established that an increase in nitrate intake, either from supplements or vegetables, results in a dose-related decrease in blood pressure in healthy normotensive individuals. This trial will address the question: "Can ingestion of a diet high in nitrate lower blood pressure in treated hypertensive individuals?"</summary>
