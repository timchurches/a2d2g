    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After obtaining consents, participants stratified according to chest wall or breast treatment area, and allocated cream. Neither participants or staff involved in recruitment were aware of which cream would be allocated. Recruiter to contact holder of allocation schedule from the Research Unit, separate to the study site.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization process will be managed by researchers from the Tropical Health Research Unit. Random allocation of participants will be achieved using a web-based computer generated program (www.randomization.com). There are two groups (Sorbolene and Cavilon); and two strata of participants (breast and chest wall) related to the skin areas irradiated.
Although blinding of nurses and participants to the cream being used by individuals is not possible because of their different textures and other properties, all participants and staff involved in recruiting participants, treating participants or collecting data will be excluded from the randomization process</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare two proven skin care products (creams) in the context of patients undergoing radiation therapy for breast cancer in the tropics. 

Who is it for?
you may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or older and are undergoing radiation treatment at the Radiation Oncology Unit, The Townsville Hospital, for cancer of the breast.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will apply CavilonTM Durable Barrier Cream twice per day to the radiation therapy treatment area from the first day of treatment up until 4 weeks following the end of the radiation therapy. Participants in the other group will use 100% Pure Sorbolene cream instead.

Participants will be assessed weekly during treatment and at one month post treatment in order to identify if one cream is more effective than the other at preventing skin reactions associated with radiation therapy for breast cancer.</summary>
