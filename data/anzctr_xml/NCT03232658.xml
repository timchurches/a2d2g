  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common nocturnal breathing disorder characterized by
      complete (apnea) and partial (hypopnea) breathing cessations during sleep. Currently,
      clinical diagnosis of OSA is based on the clinical symptoms, especially excessive daytime
      sleepiness, and apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) providing a limited overview of the breathing
      cessation event frequency during the night. Longer obstruction events and deeper
      desaturations have been suggested to be more harmful than shorter and shallower events and
      these individual characteristics are completely neglected by conventional and currently used
      AHI.

      The investigators have previously introduced novel diagnostic parameters incorporating the
      number, duration and morphology of individual obstruction events and shown that they improve
      the severity estimation of OSA compared to traditional measures. Even though, the novel
      diagnostic parameters have so far tackled some of shortcomings of AHI, they need to be
      refined to further increase the accuracy of the OSA severity estimation.

      It has been shown that age, body mass index (BMI) and sleeping position are strongly related
      to the severity OSA. However, it is not thoroughly studied whether the severity of individual
      obstruction events progress over time (the aging process) and which factors affect to this
      progression. In addition, AHI has poor correlation with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)
      albeit both of them are used to estimate the severity of OSA.

      It is known that OSA patients with similar AHI values, durations of individual breathing
      cessation events can differ significantly. Longer and deeper events are connected to
      increased mortality rate in patients with moderate or severe OSA and thus, could be
      considered to be more detrimental than shorter and shallower ones. However, it has not been
      thoroughly investigated whether in severe OSA patients with identical AHI values, sleep
      efficiency or hypertension is related to the severity of individual breathing cessation
      events.

      The investigators planned to explore, whether the individual breathing cessation event
      severity progress over time and how different confounding factors affect this progression.
      Furthermore, the correlation of EDS with the individual breathing cessation event severity,
      sleep structure, and frequency and occurrence of cortical arousals will be investigated.
      Also, the investigators will explore whether the percentage time of disturbed breathing from
      total sleep time is related to sleep efficiency or hypertension in severe OSA patients having
      similar AHI. Moreover, Positional therapy (PT) i.e., the avoidance of the supine posture
      during sleep is the treatment of choice for Positional Patients (PP) having most of their
      breathing abnormalities while sleeping supine. Since it is known that apneas/hypopneas are
      more severe while sleeping supine, this time the investigators will assess the therapeutic
      value of PT for severe Non Positional patients (NPP).</summary>
