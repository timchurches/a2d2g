Misoprostol has been compared to dinoprostone in a phase III trial called the EXPIDITE study. 

Based on the number of primiparous births we have at John Hunter Hospital, to replicate Wing et al with a 26% reduction in the use of oxytocin with a power of 90% and a p value &lt;0.05 we would need 72 women per arm

In order to reduce the rate of CRB use at John Hunter Hospital from 28% to 14% with a power of 90% and p value &lt;0.05 we would need 173 women per arm.

To replicate the difference in tachysystole rates of 13% and 4% with a 90% power and a p value &lt;0.05 we will need 200 women per arm

5 of the 6 endpoints of this trial are dichotomous variables and so the chi-square test will be used to test for differences between groups
Time to vaginal delivery will be tested using Cox Proportional Hazards Regression

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Misoprostol and Dinoprostone are both medications used to ripen a woman's cervix in preparation for labour.
In a phase III trial by Wing et al misoprostol vaginal insert, when compared to dinoprostone vaginal insert, was thought to reduce the time from insert to vaginal delivery and decrease the number of women needing further intervention by oxytocin for induction of labour by 26% without an increase in the complications of caesarean section or neonatal morbidity. Misoprostol was found to increase the rate of tachysystole (too frequent uterine contractions) to 13% compared with 4% for dinoprostone. Wing et al used both primiparous women and multiparous women in their study. 
We hypothesize that by using misoprostol in primiparous women only we may still be able to achieve the significant reduction in need for other interventions for induction of labour but without the significant increase in rates of uterine tachysystole. 

Women admitted to the study will have either the misoprostol or dinoprostone inserted for cervical ripening and data collected on whether or not they then needed to have a cervical ripening balloon for further ripening, whether they needed oxytocin for induction of labour, whether they had too many contractions that required intervention to control, what their mode of delivery was, what the time interval between when the pessary was inserted and when they delivered and whether or not there were any neonatal complications.  </summary>
