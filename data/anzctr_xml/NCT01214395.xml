  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the use of tea tree oil as a topical nasal antiseptic to prevent
      infections in patients that need renal dialysis. A maximum of fifty subjects will be
      recruited and will be assessed for signs of infection once per week for the first 6 weeks and
      then every 4 weeks until week 26. They will also be checked for nasal carriage of 'Golden
      Staph' when they enroll in the trial. The subjects will complete the trial if they have 26
      weeks infection-free or if they have an infection during that period</summary>
