    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis including all participants with outcomes data available. 

For the primary outcome measure, we will compare baseline and post-supplementation assessment outcomes of the treatment and placebo groups using unadjusted linear regression. For the secondary analysis, the treatment groups will also be compared using adjusted linear regression. 

As a sensitivity analysis, regression models will also be fitted to the primary and secondary outcomes adjusted for pre-supplementation scores on the outcome measure of interest, age, gender and ABC score at baseline (as used in the randomization) and any other baseline and demographic variables where an imbalance is found.

 P values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 

Based on the previous study by Amminger et al. (Biol Psychiatry. 2007;4:551-3), a sample size of 25 participants has 82.5% power to detect a 25% reduction in the mean baseline hyperactivity scale of the ABC (two tailed). Therefore a sample size of 50 will be more than adequate to detect any statistically significant differences between groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the broad term for neurodevelopmental disorders resulting in impairments in social interaction and communication, and a restricted range of activities and interests. Many countries, including Australia, have reported a dramatic increase in the number of diagnoses over the past three decades, and recent estimates put the prevalence of ASD at 1 in every 110 individuals (~1%). The use of specific supplements, nutrients and dietary plans have become widespread,  including the use of supplements such as fish oil (currently up to 40%). However, use of these supplements is typically based on parental report and supported by little actual evidence, and therefore fish oil represents an additional invalidated cost to families already spending a considerable sum for their childs therapy. 

Aim: The aim of this study is to find out more about the effect of fish oil for children with ASD, by examining the effects on behaviour, cognition and language. 

Significance: While there have been a small number of studies investigating the effects of fish oil for children with ASD, these studies had a small number of participants, a large age range of participants, a lower dosage and a less varied range of assessments. 

Approach: We will recruit children with ASD between the ages of 2 to 6 years to receive either 2ml of fish oil liquid daily consisting of a total of 1.08 grams of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids per day or 2ml of control liquid per day, containing 1 gram of sunflower oil per day. All group supplements will be provided daily for six months, and will consist of a 2ml flavoured liquid, identical in taste and colour. Before and after supplementation children with be assessed using a number of tests assessing behaviour, neurocognition and language, to see if supplementation improved any of these skills.
