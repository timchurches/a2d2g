  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 types of retainer for the upper teeth after orthodontic treatment (Begg or Trutain) and some patients will be issued both. Patients issued with both retainers will be asked  to decide for themselves which one to wear.
The patients will also be given one of two types of retainer for the lower teeth after orthodontic treatment (Barrer or Bonded lower 3 to 3).
Patients issued removable retainers (both types of upper retainer are removable, as is the lower Barrer retainer) will be asked to wear them full time for 3 months then night time wear only for 3 months.
Patients issued the bonded lower retainer will be asked to retain it until at least the end of active growth i.e. into the second decade. So all patients issues the lower retainer will be wearing it for the entire duration of the study.  
Half of the group will have their wisdom teeth removed immediately following the end of orthodontic treatment and half will have their wisdom teeth removed 3 years after completion of orthodontic treatment. 
(so when one takes into account the 3 different possibilities for the upper retainer issue, the two different options for lower retainer issue and the 2 different options relating to wisdom teeth,there are 12 possible combinations of treatment)</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will all be issued with retainers but with different types of retainer.
Half the patients will have wisdom teeth extracted immediately after orthodontic treatment and half 3 years after completion of orthodontic treatment</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% with acceptable PAR score. An acceptable PAR score being one which demonstrates that there has not been relapse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>T0 is before treatment
T1 is after randomisation and therefore at point of allocation to trial (immediately post treatment)
T2 is one year after allocation to trial, one year post treatment.
T3 is three years after allocation to trial, 3 years after end of treatment.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient preference for retainer, as assessed by a questionnaire.

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.	subject to be under the age of 17 years old at the end of treatment
2.	subject diagnosed as not having enough space for lower third molar teeth (assessment of this will be made using a late treatment OPG and the Space Width Ratio will be less than 0.8). If the OPG indicates that the teeth are horizontally impacted and therefore at a risk of being closely involved with the inferior dental canal and its contents then the patient would be advised not to participate in the study and to seek early removal of the 8s.  

3.	subject has a continuous (no unclosed extraction spaces) natural dentition including second molars in occlusion with no retained primary (baby) teeth or complex restorations (crowns, bridges or implant supported crowns or bridges);
4.	subject has undergone full fixed orthodontics with or without other phases or adjunctive treatments such as rapid maxillary expansion or extractions; (however no orthognathic surgery cases will be included to avoid the compounding factor of surgical relapse);
5.	subject has pre-treatment study models and OPG available (these are standard pre-treatment orthodontic records);
6.	subject has end-of-treatment study models, and late treatment OPG (these are standard end-of-treatment orthodontic records); 
7.	subject agrees, with consent of parent/guardian, to have impressions for study models not only at end-of-treatment, but also at 1 year post-treatment and 3 years post-treatment;
8.	subject agrees, with consent of parent/guardian,  to undergo oral examination and to complete a patient satisfaction survey at 3 months, 1 year and at 3 years; 
9.	subject and parent/guardian consents to a randomly assigned retention protocol</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Once patients are nearing completion of their orthodontic treatment they will be asked if they wish to participate in the study. They will be given an information sheet and a consent form. Once they have agreed to take part and consent has been signed then the clinician will draw a blank envelope from the pile given to him by the investigator. The clinician has 24 envelopes each with a different retention regime written inside, which is not visible from the exterior.
Once the patient has been assigned the retention regime they will also be assigned an identification number so that the observer does not know what retention regime the patient was assigned and thus is less likely to be biased when interpreting results.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Undesirable tooth movement following orthodontic treatment is common. Retention refers to the period of treatment after your braces have been removed and is required to help prevent teeth from moving back to their original positions.
One method of retention is to use removable or fixed retainers (retainers are orthodontic devices that help to keep your teeth in the correct position and they can either be removable or be glued discreetly onto the teeth). The eruption of second and third molars is sometimes held responsible for unwanted tooth movement and many third molars (wisdom teeth) are removed as part of the orthodontic treatment plan (before treatment, as part of or after orthodontic treatment). The delay in removal of the third molars is not uncommon where the third molars are delayed in development. The aim of this study is to compare some regularly used retention regimes  and the following will be tested; Whether there is a difference in outcomes between two commonly used maxillary, top teeth retainers, Whether there is a difference in outcomes of two commonly used mandibular, bottom teeth retainers;whether there is a difference between subjects who retain their third molars and those who have their third molars removed at the completion of treatment</summary>
