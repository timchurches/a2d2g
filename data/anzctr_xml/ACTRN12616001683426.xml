  <interventions>
    <interventions>The height of peripheral venous collapse will be compared with the invasively monitored central venous pressure in a cohort of spontaneously breathing intensive care patients.
This study will be performed on patients in intensive care with a central venous catheter already in place as part of their treatment. After the participant has provided consent, the head of the bed will be positioned at a slight angle (45 degrees), and the participant assisted to slowly raise their arm above the level of their chest. The height of peripheral venous collapse will be observed by observing the veins on the back of the hand  as the arm rises, and the height at which the veins collapse will be recorded. At the same time, the pressure reading via the central venous catheter that is constantly displayed on the monitor will be noted by a separate observer. A single assessment will be performed; the total time required should be no more than 5-10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group.  Recording of both peripheral venous collapse and central venous pressure will occur in all patients. The invasively monitored central venous pressure will serve as the comparator to peripheral venous collapse (outcome under investigation).</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The relationship between height of peripheral venous collapse and central venous pressure will be graphically checked for linearity and transformed if necessary. Although Pearson correlations, and linear regression models, will be obtained for purposes of comparison with other studies, peripheral venous collapse and central venous pressure agreement will be more directly assessed using methods such as Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlations. 95% confidence intervals will be reported throughout.

Statistical analyses will be undertaken by, or under the direction of, Epworth HealthCare biostatistician(s), using standard statistical software such as Stata (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, 2015).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a correlation between the height at which the veins on the back of the hand collapse, and the pressure measured by a central venous catheter in the heart (central venous pressure).The central venous pressure is used to guide how much fluid should be given to a patient, but is currently only available using invasive procedures performed in special departments within hospitals, such as intensive care. It would therefore be very helpful to be able to obtain this pressure using a non-invasive technique that could be used anywhere.

This study will be performed on patients in intensive care with a central venous catheter already in place as part of their treatment. After the participant has provided consent, the head of the bed will be positioned at a slight angle (45 degrees), and the participant assisted to slowly raise their arm above the level of their chest. The veins on the back of the hand will be observed as the arm rises, and the height at which the veins collapse will be recorded. At the same time, the pressure reading via the central venous catheter that is constantly displayed on the monitor will be noted. The total time required should not be more than 15 minutes.

A biostatistician will then analyse the readings to determine if there is correlation between the two measurements in each participant.

There are no additional risks to participants in this study. All the risks associated with this study are related to use of the central venous catheter, which will already be present as part of their standard care.
