  <interventions>
    <interventions>Infants under 30 weeks gestation who require respiratory support at birth will receive positive pressure delivered by gases (oxygen and air) that are heated and humidified using a heated humidifier unit. Infants requiring ongoing respiratory support will continue to receive heated and humidified gases during transport to the neonatal intensive and special care unit (NISC). 
The intervention will be given for the duration of the stabilisation in the delivery room and transport from the delivery room to the NISC. This will differ on a case by case basis and be directed by the attending clinican. </interventions>
    <comparator>Infants under 30 weeks gestation who require respiratory support at birth will receive positive pressure delivered by unconditioned gases (oxygen and air) which is the current standard care. Infants requiring ongoing respiratory support will continue to receive unconditioned gases (oxygen and air) during transport to the neonatal intensive and special care unit (NISC). 
The standard care treatment will be given for the duration of the stabilisation in the delivery room and transport from the delivery room to the NISC. This will differ on a case by case basis and be directed by the attending clinican.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infants born very prematurely (under 30 weeks gestation) often require support with their breathing after birth as their lungs are stiff and they find it hard to fill them with air. In order to help infants breathe we use a flow of gas (oxygen and air) to provide pressure to help open their lungs. In this study we are comparing whether it is better to use a gas flow that has been warmed and moistened (humidified), compared to the standard method of using gas directly from the cylinder or wall (unconditioned).  Humidifying gases is routine within the setting of the neonatal intensive care but is not extended to use in the delivery room setting. 
The purpose of this study is to find out whether the use of humidified gases in the delivery room is better in helping premature infants stay warm immediately after birth. The primary outcome will be measurement of rectal temperature on admission to the neonatal and intensive care unit (NISC).
