  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants view an educational brochure on the AC Rule for melanoma detection. They then view a series of pigmented skin lesions, and try to identify those that are suspicious of melanoma. Participants can refer to the brochure throughout the trial. There are two image sets of 100 lesions, viewed between 1 day and two weeks apart. Each image set takes approximately 1 hour to complete. Responses are recorded on paper, on a seperate results sheet for each lesion.</interventions>
    <comparator>The same experiment is also undertaken by medical students and expert dermatologists as two comparative groups. All groups will receive the educational brochure. There is no control group in this experiment. Overall assessments for suspicion of melanoma will be compared with histopathology results for each lesion, which is the gold standard for melanoma diagnosis. This is how values for sensitivity and specificity for melanoma diagnosis will be calculated for each study group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early detection of melanoma is the key to long term survival from the disease. This study aims to develop a simple educational tool for melanoma detection, aimed at people without a medical background. Current teaching looks at 5 criteria that should be present in a melanoma (Asymmetry, colour variation, border irregularity, diameter &gt;6mm and evolution in appearance). However, we believe that asymmetry and colour are the two most important features for melanoma identification.</summary>
