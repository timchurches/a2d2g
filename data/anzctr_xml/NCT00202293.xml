    <summary>Aim: In a population of first episode manic patients with psychotic features, we want to
      compare the side effect profile, the degree of adherence and the subjective well being, as
      well as the efficacy of two treatments: The standard treatment currently applied (lithium +
      chlorpromazine) and an alternative treatment more recently introduced (lithium + olanzapine).
      In addition, we want to study retrospectively the development of bipolar disorder and study
      prospectively the 6 and 12-month outcome of a cohort of patients presenting a first manic
      episode with psychotic features.

      Research Background: While the efficacy of lithium in the treatment of acute mania has been
      established by numerous studies, it is also known that up to 50% of the patients fail to
      respond when it is prescribed alone. It is therefore common practice to complement the
      treatment, most commonly with antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. It has been suggested that
      antipsychotic agents are faster acting and are superior in controlling hyperactivity compared
      to lithium, whereas mood stabilisation is better achieved by lithium, Typical antipsychotics,
      such as chlorpromazine, may therefore be useful as adjunctive medication to mood stabilisers,
      especially within the first few weeks of treatment of acute mania, and for patients
      exhibiting psychotic symptoms or hyperactivity. They however can induce side effects
      (somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, extrapyramidal side effects such as rigidity of the
      muscles, and possibly tardive dyskinesia (involuntary movements or contraction of muscles),
      as well as akathysia (sense of restlessness). They finally have been suspected to contribute
      to the occurrence of post-manic depression. Recent publications in chronic populations have
      shown that atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, are also an effective adjunctive
      treatment. Olanzapine has the important advantage to induce a very low incidence of
      extrapyramidal side effects, including tardive dyskinesia. It can however induce somnolence,
      dizziness, dry mouth, and rather commonly weight gain. Moreover, some authors have reported
      that olanzapine might induce mania. Both treatments appear then to have positive effects as
      well as undesirable side effects. Our project is to compare them. The literature concerning
      first episode mania is sparse, particularly in the domain of pharmacotherapy. One
      retrospective study showed that 77% of the patients received antipsychotics at discharge and
      25% at 6 months follow-up. No comparison has however been made between typical and atypical
      antipsychotics, and there are no specific treatment guidelines of first episode mania with
      psychotic features.

      Project Summary: The hypothesis is that olanzapine and chlorpromazine will have a comparable
      efficacy as adjunctive treatment of the acute manic episode with psychotic features. We
      however think olanzapine will induce less side effects and will be better accepted by the
      patients, and therefore that the adherence to the treatment will be better than with
      chlorpromazine. We finally think the subjective sense of well being will be greater with
      olanzapine than with chlorpromazine.We will recruit 75 patients at the time of their first
      admission for mania with psychotic features at EPPIC. After signature of the informed
      consent, we will perform a baseline assessment first to confirm the diagnosis, and second to
      evaluate the level of psychopathology. The patients will then be randomly selected to receive
      either a treatment of lithium and olanzapine or a treatment of lithium and chlorpromazine. By
      the end of the study there will be 37 patients in each group.The patients will go through a
      baseline assessment including physical examination and usual laboratory investigation to
      exclude any physical illness. They will also go through a one-hour assessment of
      psychopathology. Between day 2 and 3 they will go through 2 hours of interview to reassess
      diagnosis and personal history. They will thereafter be assessed weekly for eight weeks on
      various dimensions: evolution of the intensity of the symptoms, appearance of depressive
      symptoms, occurrence of side effects and degree of adherence to the treatment, in an 1-hour
      interview. Subjective well being and quality of life will re evaluated at week 4 and 8,
      adding 45 minutes to the duration of the interview. This is a flexible dose, open trial,
      which means the doctor in charge of the patient will know which medication is being
      prescribed, and that he will be allowed to adapt the dosage according to what he feels
      necessary. This research project will allow us to organise a more specialised clinic for the
      care of first episode manic patients. We will take this opportunity to study carefully the
      months preceding the appearance of the first episode in order to try to reconstruct the
      prodrome of bipolar disorders. We will also, in an extension phase of the study, look at the
      long term outcome (at 6 and 12 months) of a first episode of mania.</summary>
