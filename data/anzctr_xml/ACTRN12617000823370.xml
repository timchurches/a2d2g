    <interventions>Intervention: CPAP with a Weight Maintenance Program 

CPAP: 
Participants assigned to the intervention group will undergo an in-lab CPAP pressure determination (PD) study overnight to determine the therapeutic pressure that prevents OSA. Prior to the CPAP PD study the participants will receive CPAP education and undergo a mask fitting with a CPAP therapist. After the PD study, participants will be issued with a CPAP and mask to use all night during sleep at home for the remaining 10 months of the trial. The CPAP machine will be set machine at the therapeutic level of pressure determined from the PD study. Participants will have 2 pre-arranged consultations (face-to-face or by telephone) for approximately 20 minutes at 2 weeks and 1 month to assist with the initial use of CPAP. Participants can also request additional consultations (as required) with the CPAP therapist to assist with ongoing use of the CPAP device. 

Weight Maintenance Program: 
Participants in the intervention group will also receive support with a Weight Maintenance Program administered by the study dietitian. The patients will receive a lifestyle consultation by phone call from the dietitian at 3, 4, 5 and 7 month time points. Participants will also attend the Woolcock Institute to participate in individual face-to-face lifestyle consultations conducted by the dietitian running for 1-1.5 hours at 1 and 9 months. Participants will also participate in a final 1 hour individual consultation at 12 months to review their progress with the dietitian. Participants will be asked to document diet, exercise, and sleep habits daily at periods during the trial. They will also be asked to complete a 4-day food diary at 0, 4, 9 and 12 months. 24-hr food recall will also be undertaken at 0 weeks, then at 2, 3, 5 and 7 months to confirm dietary compliance.

Dietary program:
Total daily energy intakes will be prescribed according to participants energy requirements, as estimated using the Harris-Benedict equation with an appropriate activity factor (it is suggested all activity be underestimated to ensure a conservative approach) and 2000kJ/500calorie /day energy deficit to encourage weight loss. Four levels of daily energy will be used in this study (5,7,9 or 11 MJ/day) and participants will be prescribed an energy level which is closest to their energy intakes as calculated above. 

Desired macronutrient distribution will comprise 45% daily energy intake from carbohydrate, 25% from protein, 30% from fat and &lt;1% from alcohol. The diet will aim to be as low in GI as practical and achieved by replacing higher GI carbohydrates with lower GI carbohydrates.

Exercise program:
Participants will be provided a safe, tailored exercise prescription with consideration of existing comorbidities or musculoskeletal limitations. The frequency, intensity and volume of exercise will be tailored according to the following progressive targets based on the Australian Physical Activity Guidelines for the general population and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for clinically significant weight loss:
1.	Commencing with: at least 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity activity, i.e. 30 minutes on most days (Australian Physical Activity Guidelines for the general population)
2.	Increasing to: at least 250 minutes per week of moderate intensity cardio exercise, i.e. 45-60 minutes most days (ACSM guidelines for clinically significant weight loss)
3.	Plus: at least 1 session per week of ~20-45 minutes strength training
4.	Increasing to: 2 times per week. 
(48-72 hours recovery between strength training sessions)
5.	Plus: flexibility

Lifestyle counselling:
Individual dietary counselling is necessary to identify current dietary patterns, recommend specific changes, and identify barriers and target behavioural change strategies to the individual successfully. Sessions will consist of a combination of diet and exercise reinforcement and will provide the opportunity to progress exercise prescriptions as well as monitor dietary compliance. Health coaching techniques will support behaviour change and techniques are based on the Health Coaching Australia techniques in which the study clinicians are trained. 

Written materials:
Participants will be provided with written educational materials that outline their dietary and exercise prescription including the food amounts that constitute one serving and the carbohydrate options and safe/sustainable dietary and exercise recommendations to support weight loss and maintenance.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size:
120 patients in each group (240 total) will give us 90% power to detect at least a small-moderate (f=0.20) clinical improvement in insulin sensitivity (measured 2 times using MINMOD). This is conservatively estimated from the just below medium sized but nonsignificant effect reported by Chirinos et al (N Engl J Med 2014;370:2265-75) with CPAP + Weight Loss over Weight Loss alone. Assuming a 0.8 correlation between measures as this conservatively covers the highest correlations observed in a previous study conducted by the investigators (Hoyos et al, Thorax 2012; 67:1081-9) . Allowing for 20% dropout, n=300 patients will need to be randomised.

Data Analysis:
Outcome data will be analysed using Linear Mixed Model Analysis of variance due to expected interpatient variability and repeated measures. Patients will be random factors. Treatment and time (0, 2 &amp; 12 months) will be fixed factors. The Treatment x Time interaction will be examined to see the specific difference between treatments at just the 12 month time point. Analysis will be by intention to treat and will include all participants who are randomised at 2 months including drop ins to CPAP and participants who do not adhere to treatment who will be analysed in the groups they were randomised to.

Exploratory analyses accounting for CPAP compliance, dietary compliance, activity levels and apnoea severity will also be conducted using mixed models.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many weight loss interventions work in the short term, often inducing dramatic improvements in cardio-metabolic health. However these health improvements are short-lived and people eventually suffer rebound where weight is regained and cardio-metabolic health declines. This might be exacerbated by comorbid obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). We hypothesise that after successful weight loss in obese people with OSA and pre-diabetes, treatment of persistent OSA will better sustain insulin sensitivity (a strong prognostic marker of diabetes risk) and other health measures (abdominal fat, blood pressure, lipids) at one year compared to not treating OSA. This hypothesis will be tested in 2 groups of obese patients with pre-diabetes and co-morbid OSA using a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. After 2 months weight loss (at least 5%) patients with persistent OSA will be randomised to OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and Weight Maintenance Program (intervention group) or Weight Maintenance Program alone (control group). The primary outcome will be the difference in insulin sensitivity between CPAP and non-CPAP treated groups at 12 months. </summary>
