  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Pterygium Hyperemia Responders at Week 16 - Number of pterygium hyperemia responders at Week 16 as measured by the Pterygium Hyperemia Grading Scale. The Pterygium Hyperemia Grading Scale is a 6-point scale (0=absent, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=moderately severe, 5=severe). A responder is defined as a patient demonstrating at least a 2-grade decrease from baseline in pterygium hyperemia.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Severity Grade of Pterygium Hyperemia at Week 16 - Change from Baseline in Severity Grade of Pterygium Hyperemia at Week 16. The Pterygium Hyperemia Grading Scale is a 6-point scale (0=absent, 1=trace, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=moderately severe, 5=severe). A negative number change from baseline is an improvement and a positive number change from baseline is a worsening.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©) Questionnaire Score at Week 16 - Change from baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index© (OSDI©) Questionnaire score at Week 16. The OSDI© is a 12-question survey for patients to document their dry eye disease symptoms. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale (0=none of the time and 4 = all of the time). The scores are totaled over the 12 questions and normalized/converted to a score of 0-100 (0=no disability and 100=complete disability). A negative number change from baseline represents an improvement.</outcome>
