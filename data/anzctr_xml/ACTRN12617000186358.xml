  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A wide range of animal and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the herbal medicine Andrographis paniculata (AP) possesses immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-depressant properties. 
This pilot trial examining the effects of Andrographis paniculata (AP) will be carried out by researchers from the University of New England (primary investigator - Dr Linda Agnew). They have previously reported that AP induces an immune response via altered stress protein levels in ex vivo studies. A number of other human clinical trials have confirmed that supplementation with AP reduces the severity of symptoms in upper respiratory tract infections. More information is needed however, before a definitive statement can be made regardings its mode of action and efficacy as a herbal medicine. The aims of this small-scale intervention study are to examine the effects of supplementation with AP on parameters of the immune, inflammatory, stress and antioxidant responses. These aims will be achieved by measuring immune, inflammatory and antioxidant markers in blood and saliva samples as well as psychological variables collected from healthy male volunteers taking AP for two weeks at a total daily dose equivalent to 6.0 g dried leaf equivalent. All measures will be taken at commencement of the trial, prior to intervention, and after 14 days of supplementation.  </summary>
