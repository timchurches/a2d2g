  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible people (n = 240) within the SCOOP program (a colonoscopy surveillance program for individuals at higher risk for bowel cancer) at Repatriation General Hospital or Flinders Medical Centre who do not screen for bowel cancer via the standard means (ie. faecal testing), will be sent a letter to invite them to screen for bowel cancer with a blood test (Colovantage Plasma), as well as a short survey to ascertain their demographic details and their screening history. Anyone interested in taking up the blood screening test will be asked to fill in the consent form and request form and send them back (in the provided reply paid envelope) to the Bowel Health Service. Following receipt of the blood test request form, the study enrolee will then be sent further information on the blood test (including information on the accuracy of the test, where they can get their blood collected, and when they will receive their test results) and a test referral. They can then take up the offer of the free screening blood test at one of four local blood collection centres (Healthscope). They do not need to be fasted and appointments do not need to be made. Reminder letters will be sent after 6 weeks to those people who have not taken up the blood test screening offer. Screening participation rate with the blood test and demographic factors that influence uptake, will be assessed at the 12 week time point.</interventions>
    <comparator>All study invitees will be offered screening with the new blood test and factors (eg. age, gender) that influence screening uptake will be assessed. The comparison group will be those that do not participate in screening.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine how many people within 12 weeks following the invitation letter have a blood sample collected for bowel cancer screening (ie. outcome = blood test participation rate). The number that complete the blood test will be expressed as a percentage of the invited cohort (ie. 240)</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks after invitation to screen.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An additional primary outcome will be to determine the factors that predict screening uptake with the blood test, ie. age, gender, risk status for bowel cancer, reasons for not participating with faecal testing. This information will be established via a short survey (designed specifically for this study) that is provided with the original study invitation letter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks after invitation to screen.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome will be to determine if the use of a reminder letter after 6 weeks will encourage further completion of the blood test for bowel cancer screening and whether this additional is dependent on demographic factors such as gender and age. The number of people in each of the gender/age subgroups that complete the blood test before and after the reminder letter will be compared at the 12 week time point.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks after invitation to screen.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An additional secondary outcome is to determine how many people have a positive blood test result out of the people that took up the offer of a screening test. A positive blood test result is defined as the presence of either hypermethylated BCAT1 or IKZF1 in the plasma sample (using quantitative real time PCR). As everyone who has a positive blood test result will be recommended to undergo a colonoscopic investigation, we will then be able to determine the accuracy of a positive blood test result for diagnosing the presence of colorectal cancer (based on the findings from colonoscopy).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after invitation to screen.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine how many people who are unsuitable for screening with the faecal occult blood test (FOBT) will take up bowel cancer screening with the new blood test instead. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 50 and 74 years (inclusive), are at higher risk of developing bowel cancer and are unwilling or unable to participate in faecal screening tests for bowel cancer due to either personal or medical reasons. 
Study details: Bowel cancer screening is typically achieved with a FOBT which detects small amounts of blood in faeces. While this form of screening has been shown to be effective at detecting cancer at an early and more treatable stage, there are many people in the community who are unable to complete the screening test. This can be due to a dislike of sampling from faeces, or due to a condition that causes bleeding from the bowel (such as haemorrhoids) which would interfere with the results of the FOBT. We have recently developed a new form of screening for bowel cancer with a blood test which could provide an appropriate means of testing for these individuals.
In our study we will determine how many people who are unsuitable for FOBT testing will take up bowel cancer screening with the new blood test instead. We will also determine what factors may influence their decision on whether to complete a screening test. As part of the study we will provide the participants (and their GPs) with their test result, and advice on further medical investigations should they test positive. A better understanding of how to provide better screening options for people at higher risk for bowel cancer is important and could have significant implications for public health practice.</summary>
