  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan sequences of the head, neck, and chest
Treatment: devices - Pacemaker System

Experimental: MRI Group - Subjects randomized to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging group will undergo a series of MRI scans at the 9-12 week visit post-implant.

Sham Comparator: Control Group - Subjects randomized to the control group will not undergo a series of MRI scans but will come into the study office for a one hour waiting period at the 9-12 week post-implant visit.


Other interventions: Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan sequences of the head, neck, and chest

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Subjects Who Experience an Increase Less Than or Equal to 0.5V in Atrial Voltage Thresholds - Subjects' atrial pacing capture threshold was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was when a subject experienced an increase less than or equal to 0.5V (volts) between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI/waiting period (9-12 weeks post implant) to one month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Subjects Who Experience an Increase Less Than or Equal to 0.5V in Ventricular Voltage Thresholds - Subjects' ventricular pacing capture threshold was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was when a subject experienced an increase less than or equal to 0.5V (volts) between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI/waiting period (9-12 weeks post implant) to one month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Subjects Who Experience a Decrease Less Than or Equal to 50% in Atrial Sensing Amplitude - Subjects' atrial sensed amplitude was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was defined as a 50% or less decrease in atrial sensed amplitude between the two visits.</outcome>

      <outcome>Occurrence of Sustained Ventricular Arrhythmias and Asystole During MRI Scans. - The endpoint was the occurrence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and asystole during MRI scans and attributable to the MR scan. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias or asystole episodes that occurred during the MRI scan was considered attributable to the MR scan if so adjudicated by the Adverse Events Adjudication Committee</outcome>
