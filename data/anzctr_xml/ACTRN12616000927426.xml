    <interventions>Intervention
Group A participants will be from Group A cluster sites and will have access to the Support for Life intervention from year 1. An highly experienced dementia support worker will provide a  holistic, highly flexible, individualised approach to support people with cognitive impairment or dementia and their families and or carers. .Support will be relationship-centred (responding to individual needs) and focused on enablement as opposed to dysfunction. Education about dementia and information/resources  will be provided to participants as well as advocacy and practical support to navigate dementia services and healthcare with an aim to also enhance continuity of care. Additionally, the dementia support worker will also provide psychological support and facilitate participants continued participation in their community and social engagement. The mode of support will consist of a combination of face to face, telephone and internet. interaction on an as needs basis for a duration of 12 months. The dementia support worker will deliver the intervention in the participants home or at mutually suitable locations as required/requested.  (Group A).
</interventions>
    <comparator>Group B participants will continue to receive usual care by health service providers and will not be denied information on dementia or dementia services in year one. In year 2 Group B participants will have access to the Support for Life intervention. </comparator>

    <sequence>Participants with dementia and their carers/family members will be randomly selected from community health centre client lists in each of the three states and then randomly selected to receive either the dementia ‘Support for Life’ program (Group A, n=50) or routine care only (Group B, n =50).

    <statisticalmethods>Participants symptoms and institutionalization, and caregivers/family members quality of life, stress and social support at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months following intervention will be measured and compared between study groups using repeated measures. 
The sample size required is 30 clusters with 10 participant/families, in each to allow for an attrition of 20%. This is a total of 100 participant/families (50 in each group) in each of the 3 states making a total sample size of 300. This will detect significant differences in caregivers and consumers quality of life between two groups at effect sizes of 0.39 (small-medium effects). Sample size calculations were done using Stata statistical software stepped-wedge: for clusters defined at the level of the community health centre, the primary outcome measure of QOL-AD, with scores between 15-60 and standard deviation of 7 power of 0.80, significance level set at 0.05, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, the number of steps (2), and participant data collected at four time points (baseline, three months, six months and 12 months).
Statistical analysis: all data will be analysed using SPSS version 21 (IBM, Chicago).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with dementia, their carers and families will be supported to identify services that meet their individual need and provide them greater control and choice. This will help ensure that these services/supports include opportunities for people with dementia full access to life activities such as employment and recreation.  Support will also focus on providing family members and/or carers the ability to actively participate in society and not be disadvantaged by their caring role. Active participation may mean continuing to work, attend school, university and receiving appropriate support in these environments.
Staff providing support to people with dementia and their carers/families will be provided with: adequate resources and autonomy, capped case loads, access to appropriate emotional support, and an assistant and volunteer staff to assist with the identification/creation of services/activities and where appropriate the provision of support.
