  <interventions>
    <interventions>Computerised Cognitive bias modification of Interpretations (iCBM) intervention with 2 sessions completed online over 7 days at home (each session approx 30 minutes).

During iCBM, participants will be presented with a series of written ambiguous health-related scenarios on the computer screen and asked to complete word fragments at the end of the ambiguous scenarios to resolve the scenario in a positive  manner.

Adherence will be monitored by completion of iCBM sessions, as well as the time taken to complete the session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Neutral interpretation training group: computer training will involve being presented with the same series of ambiguous health-related scenarios as the positive training (as explained above). In contrast to positive interpretation training, where participants will be repeatedly asked to resolve all of the sentences in a positive manner, in the neutral group, participants will be asked to resolve half of the scenarios in a negative manner, and half in a positive manner.

    <statisticalmethods>Intention to treat linear mixed models will be used to analyse whether the positive computerised iCBM training is superior to the neutral computerised iCBM training in reducing health anxiety. If there is no missing data, independent samples t tests will be used to compare the groups at post-treatment and follow-up. Effect sizes (Cohen's d and their 95% confidence intervals) will be calculated to explore and compare the size of the within-group and between-group effects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This RCT will evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of an online iCBM program targeting health anxiety symptoms by comparing positive iCBM with neutral iCBM. This study will also explore individual difference factors that predict better response to CBM, as well as the effect of the intervention on symptoms comorbid with health anxiety (such as depression).
