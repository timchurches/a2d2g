  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cinacalcet HCl
Other interventions - Standard of Care

Active Comparator: Standard of Care - Standard of care therapy included the use of vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders.

Experimental: Cinacalcet - In addition to standard of care participants received cinacalcet at a starting dose (based on dry body weight) of 0.20 mg/kg administered once a day by mouth. Dose adjustments and withholding were based on ionized calcium levels, plasma iPTH, and corrected calcium levels.


Treatment: drugs: Cinacalcet HCl
Capsules were opened and either sprinkled onto soft food (= 5 mg dose) or suspended into a sucrose syrup (= 2.5 mg dose) to create a liquid suspension for administration. Tablets were used for doses of 30 mg and higher in participants who could swallow tablets.

Other interventions: Standard of Care
Standard of care therapy included the use of vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders.
