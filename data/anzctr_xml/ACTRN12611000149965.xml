  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture twice weekly for 6 weeks. The sites which will be used are L14, LI11, GB34, ST40, Du20, Shishencong and Baxie on Day 1(First Session)  and GB21, ST36, TH5, SP6 and LIV3 on Day 2 (Second Session).  In the treatment group the needles will be inserted with bilateral rotation until "de Qi" sensation is elicited. Electrical frequency will then be delivered over 2 to 10 Hz (as tolerated by the participant, 0.5 to 0.7 milliseconds duration pulse width for twenty minutes. Each session will take 30-60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham acupuncture will be given twice weekly for 6 weeks following the same schedule as the treatment group. Treatment will consist of bilateral manipulation using the specially designed  non-skin penetrating devices (which automatically retract on contact with the skin) placed at points close to the real acupoints in the study, which produce pinpoint pressure sensation. The electroacupuncture machine will deliver the same audiovisual stimuli as in the electroacupuncture treatment arm, but lead wires will be concealed and disconnected so no electrial current is passed to the needles.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility and safety of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture.  Benefit of acupuncture to reduce symptoms and pain associated with arthralgia related to adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy. Assessments will be measured by a research assistant blinded to the baseline measurements.To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms, both self report and a clinical examination will be utilised. Baseline self assessment will involve 4 short questionnaires: the BPI-SF, WOMAC, FACT-G and FACT-Cog which will collectively assess severity of pain, evaluate impact of pain on quality of life and determine social and emotional well being. Bloods to meausre markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP) will be performed before and after 6 weeks of treatment</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer is most common cancer in women. Aproximately 75% of patients diagosed will have hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen has long been considered the gold standard for adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with endocrine sensitive early breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are commonly used and are in fact superior in improving disease free survival.  As a result, it is expected that in coming years the use of AIs in the current setting will increase dramatically. However, trials of AIs for breast cancer treatment have indicated that more than 40% of women taking AIs experience joint pain and stiffness which doesn't respond to conventional pain medication and may cause discontinuation of AI treatment. Acupuncture is one such alternative technique currentlyused for treating a variety of conditions including musculoskeletal pain. The analgesic mechanism of acupuncture is uncertain but it is speculated that analgesia may be mediated by release of opiod peptides and serotonin.</summary>
