  <interventions>
    <interventions>Five Aboriginal language groups of Central Australian Aboriginal men independently selected the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression screening tool from a selection of depression screening tools, as the most appropriate to adapt for use with Indigenous people. The PHQ-9 was adapted to the local needs of all five language groups over 12-months and consensus regarding wording was reached. The PHQ-9 wording was modified, using simplified English, to make the adapted PHQ-9 (aPHQ-9) culturally meaningful and give it face validity. In qualitative interviews with the same participants, seven critical domains of depressive experience within Indigenous men were identified that were not covered in existing depression case-finding measures: anger, weakened spirit, homesickness, irritability, excessive worry, rumination, and drug/alcohol use.
Following consent participants will complete two separate interviews up to one week apart.
Interview 1: the adapted PHQ-9 and additional 7 questions will be administered (face to face) by a trained member of the primary health care services staff followed by demographic questions. (Up to 20 minutes)
Interview 2: MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6.0.0. will be administered (face to face) by a trained member of the primary health care services staff or by a centralised interviewer (over the telephone) (Up to 20 minutes)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The clinicial diagnosis of depression according to the MINI 6.0.0, having two categories: "major depressive episode" and "no major depressive episode".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant's acceptability of different aspects of the aPHQ-9.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be measured in 5-points Likert scales within one week of aPHQ-9 interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of assessment within PHCS services. Should the aPHQ-9 (with or without the addition of one or more of the seven additional questions) have acceptable sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool for depression we will seek qualitative feedback on feasibility from PHCS staff during the feedback of study results to sites. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Semi-structured interviews will be used to assess this outcome. Site staff will be asked about the burden screening placed on them, their participants and the practice, the effect on the participant/clinician relationship, the usefulness of the aPHQ-9 and the extent to which practice routines must be adapted to integrate the aPHQ-9 into their service delivery.
This will be completed within 6 months of finishing study recruitment.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We computed the sample size based on the target precision for the estimation of sensitivity and specificity of the aPHQ-9 used for the screening of a major depressive episode (MDE). Assuming a MDE prevalence (assessed by the MINI 6.0.0) of 10% and a true sensitivity of 0.85, a sample size of 500 participants will give us a precision of 0.1 for the sensitivitys 95% confidence interval. For the specificity, 500 participants will provide a precision of 0.04 for the specificitys 95% confidence interval, assuming a true specificity of 0.75 and the same prevalence of 10%. If the prevalence of MDE is in fact higher, for example 15%, the precision for the sensitivity will be 0.08. 
For the analysis of the contribution of additional questions to the aPHQ-9, a sample size of 500 will give us 80% probability (power) of detecting a true improvement of 0.05 in the area under the ROC curve, fixing the type I error at 0.05.
For descriptive purposes baseline characteristics will be presented. Discrete variables will be summarised by frequencies and percentages, continuous variables by use of standard measures of central tendency and dispersion, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This cross sectional project will involve 500 Indigenous primary care attendees in Australias States and Territories. We will validate (criterion validity) the aPHQ-9 as a screening tool, alone, and in combination with the additional seven questions, against a gold standard structured criterion interview for depression The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview  (MINI ) 6.0.0 (criterion standard), in Indigenous men and women attending primary health care services across Australia.
This will provide the evidence on whether to recommend use of the aPHQ-9 as a screening tool for depression in health services research, clinical care delivery and policy evaluation in Federal and State chronic diseases programmes.</summary>
