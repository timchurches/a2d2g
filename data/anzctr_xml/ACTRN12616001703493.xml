  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study comprises a cross sectional, case-control study comparing the long term
health impacts of the Paleolithic diet with a high carbohydrate, low fat diet in healthy volunteers. The Paleolithic diet is based on fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs and nuts and  excludes grains, legumes and dairy foods which form part of the evidence based Australian Guide to Healthy Eating guidelines. Primary outcome measures will include faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA), secondary bile acids,ammonia and phenol concentrations, serum TMAO, SCFA and BCAA concentrations.
Fifty one self-reported long term followers of the Paleolithic diet (greater than 1 year) will be recruited and age and sex matched with 51 controls (total n=102). Once inclusion criteria are met and consent provided, participants will complete a diet history interview, 3-day weighed food record and provide a 48 hour stool and 24 hour urine collection and blood sample for analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator group comprises Australians of similar age and sex to subjects and who consume their regular diet, which includes &gt;1 serve/day of grains, legumes and dairy products and aligns with guidelines of the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.  Participants must meet selection criteria to be considered part of the control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stool Biochemistry - Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are being examined as our primary outcome variable and forms the basis of our power calculations for the study, However, other stool biochemical markers will be considered in the evaluation of change in SCFA output.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Stool samples are collected over a 48 hour period, which commences 24 hours post enrollment.


</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular - serum Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is being assessed as our primary outcome variable as a marker of cardiovascular disease risk. However, in the assessment of cardiovascular risk, we will consider the results for lipid levels (LDL, HDL, Triglycerides) as a composite measure.
Serum TMAO is being determined via HPLC-MS analysis at Edith Cowan University, serum lipid levels are being determined by standard analytical assay in NATA accredited laboratory (PathWest, Western Australia)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting blood sample is collected at a pathology centre 4 days post-enrollment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Metabolic - Assessment of Branched Chain Amino Acids (BCAA) is a novel biomarker for development of future insulin resistance. We will be examining serum BCAA and considering results for glycated heamoglobin in our analysis of these results.
BCAA analysis will be conducted at ECU Joondalup using HPLC-MS analysis. Glycated Hb will be determined by Pathwest using standardised techniques in a NATA accredited laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting blood sample is collected at pathology centre 4 days post enrollment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stool microbiota analysis - this is an exploratory outcome. Stool samples provided in the 48 hour collection and combined and homogenised prior to DNA sequencing occurring. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Collected over 48 hours commencing 2 days post enrollment.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum SCFA is a novel biomarker for bacterial fermentation in the gut. We will be determining serum SCFA using GC-MS at Edith Cowan University and results will be compared to the stool SCFA output as well as the microbiota profile.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting blood samples is collected on day 4 - Post enrolment at pathology centre.

A portion of the blood samples provided to Pathwest will be returned to ECU for analysis of serum SCFA.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometric - (Fat Mass%) </outcome>
      <timepoint>Fat Mass is examined at the initial patient interview using a BodPod chamber.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary Intake - Dietary intake variables (Fat,Carbohydrate,Protein and Fibre) will be examined and related to differences in our other outcome variables. Nutrient intake differences between groups will also be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will complete a 3-day weighed food record, in the three days post enrollment to the study.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lipid Levels - HDL,LDL, TG </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood sample is taken 4 days post enrolment, and comprises a fasting blood sample to be taken at PathWest.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stool Biochemistry - Ammonia, Phenols, Cresols, Secondary Bile Acids, Fecal Fat, Moisture and Nitrogen - to be used in our analysis of gut health. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Biochemical, anthropometric and metabolomics data will be analysed as continuous variables using general linear modelling, with macronutrient intake as fixed factors. Significance level for the test statistics will be set at P&lt;0.05. Data obtained from experiment three will be analysed using SPSS v22.0 (IBM Corporation, 2013) and PRIMER-7 (Primer-E, 2015). Analysis of data in this manner will provide estimations of risk for changes in outcome variables for changing carbohydrate, fat and protein intake. Microbiota analysis will be conducted using PRIMER, a statistical software package designed specifically for ecological use(Primer-E, 2015) which provides data on the phyla, genus and species of bacteria present in stool samples. Changes in the microbiota will be related to changes in biomarkers and changes in macronutrient intake. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study comprises a cross sectional, case-control study comparing the long term
health impacts of the Paleolithic diet with a high carbohydrate, low fat diet in healthy volunteers. Primary outcome measures will include faecal short chain fatty acids (SCFA), secondary bile acids, ammonia and phenol concentrations, serum TMAO, SCFA and BCAA concentrations. Pre-study power calculations have been conservatively based on between group differences in faecal butyrate, with medium effect size (d=0.5) and 80% power. Fifty one self-reported long term followers of the Paleolithic diet (greater than 1 year) will be recruited and age and sex matched with 51 controls (total n=102). Once inclusion criteria are met and consent provided, participants will complete a diet history interview, 3-day weighed food record and provide a 48 hour stool and 24 hour urine collection and blood sample for analysis. Faecal biochemistry (SCFA, bile acids, ammonia, phenol, total moisture) will be determined using gas chromatography (GC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods. Serum samples will be analysed for SCFA, TMAO and BCAA.
Food group, and dietary fibre intake will be analysed using SPSS v22.0 (IBM Corporation, 2013) with between groups and within groups analysis being performed. Data obtained from experiment three will be analysed using SPSS v22.0 (IBM Corporation, 2013) and PRIMER-7 (Primer-E, 2015). Outcome variables will be compared to macronutrient intake as continuous variables using general linear modelling. Analysis of data in this manner will provide estimations of risk for changes in outcome variables for changing carbohydrate, fat and protein intake.
The study will provide significant information to public health educators in relation to Paleolithic and AGHE dietary patterns.  The study will provide a significant contribution to the understanding of how total long term dietary patterns, inclusive and exclusive of grains and legumes contribute to the risks of future development of non-infectious bowel disease, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</summary>
