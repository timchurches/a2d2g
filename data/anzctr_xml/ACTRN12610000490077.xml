    <interventions>Single Exposure Therapy Session for Spider Phobia or Dog Phobia + 50mg D-cycloserine Exposure Therapy: All children will receive a single graded exposure therapy session for their spider or dog phobia which last about three hours. A parent will be in the room throughout the treatment. During the treatment the child and therapist will work as a team to complete a fear hierarchy of steps that increase the childs proximity or contact with a live, non-poisonous spider or dog (e.g. first step: stand 10 feet away from a boxed spider or leashed dog, final step: allow the spider to walk on your bare hand or pet the dog). At each step the therapist will model the actions or step that he wants the child to complete and then encourage the child to complete it them self. At each step the child will be asked to report their level of anxiety using a visual feeling thermometer. The therapist will encourage the child to remain at the step until they report at least a 50% reduction in their anxiety. The treatment will continue until the final step of the fear hierarchy is complete or the child does not wish to continue. The treatment involves little talking therapy, however , the therapist will encourage the child to draw conclusions regarding their safety after each step (e.g. so did the spider attack you when you came close after all?). The success of therapy is contingent upon the childs co-operation and motivation throughout treatment. Therefore, the therapist will not make the child do anything he or she does not want to do. This is a clinically standard and empirically validated treatment for specific fears in children. D-Cycloserine: A single oral 50mg capsule of D-Cycloserine (DCS) administered 1 hour before exposure therapy.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the child's fear of spiders or dogs as measured by their performance on standardized Behavioral Avoidance Tests (BATs). BATs have a prescribed "fear hierarchy" of steps that increase proximity and/or contact with a live, non-poisonous spider or leashed dog (e.g. first step: stand 10 feet from the spider in a closed box or leashed dog, final step: allow the spider to walk on your bare hand or pet the dog). Measurements taken during the BATs include: 1. The number of fear hierarchy steps the child is able to complete. 2. The child's subjective report of anxiety for each BAT step as indicated on a 10 point feeling thermometer (0 = very relaxed, 10 = extremely scared). 3. The child's avergage heart rate measured at every step of the BAT achieved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On the day of treatment:
1. A BAT will be conducted before the exposure treatment within the treatment context as a baseline measure of avoidance (BAT 1A). 
2. A BAT will be conducted after the exposure treatment within the treatment context as a measure of treatment gain (BAT 2A). 

On the day of the follow-up treatment, one week later:
3. A BAT will be conducted before follow-up treatment within the treatment context as a measure of treatment maintenance within treatment setting (BAT 3A).  
4. A BAT will be conducted before follow-up treatment outside of the treatment context as a measure of treatment maintenance outside of the treatment setting (BAT 1B).  
5. Finally, A BAT will be conducted after follow-up treatment outside of the initial treatment context as a measure of treatment gain outside of the treatment setting (BAT 2B).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The child's fear of spiders or dogs will also be measured during the exposure treatment, which is like an extension of the standardized BAT. During the exposure treatment, a therapist will help the child complete the steps of the BAT by modelling the action or step he wants the child complete and then encouraging the child to partake. Measurements taken during the exposure treatment include: 1. The number of fear hierarchy steps the child is able to complete with therapist assistance. 2. The child's subjective report of anxiety for each BAT step as indicated on a 10 point feeling thermometer (0 = very relaxed, 10 = extremely scared).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement will be taken during treatment and during follow-up treatment (one week later).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this trial is to examine whether 50mg of DCS can augment a single session of graded exposure therapy in children suffering from spider or dog phobia. The researchers are particularly interested in whether treatment gains can be maintained one week later both within and outside of the treatment context, as measured by Behavioral Approach Tests. The researchers hypothesize that children who receive the DCS in addition to exposure therapy will be less fearful of spiders or dogs one week later both within and outside of the treatment context.</summary>
