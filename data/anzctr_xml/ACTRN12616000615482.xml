  <interventions>
    <interventions>Completion of patient reported outcome (PRO) measures (PROMPT-Care survey) by patients as well as providing feedback via an evaluation survey and interviews on the acceptability of the eHealth system and usefulness of the self-management resources accessed. The interventions include;
a) The patients will complete the Distress Thermometer and Checklist, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and Supportive Care Needs Survey  9 items. Based on the patients results, they will be emailed links to self-management websites. These websites consist of publically available resources from reputable national (e.g. Cancer Council, Cancer Institute NSW) and international (e.g. McMillian) sources. Staff will receive a report summarising the results of the patients PROMPT-Care survey with recommendations for action, as developed by the studys Clinical Advisory Group. 
b) The PROMPT-Care survey measures items over 4 domains: Physical wellbeing (e.g. fatigue, pain, mouth sores), emotional wellbeing (e.g. anxiety, depression, loss of interest in activities), social and family wellbeing (e.g. support from family and friends, problems with partner) and practical support (e.g. transport, housing, being informed about test results). 
c) The PROMPT-Care system is accessible by patients (to input PROMPT-Care survey results and to access self-management resources), staff at the cancer treatment centre (e.g. oncologists, nurse care coordinators, allied health staff), and selected members of the research team who have approval to access patients medical records using the MOSAIQ database. Results of patient surveys are integrated in to Mosaiq in which the clinician and other care providers can access report summaries to review patient reported outcomes as part of routine care. 
d) Frequency of use  patients on active treatment or in follow up will complete the PROMPT-Care survey every 4 weeks (includes all previously mentioned assessments), depending on the schedule of their review appointments. 
e) Duration of intervention = 6 months
f) Patients attending clinic will be asked to complete the PROMPT-Care survey in the waiting area, using an electronic tablet device. Patients in long-term follow-up will typically complete their PROMPT-Care survey from home, however should they be attending clinic for review they will be asked to complete that monthly survey while in the waiting area. 
g) Strategies to monitor adherence: Patients who do not complete their PROMPT-Care surveys from home will receive reminder emails. We will also be conducting evaluation interviews with participants to get their views of the system and to discuss issues around their adherence to the project. 
h) Participants will be asked to fill out an evaluation survey and to attend a single interview to assess their views on the eHealth platform, which will last approximately 20 minutes. Oncology hospital staff will be asked to attend a single interview to assess their views on the eHealth platform, which will last approximately 20 minutes.
i) Participants who are on-treatment at the commencement of the study and transition to follow-up care during the study will receive a Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan. This care plan will be circulated to their nominated GP.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The composite primary outcome is to test the functionality and acceptability of the eHealth platform in a sample of cancer patients at three participating hospitals and focus on the assessment of:
-Participant uptake rates assessed through trial logs recording number of patients approached, entered study, number of follow-up calls made, research staff time for recruitment, and participant feedback on how they were made aware of the study; 
-Extent of missing data from assessments undertaken by participants assessed through examination of PROMPT-Care reports to determine whether there is any systematically missing data; 
-Accuracy and completeness of data transfer procedures (from the point of the patient completing an assessment to a report appearing via MOSAIQ) assessed by comparison of data received by MOSAIQ to data presented in reports;
-System response to PROMs over time (including escalation of self-management advice messages sent to patients, sending of clinical alerts, and patient consultation with GPs) assessed through implementation and evaluation of quality assurance checks to ensure the system is operating as expected; 
-Acceptability of PROMPT-Care to participants assessed through evaluation survey and/or interviews with patients;
-Acceptability and perceived usefulness of the real-time reporting to clinicians assessed through evaluation interviews; 
-Percent of eligible participants who complete more than one assessment assessed through study log records and participant tracking; 
-Participants levels of self-reported distress, symptoms and unmet needs assessed through evaluation of patient data submitted and recorded through the PROMPT-Care survey; 
-Utility of the self-management resources by patients though assessment of the patient use of the system; and 
-Acceptability and utility of the Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan from patient, oncology and primary care provider perspectives assessed through evaluation interviews

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to implement an integrated eHealth platform to support and enable cancer survivors to achieve and maintain improved health and well-being and better cancer outcomes, and to assess the functionality and acceptability of the system. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 or over and are either currently receiving cancer care (including follow-up care), or have recently been diagnosed with cancer and scheduled to commence cancer treatment at one of the participating sites. 
Study details 
Participants will have access to the eHealth system which assesses symptoms, emotional well-being and unmet needs. Participants will have access to a range of self-management websites based on their survey responses. Staff will receive a patient report with clinical recommendations. Patients and oncology staff will have access to the system for 6 months. Patients will then be asked to complete a survey and an interview regarding their use and acceptability of the eHealth system. Staff will be asked to complete an interview only.
A sub-set of participants who are on-treatment at the commencement of the study and transition to follow-up care during the study will receive a Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan that will also be provided to their GP.
