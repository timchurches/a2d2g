  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to assess the effect of tiotropium compared with placebo in adult patients with non-cystic bronchiectasis with airflow obstruction.

The primary aim is to assess whether tiotropium reduces event-based exacerbation frequency.

And the secondary aims are whether tiotropium increases time to first exacerbation, improves lung function,
reduces symptom-based exacerbation, improves quality of life, reduces airway inflammation, reduces bacterial infection and improves exercise capacity and forced vital capacity.</summary>
