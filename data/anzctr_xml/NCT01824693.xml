  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EFS - Will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. An event is either TRM, primary or secondary graft failure, or relapse/non-response (as defined in protocol section 10). Time to event is time from transplant with patients who die between the start of the conditioning regimen and transplant given a time to event of zero.</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>TRM - Death prior to relapse or non-response. Time to TRM is defined as time from transplants to TRM. Patients who die between the start of the conditioning regimen and transplant will be considered a TRM with time to TRM of zero. Will be estimated as cumulative incidence using the Aalen-Johansen method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 100</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Graft failure rates - Will be estimated using the cumulative incidence via the method of Aalen and Johannsen. Failure to achieve an ANC &gt;= 500/uL after 42 days, determined by 3 consecutive measurements on different days; OR &lt; 5% donor cells in blood or bone marrow by day +42 (as demonstrated by a chimerism assay), without evidence of JMML.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and
      melphalan or busulfan and fludarabine phosphate before donor hematopoietic cell transplant
      works in treating younger patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Giving chemotherapy
      before a donor hematopoietic transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also
      stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem
      cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's bone marrow make
      stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not yet known whether
      giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan or busulfan and fludarabine phosphate before
      a donor stem cell transplant is more effective in treating juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.</summary>
