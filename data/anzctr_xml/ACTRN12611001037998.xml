  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of contraception for women who have infrequent intercourse of an oral medication which is taken each time a woman has sex. The objectives of the study are: to evaluate the efficacy of the study regimen among women who expect to have sex 1-6 days a month and who are relying on the study regimen as their primary method of contraception; to evaluate the safety of this regimen, with particular emphasis on its effects on vaginal bleeding patterns and anemia; and to evaluate the acceptability of the regimen among women using it.</summary>
