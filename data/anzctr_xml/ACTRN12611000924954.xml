  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a web-based tool (iTool) designed to assist oncologists calculate and explain three individualized scenarios for survival - best case, worst case and most likely- to patients with incurable cancer who want this sort of information.  

The iTool can be accessed on any computer with an internet connection but for this study it will be loaded onto iPads that oncologists will use in the clinic with patients.  When a participating oncologist has a patient requesting survival information, the oncologist is required to use their knowledge and experience to estimate the median survival for a group of patients with a similar cancer, treatment status and prognostic factors to the one in question.  The oncologist enters the estimate in months into the iTool and the iTool calculates three scenarios for survival using simple formulae discovered in previous work These scenarios will be displayed on the iPad screen with an image to assist the oncologist communicate the information to the patient.  This screenshot can be printed after the consultation with copies available for the patient and/or family members to take home, a copy placed in the patients notes and a copy sent to other health professionals involved in the patients care.  
The iTool will be used by each participating oncologist as often as required during the 6 month study period.  We estimate each oncologist will use the tool once per week.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The percentage of patients who agree that the prognostic information provided by the web-based tool is helpful.  Assessed via a written study specific questionnaire completed by patients.  The questionnaire contains a series of study-specific statements and 5-point Likert scales to elicit attitudes to each statement (strongly agree, agree, unsure, disagree and strongly disagree).  Percentages calculated by dividing the number of patients that agree and strongly agree with the statement by the total number of patients answering for that statement multiplied by 100.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participating medical oncologists will be provided with an iPad loaded with the prognostic tool and encouraged to use it to calculate and explain individualized scenarios for survival for patients wanting to discuss survival time.  Summaries of the survival information will be printed and given to patients, family members and other health professionals involved in the care of each patient.  

Oncologists will complete a brief questionnaire after using the tool with a patient to evaluate how helpful they found the tool.

Following the discussion of prognosis the oncologist will ask the patient and any family members present to participate in an evaluation study of the web-based prognostic tool and the prognostic information it provides.  Patients wanting to participate must provide written informed consent.  They are then given a study-specific questionnaire to complete in the next 2 weeks.  The questionnaire asks about how helpful the information was.

Family members wanting to participate are provided with a questionnaire to complete and return within 2 weeks.  Return of a completed questionnaire will be indicative of consent.

Other health professionals involved in the patient's care will be posted a copy of the survival information as well as the study information and a questionnaire to complete and return by post within 4 weeks.  The questionnaire evaluates how helpful they found the prognostic information.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the potential of a web-based tool to help cancer doctors explain survival time to their patients with advanced cancer who wish to receive information about their likely survival time. Who is it for? You may be eligible for this study if you have been diagnosed with incurable cancer, you wish to receive information on your prognosis and you are able and willing to complete a written study questionnaire about your attitudes to the web-based tool anfd the information you received. The study will also collect information from medical oncologists and other health professionals involved in the care of the cancer patients, along with family members and carers of the patient in order to build an overall picture of the usefulness of the tool. The overall duration of the study is 6 months but if you participate you are only required to complete one questionnaire that takes less than 10 minutes to complete.
Trial details: The aim of this study is to find out if patients and their family members find the information provided by the web-based tool helpful and if cancer doctors find using the web-based tool helpful. We will also be providing information on likely survival time to other doctors and nurses helping to care for these patients to find out if they find receiving this sort of information on their patients helpful. The overall duration of the study will be for 6 months and each participating cancer patients will be given 2 weeks to complete and return a written questionnaire.</summary>
