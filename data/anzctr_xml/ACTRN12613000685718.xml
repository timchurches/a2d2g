    <interventions>Study aims to evaluate effects of a low dose of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) on tinnitus. The study consists of two phases designed as placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trials.  In both phases, MDMA (or placebo) will be administered orally. Participants taking part in phase 1 will not take part in phase 2.

In (dosing) phase 1, we will test the efficacy of one 30 mg dose of MDMA in reducing tinnitus (N = 10). Each session will take approximately 6 hours separated by one week. Therefore the duration of phase 1 will be approximately 8 days. Only if no effect of 30 mg is found, one 70 mg dose will be tested (N = 10). Same participants may take take part  in both tests within phase 1. In this case a wash-out break will be at least 3 weeks.

In (main) phase 2, the effects of one dose chosen in phase 1 (30 or 70 mg) will be further assessed in more patients (N = 20). During the trial, patients will be placed in a low-sensory environment and MDMA will be administered under supervision of a pharmacist. In all participants in phase 2, two resting state fMRI scans will be performed: directly before (baseline) and post 2 hours after MDMA administration allowing for an objective assessment the MDMA effects. Each session will take approximately 6 hours separated by three weeks. Therefore the duration of this phase will be approximately 22 days.</interventions>

    <concealment>The Audiology section has a research volunteer database that will be search for potential candidates. Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form will be forwarded to potential participants for review. If further participants are required a call for volunteers will be made through University email research email lists. Potential participants will self-identity, by responding to the email. All email materials will undergo review by the coordinating investigator, prior to posting and will include the appropriate ethical application numbers and approval dates. Potential participants will be able to verbally ask any questions about the study from investigators when considering signing the Informed Consent Form. Allocation will be conducted by an appointed member of the team. The information about allocation for each participant will be stored in a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Individuals deemed to meet the recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be allocated to group 1 (MDMA first, placebo second) or group 2 (placebo first, MDMA second). Participants will not be aware of whether they receive MDMA or placebo. Randomizing will be conducted using online randomizing software (www.rando.la).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We will use a mixed ANOVA with a within-subject factor of time; baseline, post 1, 2 and 4 hour, post 1 week (and post 3 weeks in phase 2) and between subject factor of group  group 1 vs. group 2. The study design will also allow for combining phase 1 and phase 2 datasets (except for post 3 weeks data). This will be followed by post-hoc t-tests (baseline vs. particular time point).

Given that this is to be the first proof-of-principle study assessing the effects of NDMA on tinnitus, it is not possible to accurately calculate the sample size. In phase 1, we expect that up to 20 participants will suffice to establish the effective dose. Another group of 20 participants will be recruited for phase 2. The participant numbers are based on previous studies showing a clinical significant effect in the primary and secondary outcome measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>MDMA has recently become a focus of research for its possible therapeutic effects. Tinnitus is the perception of sound(s) in the ear(s) or head without an external source. There is currently no drug therapy for tinnitus. There are a growing number of studies showing that MDMA can improve the outcome of psychotherapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with abnormal activity in brain regions associated with memory and learning (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) and fear (amygdala). MDMA tends to normalize the activity within these regions and improve the PTSD symptoms. Recent studies indicate that tinnitus is associated with a similar pattern of abnormal brain activity that is found in patients with PTSD. It is therefore possible that MDMA may also help patients with tinnitus. There is also anecdotal evidence supporting this idea. Some tinnitus patients report a significant reduction or an absence of tinnitus after use of Ecstasy. This study is to investigate whether administration of a single dose of MDMA will decrease tinnitus perception.</summary>
