    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Haemodialysis patients who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be approached by a member of the study team. If they are interested in participating in the study the principal or associate investigator will discuss the study with the patient, answer any questions and obtain written informed consent.
Allocation concealment is by sealed, opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Given the sample size, restricted randomisation will be performed using a permuted block design and allocation within blocks in a 1:1 ratio and sequence of blocks determined using the “random allocation” function of STATA version 11.2 (College Station, Texas).  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>It is estimated that a sample size of 20 participants in each group would provide &gt;90% power to detect a within-group and between-group change in FGF23 from baseline of at least 0.8 times the standard deviation of the mean baseline FGF23 concentration.
Skewed data will be log-transformed before statistical computations. Measurements at Study Days -14, -7 and 0 will be used to estimate pre-infusion week-to-week variation in FGF23. For the primary analysis of mean changes from baseline (mean pre-infusion concentration) in FGF23, we will use restricted maximum likelihood-based repeated measures analyses (linear mixed models) that consider random time effects with baseline values treated as a fixed covariate. The models will employ an unstructured covariance design without imputing missing values. Within-group differences between time points may also be evaluated with repeated measures ANOVA, Friedmans ANOVA or with paired t-tests depending on data distribution. The association between iron indices and baseline and change in FGF23 concentrations will be assessed with Pearsons or Spearmans test, as appropriate. Changes from baseline to each scheduled evaluation and to the minimum, maximum, and final value will be compared to zero with Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. A two-tailed P value &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The goal of this randomised controlled trial is to examine the effects of iron deficiency and compare its correction with either IV ferric carboxymaltose  or iron sucrose on intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)concentrations in individuals with end stage kidney disease undergoing chronic haemodialysis therapy.</summary>
