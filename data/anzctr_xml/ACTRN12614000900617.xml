    <interventions>A novel anger focused intervention for Defence members who are also experiencing PTSD has been developed.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on preliminary data from the small number of existing studies in this area, 30 clients has been shown to be sufficient to demonstrate a moderate to large clinical effect. Sample power calculations based on treatment response from a previous trial (Moreland 2010) suggest a sample size of n=30 is required to detect a 10 point difference on mean anger scores (as measured by the STAXI-2) at follow-up, with power set at 96% and p set at 0.05. The reduction of 10 points on the STAXI in Moreland 2010 was associated with a large clinical effect size. 

Frequency statistics will be used to describe the incidence of disorders within the sample. Correlation analyses will be used to examine the relationship between variables. T-tests, repeated measures multivariate analyses and hedges g effect size analyses will be used to examine treatment effects.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel treatment for problematic anger in Defence members who are also experiencing PTSD. 

It is hypothesised that the novel anger focused intervention for Defence members will result in the primary outcome of improved (reduced levels of) anger.  Secondary outcomes which may be hypothesised include improved outcomes in associated mental symptomatology including depression, anxiety, alcohol use and symptoms of posttraumatic stress. </summary>
