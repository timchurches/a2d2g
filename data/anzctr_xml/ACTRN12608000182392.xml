  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is participation in a 12 month CHOICE program that includes a one-hour initial consultation and a few follow-up phone calls over three months.  The program has four stages and was designed as an individualized, structured, case-management approach and was overseen by treating physicians.  Stage one involves the development of modules and tailoring of leaflets by thorough investigation of local programs for each risk factor.  Stage two involves face-to-face risk factor assessment and measurement, generating a list of each patients relevant risk factors.  In stage three, patients make guided choices about which risk factors they will lower, participate in goal-setting informed by current national targets for the chosen risk factors, and select which management option(s) they will use to lower risk.

All CHOICE patients participate in a core module for lowering cholesterol (including healthy eating advice and pharmacotherapy) given its major impact on reducing recurrent events.  Up to two choice modules including blood pressure-lowering, smoking cessation, increased physical activity and nutrition are also offered depending on individual patient need and preference.  After choosing relevant risk factor modules, patient selected their preferred management option(s) and make a self-commitment to a written action plan and are formally referred where appropriate (eg, smoking cessation clinic appointment made).  Patients are also provided with a tailored resource package and a summary of the chosen risk factors, goals and interventions is mailed to the family physician, cardiologist and the patient.  Stage four of the CHOICE program is telephone follow-up.</interventions>
    <comparator>3 month CHOICE program similar to that described above but with an average of only 4 follow-up telephone calls over 3 months. We will also recruit a randomised control group of approximately 70 participants at one hospital only.  This single-site control group will continue to manage their heart health as directed by their treating doctor(s).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sudden heart events are a major health problem and account for about 22% of Australian deaths annually.  However, more than 80% of survivors dont enrol in programs aimed at lowering another attack.  We have previously shown that first time survivors who do not use existing cardiac rehabilitation programs have higher coronary risk factors yet were prepared to participate in a brief, guided-choice modular program which resulted in showed significantly improved risk factor level and would lower their chance of a future heart event.  The benefit was apparent at 3 months and maintained at 1 year.  Given the importance of these findings we aim to determine whether they can be replicated across a range of hospitals and to determine whether periodic reinforcement improves outcomes further and for 3 years.</summary>
