  <interventions>
    <interventions>An individual peer support program delivered to young people from 3 months prior to, until 3 months post discharge from a specialist first episode psychosis center.  People will receive 2 hours of contact per fortnight from the peer support worker which will include an in-reach and out-reach service and will include supportive informal contact, assistance making health related appointments, assistance with public transport to appointments and support in accessing new services. Participants will receive the peer support intervention plus standard care.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study team comprises researchers and representatives from the clinical program.  The research assistant (RA) will attend the regular clinical meetings held at EPPIC in order to identify young people who are about to commence the discharge planning period. Once the discharge planning process is about to begin the RA will contact the young person and see if they are interested in the study. If so they will obtain written consent and conduct the baseline assessment. Once the baseline assessment is conducted the young personâ€™s details will be passed to an independent statistician who will randomise them into either the treatment or control group. Those in the control group will receive treatment as usual (TAU) whilst those in the treatment group will receive treatment as usual plus the peer support intervention (TAU+PSI).

Once randomisation has taken place the statistician will contact either the project supervisor or the Peer Support Coordinator directly that the intervention can begin.  The Peer Support Coordinator will allocate a peer support worker (PSW) who will make contact with the participant and will deliver the intervention. By doing this in this way the RA can remain blind to treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation procedure will follow the consort guidelines. The subjects will be randomized to the treatment group or control group with equal allocation. Computer generated random numbers will be used to carry out the randomization.</sequence>
