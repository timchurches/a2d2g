  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage Change in Total Hip Bone Mineral Density BMD at Year 6 (Baseline) and Year 9 - Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA consists of two X-ray beams with different energy levels that are aimed at the patient's bones. When soft tissue absorption is subtracted out, the BMD can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone. Percentage change from Year 6 = 100*(Year 9 - Year 6)/Year 6.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage Change of Femoral Neck Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Year 7, 8 and 9 Compared to Year 6 - Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

      <outcome>Percentage Change of Total Hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at Year 7, 8 and 9 Compared to Year 0 - Bone Mineral Density (BMD) measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA consists of two X-ray beams with different energy levels that are aimed at the patient's bones. When soft tissue absorption is subtracted out, the BMD can be determined from the absorption of each beam by bone. Percentage change from Year 0 = 100*(Year 9 - Year 0)/Year 0.</outcome>

      <outcome>Biomarkers (Bone Markers) Serum C-terminal Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTx) at Year 6 (Extension 2 Baseline), Year 7, Year 8, Year 9 - Bone marker analysis: All patients had blood samples collected for analysis of serum c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx). Serum CTX assays measure a fragment of the C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen released during resorption of mature bone</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With New/Worsening Morphometric Vertebral Fractures at Year 9 Compared to Year 6 - Morphometric vertebral fracture (VF) was assessed based on morphometry. QM (quantitative morphometry) incident VF(QM positive) was defined by at least a 20% decrease in any vertebral height (at least 4 mm). If a participant had a QM positive at any vertebrae at any visit, x-rays from all visits for participants were evaluated using Genant semi-quantitative (SQ) method for VF assessment. A fracture was defined as an SQ reading that was greater than the baseline SQ reading.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Year 6 (extension 2 baseline), Year 9 (3 years of study duration)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean of Time to First Clinical Fracture - The mean of time to the first clinical fracture is estimated from the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Height at Years 7, 8 and 9 Relative to Year 6 - Height was measured using a stadiometer in millimeters (mm). A stadiometer is a piece of medical equipment used for measuring height. It is usually constructed out of a ruler and a sliding horizontal headpiece which is adjusted to rest on the top of the head.</outcome>
