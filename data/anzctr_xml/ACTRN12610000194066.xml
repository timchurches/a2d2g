  <interventions>
    <interventions>Canagliflozin (JNJ-28431754) oral capsule, daily dose either 100mg or 300mg. Dose will be assigned randomly.

Canagliflozin against placebo in treating patients over 25 years of age, who have inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. Patients will be randomised to receive either 100mg or 300mg of canagliflozin or placebo for 26 weeks, in addition to their current diabetes medication, with an extension of 26 weeks.Total treatment phase is 52 weeks. Study drug and placebo will be tablet form and taken orally.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of canagliflozin relative to placebo on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). HbA1c is a test that measures the amount of glycated hemoglobin in the blood.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 26 weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess safety and tolerability, by assessing adverse events during the duration of the trial and proportion of subjects receiving rescue therapy and time to rescue therapy. Important measures of renal safety will be the eGFR, based upon serum creatinine, and Albumin Creatinin Ratio (ACR) measured in the first morning urine collection</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 26 weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) will be assessed via blood analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 26 weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects with an HbA1c&lt;7% will be assessed via blood analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 26 and 52 weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured using a manometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 26 and 52 weeks of treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects receiving rescue therapy and time to rescue therapy. From Day 1 to Week 26, glycemic rescue therapy will be implemented in subjects with
FPG values, repeated and confirmed (repeated within 7 days), meeting progressively stricter Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) criteria. After
Week 26, HbA1c will be used to determine the need for rescue therapy. In this study,
glycemic rescue therapy will be selected and managed, as considered clinically
appropriate, by the investigator.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Renal function estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albumin creatinin ration (ACR). The eGFR, based upon serum creatinine, and ACR measured in the first morning urine collection (for both measures, using the mean
of 2 determinations: 1 performed on the day prior to the visit and 1 on the visit day). The eGFR will be calculated based on the 4-variable formula according to the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study with the correction for the standardized creatinine method.
The MDRDequation includes serum creatinine, age, gender, and race which all are important ovariates affecting GFR as assessed by the direct method.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to compare 2 doses of canagliflozin against placebo in treating patients over 25 years of age, who have inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. Patients will be randomised to receive either 100mg or 300mg of canagliflozin or placebo for 26 weeks, in addition to their current diabetes medication, with a possibility of continuing for an additional 26 weeks. The study is blinded so neither the patients nor the site
staff will know what the patient is taking and there is an equal change of receiving the different doses of canagliflozin or placebo. The study will asses patients for how well their diabetes is controlled on the study and also assess any side effects they have whilst taking study medication. In order to achieve this patients will have to attend regular clinic visits intially every
3 weeks then 6 - 8 weekly for first 26 weeks. In the second 26 weeks there are only 2 visits 18 weeks apart. During these visits blood samples will be taken and analaysed and patients will be asked how they feel and this will all be recorded on a case report form. Patients will also be
asked to complete a diary during the study, recording their blood sugar levels (taken on a monitor provided by the sponsor), any problems they have between visits and when they take their study medication.</summary>
