  <interventions>
    <interventions>Whole Body Vibration (WBV) Exercise. In addition to group based balance and strength exercise (See Control Treatment) participants in the intervention group will also perform an additional 3 sessions of WBV exercise per week for 8 consecutive weeks ending at week 8. Participants will perform a minimum of 1 minute of WBV exercise per session (Week 1) progressing to a maximum of 5 x 1 minute repetitions in one WBV session (Week 8).  Each 1-minute repetition will be followed by a 1-minute rest period.  WBV exercise will be devlivered by a commercially available WBV Machine which consists of an oscillating platform (see - saw mechanism) of adjustable frequency and amplitude.  The frequency of WBV exercise for the 1st, 3rd and 5th minute will be set at 18Hz. During the 2nd and 4th minutes the frequency will be set at 6Hz. Amplitude of the side-to-side motion of the platform will remain constant at 7 mm total (3.5 mm each side).</interventions>
    <comparator>Active Control.  Group based strength and balance exercise program. This will be delivered twice a week over a 8 week period with each session lasting 30 minutes. The exercises will be administered by a experienced Physiotherapy Assistant under the guidance and supervision of a physiotherapist according to standard work practises at the facility.  The exercises will be chosen according to the balance and strength capcity of the participants identified during baseline assessment.   Exercises will be targeted to identified lower limb muscle groups known to be implicated in accidental falls.  A selction of static and dynamic balance exercises will also be used to challenge balance systems.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls and falls-related injuries are a serious public health issue affecting people aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that 1 in 3 people over the age of 65 will fall every year. Falls are the leading cause of injury-related hospitalization and death in persons older than 65 years of age. They are often the key precipitating factor in leading to admission to an residential aged care (RAC) facility. People living in RAC have a higher rate of falls than older people living in the community. They are generally frailer with greater muscle weakness than their peers living independently at home.

There are usually a number of causes of falls. Risk factors that contribute to falls include gait and balance disorders, visual problems, cognitive impairment, and the use of certain medications. Improving lower limb muscle strength and balance using exercise is an effective treatment in falls prevention. In the presence of osteoporosis, the incidence of fracture following a fall increases sharply. Once a person has sustained a fracture due to osteoporosis they are four times more likely to sustain another fracture in the proceeding 12 months than the non-fracture population.

Recent interest has emerged on the use of Mechanical Whole Body Vibration (WBV) as a potential therapy that may produce improvements in muscle strength, bone mineral density and balance. WBV works by stimulating the stretch reflex causing a contract - relax cycle of muscle. Given the benefits that WBV has been shown to provide to muscle strength, balance and bone mineral density it has the potential to play an important role in falls prevention particularly in frail older people who have difficulty participating in an active exercise program. It has been suggested that 5 minutes of WBV provides benefits equating with 30 minutes of traditional exercise.  This may more achievable in the older person. 

This study aims to assess the effects of WBV on the muscle strength, balance and falls of older residents living in a RAC facility.  Participants who meet the criteria to participate in the study will have their balance and muscle strength assessed prior to commencing the study. Previous falls history will be recorded. All participants will perform a targeted group exercise program aimed at improving lower limb strength and balance. The exercise program will be run two times per week for 8 weeks with each session lasting approximately 30 minutes. Half of the participants will perform additional WBV exercise 3 times per week for 8 weeks under the supervision of a qualified physiotherapist who is experienced in the use of WBV exercise.  Each WBV exercise session will be a maximum 10 minutes.  At the end of the 8 weeks participants will have their muscle strength and balance reassessed.  Information on Falls will be collected for a further 6 months.</summary>
