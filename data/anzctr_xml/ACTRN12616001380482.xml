  <interventions>
    <interventions>In INTRA-ARTICULAR (IA) group a cocktail anesthetic will be prepared containing 50ml of 0.25% Bupivaicaine, 10mg of morphine (1ml) and 99ml of normal saline, to make the total volume 150ml. This 150 ml of fluid will be injected at posterior capsule, anterior capsule, patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon and the subcutaneous tissue at incision line at the end of surgery by the operating surgeon.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patient of FEMORAL NERVE BLOCK SINGLE SHOT GROUP (FNB) group will receive a single injection femoral nerve block after the surgery by senior anaesthesiologist. A high resolution ultrasound device (sonosite) will be used to locate the femoral nerve. Direct visualization of needle tip will be maintained by ultrasound while inserting the needle, until needle reaches close to the femoral nerve. The site of injection will be confirmed by nerve stimulator after getting the ipsilateral quadriceps contraction (patellar movement) at 0.5 mA, (stimulator frequency at 2 Hz and pulse width of 0.1 sec). At this site, 25 ml of 0.5 % Bupivacaine will be injected slowly after negative aspiration. During the injection the spread of local anesthetic solution within the fascial space will be visualized by ultrasound. The injection can be stopped and needle will be repositioned if patient complains of pain during injection.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The development of joint replacement is regarded as one of the most significant advances in orthopedic surgeries. Total knee replacement is associated with significant potential perioperative morbidity. In this regard, anesthesia is of prime importance to reduce postoperative pain and morbidity. Anesthesia for total knee replacement should provide stable intraoperative conditions and rapid recuperation. Analgesia techniques should aim to provide optimal pain relief whilst minimizing side effects. There is now good evidence that well conducted regional analgesia can achieve these aims, leading to improved functional recovery facilitated by more rapid and effective joint rehabilitation.
The usual choices for post-operative analgesia are epidural modes of analgesia, systemic opiates and peripheral nerve blocks. All these methods need to be complemented with NSAIDS or COX-2 selective inhibitors, paracetamol and gabapentenoids for effective management of break through high intensity pain. 
All these alternatives come with their own advantages and disadvantages.
Statement of the problem: The comparative analgesic effect of intraarticular local anesthetic injection and femoral nerve block has not been adequately reported in patients undergoing TKA.
Significance: Clinical trials investigating different modalities of administering analgesia in total knee replacement have reported comparative efficacies between single shot femoral nerve block (SSFNB) and intraarticular injections of local anesthetics with analgesic drugs. A recent retrospective study examining the pain rating, side effects and ambulation found that intraarticular injection with higher dose of local anesthetics provide comparable analgesic effect as single shot femoral nerve block after TKA and might be associated with early ambulation than femoral nerve block post-operatively.
