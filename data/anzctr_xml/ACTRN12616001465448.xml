  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients at 10 participating general practices in the Perth metropolitan area will be sent a short message service (SMS) reminding them to schedule an appointment for influenza vaccination. The message will be sent only once between 10 May and 26 May 2016 (approximately 8 weeks following the availability of influenza vaccine). The message will only be sent to patients who have not yet received an annual influenza vaccine. The message will be sent directly from the general practice to the patient and will read: 

"Our records show that [you/your child] is eligible for free seasonal influenza vaccine. Please contact [Practice name] at [Practice number] to schedule an appointment for vaccination."</interventions>
    <comparator>No SMS will be sent to the control group</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Prevention</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ten to thirteen weeks following transmission of the SMS reminder, vaccination information, including any vaccine administered in 2016 and the date of vaccination, will be extracted from electronic medical records at participating practices. The percent of patients immunised against influenza will be compared between those who received a SMS reminder and those who didn't.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Ten to thirteen weeks following the SMS transmission (26 July to 15 August 2016)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Based on vaccination information extracted from patients' electronic medical record at the general practice, timeliness of vaccination following the transmission of a SMS reminder will be assessed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between May and August 2016</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Immunisations are an important public health intervention for reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by vaccine-preventable diseases in the community. Certain individuals are at higher risk of serious complications following influenza infection, and unfortunately, influenza vaccine has the lowest uptake of any routine vaccination program in Australia. Studies from overseas have shown the use of text message reminders (also called short message service [SMS] reminders) can be an effective method of promoting vaccines to priority groups. The Western Australia Department of Health (WA Health) is interested in creating a program for general practitioners to use during the influenza vaccination season to remind patients they are eligible for government-funded influenza vaccine. To assess whether this activity is an effective and efficient use of resources, WA health intends to evaluate the impact of a prototypic reminder system in a subset of practices.</summary>
