    <interventions> Intravenous paracetamol (Actavis, North Adelaide, SA)

Paracetamol is one of the most commonly used medications in the world. The intravenous format is the preferred method of administration in the intraoperative and immediate postoperative periods.

In 100mL of solution for infusion, intravenous paracetamol contains the following:

Paracetamol = 1g
Mannitol = 3.91g

Cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate
Dibasic dihydrate sodium phosphate
Sodium hydroxide
Hydrochloric acid
Water for injections

For this clinical trial, intravenous paracetamol will be used once intraoperatively only. 

The insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) is required for routine anaesthesia treatment during liver surgery. Haemodynamic measurements will be monitored via the PAC. After insertion of the PAC, 100mL paracetamol (containing 1g paracetamol and 3.91g mannitol) will be administered intravenously.

Volume of paracetamol to be administered:
Actavis (North Adelaide, SA) recommends 1g of paracetamol per administration with a maximum of 4g of paracetamol per day. The minimum dose interval is 4 hours. The duration of infusion is 15 minutes.

In this trial, one dose of 1g/100mL IV paracetamol will be administered over 15 minutes. This will be administered post arrival to the operating room, prior to induction of anaesthesia, but after the insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter. 

The administration of this trial drug will be electronically logged as per hospital protocol. This will be done regardless of whether the trial drug contains paracetamol as the trial is double-blinded and all research staff will be unaware of the contents of the trial drug until the end of the study. This additional safety measure will be in place to ensure there will be no overdose of paracetamol should the trial drug contain paracetamol.

Additional postoperative pain treatment will be administered to patients via patient controlled analgesia as per routine clinical care. </interventions>
    <comparator> Normal saline 0.9% is an intravenous fluid solution that provides maintenance and replacement of deficits of extracellular fluid. It is commonly used throughout the world as an infusion proving water for hydration for patients undergoing major surgery.

In this trial, one dose of 100mL IV Normal Saline 0.9%  will be administered over 15 minutes. This will be administered post arrival to the operating room, prior to induction of anaesthesia, but after the insertion of the pulmonary artery catheter. 

The administration of this trial drug will be electronically logged as per hospital protocol. This will be done regardless of whether the trial drug contains paracetamol as the trial is double-blinded and all research staff will be unaware of the contents of the trial drug until the end of the study.

    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit 24 patients in total, 12 patients in the paracetamol group and 12 patients in the control group. This is in keeping with realistic power calculations used in other studies evaluating the haemodynamic effects of IV paracetamol in patients undergoing major surgery.

Sample size for the study was calculated based on our pilot data evaluating patients undergoing cardiac surgery at Austin hospital. With an average blood pressure of 110mmHg, and a SD of 10 mmHg, if we were to demonstrate a mean difference between the paracetamol group and control group of 10mmHg, with a power value of 90%, we require a minimum of 11 patients to be recruited into each group. We will therefore recruit 12 patients in each arm, a total of 24 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Intravenous paracetamol is ubiquitously used in hospitals as an antipyretic and analgesic worldwide. It is administered to a wide array of patients including those undergoing major surgeries due to its minimal side effect profile. Previous studies have suggested that 4g/day paracetamol is safe in patients undergoing liver resection surgery, however other authorities recommend that administration be kept at a maximum of 2g/day in patients with hepatic impairment. 

There is now a growing body of evidence that supports the safety of paracetamol use even in patients with liver disease. However, there are no studies to date that have investigated the haemodynamic effects of paracetamol in patients with chronic liver disease. Recent studies have provided evidence that paracetamol may cause hypotension in critically ill patients, which may have important clinical implications for patients undergoing major surgery. 

The mechanism for this hypotension is unknown but may be attributable to one the stabilizing compounds found in the formulation, mannitol. Mannitol is a known diuretic and even in small quantities can cause episodes of transient hypotension. There is insufficient evidence evaluating the use of paracetamol in the setting of liver transplantation, and importantly there are no pharmacokinetic studies that evaluate safety and efficacy in this setting. 

Hypothesis: A single dose of paracetamol (1g IV) has adverse effects on blood pressure in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing liver transplantation surgery. 

Study aims: To determine whether paracetamol has any adverse haemodynamic effects in patients with chronic liver disease who are undegoing liver transplantation.</summary>
