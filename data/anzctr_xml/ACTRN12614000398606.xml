  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound Guided Injection techniques:

Corticosteroid injection
The Common extensor tendon is assessed with ultrasound for tear and tendinopathy and if required the skin is marked with a texta over the abnormal area. The skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine wash. With Ultrasound guidance, using a 25 g needle the CEO tendon substance and superficial surface is infiltrated with 3ml of 0.5% Xylocaine.  
With a second 25 g needle and syringe, 1 ml Celestone chronodose and 1ml of Marcaine is inject with ultrasound guidance into the abnormal tendon substance and also along the superficial tendon surface.


Autologous Blood Injection (ABI)
The Common extensor tendon was assessed with ultrasound for tear and tendinopathy and if required the skin was marked with a texta over the abnormal area.
The skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine wash.
Using Ultrasound guidance a 25 g needle is inserted and 3ml of 0.5% Xylocaine is injected into the abnormal area and superficial to the tendon. Multiple dry needling punctures of the tendon are performed at this time to cause local bleeding.
3 ml of autologous blood is drawn from a cubital fossa vein of the other elbow.
This blood is mixed with 1ml of Marcaine and injected into the tendon with ultrasound guidance via a second 25 g needle and syringe targeting the abnormal area.

Sclerosant Injection
The Common extensor tendon is assessed with ultrasound for tear and tendinopathy.
The distribution of neovascularity is assessed. The neovascularity arises medial to the CEO from the radial collateral branch of the profunda artery and radial recurrent artery. The neovascularity then courses from medial to lateral superficial to the CEO. The sites of neovascularity are marked on the skin with a texta.
The skin is prepared with a chlorhexidine wash.

With ultrasound guidance between 2-4ml of Polidocanol is injected via a 25 g needle into the neovascularity superficial to the tendon. The neovacularity is targeted from lateral to medial back to the normal artery.  
Care is taken to inject the only the neovascularity outside the tendon. Polidocanol is not injected into the tendon substance and also is not injected too superficially to avoid causing skin necrosis.

In the sclerosant and ABI groups, injections are repeated at four weeks.

Physiotherapy Protocol: All participants will be given an information sheet outlining activity modification and taught a home eccentric exercise program. </interventions>
    <comparator>This trial is comparing the 3 ultrasound guided injections, Corticosteroid, Autologous blood and Polidocanol (sclerosant) injections. As Corticosteroid has been in use for longer and has most high quality research, it could be viewed as the comparator treatment (but not as a control). </comparator>

      <outcome>Pain free grip force will be measured with a hand-held dynamometer in triplicate, with mean scores used in analysis. The participant will grip the dynamometer stopping at the first moment elbow pain is experienced.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria is the presence of lateral elbow pain, which was exacerbated by activities involving wrist extension and gripping, as reported by the patient, as well as a clinical diagnosis of tennis elbow, which included elbow pain on resisted wrist and/or middle finger extension and tenderness in the area of the lateral epicondyle for more than two months.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria is elbow pain for less than two months, limitation of movement with passive forearm pronation, supination, flexion and/or extension that may indicate radioulnar joint synovitis or osteoarthritis, upper limb neurological symptoms or signs that may indicate cervical radiculopathy, and corticosteroid injection, autologous blood or scleosant injection to the common extensor tendon within the previous three months.

Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria above, will be referred for power Doppler ultrasound investigation.
Participants without evidence of neovascularisation on power ultrasound will be excluded from further participation in the study.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited from the greater Melbourne region of Australia, with a provisional diagnosis of unilateral tennis elbow. Patients can be referred to the study from General Practitioners, physios and other sports physicians. 
They may also be self-referred after reading advertising in the local paper regarding the study.
Patients will be phone screened and screened by the study sports physician registrars before final entry. Participants with neovascularisation will be randomised via concealed allocation into one of three groups to receive either ultrasound guided corticosteroid, autologous blood or sclerosant injection. A trial nurse who is not deciding eligibility will be responsible for allocation as below.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated through drawing of lots from a box (blinded) in order of presentation by the trial nurse.</sequence>
