      <outcome>progression free survival - To assess the anti-tumor activity of BGJ398 for patients with GBM and/or other glioma subtypes that harbor FGFR1-TACC1, FGFR3-TACC3 fusion and/or activating mutation in FGFR1, 2 or 3 based on PFS6 (PFS rate at 6 months as defined by RANO criteria as assessed by the investigator)</outcome>
