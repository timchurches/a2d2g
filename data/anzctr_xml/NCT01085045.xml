  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate, after 1 week of dosing, the efficacy and safety of
      PT003 compared with its individual components (PT001 and PT005), placebo and two active
      comparators to demonstrate superiority of the combination to its components, and to assess
      the relative contribution of the components compared with placebo, in patients with moderate
      to very severe COPD.</summary>
