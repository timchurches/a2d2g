  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be exposed to High Colour Temperature Light (HCT; 17,000K, 200 lux) administered using Philips EnergyLight HF3309 lamps or a panel of Light Emitting Diodes.

Participants will visit a light controlled, sound attenuated, temperature controlled laboratory from 6:00pm to 8:30am. Exposure to the light will occur in one intervention from 11:00pm to 7:00am. During the light exposure participants will be required to stay awake and complete computer or paper based assessments of their mood and performance, while seated. The rest of the time participants will be allowed to do quiet tasks such as reading, puzzles or card games.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomized into the control condition will be exposed to Low Colour Temperature Light (LCT; 4,000K, 200 lux). 

This light condition is the equivalent of standard lighting conditions and is not expected to have any treatment value. 

Participants will visit a light controlled, sound attenuated, temperature controlled laboratory from 6:00pm to 8:30am. Exposure to the light will occur in one intervention from 11:00pm to 7:00am. During the light exposure participants will be required to stay awake and complete computer or paper based assessments of their mood and performance, while seated. The rest of the time participants will be allowed to do quiet tasks such as reading, puzzles or card games.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to investigate the efficacy of short wavelength enriched light exposure as a therapeutic intervention for the adverse neurobehavioural consequences of sleep loss and circadian rhythm disruption in night shift workers, and to examine retrospectively whether individual differences in responsiveness to light can be predicted by circadian phase estimates and genetic differences.

The study will be carried out at three different sites, these include (1) Monash University, (2) The University of Sydney and (3) University of South Australia.</summary>
