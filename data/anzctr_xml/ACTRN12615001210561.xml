    <interventions>Motivational interviewing, comprising two 30-50min individual sessions, as a prelude to attendance at a stopping violence group programme.

The sessions will be provided by a registered clinical psychologist, registered nurse, and a social worker.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to explore the data. Although this is a small pilot study inferential analysis is appropriate given the power and effect size calculations.  A power calculation suggests that this study has 80.0% power to detect an effect size of 0.221.  An independent groups t-test will be used to detect the treatment difference between groups. Results from hypothesis testing will be treated as preliminary and interpreted with caution.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing  (MI) as a brief (2 sessions) pre-treatment intervention, to enhance treatment engagement in a group stopping violence programme for men who have been mandated to attend. It is hypothesised that MI will be effective as a pre-treatment intervention leading to enhanced engagement of mandated  clients in the stopping violence groups.
