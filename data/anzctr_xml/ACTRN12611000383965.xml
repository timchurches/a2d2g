    <interventions>Subjects (300 children &lt;3y undergoing grommet insertion)Collection of Middle Ear Fluid (at time of grommet insertion)
Collection of Nasopharyngeal Swab (at time of Grommet insertion)

Comparison Group (150 children &lt;3y undergoing elective surgery who on parental history have no significant history of ear disease)
Collection of Nasopharyngeal Swab (at time of general anaesthetic for non-ear related surgery)

Parental Questionnaire - administered to both subjects and comarison group on the day of surgery

This study will be performed as two Phases (Each phase as described above, under two different vaccination schedules):
Phase One: Starting April 2011, completion by Dec 31st 2011 (with possible extension to March 31st 2012 if target of 300 subjects not yet recruited). This will capture children vaccinated under the current PCV7 (7 valent pneumococcal vaccination) schedule.
Phase Two: Starting April 2013, completion Dec 2013 (with possible extension to March 2014 if target of 300 subjects not yet recruited). This will capture children vaccinated under the new schedule with PCV10 (10 valent pneumococcal vaccination) schedule.

Both Phases of the study will be performed in 3 centres:
- Starship Childrens Hospital ADHB (Auckland)
- Counties Manukau DHB (South Auckland)
- Canterbury DHB (Christchurch)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe infectious agents of Otitis Media in the middle ear of children under 3 years old</outcome>
      <timepoint>Middle ear sample will be collected at time of grommet insertion

Middle ear effusion will be diluted in approximately 1ml of sterile saline. The diluted middle ear effusion sample will be immediately transported to the participating laboratories. 

The participating laboratory will immediately briefly Vortex sample (mix by centrifuge) then divide sample by sterile pipette. One portion of middle ear fluid sample will be immediately stored neat at -70degrees celsius for future molecular work. Stored fluid will be sent to Christchurch laboratory for detection of otopathogens by polymerase chain detection for S.pn, H.i and M.cat. For S.pn we will use an established PCR assay targeting the pneumolysin gene to detect all serotypes. 

The second portion of sample will be cultured immediately using routine bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility techniques optimised for the detection of upper respiratory tract pathogens. Middle ear fluid will be cultured onto horse blood agar, chocolate agar and selective media for Spn (colistin nalidixic acid agar). After 24-48 hours of incubation (at 35?C in 5% CO2 for S.pn) colonies would be identified visually via colony morphology and haemolysis. Typical draughtsmen colonies with alpha haemolysis were further confirmed by sensitivity to optochin for S.pn and with X and V factor testing for Haemophilus influenzae in accordance with current laboratory methods.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing would be performed by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Paper discs impregnated with antibiotic are placed onto lawn culture then incubated with precise measurement of the zone of inhibition surrounding each disc 

and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) interpretive breakpoints were determined. 
Pure isolates of pathogens (S.pn, Mcat and H.i) would be stored in Cryobroth (Fort Richard Laboratory Ltd) at -70C for 6-12 months. All viable S.pn isolates would be sent to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), Wellington NZ for serotyping via the Quellung reaction.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the nasopharyngeal carriage rates of known otopathogens in children with a history of otitis media and compare this group with children without a history of otitis media</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected at the time of grommet insertion (300 cases) or non-ear related surgery (150 in comparison group) for both phases.

The swabs will be cultured immediately using routine bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility techniques optimised for the detection of upper respiratory tract pathogens. Middle ear fluid will be cultured onto horse blood agar, chocolate agar and selective media for Spn (colistin nalidixic acid agar). After 24-48 hours of incubation (at 35?C in 5% CO2 for S.pn) colonies would be identified visually via colony morphology and haemolysis. Typical draughtsmen colonies with alpha haemolysis were further confirmed by sensitivity to optochin for S.pn and with X and V factor testing for Haemophilus influenzae in accordance with current laboratory methods.

The results from each group will be analysed and compared by the study group statistician.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of vaccine related and non-vaccine related S.pneumoniae serotypes and H.influenzae isolated from middle ear samples and their antibiotic sensitivities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Samples will be collected at the time of grommet insertion

See methods as described in Primary outcome methodology.

This data will be particularly interesting when comparing Phase One (PCV7 vaccinated children) with Phase Two (PCV10 Vaccinated Children).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of middle ear isolates from children with otitis prone conditions that are PCR positive for known otopathogens</outcome>
      <timepoint>Samples will be collected at the time of grommet insertion

See methods as described in Primary outcome methodology.

An analysis will be made between the culture positive results from the middle ear samples and the PCR positive results. 

We will compare out results with a similar study that has been performed in Western Australia.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to describe infectious agents of rAOM and OME in the middle ear of children with a history of rAOM or OME requiring insertion of tympanostomy tubes. We also aim to describe the nasopharyngeal carriage rates of known otopathogens in children with a history of otitis media. We will run the study as two phases: 300 children who have been vaccinated under the current PCV7 schedule, and to repeat the study after introduction of the PCV10 vaccination (starting collection in 2013)</summary>
