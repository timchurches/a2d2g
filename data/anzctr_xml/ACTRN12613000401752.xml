  <interventions>
    <interventions>A meta- analysis assessing the effects of dietary interventions to increase dairy intake for at least one  one month- all randomised control studies with dairy as intervention that reported any of the outcome measures in healthy populations was eligible. All databases (science direct, Google, Chochrane database, medline) will be searched. Exclusion are if population has cardiovascular disease or diabetes, or if multiple interventions used (e.g. dairy with caloric restriction). All studies reported from 1990 to 2013 will b eligible</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Randomised studies with increased dairy for at least 4 weeks without other major concomitant interventions (e.g. caloric restriction, multiple dietary interventions.), have an appropriate control group without this dietary intervention, and sufficient data to calculate estimates of effect with standard deviations on weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers.  </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Studies are excluded if they were observational or otherwise non-randomized; were commentaries, reviews, or duplicate publications from the same study. We are restricting to studies in healthy adults who did not have diabetes, hypertension or vascular disease. We include both feeding trials and trials that utilized dietary advice; for both designs, the average change in dairy consumption was assessed. </exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Cases will be compared only with controls within the same study. For those studies with 3 treatment groups,   comparison will be made with control and the high dairy group. Differences by dietary intervention are calculated as weighted mean difference divided by variance, expressed as a sample weighted mean effect size (95% confidence interval). A test for homogeneity will  be performed for each cardio metabolic risk evaluated.  Stratified analysis will be performed if there is enough data</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This meta analysis is evaluating the effects of increasing dairy intake on a number of risk factors for heart disease; blood pressure, cholesterol, waist circumference, weight and insulin resistance. All randomised studies that have increasing dairy as an intervention wil be assessed. An analysis will be done to see if dairy does indeed have any effect on the risk of heart disease</summary>
