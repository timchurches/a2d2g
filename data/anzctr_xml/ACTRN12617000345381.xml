  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will have an intravenous cannula placed for the treatment intervention. Pain or discomfort at the injection site is a recognised common side effect of propofol upon initial injection.  Therefore as is common clinical practice in the anaesthetic environment, all intravenous cannula sites will be pre-treated with a single dose of 25mg or 2.5mL of intravenous lignocaine 1% to mitigate injection site discomfort secondary to propofol and to optimise patient comfort.  Subsequently participants will receive the lesser dose of either 120mg or 2mg/kg (rounded to the nearest ten) of propofol.  This means that participants weighing more than 55kg will receive 120mg of propofol and that participants weighing less than 55kg will receive an adjusted reduced dose of propofol.  All doses of propofol will be infused over the same time period of 40 minutes and will be a single dose only.  This calculates to no greater than 15mg or 1.5mL of propofol every 5 minutes.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The first primary outcome is to measure the effect that a continuous infusion of no greater than 120mg of propofol over 40 minutes has on refractory migraine-like headaches and associated symptoms (composite). The outcome will be measured using an average 100mm visually aided scale (VAS) as well as associated symptoms of interest, including unilateral headache, pulsatile sensation, moderate or severe pain, avoidance of physical activity, nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The scoring of headache pain utilizing a 100mm VAS will be recorded upon commencement of the infusion and at regular intervals of 20, 40 and 60 minutes. The presence or absence of  associated symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, photophobia etc.) will be recorded at the same time points.  Headache pain will also be recorded at 24 and 48 hours in a follow-up phone call with each participant and will also inquire if the patient has returned to baseline function for routine daily activities.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second primary outcome is the proportion of patients that score no greater than 4 on the Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) and no less than 13 on the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS).  The bedside research nurse providing continuous observation and recording interval data sets should at no time for medical reasons be required to touch the participant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Both the RSS and GCS will be recorded at regular intervals from the commencement of the infusion at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The third primary outcome is measurement of any adverse outcomes or derangement of vital signs requiring intervention using continuous observation and interval data sets. Tests comprise continuous monitoring of participant heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and end tidal CO2.  Blood pressure will be recorded at regular intervals.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There will be continuous monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and end tidal CO2 for the duration of the 40 minute infusion.  These vital signs will be recorded at regular intervals along with blood pressure from the commencement of the infusion at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.  Any of these continuously monitored vital signs that fall outside of a specified range will be recorded at that point in time as an adverse event.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome measure will be overall length of stay in the emergency department. This will be assessed using the time recorded at triage to time recorded at patient discharge point, which is logged on the Emergency Department Information System (EDIS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Length of stay from time of triage to discharge time will be compared to the average length of stay for headaches not requiring medical work-up in the preceding 6 months.  The lengths of stay for this treatment will understandably be artificially lengthened given the requirement for recruitment and extended consent.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Headache is a common reason why patients present to the hospital emergency department. Often patients are presenting to hospital for the simple reason that they are experiencing a headache that is not responding to commonly available medications used to get rid of headaches. Unfortunately there is not good evidence to support which available hospital medications consistently offer effective pain relief to individuals with these types of refractory headache. Understandably this is a challenging scenario in
the emergency department setting for both the patient and physician that often leads to inadequate or unsatisfactory symptom relief.

However a few small trials to date have shown promising evidence that the medication propofol is potentially an effective, safe and quick treatment alternative for stubborn headaches. It is important to note that propofol is not a new medication and is routinely used on a daily basis throughout hospitals for both general anaesthesia and procedural sedation. It is the intention of this research project to demonstrate that infusing a low dose of this medication over a relatively short period of time is an effective new use for a familiar and already commonly utilised medication.  

This has the potential to introduce a new safe and effective treatment option for stubborn headaches that can significantly reduce treatment times by rapidly restoring patients to baseline levels of function and
comfort. Furthermore it reduces overall lengths of stay in the emergency department and contributes to overall improved emergency department patient flow.</summary>
