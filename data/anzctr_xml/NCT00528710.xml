  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fundamentally, the trial aims to conduct a gold-standard test of the clinical impact of SAM-e
      in the treatment of depressed mood and general symptoms of fibromyalgia (FMS).

      As such, salient clinical and pathological parameters will be assessed over an 8-week period
      in 60 patients who will be provided with either SAM-e or a placebo preparation . On the basis
      of previous literature, it is hypothesised that patients in the active treatment group will
      experience moderate but significant improvements across the clinical measures, and that these
      gains will be significantly greater than any reported in the placebo group. All patients will
      provide informed consent. All procedures will be conducted under medical supervision and the
      preparation itself is very safe when used in the manner proposed for the trial</summary>
