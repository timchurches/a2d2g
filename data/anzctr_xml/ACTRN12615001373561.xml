  <interventions>
    <interventions>A certified Yoga instructor taught the respondents the three breathing techniques and the training were done in a group, they attended one session for around 30 to 40 minutes for each one participant. The respondents were divided into four groups; two groups for those who come for dialysis on Monday, Wednesday and Friday another two groups for those who come for dialysis on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The overall duration of the intervention period it will be 8 weeks.
The respondents were gathered in the waiting room in the dialysis center to learn breathing exercise. It was easy to gather them because dialysis patients usually come early for dialysis. The training was done prior to their dialysis session. The respondents were taught a holistic breathing technique which consist of three techniques. First technique is respondents have to focus on their natural breathing with the goal of maintaining continuity of awareness, second technique is "Ujjayi" or "Victorious Breath" Emphasizing simple, long-exhalation breathing, with a focus on slow, even exhalation approximately two times longer than the inhalation. The third technique is alternate nostril breathing, "nadi shodhana"; this technique involved moving air through alternate nostrils. The Participants were told to practice all the three breathing techniques in an order that they please for 20 minutes each dialysis section.
The strategies used to monitor adherence to the intervention is participant diary activities during dialysis sections.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All patient undergoing chronic hemodialysis treatment, dialyzing via permanent vascular access such as arteriovenous fistula, graft and permanent catheter were included for the study. The age limit was 18 years and above for the purpose of consent. Patient should have dialysis adequacy (kt/v) of more than 1.0 this is to ensure that patient is adequately dialyzed. Therefore the patients should be dialyzed regularly for more than 6 months to ensure the availability of dialysis adequacy (kt/v) result. Patient should have blood pressure within normal range and Hb above 10gm/dl.</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>ABSTRACT
Aim: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of breathing exercise on dialysis related symptoms among chronic hemodialysis patients. 
Method: The study design was a pre and post-test single group quasi-experiment. A non-probability convenient sampling method was used to recruit respondents.
Intervention: A total of 47 respondents were enrolled for the study and received training for breathing exercise. Breathing exercise was performed for around 30 to 40 minutes for each one participant. "Dialysis Symptom Index" was used to measure the frequency   and   severity of dialysis related symptoms pre and post intervention. Descriptive statistic was used to describe the demographic characteristic. Univariate analysis of variance test was used to determine association between demographic variable and symptom burden and its severity. A non-parametric test was used to compare the changes in symptom burden and symptom severity after the intervention.
Results: In this study, there is significant reduction in symptom burden and severity post intervention. Hence breathing exercise reduced the symptom burden and severity of dialysis related symptom among the respondents. 
Conclusions: It was determined that breathing exercise had positive effect on dialysis related symptom and it's severity which are suffered too often and effect the patient quality of life. 
Relevance of the study: This study is worthy of interest as it has revealed that breathing exercise which have been proven to be effective in different areas are also important, and practical complementary approaches that are effective in getting dialysis related symptoms and it's severity under control. Breathing exercise program, can be practiced irrespective of time, place and without any cost and improve patients well being.</summary>
