  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants will be randomised to 4 weeks of CPAP with Conventional Humidification (CH) or 4 weeks of CPAP with ThermoSmart Humidification. Once completed participants will be swapped to the alternate treatment arm.
Sleep Quality via Actigraphy - designed to measure rest/activity cycles continuously throughout the 24-hr day. The instrument provides reliable and valid data regarding a number of sleep-related parameters, including Total Sleep Time (TST), (awake time spent awake after sleep onset (WASO) and Sleep Efficicney (SE)
A 7 day period of actigraphy will be completed in the 7 days leading up to the participants first treatment.  
For the first week (7 days) of each arm actigraph data will be collected. Both trial administrator and subjects will be blinded. the devices are identical looking and neither administrator  nor subject will know which is which.</summary>
