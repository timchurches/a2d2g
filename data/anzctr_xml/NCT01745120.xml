  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a non-randomized, open label, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 1/2 study in up to 18
      subjects (including at least 3 adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age, inclusive) with
      beta-thalassemia major. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin® BB305 Drug Product
      [autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced with LentiGlobin® BB305 Lentiviral
      Vector encoding the human ß-A(T87Q)-globin gene].</summary>
