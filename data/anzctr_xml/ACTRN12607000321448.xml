  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this 18-month randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is to establish whether vitamin D supplementation can delay progression of cognitive decline amongst older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) who have low vitamin D concentrations (between 12.5 and 50 nmol/L). 
The main hypothesis of this study is that older adults with MCI randomised to a 18-month treatment with vitamin D will experience significantly less cognitive decline (as measured with the CAMCOG) at the end of the 18-months follow-up than subjects with MCI randomised to placebo. Secondary outcomes of interest for this study include quality of life, gait, balance and muscle strength.</summary>
