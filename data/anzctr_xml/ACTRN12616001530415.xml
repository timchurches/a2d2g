  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participant will attend the NZCIH clinic and complete the following in the order listed below on Day 1. The participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions as needed. 
Informed Consent Form (signature required)	
1. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)
2. The Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWB-S)-1
3. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D21)
4. Brief History Record
5. Medication Usage Log
6. Sleep Questionnaire

The participant will then undertake a one hour clinical assessment with the Research Clinical Psychologist whereby all assessment tools will be evaluated and the Clinical Psychologist determines the participants suitability for enrollment.

Treatment Days: 1-4 and 6-9

Within seven (7) days of enrolment participants will attend the clinic for treatment each day for ten (10) days (5 days on, 2 days off, 5 days on) for 50mins each session. Treatments will be conducted at the same time of day, throughout the Treatment Period. This is the same for all two Treatment Arms - device types: 15mA and placebo.  

The TESA-HB is a Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator (CES) device manufactured by Annecto Ltd.  This device delivers a micro-current with a proprietary waveform for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

The TESA-HB Device delivers a modified bipolar high frequency (65-100kHz) low milliamp (15 mA) alternating current (AC) signal  monopolar  and bipolar modulated at 76-79Hz. During process of bipolar modulation polarity of waveform will be changed every 7 minutes. 

The device delivers a current to electrodes that are placed sagitally on the participants skin behind each ear over the mastoid area, on neck and on the forehead. 

Participants who do not complete, or are unable to complete, their entire two weeks of therapy, or who miss more than 2 treatment days will not be included in the per-protocol (PP) analysis. These participants will continue to be followed in the study, but will be classified in the intent-to-treat (ITT) group.

</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will be randomised to one of the two different arms, 50 participants in each group:
1.  Treatment Arm A = 15mA TESA-HB Device
2.  Treatment Arm B = Placebo Device
The front display of the arm B device will be absolutely identical to the front display of the arm A device and shows a digital read out of the treatment time.  In contrast to the devices for arm A, devices for arm B will not deliver any current to participants.  For both groups electrodes are applied to the skin surface: one to the forehead, one to neck and one behind each ear on the mastoid area.  As there is no sensation by the electrodes the double blind method will not be compromised. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Recruitment of 100 participants was based on a trial Effects of music therapy on pain and anxiety in patients undergoing bone marrow biopsy and aspiration whereby they evaluated the effectiveness of music therapy interventions on pain and anxiety control for 100 patients.

The HAM-A is scored independently based on a five-point, ratio scale. A rating of 0 indicates that the feeling is not present in the patient. A rating of 1 indicates mild prevalence of the feeling in the patient. A rating of 2 indicates moderate prevalence of the feeling in the patient. A rating of 3 indicates severe prevalence of the feeling in the patient. A rating of 4 indicates a very severe prevalence of the feeling in the patient. The Clinical Psychologist proceeds through the fourteen items, evaluating each criterion independently in form of the five-point scale described above. A total of the composite score based upon the summation of each of the 14 individually rated items will be completed. This calculation will yield a comprehensive score in the range of 0 to 56. A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. Lastly, a score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity.

The Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWB-S) twenty-two items of the questionnaire will be analysed in a linear multiple regression model. A score transformation will be applied to convert the lowest and highest possible scores to 0 (worst possible level of well-being) and 110 (maximum level of well being), respectively.

The HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe.  Nine are scored from 0-2. The sum of the scores from the first 17 items will apply within the following: 0-7 = Normal, 8-13 = Mild Depression, 14-18 = Moderate Depression, 19-22 = Severe Depression, = 23 = Very Severe Depression.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anxiety is a major health problem worldwide and the lifetime prevalence in New Zealand is approximately 25%. The key features of anxiety are uncontrollable, persistent and excessive nervousness and worry across specific or all settings, and relate to the anticipation of a future threat. The recent NZ Mental Health Survey, September 2016, showed mental disorder is common in New Zealand: 46.6% of the population are predicted to meet criteria for a disorder at some time in their lives, with 39.5% having already done so and 20.7% having a disorder in the past 12 months. 
According to the Health Loss in New Zealand study, anxiety and depressive disorders are the second leading cause of health loss for New Zealanders, accounting for 5.3% of all health loss, behind only coronary heart disease (9.3%). Anxiety has detrimental effects, some lasting many years and left untreated, anxiety limits an individuals daily functioning, often avoiding many aspects of life in an attempt to cope with, and relieve, the anxiety. Several medical devices using microcurrent levels of electrical stimulation have been approved for use in the area of anxiety, however the most effective waveform, current and application process, has not been determined.
The TESA-HB Device ANNECTO LLC is a transcranial electronic stimulation device delivers a modified bipolar high frequency low milliamp (15mA) alternating current (AC) modulated at 76-79Hz applied cranially through four external electrodes and is intended for the long-term reduction of pain. It is hypothesised that the TESA-HB Technology could also help to decrease depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

Researchers have noted that transcranial electronic stimulation applied within quasi resonance, resulted in stimulation and activation of the antinociceptive system with its endorphinergic and serotoninergic mechanisms.

The purpose of this work is to determine the effectiveness of the TESA-HB in reducing the symptoms of anxiety in people with mild to moderate episodes.  The specific aims of the project are to determine the effect of 10 days of TESA-HB treatment on psychological general well-being, quality of sleep, quantity of sleep, quality of life, and anxiety score.
100 participants (18-65 years) will be recruited from the Tauranga area.  The criteria for inclusion is a level of anxiety estimated from the Hamilton A (HAM-A) Rating Scale which categorises mild to moderate (18-24), or moderate to severe (25-30).
The participant will attend the NZCIH clinic and complete questionnaires on Day 1. The participant will be given the opportunity to ask questions as needed. The participant will then undertake a one hour clinical assessment with the Research Clinical Psychologist whereby all assessment tools will be evaluated and the Clinical Psychologist determines the participants suitability for enrolment.

Within seven (7) days of enrolment participants will attend the clinic for treatment each day for ten (10) days (5 days on, 2 days off, 5 days on) for 50mins each session. Treatments will be conducted at the same time of day, throughout the Treatment Period. This is the same for all two Treatment Arms - device types: 15mA and placebo.  

The device delivers a current to electrodes that are placed sagitally on the participants skin behind each ear over the mastoid area, on neck and on the forehead. 

Participants will return to the Clinic for follow up evaluations at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after completion of the last treatment.
