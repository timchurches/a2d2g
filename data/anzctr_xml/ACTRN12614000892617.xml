  <interventions>
    <interventions>Regular monitoring  and goal setting using feedback on physical activity levels provided via an activity monitor device.  Participants in the intervention group will wear a SenseWear armband and the SenseWear display monitor during waking hours (approximately 16 hours per day). The display unit will provide information about the participant's level of activity throughout the day.  This information will be used by the physiotherapist and the participant to set individual daily and weekly activity targets. This will be done in the participants usual physiotherapy sessions.  Participants in these wards typically recieve physiotherapy once or twice a day on weekdays.  Sessions can be delivered on an individual basis or group basis, as is usual practice.  Where appropriate, family members are invited to attend physiotherapy sessions if they are able.  The length of the physiotherapy sessions will be determined by the treating physiotherapist, as per usual practice, however physiotherapists will be required to record the amount of time spent in physiotherapy sessions.  Physiotherapists will educate participants, other staff and their families about the information provided on the display unit, so they can monitor progress towards goals.  Techniques such as graphing progress towards activity goals will be used to increase the patients motivation and adherence towards achieving these goals.  The intervention will cease either when the participant is discharged from rehabilitation or after a period of 3 weeks (which ever occurs first). </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive standard care, which includes treatment by a multidisciplinary team including physiotherapy.  Participants in these wards typically recieve physiotherapy once or twice a day on weekdays.  Sessions can be delivered on an individual basis or group basis, as is usual practice.  Where appropriate, family members are invited to attend physiotherapy sessions if they are able.  The length of the physiotherapy sessions will be determined by the treating physiotherapist, as per usual practice, however physiotherapists will be required to record the amount of time spent in physiotherapy sessions.Participants in the control group will have activity monitored using the SenseWear Armband. They will not be provided with a SenseWear Display Unit, and will not be provided with any  feedback on physical activity levels</comparator>

      <outcome>Feasibility of delivering intervention
1) Proportion of patients with weekly activity goals (target 100%).  Physiotherapists will document weekly goals on  a 'goal setting' form.  Each participant will have their own goal setting form.  When the participant has completed the intervention phase of the study, these forms will be collected.  
 2) Appropriateness of activity goals, determined by goals being met  80% of the time.  Data from the SenseWear activity monitor will be compared with the weekly goal.  If the goal is met/ exceeded it will be classified as 'met'.  If the goal is not met, it will be classified as 'not met'.  A target of 80% has been set based on clinical experience, in that acheiving a goal 100% of the time suggests the goals were not challenging enough.  </outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible for inclusion, participants must:
* Be admitted to Mellor ward (Royal Talbot), ward 11 or 12 (Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital)
* Be aged over 18,
* have as a goal of admission improve upright mobility or improve walking, as determined by either the admission referral or the treating therapist.
* Have an anticipated length of stay greater than one week. People with very short length of stays may not have sufficient time to modify activity based on feedback. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if 
* the primary reason for admission is to await placement in residential care or primarily for carer training,
* they have been identified as not requiring  physiotherapy on admission,  
* there are medical restrictions on mobilization or activity (e.g. non weight bearing).
* The mobility goals are non-weight bearing goals (eg goal is to improve bed mobility/ slide board transfers)
* They are involved in another interventional study
* They have had a lower limb amputation.  Upright mobility for this group is often dependent on factors such as wound healing and prosthesis fit.  
* Are cognitively impaired or unable to give consent. Part of the intervention involves working with the participant to set and achieve goals.  This would be difficult for participants who are cognitively impaired.
* They have an anticipated LOS of less than a week.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients admitted for rehabilitation to either Mellor ward at Royal Talbot Rehabilitation Centre or wards 11 and 12 at the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital will be eligible for recruitment.  Patients admitted to these wards are medically stable, but may have chronic or complex health conditions that require treatment and management by a geriatrician or rehabilitation physician and multidisciplinary team, and require a period of rehabilitation to maximise physical function.  A cap of six participants can be in the trial at any one time, as only six armbands are available.

It is not possible to blind either participants or treating therapists to group allocation.  Clinical data will be collected by the treating therapists.   The activity data will be processed and entered by a research assistant who is blind to group assignment.  Dr Blennerhassett and Mr Smith are likely to be unblinded as they will be working closely with clinicians during the intervention phase.  Mr Smith may also be treating participants in the trial.  Dr Said will remain blinded to group assignment and will be responsible for analysis of data.  </concealment>
    <sequence>A blocked stratified randomisation procedure, based on functional level, will be used to allocate participants to either the intervention group, (activity feedback), or a control group (no feedback).  Participants will be divided into two categories based on functional level; nonambulant and ambulant.  Nonambulant participants include those who are unable to walk, defined as Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Locomotion score 1.  Ambulant participants include those who are able to walk with assistance of one person, with supervision only or independently (FIM Locomotion scores 2-7).  Randomisation will be computer generated and performed by a third party.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline characteristics will be examined for the intervention and control groups, to determine whether the groups are similar.  Time spent in physiotherapy will also be compared between groups, using either paremetric or non parametric statistics as appropriate.  
To determine whether participants in the intervention group have weekly activity goals identified using data from the Sensewear, the number of weekly goals identified will be calculated and divided by the total number of intervention weeks.
To determine whether the intervention was delivered as intended, the total number of days for which activity goals were met for the intervention group will be calculated and divided by the total number of intervention days.  
Activity data will be examined for normality, and descriptive data calculated for the intervention and control groups using either parametric or nonparametric statistics as appropriate.  Effect size will be calculated and sample size will be estimated for the larger study.  Note that as the study will not be sufficiently powered, tests for significance will not be conducted.  
Feedback from participants and from therapists will be collated and analysed descriptively.  Open ended responses will be examined by the research team to identify any common themes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this pilot project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating whether older people undergoing rehabilitation who receive feedback on activity levels are more active than patients who do not receive feedback.  
One of the main reasons older people are admitted for rehabilitation is to improve their mobility. There is increasing evidence indicating that mobility is improved by increasing physical activity.  However, studies have shown that physical activity levels are very low in people undergoing rehabilitation.  One difficulty for therapists is that to date there has been no way of easily measuring or monitoring activity levels in patients.  It is therefore difficult to know how active a person really is, and whether their activity levels are improving during their rehabilitation stay. There are now devices available that can provide accurate feedback about activity levels, even in people who have very low levels of mobility and activity.  One device is the SenseWear armband, which is the size of a watch and can measure even small changes in activity.  The SenseWear armband has an optional display unit, which provides the person and their therapists with real time feedback about their level of activity.  
Studies in community dwelling groups have shown that feedback about activity levels can be used to improve activity.  However, older people undergoing rehabilitation are typically more frail and dependent on staff to assist them be active.  Hence, it is not known whether providing feedback to older people undergoing rehabilitation will lead to increased activity levels.  
Forty older people admitted for inpatient rehabilitation will be randomly allocated to either receive feedback and develop activity goals based on their activity level (intervention group) or monitoring of activity without feedback (control group).  All participants will wear a Sensewear device for up to 3 weeks while undertaking inpatient rehabilitation. The results of the pilot will be utilised to inform the design and need for a future RCT.  If we find that feedback provided by Sensewear device can promote activity, we shall further investigate if ongoing use can maximise activity level and mobility outcomes and reduce length of stay during inpatient rehabilitation.
