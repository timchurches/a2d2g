  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of
      intravenous Aralast Fraction (Fr.) IV-1, a sterile, stable, lyophilized preparation of
      functionally intact human Alpha1- Proteinase Inhibitor (a1-PI). This pharmacokinetic study
      will be a randomized controlled clinical trial with a cross-over design. Twenty-four subjects
      will be enrolled into the study. Overall study duration will be approximately 6-8 months.</summary>
