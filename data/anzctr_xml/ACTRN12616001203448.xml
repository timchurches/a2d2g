  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients participating in this study will be undergoing total knee replacement and receiving the Apex Total Knee Replacement
A wrist-worn activity tracker device that counts steps and monitors activity over time will be used to measure activity pre and post knee replacement surgery. X-rays and CT will be used to assess implant positioning.
Each participant will be asked to wear the Vivofit device on their wrist from about 5 weeks before your surgery to 6 weeks afterwards. Ten (10) months after surgery, each participant will be contacted again and another Vivofit device will be sent to them to wear for 1 month prior to their 1-year postoperative assessment by their surgeon.
The participant will place the wristband on as soon as they receive it. It should be worn 24 hours a day. It is waterproof so they can swim and shower normally. The internal battery will last for 12 months and after this time  the participant will remove the wrist band, record the dates it was worn on the small envelope and return it to to the investigator using the self-addressed post-paid envelope provided.
Before the operation, the affected knee will be assessed by x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans in accordance with the study protocol. Each participant will also be asked to complete some simple questionnaires (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score, Forgotten Joint Score, Oxford Knee Score and VAS scale) to find out how the condition of their knee affects their life before the operation and after the operation: at 6 weeks and 12 months. Each questionnaire will take only a few minutes to complete.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>As there are no comparators in the primary variable a sample size calculation has been done on the basis of binarisation of the patient group into those in the upper half and lower half of preoperative step count. The KOOS score was selected as an appropriate PROMS measures to determine the sample size from as it has values for the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 10 and a standard deviation of 15 already established. [Roos, E. M. and L. S. Lohmander (2003). "Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS): from joint injury to osteoarthritis." Health Qual Life Outcomes 1: 64.] Using a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20, 72 total samples would be required to detect a minimum clinically important difference between the two subgroups formed.
As the introduction of activity monitoring devices presents an additional risk of data loss to follow up due to misplacement, theft or damage to the devices, losses to follow up are estimated at about 10%, yielding a total enrolment number of 80 patients. Hence, the study will enrol a minimum of 80 patients between three surgeons at one centre. Each participant will receive the Apex Total Knee Replacement system. The aim is to have 72 patients at the end of the study.
All patients receiving an Apex Total Knee Replacement will be invited to participate in this study.
Statistical analysis will be performed using R for Windows software. All data will be assumed to be non-parametric. Statistical significance will be set at p=0.05. Comparison of variables over time will be analysed with Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Comparison of variables between groups will be analysed with Mann Whitney U tests. Linear variables will be summarised by the mean and 95% confidence interval. Categorical variables will be summarised by frequency.
Data monitoring will be reviewed and entered into a clinical database. Export of primary and secondary variable data will be made for the calculation of the indicated t-statistics, their related p-values, and graphical summaries.
Analysis will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis and a per protocol basis for the primary and secondary endpoints. Patients missing the measure of the primary end point will be considered missing in the intent to treat analysis; no inputting of missing data will be conducted for any variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study design: Prospective, single-centre, patient-blinded, non-randomised, clinical study. The study will enrol 80 patients over a 12-month recruitment period between three surgeons.
Objectives: To determine the relationship between ambulation (daily step count) preoperatively/post-operatively and patient reported outcomes after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). To investigate if component alignment affects ambulation and clinical outcomes after TKA. To investigate if post-op ambulation after total knee replacement affects other parameters such as return to work and patient satisfaction. The study will also demonstrate safety, and equivalent clinical outcomes on pain and function to other published data.
Group: Apex Total Knee Replacement (single study group)
Number of subjects to be enrolled: 80 patients will be enrolled into this study.
Medical Devices: The Apex Knee is intended for use as a primary total knee replacement device consisting of a femoral, tibial, tibial bearing and optional patellar component. The Vivofit is an activity tracker, a wrist-worn band that counts steps and monitors active time.
Regulatory status: The Apex Knee is CE marked, TGA approved and has a rebate code on the Prostheses List.
Clinical evaluations: Standard, functional parameters will be assessed pre-operatively, and post-operatively at 6 weeks, and 12 months.
Patient outcome assessments: The Oxford Knee Score, The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score (KOOS), Forgotten Joint Score and VAS satisfaction scale will be assessed pre-operatively, and post-operatively at 6 weeks, and 12 months.
Radiographic evaluations:
X-Rays will be assessed pre-operatively, post-operatively and at 12 months to evaluate femoral and tibial components coronal and saggital orientation.
A CT-Scan will be performed preoperatively and at 6 weeks post-operatively to verify implant positioning axially.
