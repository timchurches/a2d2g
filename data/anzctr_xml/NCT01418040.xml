      <outcome>Implementation of a risk adapted duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy - Radiotherapy to commence when the first of the following triggers occurs:[44]
PSA&lt;0.5 ng/L
PSA plateau: Defined as a decrease between 2 PSAs taken at least 10 weeks apart of greater than 50%. This definition includes no change, and any increase in PSA observed. For example, if the PSA decreased from 10 to 2 (ie 80%) between 3 and 6 months, the man should receive a further 3 months of neoadjuvant ADT. Conversely, if the PSA decreased from 5 to 3 (ie 40%) over the same time period, the man should commence radiotherapy.
9 months of ADT delivered.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Implementation of a nomogram based radiotherapy target delineation algorithm - Nomograms have been constructed from large surgical PC cohorts to help define the risk of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement and lymph node involvement based on initial clinical parameters. Trying to treat all patients with the progressively larger treatment volumes required to include these areas would potentially increase toxicity without a high chance of improving efficacy. However, if a threshold risk level of 15-25% were required prior to including each elective target volume, we would aim to apply such treatments to patients most likely to benefit.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single centre prospective observational noninterventional study of men with
      histological confirmed prostate cancer, high risk disease and not positive for metastatic
      disease planned to receive Radiotherapy and 18 months of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT).
      Although ADT improves the chance of cure, it can also have many side effects. One of these is
      bone mineral density loss. When this is advanced, it is called osteoporosis. Men with
      osteoporosis have a higher chance of getting fractures of bones such as the hip and spine.
      Currently, the best way to measure for osteoporosis is to do a bone mineral density scan
      using a DEXA scanner.

      The primary objective of this study is to see if baseline Magnetic Resonance Imager (MRI) and
      a Computer Tomogram (CT) combined with clinical factors predicts which men are at greater
      risk of accelerated ADT induced bone mineral density loss than baseline DEXA scanning alone.
      The data from the patients will be used to construct a model predicting annual rate of bone
      loss based on baseline imaging, clinical and biochemical characteristics.

      Secondary aims for this study are as follows:

        -  Evaluating the feasibility, toxicity (acute and late) and efficacy (5 year biochemical
           control by the Phoenix definition)of multimodality therapy with hypofractionated
           radiotherapy (giving a larger dose of radiotherapy over a shorter time 5½ weeks compared
           with a standard 8 week approach). Although used overseas, this 5½ week regimen has not
           been used widely in Australia, and we would like to see if we gain similar results here
           as have been reported from the US.

        -  Feasibility and efficacy of a risk adapted duration of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.
           Usually, ADT is given for between 19 months before radiotherapy is started but there is
           no agreement as to which duration is best. This trial aims to tailor the duration of ADT
           prior to radiotherapy based on blood PSA test results.

        -  Prognostic value of circulating tumour cells (CTCs). This is a blood test which can
           detect cancer cells in the blood which has been used for patients with metastatic
           cancer. The presence of CTCs in men with prostate cancer correlated with poorer overall
           survival. Potentially, high risk prostate cancer patients with CTCs detected may
           represent a very high risk group and could therefore warrant treatment intensification.

        -  To correlate bone marrow changes on MRI with changes in blood counts and patient
           reported fatigue. Measuring bone marrow may help in predicting not just which patients
           are at risk of losing bone faster but also of becoming anaemic, and suffering fatigue. A
           correlation may better explain some of the toxicities associated with ADT.

        -  Implementation of a nomogram based radiotherapy target delineation algorithm. This trial
           aims to use a decision making tool called a nomogram to help tailor the area to treat in
           a more standard way.</summary>
