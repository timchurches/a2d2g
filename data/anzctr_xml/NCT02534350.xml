      <outcome>Time-Weighted Average Change in log10 Viral Load from Day 1/Baseline Through Day 7 in Participants in the Full Analysis Set - This co-primary endpoint will measure the time-weighted average change in viral load from Day 1/baseline through Day 7 among participants in the Full Analysis Set. The time-weighted average change (DAVG) provides the average viral burden in change from baseline during the time period of interest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 7 days</timepoint>
