  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 - Control Arm: 0.3 ml VMCL Vaccine Untimed, administered via intra-dermal injection. If progression occurs, then addition of oral chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide -100mg tablet) every 3 weeks, until disease regression/progression. Arm 1 therapies are administered on a regular, pre-determined basis per protocol schedule.
Arm 2 - Test Arm: 0.3 ml VMCL vaccine Timed, administered via intra-dermal injection. If progression occurs, then addition of timed oral chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide - 100mg tablet) as dictated by patients immune system cycle profile (approximately 3 weekly), until disease regression/progression.  Arm 2 therapies are co-ordinated with the patient's own immune cycle, as determined by regular blood tests. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was selected to ensure the standard error of the observed response rate was = 0.1 and to permit a satisfactory estimate of response rate. The pilot study design is in accordance with previous literature determining sample size for prediction of larger study testing (Hertzog 2008). The anticipated predicted difference is for an approximate doubling of the CR rate in the test (timed therapy) group, over the control (untimed therapy) group. An early stopping rule according to the method of Gehan (1961) was incorporated with the response rate of interest set at 15%. Descriptive statistics will be generated for response efficacy, toxicity and survival end-points. The median time to progression (TTP) will be estimated using KaplanMeier survival curves (STATA-1). Data between groups will be analysed by t-test or the MannWhitney U-test and Spearmans method will be used for correlations. The log-rank test will be used to compare survival between patients with progressive and SD. Significance will be assumed if P &lt; 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the effect of timed vaccine and chemotherapy delivery in advanced melanoma patients. You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male or female aged 18 years or above who has been diagnosed with advanced melanoma (Stage IV or IIIB/IIIC) that cannot be treated with surgery. Participants in this trial will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. Participants in groups one and two will both receive the VCML vaccine. Group one will receive regular, pre-determined vaccinations whereas Group two will have their vaccination times determined by blood test results. If disease progression occurs, then participants in group one will receive oral chemotherapy treatment on pre-determined dates, whereas participants in group 2 will receive oral chemotherapy at times determined by the results of blood tests. The treatment in group 1 will not be timed in this way. All participants will be assessed on a regular basis for a period of up to 5 years in order to determine whether treatment response and overall survival differ between groups. This will enable us to determine whether the timing of vaccine or chemotherapy administration can improve treatment response. </summary>
