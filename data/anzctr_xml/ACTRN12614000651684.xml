  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Intraocular pressure changes were investigated after the general anesthesia in patients who scheduled for  arthroscopic surgery  in supine position.
The patients have American Society of Anaesthesiologists physical status  (ASA) 1-2.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sugammadex is the intervention of the study. This drug is the first selective relaxant binding agent. In the study, sugammadex  was given  as an intravenous injection and each  patient received only a single dose . The dosage of  Sugammadex is 4mg/kg. Sugammadex was administered at the completion of surgery.

</interventions>
    <comparator>At the completion of surgery, anesthesia was withdrawn and the neuromuscular block was reversed using 4050 micro/kg of neostigmine (intravenous injection) and 15 micro/kg of atropine (intravenous injection). The specific dose of neostigmine was determined according to sufficient ventilation and the presence of airway reflexes.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> To investigate the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, peripheral arterial oxygen saturation).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> To investigate the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on IOP, hemodynamic parameters, and complications after extubation.

Patients aged 1865 years with a risk status of ASA III who underwent arthroscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned into 2 groups. At the end of the surgery, the neuromuscular block was reversed using neostigmine (4050  microg/kg) and atropine (15  microg/kg) in group 1, and sugammadex (4 mg/kg) in group 2. IOP were measured before induction and at 30 sec and 2 and 10 min after extubation. A Tono-Pen XL applanation tonometer (Medtronic Solan, Jacksonville, FL, USA) was used to measure IOP. </summary>
