    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Minimally invasive surfactant therapy
Other interventions - Continuation on CPAP

Active Comparator: Minimally invasive surfactant therapy - Minimally invasive surfactant therapy - delivery of exogenous surfactant to the lung via brief catheterisation of the trachea with an instillation catheter in a preterm infant who is being supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via nasal prongs or mask. Poractant alfa (Curosurf) at a dosage of 200 mg/kg will be administered over 15 - 30 seconds. Total duration of the procedure will be less than 5 minutes, followed by reinstitution of CPAP.

Sham Comparator: Continuation on CPAP - Standard control treatment. After randomisation, infants will receive a sham treatment from a treatment team not engaged in clinical care. This will not involve removal of prongs or discontinuation of CPAP but will require setting up intubation equipment, screening the baby, testing suction unit, repositioning of the baby and changing the baby's monitoring. CPAP will thereafter continue.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Death or physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia - Composite outcome of death by 36 weeks or physiological bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Physiological BPD is assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and is defined as either need for respiratory support (intubation / CPAP / high flow nasal cannula &gt; 2 L/min) or need for FiO2 &gt;=0.3 or failure of a room air trial conducted at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. This will be assessed by the research nurse at each centre.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mortality</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks post menstrual age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major morbidity - Major morbidity, defined as one or more of BPD, grade III or IV intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia or retinopathy of prematurity &gt; stage 2, occurring at any time up to 36 weeks post menstrual age. Screening for intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia and retinopathy of prematurity will be performed as routine care, and the results taken from the medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks post menstrual age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pneumothorax - Pneumothorax at any time up to 36 weeks post menstrual age, as documented in medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks post menstrual age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of respiratory support - Duration of respiratory support, defined as cumulative hours of all episodes of intubation, nasal CPAP and high flow nasal cannula oxygen (flow rate &gt;= 2 litres/min). This information will be derived from medical record or unit database.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During first hospitalisation (average assessment period 14 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia - Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) will be assessed both clinically (need for mechanical respiratory support and/or an oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected gestation), and by a physiological definition. Physiological BPD is assessed at 36 weeks post-menstrual age, and is defined as either need for respiratory support (intubation / CPAP / high flow nasal cannula &gt; 2 L/min) or need for FiO2 &gt;=0.3 or failure of a room air trial conducted at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. This will be assessed by the research nurse at each centre.</outcome>
      <timepoint>36 weeks post menstrual age</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of bradycardia and hypoxaemia during intervention - Heart rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored continuously during the intervention. The severity and duration of bradycardia and hypoxia will thus be documented during delivery of exogenous surfactant via brief tracheal catheterisation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Discomfort during intervention - The incidence of apparent discomfort, as judged by the nurse assisting in the surfactant delivery procedure, will be ascertained in the group randomised to receive surfactant via brief tracheal catheterisation.</outcome>

    <summary>Trial question: Does administration of exogenous surfactant using a minimally-invasive
      technique improve outcome in preterm infants 25-28 weeks gestation treated with continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP)? Trial hypothesis: That early surfactant administration via a
      minimally-invasive technique to preterm infants on CPAP will result in a lesser duration of
      mechanical respiratory support, and a higher incidence of survival without bronchopulmonary
      dysplasia. Trial design: Multicentre, randomised, masked, controlled trial in inborn preterm
      infants 25-28 weeks gestation, aged less than 6 hours, requiring CPAP because of respiratory
      distress, with an FiO2 of &gt;=0.3 and CPAP pressure 5-8. Infants randomised to surfactant
      treatment receive 200 mg/kg of poractant alfa (Curosurf) administered under direct
      laryngoscopy using a surfactant instillation catheter, followed by reinstitution of CPAP.
      Controls continue on CPAP. The intervention is masked from the clinical team. Care thereafter
      is as per usual in both groups, other than the requirement to adhere to intubation criteria.
      The primary outcome is incidence of death or BPD. Secondary outcomes include incidence of
      death, major neonatal morbidities (BPD, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular
      leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, necrotising enterocolitis), pneumothorax and patent
      ductus arteriosus; need for intubation and surfactant therapy; durations of mechanical
      respiratory support, intubation, CPAP, intubation and CPAP, high flow nasal cannula (HFNC),
      oxygen therapy, intensive care stay and hospitalisation; hospitalisation cost; applicability
      and safety of the MIST procedure; and outcome at 2 years. The sample size is 303/group,
      allowing detection of a 33% difference in the primary outcome with 90% power. The trial
      commenced at Royal Hobart Hospital December 2011 and Royal Women's Hospital during 2012, and
      will ultimately be conducted over 5 years in multiple centres internationally.</summary>
