    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients are recruited from the Heart Failure Clinic at Concord Hospital. Patients with iron deficiency will be approached by the investigator regarding their interest in participation and informed consent will be obtained prior to their enrollment. Participating patients will present to the Concord Hospital Cardiovascular Outpatient department on the day of their infusion, where an independent clinical trial pharmacist will randomize the patient using a computer software program to iron or placebo. The investigators will not know which treatment is allocated to the patient</concealment>
    <sequence>At randomization, the pharmacist will use a computer software to randomize the patient to either iron or placebo, stratified by their NYHA class (I vs II and III). The details on which treatment the patient received will be entered into a separate database that will not be made available to the investigators, ensuring they are blinded to what treatment the patients are having </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Ferric carboyxmaltose is easily distinguished from normal saline due to its distinctive brown color. To ensure blinding of the patient, the treatment is administered with a curtain shielding the patient's view. To ensure blinding of the investigators, the treatment is administered by an independent nurse not involved in data analysis.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is an improvement in 2 week change in KCCQ score greater or equal to 5, which is considered a clinically significant change. Assuming a standard deviation of change in KCCQ of 8, a sample size of 82 patients (41 treatment, 41 placebo) will have 80% power to detect a between group change in KCCQ score of 5 or greater. We will also arrange for an outside statistician to conduct a blinded interim analysis after 20 patients per group have been enrolled to revise the sample size requirement and ensure that we have the power to show a clinically significant difference of 5 points between groups is statistically significant. We will analyze the outcomes with an ANCOVA model on the change in KCCQ score, PHQ-9 score, BNP, ST2 at 2 weeks. A repeated measures mix model will be used for changes in 6-minute walk test, hand grip strength, cardiac output, cardiac index, and stroke volume. We have pre-specified subgroups including NYHA class (I vs II/III), left ventricular ejection fraction (normal vs reduced), gender, anaemia (haemoglobin greater or equal to 12g/dL vs &lt;12g/dL), diabetes, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (greater or equal to 60ml/min/1.73m2 vs &lt;60 ml/min/1.73m2) for further analysis to identify interactions.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of our current study is to characterize the immediate short term impact of iron repletion on heart failure patients quality of life, exercise tolerance, hemodynamic indices, and serum BNP and ST2 levels; this will in turn add to the growing body of evidence supporting the investigation and treatment of iron deficiency in patients with congestive cardiac failure. Our hypothesis is that intravenous ferric carboxymaltose in congestive cardiac failure patients with concomitant iron deficiency will improve quality of life (as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Score), short term exercise capacity (as measured on the six minute walk test), hemodynamic indices (as measured via impedance cardiography), and blood profile (BNP and ST2 levels )when compared with a placebo infusion of 0.9% sodium chloride.</summary>
