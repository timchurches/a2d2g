    <interventions>Sixteen healthy individuals will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled, crossover clinical trial either to drink 300 mL of the beverage made with 4,8 % of the grape pomace flour (GPF) from the grape juice or commercial grape juice contents 1 % of grape pulp once daily for two weeks. After fourteen days of washout, the same individuals will drink the other beverage, commercial juice or from grape pomace, for more fourteen days. Blood samples of the individuals will be collected at baseline, after two weeks of intervention and the same protocol will be performed after fourteen days of washout.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study i to evaluate the effect of a beverage with the grape pomace flour from the grape juice and to evaluate its effect on oxidative stress and coronary artery disease marker in human beings. Sixteen healthy individuals will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled, crossover clinical trial to take the beverage made of the grape pomace flour (GPF) from the grape juice or commercial grape juice for two weeks. Blood samples of the individuals will be collected at baseline, after two weeks of intervention and the same protocol will be performed after fourteen days of washout. Triacylglycerols, total cholesterol and its fractions, C-reactive protein, IL-6 and TNF-a will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the experiment. Plasma and  LDL will be submitted to the oxidation by Copper (Cu+2) at the four moments, followed by the measurement of the formed products of lipid peroxidation: the concentration of TBARs (Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and the formation of conjugated dienes using spectrophotometric methods. The total antioxidant status of the plasma (TAS) and Oxygen Radical Absorbing Capacity will be likewise analyzed. Superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities will be determined in erytrocitys. And analyzed DNA damage by comet Assay.</summary>
