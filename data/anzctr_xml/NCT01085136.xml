  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multi-center trial
      is to determine the efficacy of BIBW 2992 given as an add-on to chemotherapy in patients with
      NSCLC Stage IIIb or IV progressing after BIBW 2992 monotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone
      in this patient population. Patients on both treatment arms will receive best supportive care
      in addition to study treatment. Patients enrolled into the trial will be treated and followed
      until death or lost to follow-up. Additional information on the health-related quality of
      life (HRQOL) will be collected.</summary>
