  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Narrowing of coronary arteries interferes with blood flow and can cause chest pain. But
      patients may have more than one narrowing and studies have shown that not all narrowings need
      to be treated. To identify the narrowings that need treating cardiologists sometimes quantify
      the extent of the narrowing by measuring fractional flow reserve (FFR, the ratio of the
      pressure in the aorta to the pressure downstream of the narrowing).This technique requires
      the administration of drugs that add cost and time to the procedure and in some countries are
      simply unavailable. As a result despite the clear health and healthcare costs benefits of FFR
      its use is limited to less than 5% of procedure. We have developed a new technique called the
      instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) that does not require the administration of drugs for its
      accurate assessment. It has been approved for use in this indication. This study aims to
      compare clinical outcomes of patients whose treatment has been guided by iFR to those whose
      treatment has been guided by FFR. If iFR is found to provide the same clinical outcomes as
      FFR its adoption will permit the clear benefits of this approach of identifying the coronary
      narrowings that really need treatment to be applicable to a much larger patient population
      and further improve healthcare costs.</summary>
