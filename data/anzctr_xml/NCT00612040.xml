    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Glycosylated Haemoglobin (HbA1c) - Change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 weeks of treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) - Change from baseline in FPG (expressed in mmol/L, 1 mg/dL = 18times mmol/L) after 16 weeks of treatment</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean of 9-point Self Measured Plasma Glucose Profile (SMPG) - Estimate of the overall mean of SMPG (expressed in mmol/L, 1 mg/dL = 18times mmol/L) after 16 weeks of treatment. Plasma glucose measured: before breakfast, 120 minutes after start of breakfast, before lunch, 120 minutes after start of lunch, before dinner, 120 minutes after start of dinner, bedtime, at 4 am and before breakfast.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Major and Minor Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of major and minor hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Major if unable to treat her/himself. Minor if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16 + 5 days follow up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of Nocturnal Major and Minor Hypoglycaemic Episodes - Rate of nocturnal major and minor hypoglycaemic episodes per 100 patient years of exposure (PYE). Major if unable to treat her/himself. Minor if able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.

Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with subject's daily activities. Moderate: marked symptoms, moderate interference with subject's daily activities. Severe: considerable interference with subject's daily activities, unacceptable. Serious AE: AE that at any dose results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening experience, in-subject hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalisation, persistent/significant disability/incapacity/congenital anomaly/birth defect.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical Examination - Physical examination was performed at screening (week -1), and after 8 and 16 weeks of treatment. If any new findings or deterioration in previous findings were observed during the trial, these were recorded as AEs and are therefore not presented separately as no analysis was performed.</outcome>

    <summary>This trial is conducted in Europe, Oceania and the United States of America (USA). The aim of
      this trial is to compare two NN1250 (insulin degludec) formulations with each other and with
      insulin glargine, all in combination with insulin aspart in subjects with type 1 diabetes.</summary>
