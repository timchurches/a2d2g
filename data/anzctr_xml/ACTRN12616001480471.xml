  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the intervention group, the participants will have to implement two different kinds of treatment. First of all, they will have to complete a motor control program focused on muscles like medium and lower trapezius and anterior serratus, which are responsible for stabilize the scapula when shoulder makes a movement in the space. In addition, this group will realise also a strengthening program for the rotator cuff muscles. This program consists on working in different movements of the shoulder like flexion, extension, abduction, internal and external rotation using elastic bands to get resistance for these movements. The participants will realise 3 series of each movement with 10 repetitions per serie.

Elastic bands will be used to perform the strengthening program. Different levels of resistance will be used depending on the patient evolution. These levels will be supervised by the therapist. Besides, participants will receive verbal orders from the therapist to implement the motor control program in the correct way. 

The professional who will implement the program will be a physiotherapist with more than five years of clinical experience. 

The delivery mode will be attendance individually in a physiotherapist consultation. During the intervention, participants will have to sign every attendance session at hospital. This condition will allow the researchers to know the level of attendance in control and intervention group. 

The intervention consists of two sessions of 30 minutes per week during eight weeks. 
The location will be in a public hospital in Madrid called "Hospital Clinico San Carlos".</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator / control treatment: The control group is an active group, they will perform the same strengthening program as the intervention group, with elastic bands for the rotator cuff muscles. This group will realise abduction, flexion, extension, internal and external rotation movements in the shoulder joint, the resistance will be given by the different levels of elastic bands. Different from intervention, control group will not implement a motor control program for the scapula-thoracic joint.

They also will attendance at hospital during eight weeks with two sessions per week too.</comparator>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy of a motor control program on pain and functionality in patients diagnosed with shoulder impingement syndrome: randomized clinical trial.

Background: pain and functional limitation in the shoulder joint complex, known as impingement syndrome, is one of the great problems for the working population in developed countries and one of the main reasons for medical services. Despite the many efforts by the scientific community in establishing the causes or responsible for generating this syndrome, the reality is that these etiological factors remain unclear, considering that in a high percentage of the patients diagnosed with this syndrome, the cause thereof entity is not known.

Among others, stability and abnormal mobility of the scapula on the rib cage during movements of the upper limb, have been indicated as potential triggers or aggravating causes of subacromial syndrome. Such mobility and stability required in the scapula may be present due to a deficit in the motor control of the lower trapezius muscle, middle trapezius and serratus anterior. In this line, very few studies to date that have guided conservative treatment for this syndrome to control scapular stability and mobility through motor control techniques, comparing the results obtained with other techniques of conservative treatment.

Objectives: To measure the effect of the application of a motor control program, in addition with a program to strengthen shoulder in pain and functionality of patients diagnosed with subacromial syndrome.

Subjects and methodology: to achieve the objectives of the study will be carry out a randomized clinical trial comparing two similar and homogeneous groups at startup. The patients who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria and after reading the newsletter and sign informed consent will enter into the study and randomly form part of the control group (strengthening) or experimental group (strengthening + motor control). The intervention, which consist of 2 classroom (attended) sessions a week, apply over 8 weeks. 3 measurements shall be performed at baseline, at the end of the 8 weeks of treatment and one month after the last treatment session.
