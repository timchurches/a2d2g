    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - MORAb-003 (farletuzumab)
Treatment: drugs - 0.9% Saline
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel

Active Comparator: 1 - MORAb-003 (Farletuzumab) Plus Paclitaxel

Placebo Comparator: 2 - Placebo Plus Paclitaxel


Treatment: drugs: MORAb-003 (farletuzumab)
Farletuzumab (FAR) at 2.5 mg/kg was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion weekly on Day 1 of Weeks 1 to 12 (Cycle 1) and then in 4-week cycles with treatment administered on Day 1 of Weeks 1 to 3 for all subsequent cycles.

Treatment: drugs: 0.9% Saline
Placebo (0.9% normal saline) was administered by IV infusion weekly on Day 1 of Weeks 1 to 12 (Cycle 1) and then in 4-week cycles with treatment administered on Day 1 of Weeks 1 to 3 for all subsequent cycles.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of the first observation of progression as determined by modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), or death regardless of cause. If progression or death was not observed, the PFS time was censored at the date of the last tumor assessment without evidence of progression before the date of initiation of further antitumor treatment, or the cutoff date (whichever was earlier).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of Randomization to date of disease progression or death (whichever came first), assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the date of death, whatever the cause. If death was not observed for a participant, the survival time was censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive or the cutoff date, whichever was earlier.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of Randomization to date of death, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Overall Response - BOR was defined as the percentage of participants having either a confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) using modified RECIST criteria by independent radiologist review. RECIST criteria was adjusted based on current medical practices and on possible differences between ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. Tumor assessments performed up to the initiation of further antitumor treatment were considered. Target lesions selected for response assessment were measured using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans then graded according to the modified RECIST criteria, adjusted based on current medical practices and on possible differences between ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. Participants were assigned to one of the categories of change in disease state; CR, PR, progressive disease (PD), stable disease ( S)D, or not evaluable (NE).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of first study drug to disease progression/recurrence, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Tumor Response (TTR) - TTR was derived for those participants with objective evidence of CR or PR, and was defined as the time (in months) from the date of randomization to the first documentation of object tumor response (TR). Analysis was based on the Kaplan-Meier estimated percentage of responders. This statistical analysis method measures the effect of study drug on tumor response over a period of time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of Randomization to the first documentation of objective TR, assessed up to study termination (28 Nov 2011), or up to approximately 2 years 10 months</timepoint>
