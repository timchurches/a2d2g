  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the intervention group receive usual inpatient treatment, including medical, nutritional and physiotherapy. In place of the usual physiotherapy exercise program, participants in this group receive a targeted exercise program, addressing components of strength, flexibility and aerobic and anaerobic activities. This supervised program is performed five days per week (for up to 60 minutes), and is encouraged to be continued over the weekend (supervised by parent / guardian). Participants receive an exercise pack which includes items to encourage physical activity. A log is used for documentation of activities and relevant measures (for example: heart rate, breathlessness score, shuttle level attained or number of jumps performed in 30 seconds etc). A pedometer is provided to count the number of steps taken during the session and between sessions. Prior to discharge from hospital, advice is given regarding continuation of the program at home, aiming for 30 minutes on three days per week. This program is continued for 12 weeks following discharge. Strategies to encourage adherence to the home program include contact via telephone and email.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group receive usual inpatient treatment including medical, nutritional and physiotherapy. Participants receive the usual practice exercise program as part of the physiotherapy airway clearance regimen. This supervised program includes general aerobic-type activity, performed five days per week (for up to 60 minutes). Detail of session duration and activities performed is documented by the treating therapist on a study form. Following discharge from hospital, participants perform usual physical activity.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Six Minute Walk Test (distance).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity levels and participation in physical activity using the Fels Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children, and the Three Day Activity Diary.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures are completed once during the 14 day inpatient period, and once during the 12 week outpatient period.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Respiratory function (namely Forced Expiratory Volume in one second), tested by a trained respiratory function technician.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise is a vital component of the physiotherapy management for young people with cystic fibrosis (CF). The overall aim of this research is to strengthen knowledge about best practice exercise programs for this population. This study compares effects of two exercise programs (the current exercise practice versus a novel targeted exercise program). Ultimately, it is expected that with improved exercise programs, young people with CF may have improved body structure and function, and activity and participation levels, leading to enhanced quality of life.</summary>
