  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who are five years or more disease-free following curative treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma (also known as Hodgkin's Disease) will be invited to attend a specialized Survivor's Clinic.  The Clinic will deliver a complete health review to monitor for complications resulting from the curative treatment.  Second malignancies and cardiovascular complications are the two most serious resulting problems of the curative treatment; thyroid, pulmonary and fertility problems are also reported.  Through lifestyle advice and checks appropriate to the particular treatment received early detection can prevent the development and/or the severity of such complications, known also as 'late effects'.  This is the purpose of the Survivorship Clinic.
1.teaching breast self-examination techniques - the nurse will give a pamphlet describing the technique and will go through it with the survivor - 15 minutes required, one session.
2.  Mammograms - yearly for life from the age of 40 or if family history of breast cancer or if received mantle field radiotherapy as part of curative treatment.
3. Smoking cessation nurse to advise particular problems with smoking and then to refer to GP if help required to quit.  15 minutes to ascertain smoking habit and appropriate course of action ie. referral to GP.  Smoking habits to be addressed at every yearly review.
4. Computed tomography of chest yearly where indicated ie if mantle field radiotherapy given as curative treatment.  
5 .Echocardiogram - an ultrasound scan of the heart to check its efficiency.  To be carried out yearly if mantle field radiotherapy was given as  curative treatment.
6.  All of these interventions will be carried out at least yearly for the rest of these individuals lives.</interventions>
