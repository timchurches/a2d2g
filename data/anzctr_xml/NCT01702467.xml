    <summary>The current study will examine the safety, tolerability, plasma pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      plasma pharmacodynamics (PD) of single-doses of GSK2647544.The study will be conducted as a
      randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled, 4-way crossover single oral ascending dose
      design in 2 independent cohorts, eight healthy male subjects in each of the cohorts. Each
      potential subject will undergo Screening visit, Treatment Phase and Follow-up visit.</summary>
