    <statisticalmethods>The sample size required to assess a 30% reduction on acne severity, based on an 80% confidence, is 30 participants in each arm, total of 60 participants.

The primary endpoint is reduction in Acne Severity (assessed at baseline, week 8 and week 16). The severity is defined as the severity of acne and the percentage of the face and neck affected. The mean percentage change in area will be calculated. Data will be analysed using SPSS statistical software to test for equality of means between the active and placebo groups at each time point. 

QOL questionnaires will be analysed using SPSS statistical software for difference in mean values between the active and placebo group at each time point. The specific statistical test will be determined once the initial data has been analysed for normality.
