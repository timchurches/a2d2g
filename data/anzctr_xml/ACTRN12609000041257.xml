  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to evaluate the EpiSure, a new epidural syringe that uses a novel spring-loaded mechanism to locate the correct place in the back for epidural insertion. Early data regarding this device suggests that it may ease the process of inserting an epidural and reduce complications, particularly in anaesthetists who are relatively new to the procedure of epidural insertion.

We will compare effectiveness of pain relief and outcomes in patients whose epidurals are inserted with the EpiSure with those whose epidurals are inserted with traditional syringes.</summary>
