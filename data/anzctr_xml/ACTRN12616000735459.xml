    <interventions>McKenzie approach for treatment of acute low back pain.
The McKenzie method of mechanical diagnosis &amp; therapy is an active exercise approach involving repeated movements, sustained positions and therapeutic forces, it has an educational component with the purpose of minimising pain, disability, and improving spinal mobility. This method involves the assessment of symptomatic and mechanical responses to repeated movements and sustained positions. The responses are used to classify them into subgroups or syndromes (Posture, Dysfunction and Derangement) which help in guiding the treatment principles.
Physiotherapist (assessor) will perform a physical assessment of lumbar range of motion &amp; palpation, he/she will also look for any directional bias the symptoms have.
Depending on whether the patient responds to flexion or extension movement, exercises will be prescribed to the patient on the day of presentation in the emergency department.
This process of assessment and treatment takes around 90minutes.
The patient will also receive analgesia(NSAIDS, paracetamol &amp; opioids if necessary.
The patient will asked to perform the same set of  exercises 20minutes 4/day for 2weeks at home.(exercise sheets will be provided for assistance)
The patient will be provided with an daily exercise checklist which he would return by a reply paid envelope to the principle investigator. Patient education provided will help improve exercise adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Management will include patient education and assurance , symptom relief by analgesia (NSAIDS, paracetamol &amp; opioids if necessary), as well as recommendation to stay as active as possible including return to work .
The assessor (Physiotherapist) will perform a subjective &amp; objective (assessment of range of motion &amp; palpation) assessment to rule out serious pathology.
The patient will be shown gentle range of motion(mobility) and core activation(stability) exercises 10 reps, which he will also be asked to continue 10minutes  3-4/day for 2 weeks at home, exercise sheets will be provided. The patient will be provided with an daily exercise checklist which he would return by a reply paid envelope to the principle investigator. Patient education provided will help improve exercise adherence.
The assessment and treatment will take around 60minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). It is also a major health condition associated with high rates of absenteeism from work and more frequent use of health services. As per the international back pain guidelines, primary contact practitioner aim is to classify back pain and rule out serious pathology. The mechanical low back pain group (back pain from a musculoskeletal cause) makes up 90% of presentations to ED. Currently in ED standard treatment comprises of subjective and objective assessment (RMO/ED registrar, or Physiotherapist):,radiological investigations as appropriate for the individual. Management will include patient education and assurance, symptom relief by analgesia (NSAIDS, paracetamol &amp; opioids if necessary), as well as recommendation to stay as active as possible including return to work. Depending on their response to the analgesia patients are discharged with gentle exercises &amp; Physiotherapy follow-up.
Despite these forms of care twenty five percent (RBWH ED statistics) of low back pain patients are admitted to the short stay unit for overnight analgesia due to difficulties coping with the pain. They are then discharged after 1-2 days. Apart from adding to the cost , this also blocks a bed for other emergency patients. 
Effective treatment of acute LBP is important because it prevents patients from developing chronic LBP which needs more costly and complex investigations and treatment. Presently treatment  for  patients presenting to ED with back pain lacks an individualised approach with respect to alleviating mechanical low back pain. 
We propose this may be improved with the use of a McKenzie approach to management of back pain in the ED setting. The McKenzie method of mechanical diagnosis &amp; therapy is an active exercise approach involving repeated movements, sustained positions and therapeutic forces, it has an educational component with the purpose of minimising pain, disability, and improving spinal mobility. 
Currently data suggesting effectiveness of this method in an ED setup is lacking.
Therefore the purpose of this study is to compare if more benefits are gained with a McKenzie exercise approach compared to a stability/mobility exercise approach for patients who are treated by a Physiotherapist for low back pain in ED. We anticipate the findings of the study will be informative to the best approach to management of these patients in ED.</summary>
