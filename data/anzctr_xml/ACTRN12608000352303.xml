  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is a clinically recognised test for quantifying functional mobility. It is quick, easy to perform and reliable in a clinic setting. Rehabilitation in the Home (RITH) physiotherapists utilise the TUG test to assess and reassess clients in their home environment.  However, there is no data on the reliability of TUG in the home environment.  In addition, due to the nature of home based therapy, it is often difficult to utilise the recommended seat height for the test.  This study aims to investigate the reliability of the TUG in the home environment, compared to the outpatient setting and to determine the reliability of the TUG when a non-standard chair is utilised for the testing.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The TUG test is to be investigated for reliability for use in the home environment within the frail aged population.  The intervention part will be the performance of the TUG in the participant's home environment.  This will occur within 24 hours of the control testing (see below).  The testing procedure involves a standard chair (height 44-47cm with arms) positioned with a marker placed 3 meters away on the floor. The patient is tested wearing their usual footwear and walking aid and no physical assistance is given. The patient starts sitting in the chair and is instructed to stand up and walk to the mark, turn around and walk back to sit in the chair.  On Go the patient is timed to complete the task.  At each setting, a practice test will occur prior to the actual test.  A rest will occur between the practice and actual tests of approximately 3 minutes.  Following the second test, a third TUG will be conducted using a non-standard chair.  The total testing time including rests will be 10 minutes.  The testing will occur once only, on the day following the control treatment.  All subjects will act as their own controls and be tested in both the clinical setting and the home setting.</interventions>
