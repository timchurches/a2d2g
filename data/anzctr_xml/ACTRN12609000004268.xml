  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this cross-over randomised controlled trial, the adolescents will undertake each of three regimens on different days: (1) participate in a single bout of moderate intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer for 10 minutes; (2) participate in a single bout of moderate intensity exercise on a cycle ergometer for 20 minutes; or (3) no exercise (control condition). The order of the regimens will be randomly allocated for each adolescent. A washout period of at least 18 hours is used.</interventions>

    <concealment>The study was advertised at a local secondary school and on campus for volunteers. Those interested are provided with a patient information sheet and consent form. If under 16 years of age, parent consent forms and participant assent forms are completed. Baseline measures will be done after enrolment and before allocation of randomisation (of order of regimens). Allocation of randomisation will be by numbered, enclosed, opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low mood is common in adolescents and can sometimes lead to impaired performance, or longer term anxiety and depression. There are no trials that have investigated the effect of exercise duration on mood in adolescents. This study will use a randomised controlled trial design to assess the effect on mood of moderate-intensity exercise of different durations (10 minutes, 20 minutes and no exercise) in 30 adolescents. Understanding the effects of exercise on mood may assist in tailoring physical activities for adolescents to improve mood, motivation and participation, assist in the management of adolescents who suffer from low mood, depression or anxiety, and inform public health messages.</summary>
