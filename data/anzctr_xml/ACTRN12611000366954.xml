  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Electromagnetic brain stimulation techniques have been used to map brain areas, to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression and rehabilitation. Often to see the changes of activation or inhibition of brain areas or to assess any change in synaptic plasticity induced by these stimuli, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used.
Methods This double blind randomized pilot study, is the first study to examine with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the effects on brain activity of voluntary healthy subjects, following a single, very low power 250 ms transcutaneous radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) pulse. The primary target of this study was to assess if the REAC pulse, well below the temporal resolution of fMRI, might show some effect on the brain and particularly on cerebellum activity.</summary>
