  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial will be conducted in two stages:

Stage 1: Development of the Consumer Questions Program (CQP). This is the intervention which will be tested in Stage 2. 

Participants:
a) Clinical staff focus groups (health professionals and clinic staffs at Family Planning NSW
b) Consumer focus groups (clients at Family Planning NSW)
Outcome: thematic analysis to identify themes and sub-themes within the data (audio-records transcriptions)

Stage 1 will take 1-4 months

Stage 2: A feasibility Study.  Testing of the intervention: The Consumer Questions Program.

The Consumer Questions Program (CQP) to train consumers to use the consumer questions. The program includes providing participants with four components:
i) a 2-5 min CQP DVD 
ii)  a consultation summary sheet
iii) a consumer questions reminder card
iv) a CQP pamphlet, including website address to access the DVD and the supporting information online


The intervention will be delivered once to participants by a research officer/nurse when they attend the clinic. Client participants will complete questionnaires for data collection at 3 time points.  Prior to consultation (T1), immediately post consultation ( T2) and 2 weeks  post consultation (T3)

Participants:
a) Clinical staff (health professionals and clinic staff) at Family Planning NSW
b) Clients at Family Planning NSW


Primary outcomes will be measured from participants' report:
a) proportion of client participants who report asking the questions in the consultation
b) qualitative data about the experience of asking the questions and use of the information obtained from the doctor as a result of asking the questions.

Secondary outcomes:
c) proportion of clients who report viewing the CQP video
d) Proportion of clients who report accessing the online information
e) length of consultation
f) access to study online resource monitored by URL address hits
g) qualitative data from the health professional log books
h) data from the consultation summary sheets completed by client participants.


We anticipate Stage 2 will take 5 months to complete all data collection and analysis.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims
To explore the feasibility and implementation issues of a program to train consumers to use simple consumer questions to enhance their understanding and decision-making in a clinical consultation.

Specific aims
i) To develop and produce a program to train and support consumers to use consumer questions (the Consumer Questions Program CQP) to elicit information for decision making and to integrate this information with their personal preferences, and;
ii) To test the feasibility of consumers using this program in FPNSW consultations.

Research questions
The effects of the program results on:
1) consumers' knowledge of the questions
2) consumers' understanding of when and why they might want to ask the questions
3) consumers' willingness to ask the questions in the consultation
4) consultation processes, particularly in consultation length and complexity
Health professionals' reactions to the questions will also be examined.</summary>
