  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether a drug called Riluzole can prevent chemotherapy-induced nerve injury in patients with colorectal cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are aged 18-80 years and are scheduled to undergo chemotherapy with the drug, oxaliplatin, for the treatment of colorectal cancer. 

Trial details
In this study, participants are randomly (by chance) divided into two groups. One group will take the study drug, Riluzole, at a dose of 50 mg oral tablet twice daily for the duration of chemotherapy treatment (4-6 months), and for 2 weeks following treatment cessation. The other group will receive a placebo (sham) treatment consisting of lactose tablets. During the trial, participants will not know whether they are receiving the active drug or placebo. 

Participants will be assessed at regular intervals over 2 years to assess their nerve function, quality of life, and cancer-related outcomes.</summary>
