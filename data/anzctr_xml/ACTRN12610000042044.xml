  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will carry out an exercise training program that will be supervised by a physical therapist, two days per week for 12 weeks, 60 minutes each session. They will be divided into four small groups according to their own schedule preferences. Each training session will consist of stretching exercises, 4 ankle and knee muscle strengthening exercises at an intensity of 60-70% of 1 repetition maximum (2 sets of 10 repetitions ) and balance training. Static balance training will be performed through simple and double-tasks at stand on one leg, their heels and their tiptoes and tandem position. Dynamic balance training will be performed through lower support base walking. It will be included ludic activities looking for great adherence. Each session will be accompanied by music.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control participants will not receive treatment during study period. They will be ask about their activities during this time. They will be invited to carry out exercise training program after outcome assessments.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is analyse the effects of an exercise training program on ankle and knee muscle strength, postural control, functional balance and quality of life among elderly community-dwelling women.
The study hypothesis consists that women that take part in the exercise training program decrease risk for falls  and improve quality of life through some improvement in muscle strength and postural control.</summary>
