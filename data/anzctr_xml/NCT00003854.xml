Experimental: Surgery + radiotherapy + adjuvant therapy - Patients undergo bilateral anterior iliac crest bone marrow aspiration to test for presence of micrometastases. Patients then undergo breast-conserving therapy comprising segmental mastectomy and sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) with planned postoperative whole-breast radiotherapy and systemic adjuvant therapy. The SLND comprises ipsilateral axillary sentinel node identification and histopathology.
Patients with no sentinel node identified intraoperatively and patients with sentinel node metastasis identified by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) who choose not to be registered to ACOSOG-Z0011 undergo axillary lymph node dissection involving removal of at least level I and II nodes.
All patients undergo whole-breast radiotherapy (excluding a supraclavicular field) 5 days a week for a maximum of 8 weeks.
Patients are followed at 30 days; at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months; and then annually until 10 years after surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Patient must be female.

          2. Patient's clinical stage must be I or II (T1 or T2 N0 M0) and the tumor must be
             amenable to segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy).

          3. Patient must have a tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma. Note: A patient can
             be registered to this study if they have a cytologic diagnosis suggestive of carcinoma
             from a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a palpable or non-palpable breast lesion and
             the investigator believes the breast lesion is clinically suspicious for invasive
             breast carcinoma.

          4. The date of the patient's first tissue diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma or
             cytologic diagnosis of breast carcinoma must be no more than 60 days prior to SLND.

          5. The patient who had segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy) performed previously, and is now
             referred to the local investigator for SLND, is eligible if the lumpectomy was less
             than or equal to 60 days prior to the SLND. Copies of the operative and pathology
             reports must be submitted as a part of the registration process.

          6. Patient must have ECOG/Zubrod status of =2, as documented in patient's medical record.

          7. Patient must be available for follow-up.

          8. The patient with a history of a previous malignancy is eligible for this study as long
             as the patient meets the following criteria for a cancer survivor. A cancer survivor
             is eligible provided that the following criteria are met:

               1. The patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior
                  malignancies.

               2. There has been no evidence of any prior malignancies for at least five years with
                  no evidence of recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous
                  carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been effectively
                  treated by surgery alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or
                  contralateral breast treated by surgery alone), and

               3. The patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for
                  recurrence from prior malignancies.

          9. Signed and dated informed consent is obtained prior to patient registration.

         10. Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within 14 days of beginning study interventions.

         11. Patient must be able to physically undergo bilateral anterior iliac crest bone marrow
             aspiration.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Patient is lactating (breastfeeding).

          2. Patient has been previously treated with chemotherapy, estrogen receptor antagonists
             (i.e. Tamoxifen) or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, i.e. Raloxifene)
             for this invasive breast cancer.

          3. Patient has a previously placed pre-pectoral breast implant. NOTE: A subpectoral
             implant is allowed.

          4. Patient is considered a poor surgical risk due to a non-malignant systemic disease
             (cardiovascular, renal, etc.), which would preclude the treatment options.

          5. Patient has concurrent bilateral invasive breast malignancies.

          6. Patient is not able to undergo and does not have access to radiation therapy as
             describedin Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in the Interventions section of the protocol.

             Patients with active connective tissue disorders and those that live too far from a
             radiation treatment center, for example, would not be eligible.

          7. Patient has clinically and radiologically identified multi-centric disease that is not
             amenable to a single lumpectomy.

          8. Patient has had previous ipsilateral axillary surgery such as excisional biopsy of
             lymph node(s), treatment of hidradenitis.</exclusivecriteria>
