    <studytitle>Plavix response in coronary intervention (PRINC)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised controlled trial to assess the antiplatelet effect of a 600mg (single-dose) and 1,200mg (split-dose) loading dose of clopidogrel and the impact of verapamil, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the incidence of clopidogrel resistance defined by the VerifyNow? (Accumetrics Ltd) P2Y12 platelet function analyzer in patients with coronary disease.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised to receive intravenously verapamil 5mg, orally 600mg clopidogrel or 1,200mg clopidogrel (split dose 600mg followed by 600mg 2 hours later, whilst in hospital).  The drug effects will be monitored by platelet function analysis. Patients at discharge will be randomised to 75mg daily or 150mg daily of clopidogrel and platelet function measured at one week. Patients will receive standard dose clopidogrel 75mg once daily for either 3 weeks or 6 months depending on whether they receive bare metal coronary stents or drug eluting stents respectively.</interventions>

      <outcome>Complications associated with PCI i.e. Vascular complications; 
1. Haematoma
a. Assessed by clinical examination immediately prior to discharge.
2. Pseudoaneurysm 
a. Diagnosed by vascular ultrasound. Ultrasound will be performed in any patient with a haematoma greater than 10cm in its largest dimension or any tender swellings in which the attending clinician has a high suspicion on pseudoaneurysm.
3. Retroperitoneal haemorrhage
a. Diagnosed by CT scan of the pelvis. CT will be perfomed it the haemoglobin drops unexpectedly or if the patient becomes shocked without cardiac cause.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is designed to assess the response to a drug known as Plavix®. This drug reduces blood clotting by acting on small blood cells called platelets. A platelet rich blood clot is the cause of the blockage of the arteries of the heart that causes a heart attack. This study will hopefully determine the ideal dose that will give the maximum effect on clotting and help reduce the heart attacks related to the stenting opening of the heart arteries. We will also learn whether a drug called verapamil, given at the time of stenting has any effect on the clotting properties of Plavix®. Research assessing this drug interaction and higher doses of Plavix® has not been undertaken before. Both patients and investigators will be blinded to treatment allocation. One randomisation occurs at the outset, to one of four arms. Each study drug administered is coded to blind subjects and investigators.</summary>
