    <interventions>This project aims to examine the efficacy, mechanisms of change, and cost-effectiveness of a novel group cognitive behavioural therapy, imagery-enhanced cognitive behavioural group therapy (IE-CBGT), compared to gold standard verbally-based cognitive behavioural group therapy (VB-CBGT), in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD).

Both protocols target the same maintaining factors (negative cognitions, avoidance, safety behaviours, self-focused attention, negative beliefs about how others perceive them, and core beliefs), but differ critically in the mode within which they are modified. The imagery-enhanced protocol encourages patients to focus on multi-sensory negative social images as a key maintaining factor and imagery monitoring, rather than focusing on verbal thoughts and thought monitoring. Cognitive challenging occurs within imagery rather than only using traditional verbal-linguistic methods. Behavioural experiment predictions are guided by negative imagery rather than thoughts, new information is incorporated into imagery, and coping imagery is constructed. Imagery exercises are included in all within-session behavioural experiments. Negative core beliefs are identified and challenged in IE-GCT via past imagery rescripting techniques, rather than more traditional verbal cognitive methods.

Both protocols involve 12, 2-hour group therapy sessions (once/week) plus a one month group-based follow-up session of 2 hours duration. Groups comprise of between 6 and 12 patients. All treatment sessions will be facilitated by a registered psychologist with a masters or doctoral degree in clinical psychology. Clinicians will maintain an attendance register. Protocol adherence and homework completion will be monitored throughout the trial through coding of in-session audio recordings and use of the Homework Rating Scale (HRS-II), respectively. Additionally, the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) and Gross Cohesion Scale will be used to measure therapist-client alliance and cohesiveness/bond amongst group members.</interventions>
    <comparator>The verbally-based protocol uses verbal-linguistic techniques with no reference to imagery, except within the context of challenging negative self-images via video-feedback. Patients are encouraged to challenge their beliefs regarding negative feelings associated with social situations using a range of structured cognitive behavioural exercises, which includes identifying perpetuating factors (e.g., safety behaviours), psychoeducation, thought monitoring, gathering contrary evidence, and developing new core beliefs.</comparator>

      <outcome>Psychophysiological responding (heart rate variability and skin conductance level) will also be obtained throughout the TSST.

The procedure begins with a 5 min baseline rest during which physiological activity is recorded. They are then given instructions for the subsequent task and 3 min of preparation time. After this they are instructed to talk for 5 min. The task concludes with a further 3 min baseline to assess recovery to baseline responding.

Skin conductance level (SCL) will be recorded with two disposable electrodes attached to the thenar and hypothenar prominences of their non-dominant hand.

Heart rate variability will be measured via electrocardiogram (ECG).

Respiration will be recorded using a chest strap transducer attached to the participants lower chest. It is used as a control measure for the main measures SCL and ECG.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyzing continuous treatment outcomes:
Non-linear change across the duration of the study is expected. In these circumstances, the most powerful approach to data analysis (regardless of the significance of the Time x Group interaction) is to treat time as an ordered categorical (i.e., ordinal) variable and focus on between-group comparisons at each post-treatment assessment (e.g., post-treatment, 1-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up) after controlling for between-group differences at baseline. The 1-month follow-up is nominated as the primary endpoint, because historical data suggest that differences between treatments will be optimal at that point. If the outcome measure does not have a normal distribution, but is nevertheless distributed according to a well-understood function (e.g., gamma, inverse Gaussian), then between-group comparisons will be tested via a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) that specifies this function. Two types of GLMM will be tested. The potential clustering of outcome data within treatment groups will be acknowledged in one model but not the other. The better fitting model will be selected. The method of analysis will depend on whether the slope of the treatment trajectories is non-linear (in which case time would once again be treated as an ordered categorical variable and analyzed as before) or linear (indicating a piecewise growth curve analysis). Standardized rates of reliable and clinically significant change will be calculated and compared at 1- and 6-month follow-up.

Analyzing the binary diagnostic outcome:
A GLMM will be tested to determine whether the imagery-enhanced group contributes to a better diagnostic outcome for SAD than the verbally-based group. The GLMM will include one nominal random effect (participant), one nominal fixed effect (group: imagery-enhanced, verbally-based), one ordinal fixed effect (time: 1-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up), and the Group x Time interaction. The GLMM will use a binomial probability distribution for the outcome (SAD: yes, no) and link it to the fixed effects with a logit function. Once again, two types of GLMM will be tested. The potential clustering of outcome data within treatment groups will be acknowledged in one model but not the other. The better fitting model will be selected. Simple main effects tests will be used to test for between group differences in caseness at 1- and 6-month follow ups. 

Testing moderated mediation:
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with single indicator latent variables to control for measurement error, will be used to determine i) whether the relationship between time (Session 4, Session 8, post-treatment, 1-month follow-up, 6-month follow-up) and SIAS is mediated by changes in negative self-beliefs, repetitive negative thinking, self-focused attention, and avoidance and safety behaviors, and ii) whether group (IE-CBGT, VB-CBGT) moderates the strength of the time-mediator pathway and the mediator-symptomatology pathway. The approach to the moderated mediation analysis follows that of Hofmann and colleagues. Bootstrapping procedures will be used to estimate the significance of the mediation pathways; the error inherent in the psychometric measures will be included in the estimation of the SEMs; any clustering of outcome data within treatment groups will be accommodated by using a sandwich estimator for the path coefficients standard errors. 

Balancing Type I and Type II error rates:
Conducting multiple statistical tests on the secondary outcomes will inflate the familywise error rate (FWER; the probability of at least one false positive). Inflation of the familywise error rate is normally controlled by applying a Bonferroni (or a modified Bonferroni) adjustment to the per-test alpha-level. Controlling FWER guards against false positives (Type I errors) at the cost of missing real effects (Type II errors). Instead of controlling the FWER, however, we could control the false discovery rate (FDR; the expected proportion of false positives). In contrast to FWER controlling procedures, FDR controlling procedures guard against missing real effects (Type II errors) at the cost of an increased number of false positives (Type I errors). In order to optimize statistical power in this study, the FDR rather than the FWER will be controlled. Analyses of the primary outcomes (SIAS, SAD diagnosis, and severity) are hypothesis-driven and will therefore be evaluated at the conventional per-test alpha level of .05.
  
Sample size estimation/Power analysis: 
We are planning for a minimum of 12 groups with an average of 8/group (N = 96) to ensure feasibility to detect a small to medium effect size, as indicated by our pilot work. However, we will continue to recruit for the duration of the funding period (from July 2016 until December 2019) to derive a larger sample size so that smaller effect sizes can be detected. Larger numbers will enable greater precision in effect size estimates and will also allow for multiple comparisons and additional analyses of multiple moderators/mediators. Assuming negligible variance is accounted for by dependencies on the outcome measures within the 12 treatment groups, ninety-six participants (48 in each group) are required for an 80% chance of detecting a moderate (d = .615) difference between the two group means at a Bonferroni-adjusted alpha-level of .017 (= 3 congeneric outcomes). In order to increase the probability of capturing smaller effects, however, we will accommodate multiple testing by controlling the FDR. 

There are many procedures for estimating an adequate sample size for the binary logistic regression - each procedure based on its own prescriptive set of assumptions. We estimated the sample size required for capturing a moderate association between group (imagery-enhanced, verbally-based) and recovery (yes, no) at each post-treatment assessment. Assuming once again that negligible variance is accounted for by intra-group dependencies on the diagnostic measure, 96 participants (48 in each group) will provide sufficient power for an 80% chance of detecting a moderate (w = .29) association between group and recovery. 

Each of the four moderated mediator models (one for each of the four mediators) includes 15 free parameters (i.e., parameters that must be estimated from the data). In order to reliably test an SEM, Our planned sample size of 96 exceeds the minimum sample size (N = 75) required for testing our model (a minimum of 5 participants per parameter is recommended), hence contributing to the appropriateness of implementing SEM.

Handling Missing Data:
Missing outcomes can potentially bias the results of clinical trials. We will limit the frequency of missing data by attempting to collect follow up measures from all participants, including those who do not complete treatment.  Participants will receive a series of phone, text, and email contacts to schedule, and reschedule (where necessary), assessment appointments. If participants refuse to return to the clinic to complete a full assessment, permission will be sought to collect diagnostic interview data via telephone as a minimum. Contact will be made within three days of each assessment via a phone call and one text message reminder. All missed treatment sessions will be followed up by the treating clinician by phone call and/or text message, plus an email with the weekly questionnaires to be completed and returned at the next session. Individual sessions will be allowed if clients are in crisis or specifically request this, which will be noted for consideration in subsequent analyses. Analyses will utilize techniques (such as GLMM and multiple imputation) that make full use of all observed data and help correct for potential biases caused by missing observations. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential impact of missing data on the robustness of our findings.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common and debilitating mental illness, with sufferers frequently experiencing chronic anxiety in anticipation of, and during and following exposure to, social situations. Currently, group cognitive therapy is efficiacious for SAD, but some 80% fail to achieve normative functioning. The current project will investigate the utility of a novel treatment approach for SAD, namely imagery-enhanced cognitive behavioural group therapy (IE-CBGT). In this approach, imagery-based techniques are used to enhance existing evidence-based techniques within a 12-session treatment package. In this trial participants will be randomised to one of two conditions: i) IE-CBGT, or ii) a gold-standard treatment, verbally-based CBGT (VB-CBGT, which relies on identifying and challenging anxiety-provoking beliefs predominantly within the verbal cognitive mode). A minimum of ninety-six individuals with SAD will be recruited through established referral pathways to the Centre for Clinical Interventions (CCI) from general practitioners, psychiatrists and psychologists and randomised into one of the two treatment groups. Between 6-12 patients will be admitted per group. The objectives of the project are threefold: i) to compare outcomes of IE-CBGT and current gold-standard VB-CBGT for SAD, across cognitive, behavioural, psychophysiological and emotional measures (i.e., questionnaires, behavioural tasks and physiological monitoring), ii) to evaluate unique and common mechanisms of change across the two treatments to inform theory and future treatment innovations, and iii) to compare the cost-effectiveness of the treatments to ensure that IE-CBGT has broader cost benefits in a health sector with limited resources and increasing demand. A standard battery of self-report questionnaires will be administered at baseline, and prior to each treatment session in line with current practice at CCI. Additional self-report questionnaires will be administered following sessions 4 and 8 and after the final treatment session. A routine CCI (group) follow-up appointment will be made 1-month after treatment completion with the treating psychologist. An additional individual assessment appointment will be made 1-month after treatment completion so that a diagnostic interview and self-report questionnaires can be administered. Another follow-up appointment will be made 6 months after treatment, allowing for fine-grained assessment of mechanisms of change to be assessed. Psychophysiological responses will be recorded during a social stress task at baseline and upon completion of the treatment sessions (at the individual assessment 1-month follow-up).</summary>
