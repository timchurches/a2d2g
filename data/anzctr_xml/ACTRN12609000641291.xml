  <interventions>
    <interventions>Problem solving therapy (4-6 sessions lasting about 45 minutes each); Improved access to GP (by providing participants with a voucher to access their GP without cost); Risk management (using the principles of aviation risk management which include checklists, crew resource management techniques and continuous identification and management of adverse events); Cultural assessment (assessment of identity and sense of belonging and prompting for this as a potential problem in the problem solving therapy); Postcards (eight postcards sent to the particpants over a year saying "hope you are well"); Patient support (minimum of two phone calls over two weeks to make sure participants receive the treatment they are supposed to have and to co-ordinate intervention).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment (treatment as usual)  - which is hard to specify as it is very variable. It includes intervention from mental health crisis teams, referral to community mental health centres, private provision of therapy, contact with alcohol and drug services and general practitioner follow up.</comparator>
