  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients received hot packs ( hydrocollator). A hydrocollator pack is a silica gel filled pack that is soaked in hot water for a minimum of 20 minutes. The gel pack is wrapped in towels 3 to 5 layers underneath and 1 on top to provide prolonged moist heat.
During application, patients were asked to adopt prone position the hot packs was applied on the lumbosacral region  for 15 minutes.This conventional treatment was to be repeated three times per week for 10 weeks.

interferential therapy. During interferential application, patients were asked to adopt prone position. Interferential treatment was introduced using electrotherapy device. The interferential therapy was delivered at the lumbosacral region with an amplitude-modulated constant frequency of 100 Hz and a pulse duration of 125 micro seconds due to its analgesic effect, for a 20-minutes.This conventional treatment was to be repeated three times per week for 10 weeks.

The patients additionally received lumbar extension traction. In this type of traction, there is vertical load applied by a posterior padded strap between the upper torso and lower pelvis while the upper torso and femur were stabilized by other straps. The patients were having traction three times a week for ten weeks. The traction began at three minutes/session, increased one minute/session to 20minutes, at which time traction was applied for 20minutes/session 

all treatments were administered simultaneously over the10 weeks.</interventions>

      <outcome>the lumbar lordotic angle.it was measured from lateral radiograph by calculating the ARA which considered as a valid and reliable measurement. From lateral radiograph, the posterior superior and posterior inferior vertebral body corners of  L1 and L5on lateral lumbar radiograph were marked.

      <outcome>disability
Disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index. It consists of 10 items that refer to activities of daily living that might be disrupted by low back pain. The items are: 1. pain intensity, 2. personal care, 3. lifting, 4. walking, 5. sitting, 6. standing, 7. sleeping, 8. sex life, 9. social life, and 10. traveling. Each with 1 of 6 possible answers provided. The total score is transferred onto a scale ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates no disability and 100 indicates worst possible disability</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>symptoms (back and leg pain)
pain were measured by The Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) which considered as a valid and reliable scale was used to measure the patient pain intensity.The scale is composed of 0-10numbers. The Patients were asked to place a mark along the line to denote their level of pain; 0 reflecting no pain and 10 reflecting the worst pain.</outcome>

      <outcome>lumbar flexibility assessment,
the modified Schober test was used in this study. A skin mark was drawn at the level of the lumbosacral junction and another two marks were drawn 10cm above and 5 cm below this first mark. Participants maximally bent their trunk without bending the knees, at which time the distance between upper and lower marks was measured in centimeters. The mean of three trials was used for data analysis. Intrarater reliability for this testis high (r=0.88).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>neurophysiogical findings (latency and peak to peak amplitude of H reflex).
Latency and peak to peak amplitude of H reflex was measured.  An electromyogram device (Tonneis neuroscreen plus version 1.59, Germany). The patient was lying prone on a wooden padded table, with arms on the side. The head was maintained in mid position to eliminate the possible effects of asymmetrical tonic neck reflex. The knee was flexed 20 degrees by placing a small cushion under the knee to relax the gastrocnemius muscle. The feet were allowed to rest free over the edge of the bed, with the ankle joints in an anatomically neutral position. Then, the skin of the popliteal fossa, calf muscle and soleus muscle of both legs was rubbed lightly with fine grade sandpaper and finally cleaned with a piece of cotton soaked with alcohol. A silver -silver chloride surface-stimulating bar electrode with coupling gel was placed longitudinally on the tibial nerve in the popliteal fossa midline with the cathode proximal to the anode. A recording surface bar electrode was positioned over the soleus muscle with the active electrode proximal to the reference electrode, and 3 cm distal to the bifurcation of the gastrocnemii and on the line with the Achilles tendon. A ground surface metal electrode was positioned midway between the stimulation and recording electrodes to minimize the stimulus artifact. Electrodes were firmly secured with adhesive tape. The stimulation parameters were 1.0 ms pulse duration and intensity that elicited H-maximum with minimum and stable M-response at a frequency of 0.2 Hz. Two-minute practice trials of elicited H-reflex were obtained to familiarize the patients with the H-reflex stimulation and recordings. Four readings of the maximum H-reflex with minimum and stable M-response were recorded and averaged from the involved leg. The signals were amplified 500-2000 using differential amplification and filtered at 20-10,000 Hz bandwidth, digitized and stored on computer for analysis</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>mechanical findings (segmental intervertebral movements), three sets of lateral lumbar radiograph in flexion and extension view were analyzed. For measuring the sagittal rotational movements between segments L1-L2: L5-S1, we started by defining the midplane which is the line connecting the midpoints between corners for each vertebrae and then the angle between two adjacent vertebrae is calculated by the angle between their midplanes. The value of sagittal rotational motion of any segment is given by the difference of the angle in extension view minus the angle in flexion view. For translational displacements measurement between each adjacent vertebra, we had to draw Perpendiculars from the center points which are the geometric center of four corners onto the bisectrix between the midplane. The difference between the intersection points in the bisectrix line was defined as translational displacement. To correct the radiographic magnification, the displacement measured in millimeters was divided by the mean depth of the caudal vertebra. As previous, the value of translational motion is given by the difference of the displacement in extension view minus the displacement in flexion view</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>this study was conducted to investigate the effects of lumbar extension traction in patients with unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy due to L5-S1 disc herniation.
Sixty four patients with confirmed unilateral lumbosacral radiculopathy due to L5-S1 disc herniation and lumbar lordotic angle measured less 39 degrees were randomly assigned to traction or a control group.The control group (n=32) received hot packs and interferential therapy, whereas the traction group (n=32) received lumbar extension traction in addition to hot packs and interferential therapy. Absolute rotatory angle (ARA), back and leg pain rating scale, Oswestry Disability Index, modified Schober test, H reflex (latency and amplitude) and intervertebral movements were measured for all patients at three intervals (before treatment, after 10 weeks of treatment, and at follow-up of six months). There was a significant difference between the traction and control groups adjusted to baseline value of outcome for all measured variables at 10 weeks post treatment with respect to  ARA (P=0.000), ODI ( P=0.002), back and leg pain (P=0.009), (P=0.005), modified Schober test (p=0.002), latency and amplitude of H reflex(p=0.01), ( p=0.000), intervertebral movements (p&gt;0.05) and at follow-up for all previous variables (p&gt;0.05). Lumbar extension traction in addition to hot packs and interferential therapy decreased pain, disability and H reflex latency while increased lumbar flexibility, H reflex amplitude, and segmental intervertebral movements
