  <interventions>
    <interventions>8 x 30-40 minute therapist sessions of Activation Therapy on-site at the psychiatric unit (4/week) and 10 x online practise sessions over 2 weeks (5/week) in addition to Treatment as Usual (see comparator treatment). 

Activation Therapy consists of two components.  Cognitive Activation and Behavioural Activation.  

Cognitive Activation is the use of therapist guided computerised cognitive exercises from a programme called Scientific Brain Training Pro (https://www.scientificbraintrainingpro.com/ - provided free of charge for this study).  These exercises are designed to activate parts of the brain that are under-active with depression.  This system has been selected based on its use of tasks with flexibility to alter level of difficulty to meet the individuals current functioning, ease of use and delivery in an attractive interactive format. Therapists will select cognitive tasks suitable for the patients current level of functioning from a menu of tasks, and in later sessions, review progress. Collaborative practice, encouragement and coaching will take place.  Therapists will be experienced registered nurses, social workers, or psychologists familiar with the requirements of ward environments and working within multi-disciplinary teams.  Patients will be encouraged to practise the exercises in-between therapy sessions to reinforce and build on learning occurring during therapy.  Patients will focus on the exercises used in therapy when doing the on-line practise sessions. 

Behavioural Activation occurs alongside the Cognitive Activation in the therapy led sessions.   Behavioural Activation involves identification of both positive and negative reinforcers maintaining depressive symptoms and behaviours, and of reinforcers that promote more adaptive behaviours (i.e. those that re-engage the depressed person with previously rewarding or potentially rewarding aspects across the important domains of life). Personal values are identified and activities focussed on those values are considered.  A graded hierarchy of pleasurable activities and activities that give the patient a sense of competency is then chosen and worked through collaboratively with the patient.  Collaborative problem-solving of difficulties in undertaking the tasks occurs.

Training/adherence
Activation Therapy will be delivered according to our Activation Therapy manual by mental health professionals trained and closely supervised with a focus on adherence and competence.
Fidelity checklists of core strategies delivered during each sesson will be completed by therapists after each session to ensure all elements are delivered.
 A random selection of 10% of audiotaped sessions will be listened to by a supervisor and scored according to the Quality of Behavioral Activation Scale.
Participant adherence will be measured by the 9-item Short Form Behavioral Activation Scale (BADS-SF) completed by participants at baseline, session 4 and session 8.
A single question self-rating the extent of practice of Behavioural Activation activities within the past 24 hours will be completed by participants at each session.  The frequency and duration of on-line cognitive activation exercises will also be monitored through the Scientific Brain Training Pro programme.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as Usual involves nursing care, regular review with medical staff, pharmacotherapy, and an occupational therapist led therapeutic programme including diversional group activities (walks and therapeutic activities e.g., cooking). Availability of psychology input is limited due to resourcing factors and usually only occurs in cases in which the admission has become prolonged and would therefore occur after the end of the treatment period.   Treatment as Usual is provided for the study period (2 weeks) and then continues for patients in the comparator and intervention groups until discharge.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is change in a composite cognitive score generated by adding z scores of the change between baseline and follow-up for a preselected group of cognitive measures. These measures cover the domains of visual and verbal memory and learning, attention, executive function, and psychomotor function. The composite score measures are comprised from the following variables: Groton Maze Learning Task Test (Cogstate) total errors in all learning trials, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Task- total words recalled in all learning trials, Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Task - words recalled delayed recall, Category Fluency- total words generated, Category Fluency Switching - total correct switches, Digit Span - total forwards plus backwards, Timed Chase Test (Cogstate)  number of correct moves per second, Digit Symbol Substitution Tasks - total correct symbols generated. 

The composite score will be calculated by computing z scores for each variable (score/standard deviation of the score at baseline). The z score for each variable will be added and divided by the number of variables to create a composite z score. z scores at baseline and at follow-up will be entered into general linear model.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>In an equivalent group of patients with depression, the difference in mean z-scores between patients and healthy controls on the composite cognitive measure at follow-up was 0.8. We can therefore assume a similar difference in the TAU group. A clinically meaningful difference would be to reduce this by half - to a difference after treatment of 0.4 in the AT group. The SD of change of the composite z-score in  the equivalent group was 0.7. We are therefore aiming for a difference in change in z-score compared with controls of 0.4 with an SD of 0.7. Sixty five patients per group will give 90% power to detect this difference as statistically significant (2-tailed a=0.05). 

The primary outcome will be analysed by general linear mixed model with group and site as between-subject factors and time (baseline/follow-up) as a within-subjects factor. Analysis population will be intention-to-treat with all patients who are randomised entered into the analysis. This will be regardless of protocol (treatment adherence). Patients who do not undergo repeat cognitive testing will be assumed not to have changed. Close liaison with patients and their clinicians following discharge and an interim contact to carry out mood rating, plus testing in patients homes will maximise follow-up and minimise the chance of differential dropout between groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression is a common and serious problem.  Patients who are admitted for treatment of depression are generally the most severely affected with the greatest degree of depressive and cognitive symptoms (difficulty with thinking, memory, and organising).

Existing treatments of depression largely consist of medications and psychotherapies (talking treatments).  However, these treatments are limited for a number of reasons including partial response rates (not helping everybody who takes the treatment), incomplete responses (only improving depression somewhat), and persisting cognitive symptoms despite improvements in mood.  These factors are all linked to poor functional recoveries (failure to return to previous level of functioning) and risk of depression returning.

Current treatment of depression on a psychiatric ward largely provides a secure setting that minimises the risk of suicide whilst medications take effect.  Unfortunately, the evidence for non-medication strategies to improve the care of inpatients with depression is not well established and largely preliminary in its findings.  This study, therefore, seeks to improve the evidence base for non-medication strategies for inpatients with depression.  

Behavioural Activation is a treatment that has predominantly been studied in outpatient depression studies with good evidence for its effectiveness.  Behavioural Activation helps people by assisting them to increase their activity levels.  Cognitive Activation is a new treatment that is increasingly being evaluated for depression and other mental disorders.  Cognitive activation stimulates under-active areas of the brain with on-line computer games.  We have combined Behavioural Activation and Cognitive Activation to create Activation Therapy (AT).  We believe that this combination of treatments provides the best chance of helping people with severe inpatient depression. 

Our study will assess whether AT given in addition to usual treatment (Treatment As Usual (TAU)) on a psychiatric ward  is better than TAU for inpatients with depression.  If patients agree to participate in the study, they will be randomly chosen to either have Activation Therapy and TAU or TAU alone. 

Our main goal is to assess whether or not Activation Therapy improves the cognitive deficits caused by depression.  We will do this by measuring cognition before the study starts and 14 weeks later.  We will also measure symptoms of depression, functioning, readmission to hospital rates, and total time spent in hospital to help us understand if Activation Therapy is useful for inpatients with depression.
