    <interventions>Ultrasound guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with local anaesthetic.  At the end of the caesarean section, a TAP block will be performed with either local anaesthetic or placebo.

TAP block technique
Equipment
 Ultrasound  38mm linear array probe 13-6MHz
 22G 150mm Stimuplex needle
 Study drug  40ml of 0.5% ropivacaine / saline
 Betadine antiseptic preparation for skin preparation
 Pulse oximetry to measure heart rate
 Availability of full monitoring and resuscitation equipment

Identification of landmarks
 Ultrasound positioned in the mid axillary line in the axial plane half way between the iliac crest and the costal margin.
 Structures to be identified: subcutaneous fat, external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle, peritoneum and intraperitoneal structures.  As a means of confirmation, the transversus abdominis tends to be darker and less echogenic.
 If these are not readily identified, the probe may be moved posteriorly to identify the latissimus dorsi muscle which is external to the fascial extension of these muscles.  The probe may also be moved anteriorly to the rectus sheath and the fascial planes followed back out laterally.  The final position of the probe is to be no further anterior than the anterior axillary line.  Oblique angulation may assist with identifying the planes.
 Landmarks are to be classified as 'unsatisfactory' if any of 1. external oblique, 2. internal oblique, 3. transversus abdominis, or 4. intraperitoneal structures cannot be identified posterior to the anterior axillary line.  The block may still be performed if the investigator is satisfied that the transversus abdominis muscle can be differentiated.  Views will be considered excellent if quadratus lumborum can be seen in addition to the above four structures.
 If landmark identification is impossible, the block will not be performed.

Needle technique
 The needle is inserted 'in plane' and directed to lie between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis under real time ultrasound guidance.
 To confirm location, 2ml of local anaesthetic can be injected.
 Once position is satisfactory, local anaesthetic is then injected in 5ml aliquots with aspiration between injection to a total of 20ml each side.  Appropriate placement will be judged as production of an echolucent plane between the two muscles.  Visible separation of muscle bundles of the internal oblique considered superficial placement.  Separation of muscle bundles of the transversus abdominis indicates deep placement.  Superficial or deep placement requires the needle to be repositioned.


Intervention drug
The active treatment arm will receive 20ml of 0.5% ropivacaine on each side (total 200mg ropivacaine).  The placebo arm will receive 20ml saline on each side.  The local anaesthetic duration of action is expected to be between 12 and 24 hours.</interventions>

    <concealment>All patients undergoing elective caesarean section at the Mater Mothers' Public and Private Hospital are eligible.

When patients are booked for elective caesarean section in the obstetric clinics, they receive the information sheet about this research.

An opportunity is given to all patients to discuss the study before the day of surgery with an anaesthetist.  This occurs either at the anaesthetic clinic or by telephone interview.  Patients are then be approached on the day of surgery in the admissions area by the investigator.

Allocation to placebo or treatment group is by sequentially numbered syringes filled with either placebo or local anaesthetic by the pharmacy.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a local anaesthetic technique that has been developed in recent years for pain relief after abdominal surgey.  It has been shown to work after caesarean delivery when performed by skilled operators.    We aim to test an ultrasound guided approach to this block for pain relief after caesarean section.  Women having elective caesarean sections will be randomly allocated to receive an ultrasound guided TAP block with local anaesthetic or placebo in addition to standard pain relief including morphine.  We hope to find women who receive the local anaesthetic have better pain relief, need less morphine and have fewer side effects from morphine after caesarean section.</summary>
