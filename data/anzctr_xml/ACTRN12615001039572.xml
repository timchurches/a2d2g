  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three bedding intervention groups; receiving either feather, wool or synthetic sleepsacks for their infant to use to sleep in during their first 2 years of life. All participants will receive a heating voucher of $200 to their power accounts to use during their infants first winter. Parents will be given advice about what temperature to heat infant bedrooms to, based on WHO guidelines (18-22Â°C). Participants will be contacted every 6 months to remind them to use the sleepsacks.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by the staff of Parents as First Teachers (Naku Enei Tamariki Boards), who see pregnant women as part of the services they provide. Mothers will be invited to take part in the study and will be provided with a detailed information sheet. Those that are willing and eligible will be enrolled into the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to a bedding group using a computer generated randomisation programme. Allocation concealment will be performed by sealed opaque envelopes. All sleep sacks will be assigned a random number matching that of the computer programme to be given to participants. The researchers do not know which group the participant will be assigned to, so allocation to the study groups is concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation will occur by using a randomisation table created by computer software and applied at the time of enrollment. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Power, sampling and analysis: The primary outcome will be a parental reported history of wheezing during the first two years of life. The primary analysis will be will be a multivariate logistic regression with wheezing as defined above as the primary outcome and the sleepsack which was assigned as the independent variable, this model will be adjusted for significant confounders . Secondary outcomes will be similarly analysis by a  multivariate logistic model

Power: Our previous population based birth cohort study found the prevalence of reported wheezing in the first 15 months of life was 35%.  Each of the three groups will consist of 150 infants.  Allowing for 12% loss to follow-up, the proposed study will have 88% power to show an absolute reduction in wheezing from 35% to 20% by any bedding type (alpha 0.05).  The secondary outcome of atopy is equally well powered.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cold and damp housing have been shown in many studies to be linked to asthma in children. We have shown recently that dampness is also related to the onset of wheezing in New Zealand children.  In this study we are looking at how improving insulation and heating, and how using different types of infant bedding, might help prevent wheezing and asthma in young children. This research is part of He Kainga Oranga Housing and Health Research Programme conducted by the University of Otago Wellington, funded by the Health Research Council of New Zealand. </summary>
