  <interventions>
    <interventions>Driver Safety Behaviour Change Program  a driver safety behaviour change program consisting of an online self-assessment of driving risk questionnaire, a group session regarding driving patterns and behaviour (known as group session 1), an on-road coaching session, and a final group session regarding driving patterns and behaviour (known as group session 2). The self-assessment questionnaire takes approximately 20 minutes to complete, both group session 1 and group session 2 take 3 hours, and the on-road coaching session takes 2 hours. The timings between each course session are as follows: the self-assessment questionnaire is completed within 0-14 days of the participant attending group session 1, the on-road coaching session is completed 7 days after group session 1, and group session 2 is completed within 14 days of attending the on-road coaching session.  All group sessions and on-road coaching sessions are facilitated by trained instructors who are employed by the Centre for Adult Education (CAE). The CAE are contracted to VicRoads to deliver the training program in Victoria and NSW. The intervention is being undertaken with new drivers in Victoria (randomised control trial (RCT)/Quantitative Trial) and new drivers in New South Wales (NSW) (Process Trial). There are no differences in the intervention between Victoria and New South Wales participants  there are no control participants recruited in New South Wales.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group is active, they are asked to complete three surveys which are completed at the same time as the Treatment participants. The survey timings are: pre-program (between 30-90 days after obtaining P1 licence), 1-month post-program, and 12-months post-program. The surveys take ~20 minutes to complete and are all administered online. The surveys cover the following areas: Self-reported crashes, self-reported driving exposure, driving behaviour (based on Driver Behaviour Questionnaire), driving style (based on 11 items using visual analogue scales), awareness of accident risk factors (5 items out of a possible 22 items are selected as the factors that are most important in causing serious accidents  this question is repeated using the same 22 items for the least important factors), and the key ingredients for behaviour change are measured via self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, subjective norms, and intentions The control group is only relevant for the Victorian trial, that is in New South Wales only Treatment participants are recruited because the New South Wales sample of participants are evaluated via the Process Evaluation whereas the Victorian participants are evaluated via the Quantitative Evaluation.</comparator>

    <summary>Participants will be recruited from Metropolitan Melbourne, and the following regional areas of Victoria: Geelong, Bendigo, and Ballarat.

This project aims to inform policy development and implementation in regards to novice driver safety, by:

1. Quantifying the effectiveness of the Driving Safety Behaviour Change Program versus Usual Practice in terms of improved outcomes, both primary and secondary (self-reported and police crashes, and reported traffic offences), within 18-months post licensing; and
2. Identifying factors (self-reported road safety behaviours) which predict optimal response to the intervention and quantifying the relationship between these factors and the treatment response.</summary>
