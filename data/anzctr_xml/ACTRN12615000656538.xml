  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who meet the trial eligibility criteria following screening and review of blood test results will donate a 250-300 mL blood sample. 

The investigational product is autologous CMV-specific T cells, stimulated with autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) coated with synthetic CMV epitopes. Approximately 200-400mL will be collected from eligible participants in order to generate the investigational product. 

GBM patients will be given up to six infusions every 2 - 4 weeks of 1-2 × 10^7/m^2 autologous CMV-specific T cells. The timing of adoptive transfers will be at the discretion of the clinical investigator, based on the patients chemotherapy schedule, and the number of cells infused is based on the height and weight of the patient and the number of cells grown. 

The cells will be thawed into 20 mL saline, and will be administered to patients intravenously. The T cells will be administered to the patient over 515 min by Prof Walker or an appropriately trained delegate. This will allow the slow administration of T cells into the blood. 

Participants will be followed up to 1 year from the final cell infusion.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of the adoptive transfer of autologous CMV-specific T cells into patients with primary GBM as an adjuvant to standard chemotherapy/radiotherapy. This outcome is assessed using adverse events as well as full blood count, electrolyte and liver function tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse event monitoring, clinical examinations and vital sign monitoring are conducted at each infusion.This outcome is assessed at each treatment (approximately every 4 weeks for up to 6 treatments) and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 months after the last treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if autologous CMV-specific T cells can be generated to clinical scale from the blood of patients with primary glioblastoma multiformae. This will be determined by calculating the proportion of patients for whom the minimum number of 2 doses of T cells can be generated (ie two vials of 2 x 10^7 cells/m^2).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>For each patient, the feasibility of generating the T cell therapy will be known approximately 5 weeks after the collection of 250-300 ml blood for therapy generation.

    <concealment>Patients will be identified by the Clinical Investigator based on suspicion of GBM (if the patient is already under the care of the Clinical Investigator), or they will be referred to the Clinical Investigator following diagnosis of GBM.  Patients will initially be approached to participate in QIMR Berghofer project P158—a monitoring study for patients with brain tumours. They will be provided with a P158 Participant Information and Consent Form (PICF), and the monitoring study discussed with them. If the patient provides their consent to participate in P158, they will donate blood for testing. The results of these tests may be used as part of the screening required for this trial if the patient is later confirmed to have GBM and agrees to participate in the trial.
For patients identified prior to surgery, tumour type will be determined by an accredited pathology laboratory via analysis of the removed tumour specimen.  In cases where the patient is confirmed to have both GBM and CMV, they will be provided with the PICF for this clinical trial. This form describes the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. Also discussed in this form is the possibility that no direct or immediate benefit may be achieved by this therapy, and that unforeseen toxicity may occur, which will be treated unconditionally at the attending hospital. The Clinical Investigator will conduct the informed consent discussion, answer any questions about the study, and check that the participant comprehends the information provided. Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion. 
The Investigator who conducts the consent discussion will also sign the PICF, attesting that they have provided the relevant explanation. A copy of the signed form will be given to the participant. 
Each participant will undergo further screening which will involve a clinical evaluation, recording of medical history, and an ECOG performance scale assessment. In addition, up to 30 mL of blood will be collected for further assessments, to be completed by an accredited pathology laboratory. If a participant is screened and does not meet the eligibility criteria for the trial, they will be notified by telephone. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria following screening will be notified that they are formally enrolled, and an appointment will be made for the collection of blood for therapy generation. A 250–300 mL blood sample will be collected to generate CMV-specific T cells for up to six adoptive transfers of T cells. Once these cells have passed quality assurance assessment, treatments will be scheduled. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>With an expected drop-out rate of 10% and a sample size of 20, the effective sample size will be 18. Power calculations are generated based on the effective sample size of 18.

The probability of observing at least one participant experience an AE in a sample of 18 participants receiving the investigational product (including 10% dropout) is 0.98, if the probability of that event occurring is assumed to be 0.2. If the proportion of people who experience an AE is &gt;0.5, we will be
able to say with 80% power and 5% statistical significance, that the probability of an AE is &gt;0.1.

Any missing data will be obtained from source documents. Where such data are not available, statistical methods will be employed to ensure that a valid statistical analysis can still be performed. For example, summary statistics will be used for each participant. Any changes or deviations from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the Clinical Study Report. Every attempt will be made to avoid any deviations from the original statistical plan.

No interim analysis is planned for this study. Twenty participants who have received at least two adoptive transfers of the investigational product will be used in the statistical analysis. When a participant receives less than two adoptive transfers of the investigational product, they will be recorded as having withdrawn from the study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is assessing the safety and tolerability of using T cell therapy targeting human cytomegalovirus (CMV) in treating brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with primary glioblastoma multiforme, and have human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive serology or positive staining for CMV in tumour tissue.

Study details
A blood sample will be taken from patients in order to grow the cells for the experimental therapy. These cells, known as T cells (a type of white blood cell) will be grown in the laboratory from each patients blood sample. Following generation of the T cell therapy, the participants will commence T cell infusions. The specific timing of each infusion will be dependent on the participants chemotherapy regimen. Treatment consists of 2 to 6 infusions (each taking 5-15 min) of T cells, and patients are monitored for 12 months afterwards to see if the treatment is safe.

It is hoped that the development of an immunotherapy as an adjuvant to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy will reduce the rate of tumour recurrence in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. </summary>
