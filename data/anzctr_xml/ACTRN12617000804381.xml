  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will focus on finding the right dose of aspirin for cancer prevention in people with a mismatch repair (MMR) gene defect, the underlying cause of Lynch syndrome, also known as HNPCC (Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a confirmed hereditary gene defect in one of the mismatch repair genes; MSH2, MLH1, PMS2 or MSH6 manifesting a classic Lynch syndrome phenotype.

Study details
All study participants will take daily aspirin tablets for duration of two years but will be allocated by chance to one of three different doses (100mg, 300 mg or 600mg). Study investigators will not know which dose any participant is given and you will not be aware of the dose that you are taking. We will then measure number of participants that develop cancers over 5 years. 

Our previous study CaPP2 showed that 600mg of aspirin was effective at reducing the risk of cancer in people with Lynch Syndrome and in this study (CaPP3) we would like to determine if 100mg and 300mg of aspirin will be as effective as the higher dose. Taking lower doses of aspirin carries lower risk of side effects such as stomach bleeding occurring.</summary>
