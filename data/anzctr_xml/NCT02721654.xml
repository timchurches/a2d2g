    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Plasma-Lyte 148®
Treatment: drugs - 0.9% sodium chloride

Experimental: Plasma-Lyte 148® - Following randomisation, each study participant will receive either Plasma-Lyte 148® or 0.9% saline alone for all resuscitation episodes and for all compatible intravenous crystalloid therapy while in ICU (for up to 90 days).

Active Comparator: 0.9% sodium chloride - Following randomisation, each study participant will receive either Plasma-Lyte 148® or 0.9% saline alone for all resuscitation episodes and for all compatible intravenous crystalloid therapy while in ICU (for up to 90 days).


Treatment: drugs: Plasma-Lyte 148®
Plasma-Lyte 148 (approx pH 7.4) IV infusion is a sterile, clear nonpyrogenic isotonic solution &amp; when administered intravenously it is a source of water, electrolytes &amp; calories. Plasma-Lyte 148 intravenous infusion is indicated as a source of water &amp; electrolytes or as an alkalinising agent.

Treatment: drugs: 0.9% sodium chloride
The active ingredient is sodium chloride formulated in Water for Injections. The chemical name is sodium chloride with molecular formula NaCl. Sodium Chloride (0.9%) intravenous infusion preparation is a sterile &amp; non-pyrogenic solution &amp; is indicated for extracellular fluid replacement &amp; in the management of metabolic alkalosis in the presence of fluid loss, &amp; for restoring or maintaining the concentration of sodium &amp; chloride ions. As sodium chloride intravenous infusion is administered to the systemic circulation by intravenous infusion, the bioavailablity (absorption) of the active components is complete (100 per cent).

    <inclusivecriteria>-  The patient will receive fluid resuscitation defined as a bolus of fluid, prescribed
             to be administered over one hour or less to increase or maintain intravascular volume

    <summary>The aim of PLUS is to conduct a multi-centre, blinded, randomised, controlled trial (RCT) to
      determine whether fluid resuscitation and therapy with a "balanced" crystalloid solution
      (Plasma-Lyte 148®) decreases 90-day mortality in critically ill patients requiring fluid
      resuscitation when compared with the same treatment using 0.9% sodium chloride (saline)</summary>
