  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised crossover study patients will be studied on their usual home oxygen (Control) and on AIRVO (Treatment).

Treatment
* Patient receives usual home oxygen while equipment is set up (20 minutes) 
* Baseline observations on usual home oxygen will be recorded (20 minutes) 
* Participant receives treatment/control (20 minutes)
* Washout period on usual home oxygen (20 minutes)
* Participant receives treatment/control (20 minutes)
* Recovery period on usual home oxygen (20 minutes)

Note:
*Usual home oxygen - patient receives the usual oxygen flow rate received at home via their own cannulae
*AIRVO - oxygen flow into the Airvo system is titrated to give an oxygen saturation the same as the patient receives on their own cannulae along with a flow of 30L/min

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be enrolled via telephone consent and randomly allocated to receive the control (usual home oxygen) or  treatment (AIRVO) first. Following the washout period the participant will receive the alternate arm control/treatment. Identical numbered opaque sealed envelopes containing the randomisation order will be prepared by non study staff.  It will not be possible to blind the patient, clinical staff or study staff to the treatment allocation. The statistician will be blinded to treatment allocation. </concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a table created by computer software will be generated. Identical numbered opaque sealed envelopes containing the randomisation order will be prepared by non study staff. The randomisation order will be revealed immediately prior to study commencement.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide. In addition to generating high healthcare costs, COPD imposes a significant burden in terms of disability and impaired quality of life. Unlike many leading causes of death and disability, COPD is projected to increase in much of the world as smoking frequencies rise and the population ages.

The  use of home oxygen for hypoxic COPD patients has increased since studies have shown improved survival. Home oxygen however is cold and dry and may be uncomfortable and lead to thickened secretions.

This study aims to assess the feasibility and short term physiological respiratory changes caused by using an alternative device AIRVO (high flows of warmed and humidified air enriched oxygen ) versus the currently used home oxygen (low flow oxygen therapy).</summary>
