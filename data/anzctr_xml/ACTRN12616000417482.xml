  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study was a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, cross-over trial with a four day wash out period between two phases. The wash out period was selected as large alkaline loads are known to be excreted within 1  2 days following their caseation. 

The intervention consisted of a powdered fruit and vegetable supplement. 15g of the supplement was consumed in water 3 times daily for 3 days. To ensure compliance, the participants were met daily and questioned on their intake. The supplement was approved as safe by the University of the Sunshine Coast's Human Ethics committee (reference number: S/14/70). The supplement is also commercially available.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in 24-hour urinary net acid excretion (NAE) as assessed by 3-step back titration. The methods are described below. 

24-hr urine sample were analyzed by a calibrated labChem pH meter (TPS Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia) at ambient temperature and 36.5+/-0.5 degrees Celsius. Creatinine was measured spectrophotometrically by a colorimetric detection kit Cat no. 09151410 (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, USA) using a multiscan GO plate reader (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Ammonium was measured using methods of Rice et al by flow injection analysis using a Lachat QuikChem Registered Trademark 8000 (Lachat Instruments, Wisconsin, USA). Titratable acids and bicarbonate were measured in duplicate by methods of Litkowski and Wilson with the following modifications. Briefly, after addition of 0.05 M hydrogen chloride to 20 ml urine samples, simmering occurred for 20 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius. Concurrently, a blank was run in the same manner using MilliQ water (Milliport Corp., Bedford, USA). After samples cooled, bicarbonate was determined as the amount of 0.05 M sodium hydroxide necessary to titrate back to the initial pH at ambient temperature less the corresponding value for the blank. Thereafter, titratable acid was determined as the amount of 0.05 M sodium hydroxide necessary to titrate to pH 7.4 from the bicarbonate end point. The mean of the duplicates was used for the calculation of NAE and the intra-assay CV was 8.0 percent. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Difference between 24-hour net acid excretion on day 3 of the placebo as compared to day 3 of supplement.  </timepoint>

      <outcome>In addition to the intervention study, this study also consisted of a validation study. That is, the accuracy and precision of net endogenous non-carbonic acid production as estimated by the Frassetto as well as the Remer and Manz equation was compared to the gold standard of 24-hour urinary net acid excretion.  For the purposes for this form, these could be considered composite outcomes. To estimate the equation, weighted food diaries were collected and diet compositions were determined using Foodworks Professional (Xyris, Brisbane, Australia) using the Australian food database (NUTTAB 2010 Australian Government Nutrient Database, Canberra, Australia). When food items were missing, nutrients were entered according to nutrient information on the food label.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Equations were computed using dietary data from the concurrent 24-hr urinary collection periods which occurred on the third day of each phase. </timepoint>

      <outcome>In addition to the aforementioned validation study, this study also consisted of another validation component. That is, it sought to elucidate the relationship between spot-tested urine pH in the first morning void and 24-hour net acid excretion.

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of an a priori power using G-power 3 (Dusseldorf University, Dusseldorf, Germany) identified a required sample size of 11 participants to observe an expected change of 0.45 pH units in the first morning fasting urine following a potential renal acid load (PRAL) modulation of -23 mEq/d. Consequently, 16 adults were recruited to allow for attrition. 

To determine whether pH could index NAE, regression analyses with 95 percent prediction intervals were used. Independent samples was assumed and prior checking occurred for linearity, independence of error terms (Durbin-Watson), normality of residuals, heteroscedasticity and outliers (+/-&gt;3 SD). To assess the ability of spot-tests (last evening and first morning) to track changes following NEAP modulation, a two way ANOVA with repeated measures (days X treatment) was used. Data was checked for normality, outliers (+/-&gt;3 studentised residuals) and sphericity (Mauchlys test). In the instance a participants food intake drifted resulting in a PRAL deviation of &gt;3 mEq on any day during cross over, the participant was excluded from the ANOVA and consequently their case was removed. Non-normal data was transformed by square root and again, assumptions checked. Effects sizes were calculated as partial eta squared (?2). Additionally, the average of the maximum and minimum spot-tests on the days where all voids were spot-tested is reported, as is the percent of participants whom had maximum and minimum pH units &gt;1.5 pH units apart.

To assess the capacity of the supplements to modulate NEAP, paired t-tests were computed for the primary (24-hr NAE and urine pH) endpoints. In addition such analysis was carried out on the second morning spot-test. For these analyses, only participants whose intake drifted (&gt;3 mEq) on the day of the 24-hr collections were excluded. Outliers (by boxplot) and normality of difference scores was checked, while, effects sizes were calculated as Cohens d. These statistical analyses were completed using Microsoft Excel (XP professional edition; Microsoft Corp, Redmond, USA), SPSS version 11 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA) and MedCalc (MedCalc Software, MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium). Summary data is presented as mean +/- SD. Two-tailed significance was accepted at P equal to or less than 0.05 and the Shapiro Wilk test was used to accept normality at P equal to or greater than 0.05.

To assess the agreement between estimated and analysed NEAP, the Bland and Altman method with repeat (duplicate) non constant observations (i.e., one observation during the placebo period and one observation during the supplement period on the same participant) was used. Equations were computed using dietary data from the concurrent 24-hr collection periods. The distribution of the differences was checked and outliers (+/-&gt;3.0 standard deviations (SD) of the difference) excluded. As non-constant observations require equal replications, those with unequal replicates were excluded. A priori limits of agreement were set at +/-15 mEq/d as this would permit a reasonable estimation of NEAP in individuals and also account for imprecision in the criterion method. These statistical analyses were completed using MedCalc (MedCalc Software, MedCalc, Mariakerke, Belgium).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The normal foods people eat release both acid and alkali into the human body. This is called the dietary acid-alkali load. Powdered vegetable (greens) supplements are currently marketed as alkalising to the body and are used by the public for this reason. The extent these supplements influence the dietary acid-alkali load has received little scientific attention. As such, this research will evaluate their capacity to modulate the dietary acid-alkali load. In addition, it may be possible to monitor the dietary acid-alkali load by urine pH (that is, by urine dipsticks). As such this research also aims to explore urine pH before and following greens supplementation</summary>
