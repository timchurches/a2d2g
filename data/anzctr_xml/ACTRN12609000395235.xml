  <interventions>
    <interventions>Quadrapolar Neuromagnetic device, Magnetic Flux Generator(MFG),  (Qmagnets tm)  These consist of 4 centre charged
 12 500 gauss magnets with alternating polarities that produce steep field gradients that are purported to have physiological effects.  Active magnets will be applied to particpants for a one week period with a one week period wash out and one week period of wearing a placebo device.  The participants will be computerized random coding system.  The researcher will be blinded to active and passive device intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo neuromagnetic device consists of nonmagnetised material the same size and weight of the active device with no magnetic field to side of application to knee.  On the outside of the device a flexible bipolar magnet with no steep field gradient, yet is sufficient to hold a paper clip. This placebo has been manufactured to maintain the blind for the participant and the researcher that a 'placebo magnet' is being used.  The crossover period will be one week of active devices,  one week washout and one week of placebo device.  Both researcher and participant will be blinded.  There will be 4 devices worn for one weeke of each duration with a washout week in between.  Each participant will be allocated active and placebo new neuromagnetic devices.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via posters and flyers from local clubs and community groups via phone email.  They will be randomised into two groups with a double cross over.  Both groups will receive the active medical device for one week, with a one week wash out period and one week placebo device period.  Central randomization will be ensured using a computer-generating coding system and allocation will be concealed by a 'lucky dip' system of coded cards placed in a receptacle.  Codes will match a master sheet where the experimental protocol will be recoreded.  Investigator DH will be the only one having access to this master sheet.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation will be ensured by using a computer-generated coding system and participants will choose a code using a ‘lucky dip’ system of coded cards placed in a receptacle. Codes will match a master sheet upon which specific information regarding the experimental protocol will be recorded. Investigator DH will be the only person with full access to the master sheet</sequence>
