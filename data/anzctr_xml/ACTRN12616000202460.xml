    <interventions>Survey of emergency physicians investigating their experiences of using medical scribes in Emergency Medicine consultations 
(Scribe program being run in research capacity from October 2015 to September 2016, scribes training December to mid January, considered trained from mid-January onwards and utilised by physicians from mid January 2016 onwards (once trained)
(please see ACTRN12615000607572 - Walker, training and evaluating Australian scribes in Emergency Medicine and their impact on emergency physician productivity))

Measurement of the physician productivity (patients/hour) whilst allocated a medical scribe

Productivity analysis undertaken from January to September 2016

Interviews conducted with physicians. Conducted with independent interviewer. Two physicians who chose to decline the use of a scribe interviewed to determine their reasons for declining, and to identify any concerns that they have regarding the use of medical scribes. 

Physicians who elected to work with medical scribes are interviewed to further identify their concerns and description of their experience using scribes. Interview questions are formulated based on themes reported in survey</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, Emergency Physicians in Australia perform a significant amount of clerical tasks in the provision of direct patient care. These clerical tasks may take up to 44% of the time dedicated to an individual patient and include the writing of notes, obtaining results, faxing and organising investigations, contacting other healthcare providers and billing. More broadly, the aging population and increasing use of the healthcare system in Australia, coupled with restrictions on the funding of healthcare is mounting pressure on emergency departments to make productivity gains and ensure their economic sustainability. 

Currently, physicians in the Cabrini Emergency department see 1.0 patients per hour on average however 2-3 patients per hour are seen with the assistance of medical scribes in other health systems (1,2). This gain in productivity forms an economic basis for the use of scribes in emergency departments, but the implementation of a scribe program can be a daunting experience to the physicians they work with.

For a physician to work well with a scribe and improve their productivity they need to work differently, working in a team with their scribe, trusting the scribes work; letting go of administrative tasks and focusing on higher-level cognitive tasks for the majority of their time. This probably requires a good working relationship with their scribe and a positive experience of using a scribe. 

Physician experience with scribes is not yet broadly described, however Hess notes that 60% of their providers liked or really liked having a scribe whilst 9% would be happier if they werent allocated a scribe. 

Initial work at Cabrini describes marked differences in productivity gains between providers.  There is no work published to date on the experiences of emergency physicians who like or dont like having scribes and how this relates to the economics gains (or not), of the providers.

Work is required to identify what a provider experiences when working with a scribe. What issues are anticipated before working with a scribe? Are these issues real issues as they work scribed shifts? Are there common themes of concerns about scribe utilisation? Can these barriers or concerns be described so that solutions can be considered? How do these concerns relate to productivity gains for each provider?

This study aims to investigate the common concerns faced by physicians during the implementation of a scribe program and to compare these to the concerns held once the program is established. This study also aims to correlate the concerns regarding perceived productivity with actual productivity data.
