  <interventions>
    <interventions>Progressive resistance training for 12 months.
This is a self-managed structured 40 minute resistance exercise regimen 3 times a week
with 8-10 exercises targeting the major muscle groups using adjustable dumbbells and body weight loading (i.e. calisthenics). Loads will yield 8-12 repetitions maximum per set and calisthenics exercises and loads will be advanced with strength adaptation. One week of exercise supervision (3 sessions) will be provided at baseline to instruct participants in proper lifting techniques and loading progressions by exercise phisiologist. Online instructional videos and a printed training manual will also be provided for each exercise. Follow-up supervised sessions will be provided one session every 8 weeks of the intervention. Compliance to training will be recorded in a training log by the participants.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation from our pilot data in 12 prostate cancer patients show that with 28 men in each group, the study will have 80% power to detect significant (0.05) difference in ADT-induced reduction in LBM, deterioration in muscle strength between the resistance training group and the non-training group of 0.83 kg and 1.8 kg, respectively. From previous published studies, a sample size of 15 subjects in each arm is required  to detect an increase in protein oxidation of 11% at a 80% power. Thus, 30 patients will be recruited in total.
Standard descriptive and statistical modelling approaches will be employed to analyse the data. Specifically, the treatment effects will be analysed by ANOVA with repeated measures. Regression analysis will be used to determine the correlations between physical activity scores and other endpoint measures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy of progressive resistance training for reducing the side effects of loss of muscle and increase in fat associated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 50-80 years and have been diagnosed with prostate cancer for which you are scheduled to receive ADT by a GnRH agonist.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to either the progressive resistance training group or the control group, who receive no training. Participants in the progressive resistance group will receive self-managed structured 40 minute resistance exercise regimen using dumbbells 3 times a week for 12 months.

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on the efficacy of progressive resistance training for reducing the loss of protein, muscle mass and function associated with ADT in prostate cancer patients. </summary>
