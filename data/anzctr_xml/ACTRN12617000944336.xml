  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, observational, multi-site study of patients scheduled for elective Invasive Coronary Angiogram (ICA).

Staff will apply the ACCESS Tool for patients booked for elective ICA at either the Royal Adelaide Hospital or The Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The ACCESS Tool is a statistical algorithm which was developed from data obtained from the CADOSA-Registry (ACRTN125000026527).  The process involves obtaining key information from the patient, e.g. past history, current symptoms, etc using a series of set questions. The patients responses to the questions are entered into the statistical algorithm by the research staff in order to calculate the patients probability of normal angiography. This will be done by phone within the week prior to the procedure or in person on the day of the procedure. 
The result of the statistical algorithm will be compared with the observed ICA findings. Each patient will only be observed during the hospital admission for the procedure, with no further follow-up required.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>At the conclusion of the Field Testing, we will undertake further validation of the ACCESS Tool using the data obtained during the Field Testing. A logistic regression model will assess the individual relationship between each variable collected and the ICA outcome (CAD present/absent). A multivariable stepwise logistic regression (backward elimination) approach will be used to estimate the probability of the ICA outcome and variables associated with p&lt;0.05 retained in the final, validated model of the ACCESS Tool. The goodness of fit of the final model will be evaluated using the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test. The discriminatory capacity of the ACCESS Tool will be assessed by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c statistic) as an index of model performance. The c-statistic reflects the concordance of predictions with actual outcomes in rank order, with a c statistic of 1.0 indicating perfect discrimination. In addition to ROC, the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the ACCESS Tool will be assessed. Accuracy of calibration will also be evaluated by plotting the predicted versus observed outcome. Once confirmed that the ACCESS Tool can perform well in a real-world setting (i.e. a sensitivity of &gt; 80% with a moderate-high AUC), the ACCESS Tool will be ready for use in the ACCESS Clinical Trial.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Invasive coronary angiography is the benchmark investigation for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) with approximately 6,000 performed in South Australian public hospitals each year. The ACCESS Program (The Assessment of Coronary artery disease using Computed tomography Effectively for Stable Symptoms) is a large project involving the development and application of a simple clinical tool to identify which patients are likely to have a normal angiogram amongst those scheduled for elective invasive coronary angiography. These patients can then be alternatively referred for coronary computed tomography angiography, a noninvasive technique that is safer and less expensive than invasive angiography yet has shown to be as reliable as the benchmark test in confirming the presence of normal coronary arteries. The ACCESS Tool has been retrospectively developed from a local cardiac procedures registry (CADOSA  Coronary Angiogram Database of South Australia) using statistical modeling techniques to pre-procedurally identify patients with a high probability of normal coronary angiography. To asses the effectiveness of this Tool in clinical practice, it is important to field test the ACCESS Tool prospectively as its utility may change when being by applied by hospital staff in a real-world setting. This current protocol refers to the Field Testing of the ACCESS Tool, whereby for a 3-month period, hospital staff will apply the ACCESS Tool to patients booked for elective angiography via a short phonecall. The outcome of the ACCESS Tool will be recorded and compared to the angiography findings. The sensitivity, specificity and receiver operator characteristics of the ACCESS Tool in practice will then be evaluated in preparation for a clinical trial.</summary>
