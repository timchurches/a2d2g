  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Nivolumab
Treatment: drugs - Ipilimumab

Active Comparator: Cohort 1 Nivolumab Monotherapy - Nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks, until disease progression, withdrawn consent, unacceptable toxicity or death.

Active Comparator: Cohort 2 Nivolumab Monotherapy - Nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks, until disease progression, withdrawn consent, unacceptable toxicity or death.

Active Comparator: Cohort 3 Nivolumab and Ipilimumab - Nivolumab 1mg/kg every 3 weeks x four doses and ipilimumab 3mg/kg every 3 weeks x four doses. After 12 weeks, nivolumab 3mg/kg alone every 2 weeks until disease progression, withdrawn consent, unacceptable toxicity or death.


Treatment: drugs: Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed cell death-1/PCD-1) with immunopotentiation activity.

Treatment: drugs: Ipilimumab
Ipilimumab is a recombinant, human monoclonal antibody that binds to the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Ipilimumab binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation. The mechanism of action of ipilimumab's effect in patients with melanoma is indirect, possibly through T-cell mediated anti-tumour immune responses.
