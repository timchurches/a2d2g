    <concealment>Patients aged between 6 month and above with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with Dihydroartemisinin and monitored for 42 days.

    <statisticalmethods>The assumed treatment failure rate to Dihydroartemisinin+Piperaquine in the area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 42-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per site. 

WHO excel software program will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition  patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis due to consent withdrawal, failure to complete treatment, enrolment violation, voluntary and involuntary protocol violation and if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.

The final analysis will include:
* a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
* a description of all the patients included in the study;
* the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
* the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
* the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 42, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in District  Headquarter Hospital Zhob of Balochistan province and Tehsil HQ Hospital Sadda Kurram Agency FATA, Pakistan

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections

Study Sites: study will be conducted in two hostpitals: health centres: District  Headquarter Hospital Zhob of Balochistan province and Tehsil HQ Hospital Sadda Kurram Agency FATA

Study Period: The study will be conducted from October  to December 2015

Study Design: Single arm prospective study.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months and above excluding 12-17 old female minors and unmarried females aged 18 years and above, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection 

Sample Size: 88 patients per site. For the two sites a total of 176 subjects will be enrolled.

Treatments and follow-up: Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine (daily dose for 3 days) will be given.

Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.

Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
