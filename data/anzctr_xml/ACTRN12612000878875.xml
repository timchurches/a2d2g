  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 10 in home coaching sessions while they attend a 14-18 week Incredible Years Parent Programme (IYP) to help personalise the parenting strategies and implement them in the home. The Incredible Years programme is carried out in groups of 10-16 participants for 2.5 hours weekly for 14-18 weeks. Each week a parenting strategy is covered. Parents learn together by reflecting on their implementation of new strategies, discussing key points, watching video examples, practicing new skills, and setting a goal for the next week. The number of IYP sessions is determined by the programme i.e Pre-school IYP is 16-18 sessions and School-Age IYP is 14-16 sessions. Facilitators are able to extend the number of sessions depending on the needs of the group. The in-home coaching is for an hour once a week in the participants home and supports the learning from the group sessions. It is one-on-one sessions but may also include other key family/whanau members and/or the children. The coaching involves reviewing the content of the last IYP session, practicing new skills, addressing any barriers, and setting specific goals.</interventions>
    <comparator>A randomised controlled trial. Eligible participants will come from up to 16 IYP groups delivered in the community by Ministry of Health, Non Government Agencies (NGO's) and Ministry of Education. All IYP programmes  are delivered according to the manualised protocol by trained facilitators. Groups are delivered in different locations within the region, on different days of the week and different times (evening and daytime) to allow for maximum access.  
Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to the treatment arm to receive additional in home coaching from the Incredible Years Specialist Service (IYSS) at the same time as attending the IYP group, or to the control group of IYP treatment with no additional intervention. Randomisatin will be stratified on each IYP group so that there are equal numbers in each arm of treatment. There will be one treatment group and one control group for this study.</comparator>

      <outcome>The primary aim of this evaluation is to collect data on the efficacy of the addition of IYSS as a structured home intervention, and thereby to test the feasibility of undertaking a larger prospective RCT trial and to inform power calculations for such a trial.

    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be eligible for inclusion in the trial if: -They are attending an IY programme. -Their child is over 3 years and under 8 years of age on the date of consent. -Parent/whanau Child Behaviour Scores are in the clinical range i.e. Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) Intensity scale greater then 127, Problem scale greater than 11,  OR Scores on Social Competence Scale (SCS) below 17. - Or one of the following risk factors is present: CYFS involvement, School exclusion Parent/whanau diagnosed with mental health disorder - They sign informed consent to participate in the trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>On completion of baseline data, participants will be randomised to IYP and IYSS or IYP alone. The randomisation will be undertaken using a computer generated randomisation sequence generated prior to the enrolment of any participants. The randomisation sequence will have a 1:1 ratio to the two treatments arranged in permuted blocks. After participants have met all inclusion criteria and signed the informed consent they will be allocated a study number. Study numbers will be submitted to a universtiy statisician who will allocate the next available randomisation allocation. The randomisation list will not be available to the primary investigator or to any researchers directly involved in the assessment or screening of participants. Randomisation will be stratified on age (under 5years and over 5 years,) sex, and ethnicity (Maori and non Maori), for each intervention group so that each intake or source group will have approximately equal numbers allocated to each treatment. </concealment>
