  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in patient reported pain intensity - Patient reported pain intensity is recorded as an average daily pain intensity using an 11-point scale (0 = no pain to 10 = worst pain possible).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Pain Score - The BPI is a nine-question survey completed by the patient that assesses quality of life and health status. BPI scores range from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating greater pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients' Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) - The PGI-C is a patient/patient's caregiver rated scale to assess the patients overall treatment response. PGI-C is a 7-point (1-7) scale rated as; very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinicians' Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) - The CGI-C is an investigator-rated scale to assess the overall treatment response. CGI-C is a 7-point (1-7) scale rated as; very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, much worse, or very much worse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in EuroQOL 5-dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) - The EQ-5D descriptive system comprised the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is rated by the patient at one of 5 levels, with level 1 indicating the best health state (no problems) and level 5 indicating worst health state (e.g., unable to walk about).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ-2) - The SF-MPQ-2 measures both neuropathic and nonneuropathic pain. It contains a total of 22 descriptors, which are rated on an intensity scale of 0 = None, to 10 = Worst Possible.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in bone turnover markers - Bone turnover is measured from 2 biomarkers collected from peripheral blood samples: serum carboxy terminal telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX) and serum procollagen type I N terminal propeptide (s-P1NP).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
