  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trial intervention is a probiotic provided by BLIS Technologies Dunedin.
The probiotic is a preparation of live bacteria in powdered form containing 100 million Streptococcus Salivarius K12, 400 million Lactobacillus Acidophilus L10, 400 million Bifidobacterium Lactis B94 per dose.
Each participant will take one dose of the probiotic twice daily for one week.</interventions>
    <comparator>The same patients taking the probiotic will act as controls.
The same metabolite levels of Sulphasalazine will be measured prior to starting probiotic and one month after completion of probiotic to determine the alteration of its levels whilst participants are on probiotic.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Probiotics are cultures of bacteria intended to impart a beneficial effect on the host.  Sulphasalazine, a drug frequently used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis, is split into two active ingredients by the resident bacteria of the normal human gut. Preliminary evidence from animal work suggests that there would be an increase in sulphasalazine metabolites when combined with probiotics.  This could alter its efficacy and side effects, which could be clinically important, especially as probiotics are now widely available and usually regarded as harmless.  There is little awareness about the interactions between probiotics and conventional medications either by health  professionals or the public.
We plan to carry out a pilot study of 12 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.  Patients will have a baseline assessment of their disease in rheumatology clinic and will have blood, 24 hour urine and stool analysed for sulphasalazine and its metabolites.  Subjects will then take probiotics for a week and have blood, urine and stool samples reanalysed.  They will also have a clinical assessment in clinic.  These tests will be repeated in a further 3 weeks after stopping probiotics.  Any patient becoming unwell during the time of taking probiotics will have earlier analysis.</summary>
