  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The target enrollment goal for the trial was to enroll 36 subjects. However due to a
      challenging protocol inclusion/ exclusion criteria, only one subject was enrolled since the
      trial was initiated in June 2011.

      To evaluate the following in participants undergoing coronary artery scaffolding/stenting for
      significant coronary artery disease:

        -  The acute (post-implantation) effect of an implanted bioresorbable vascular scaffold
           (BVS) or metallic drug eluting stent (mDES) on coronary blood flow and physiological
           responsiveness of the target coronary artery

        -  The long-term (2 years) effect of an implanted BVS or mDES on coronary blood flow and
