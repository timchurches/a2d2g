  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three treatment arms completed in random order by each participant, with treatments separated by at least one week: 1) Single 20mg dose Temazepam administered orally &amp; observed for 5hrs; 2)Orally administered alcohol doses resulting in two peak blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), 0.05% &amp; 0.08%, observed for 8hrs total with 1.5hrs between peak BACs; 3) Restricted sleep (4hrs) observed for 8hrs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each participant undergoes all treatments: 1) Single orally administered 20mg dose Temazepam controlled against single orally administered 20mg microcellulose placebo capsule; 2) Restricted sleep (4hrs) controlled against normal sleep (no treatment); 3) Restricted sleep (4hrs) and Single orally administered 20mg dose Temazepam compared to 0.05% and 0.08% BAC; 4) Ocular measure of drowsiness (Optalert) compared to electroecephalogram (EEG) and attentional performance measures.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The results of the study will examine the association between performance impairment on a simulated driving task and eye measures of drowsiness, induced by acute sleep loss, alcohol and hypnotic drug administration. These findings will help to determine the validity of eye measures as a countermeasure to fatigue-states, with the aim of reducing sleep-related motor vehicle accidents.</summary>
