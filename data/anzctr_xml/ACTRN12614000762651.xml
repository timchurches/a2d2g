  <interventions>
    <interventions>Suitable participants will be required to attend the CNRC 5 times over the period of 20 weeks. 

Participants will arrive at the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre (CNRC) following an 8 h overnight fast for further screening to determine study eligibility. Anthropometric measurements of height, weight and waist circumference will be obtained before clinic blood pressure (BP) and arterial compliance (AC) measurements are assessed. Those with clinic BP not within the study inclusion range will be excluded. Participants will be fitted with a transcranial doppler (TCD) headpiece supporting an ultrasound probe on each temporal region. An investigator will adjust the probes until a measurable blood flow signal is obtained in each middle cerebral artery (MCA) and posterior cerebral artery (PCA). If the investigator is unable to obtain a blood flow signal in the PCA, the procedure for cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to photic stimulation will not commence. However, if no measureable blood flow signal is detected in the MCA for the measure of CVR to hypercapnia, the participant will be excluded from the study. 

The dementia status of the participants will be determined using the Australian Version of the Modified Mini Mental State Examination (3MS). Participants scoring below 78/100 (considered an indicator of suspected dementia) will be excluded from this study. A blood sample analysis for the measure of Omega-3 index, pro-inflammatory biomarkers and blood lipids will be obtained from the participant. Due to the long fasting duration in the physiological assessment protocol (Part A), the psychological assessments (Part B) will be scheduled for the following day or within 7 days of completing the physiological assessments. This is to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, which would affect the neuropsychometric test performance. Participants will return for neuropsychological testing following a 4 h fast (no food/beverage, except water). The TCD headpiece will be refitted on the participants and probes adjusted to obtain a measurable blood flow signal in each MCA. Continuous recordings of changes in mean blood flow velocities during the neuropsychological test battery will be obtained. 

At the conclusion of the test battery, participants will be asked to complete a scale to assess mood states. In addition, a short questionnaire of ones dietary intake of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCn-3PUFA) and the Self-reported Assessment of Subjective Cognitive Impairment (as previously captured in the Health, Diet &amp; Lifestyle Questionnaire) will be administered at Visit 2 or 5 and for the purpose of determining test-retest reliability coefficients. Duration of the visit will last approximately 90 min. Light refreshments will be served at the conclusion of each visit.

Participants will be randomly assigned to a treatment arm using allocation by minimization (Altman DG, Bland JM. Treatment allocation by minimisation. Brit Med J. 2005 Apr 9;330(7495):843-.). They will be required to consume 4 supplement capsules per day for 20 weeks, preferably at the same time each day. To assist with compliance, participants will note down the time of capsule consumption in their supplement diary. A study investigator will contact the participants every 4 weeks during the intervention to check participants well-being and to remind them to consume their supplements. Participants will return at week 10 to be reassessed for Part A of the protocol. To minimize learning effects, Part B will not be assessed at week 10. The purpose of this visit is to maintain participant-investigator contact and to assess treatment compliance, as assessed by erythrocyte LCn-3PUFA levels. Measuring cerebrovascular function mid-way in the intervention will provide insight into the trajectory of improvement. Participants will continue taking their allocated supplement from week 10 to 20 before returning for reassessment physiological and psychometric assessments. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to hypercapnia is assessed using transcranial doppler ultrasound (Doppler Box X). Increases in blood flow velocity in the MCA in response to vasodilator stimuli (i.e. hypercapnia) reflect endothelial dilatation in downstream vascular beds. Basal cerebral blood flow velocities for 10 cardiac cycles will first be recorded to determine the blood flow velocity (peak systolic, end diastolic and mean) at rest. The measures of cerebral pulsatility and resistive indexes will also be recorded simultaneously. During CVR to hypercapnia, participants breathe carbogen (5% CO2, 95% O2) for 150 seconds and the peak increase of blood flow velocity is recorded.  This is performed 3 times with a 2-min interval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline at week 0, and at week 10 and week 20 after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seated clinic blood pressure and arterial compliance will be measured by automated oscillometry with a Cardiovascular Profiler (Trademark) (HDI Cardiovascular Profiler CR2000).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline at week 0, and at week 10 and week 20 after intervention commencement. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to photic stimulation will be assessed using transcranial doppler ultrasound. Increase in blood flow velocity in the posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) in response to photic stimulation is a robust activation paradigm that allows for the assessment of the relationship between local neuronal activities and regional blood flow in the cortex (neurovascular coupling capacity) (20). Protocol will take place in a quiet, dark room and a computer monitor will be placed 0.3m in front of the seated participant. The screen will occupy approximately 80% of the participants visual field. Mean blood flow velocities in the PCA will be recorded continuously during stimulation period. 

After a baseline recording of 1 min eyes open and 1 min eyes closed, CVR to photic stimulation protocol will consist of alternating between 60s eyes closed and 40s eyes open whilst (a) looking at the monitor with a white lighted and (b) looking at an image of complex scenery. Transition between eyes open and close will be signal by an acoustic tone. Previous literature found that the blood flow velocity in the PCA will peak within 20s of photic stimulation. Discarding the first 5 s during the eyes closed, an averaged velocity of the reminding 30s will be the baseline. The vasomotor reaction time will be recorded as the time taken to reach peak velocity after opening eyes. CVR to photic stimulation will be calculated as the percentage increase of peak velocity over baseline velocity.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebrovascular responsiveness to neuropsychological tests will be recorded continuously using transcranial doppler ultrasound to monitor the changes in mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) during cognitive assessments. To minimise the potential influence of artefact, CVR will be assessed only in the non-verbal tasks of the cognitive battery, i.e. all except the dual-task conditions.  The order of tests will be as follows:
- Choice reaction time test 
- N-back task
- Computerised multi-tasking test battery
- Trail-making task</outcome>

      <outcome>Mood states will be measured using a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire consisting of 65-adjectives that participants will rate on a 5-point scale. This will be administered on paper at the conclusion of the neuropsychological test battery. Participants will be required to rate the level at which they have been feeling in the last week and including today according to the 1-5 Likert Scale (1 being not at all and 5 being extremely). </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>In the intention-to-treat analysis, effects of LCn-3PUFA supplementation on primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed by two-way, repeated measures ANOVA with factors of time (baseline, post-dose) and treatment (placebo, LCn-3PUFA). Significant interactions (with appropriate correction for multiple comparisons) will be further explored by pre-planned comparisons of treatments at each time point using t-tests for independent samples. 
Baseline measures will be used as covariates. We will match groups by stratification of age and gender and other potentially confounding variables such as IQ, years of education and socioeconomic status will be added as covariates.   
Relationships between changes in circulatory parameters and cognitive parameters will be analysed by linear regression with appropriate pre-planned Bonferroni comparisons and the effect of biomarker status will be determined using biomarkers as covariates in a mixed model analysis.  
48 participants in a two-treatment parallel design will give 80% power to detect a 7.5% change in CVR to hypercapnia (relative increase ~25%) at alpha = 0.05, based on a 9% SD observed previously (Wong RHX, Howe PRC, Coates AM, Buckley JD, Berry NM. Chronic consumption of a wild green oat extract (Neuravena) improves brachial flow-mediated dilatation and cerebrovascular responsiveness in older adults. J Hypertens. 2013 Jan;31(1):192-200.). We will recruit a total of 60 participants to allow for a 20% attrition. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is postulated that impairments in circulatory function are central to the association between hypertension and declining cognition and mood. Regular long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) supplementation has the potential to enhance cerebral arterial function which may in turn enhance mood and cognition. This project aims to evaluate benefits of supplementing the diet with LCn-3PUFA on cerebrovascular function, mood and cognitive performance in hypertensive adults with low habitual intake of LCn-3PUFA. Sixty dementia-free adults aged 40-65 years with elevated blood pressure (BP) (130-160 mmHg systolic and 85-100 mmHg diastolic) at screening will undertake a 20-wk randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design omega-3 supplementation trial at the University of Newcastle. Eligible volunteers will undergo further baseline assessment of systemic artery compliance (AC) (pulse wave analysis), cerebral AC (pulsatility index), cerebrovascular responsiveness (CVR) to hypercapnic and cognitive stimuli (assessed by transcranial Doppler ultrasound), cognitive performance and mood. Participants will then be randomised to consume 4 capsules delivering 2g LCn-3PUFA or placebo daily for 20 wk before returning for reassessment. We expect that LCn-3PUFA supplementation will improve cerebrovascular perfusion and thereby enhance mood and cognition. Findings will advocate the use of LCn-3PUFA in hypertension management.</summary>
