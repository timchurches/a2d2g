  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 'Keep it Real' website will be evaluated by young Australians (16-25) who have used cannabis in the past month and have has a Psychotic-Like Experiences (PLEs). The outcome variables, cannabis use and the rate of PLEs, will be assessed at baseline for the treatment group, one month for the delayed group and three and six month for both groups.

The Keep it Real website consists of 6 modules as well as a page of contact details for resources a participant could use if they need to seek help. The modules include: 
1. What are weird experiences'? 
2. Why it is happening?
3. What are the types of weird experiences? 
4. How does cannabis affect me?
5. How can I deal with stuff?
6. Should I seek help?

Each module should take a participant approximately 10 minutes or less to complete.  The total time to complete all modules is expected to be 1 hour or less.

Participants will be asked to complete the 'Keep it Real' program within one month. They will have six months access to the website. During this time data will be collected about the use of the 'Keep it Real' website. Participants are able to access the website as much as they want once they have their login details. 

Participants will be sent a message (SMS text message or email) once a week for the first month of the trail to remind them to complete the program.  A maximum of three reminder emails will be sent for each follow up survey at the 1 month, 2 month, 3 month and 6 month follow-ups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the usability, acceptability and impact of the Keep It Real website for young cannabis users with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs).

Participants will be asked to evaluate a new website about cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs). This evaluation will determine the impact of the 'Keep it Real' website on PLEs and cannabis use in young people. 

180 participants will be given 6 months' access to the website. Half of these participants will comprise a waitlist control, whose access to the website will be delayed by one month. They will complete an online survey at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months' follow up. This will assess outcomes such as PLEs, cannabis use, psychological distress and functioning. Information will be collected about the number of times the website was used; the date, time and duration of each session; the sections of the website accessed and data entered.</summary>
