  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) To develop a Maori cancer support whanau programme including a framework of sustainability as a core component.  This includes designing the materials and activities, and additionally  interviewing key informants to inform the programme sustainability component. Key informants will be experts who have extensive experience in the area of research, policy, management level, and/or cancer service provision across the primary, secondary and palliative care cancer interface. The interviews will focus on positive features of cancer support programmes and the types of organisational processes (including community, workforce and policy environments) that are consistent with a sustainable Maori cancer support whanau programme. 
(2) To implement a Maori cancer support whanau programme.  The programme sessions are delivered in groups.  The six key areas to be covered in the programme include: knowledge of cancer; treatment; oncology services; support options; confidence building; coping and planning for the future.  The facilitators will be from the communities of each of the cases.  The programmes will run continuously over a one year period and participants will be invited onto the programme as they are identified by each MHP organisation.  Groups will be run once/fortnight (once/month over winter).  TThe duration of each session is not yet known and will vary depending on the needs and preferences of the group, however it is likely that each session will involve an hour of information sharing and another hour of whakawhanaungatanga (connection) and hakare (eating together).  The locations of the support groups are yet to be finalised, but are likely to be at local marae or other community meeting places where whanau will feel comfortable. 
(3) To evaluate the effectiveness of a Maori cancer support whanau programme.  This phase involves interviews with whanau who have taken part in the programme.  Informed consent will be obtained before interviews take place.  Interviews will be held at locations where whanau are comfortable such as their homes or marae.  They will be undertaken face to face with a trained researcher from the study team.  Programme documents will also be examined including panui, information kits and any other material generated from the programme,

After 1 year,  a sample of whanau (10 from each case) from each of the programme sites will be interviewed to explore the challenges and benefits following implementation of the programme.  With informed consent, semi structured interviews will be undertaken with participants, conducted by a trained researcher who is part of the study team
Whanau will be asked how they came to attend the programme and how participation has affected their lives, as well as their families. For example, aspects of participating in the programme such as gaining strength from sharing and learning with other whanau will be explored.  Additionally, participants will be asked if they have shared their knowledge with others in their whanau and community, and whether this has encouraged participation in, for example, screening programmes.

      <outcome>Programme sustainability will be explored with key informants who work in health policy. These interviews will be undertaken with experts who have extensive experience in the area of research, policy, management level, and/or cancer service provision across the primary, secondary and palliative care cancer interface.  With informed consent, semi structured interviews will be undertaken with participants by a trained researcher who is part of the study team. The interviews will focus on positive features of cancer support programmes, the types of organisational processes (including community, workforce and policy environments) that are consistent with a sustainable Maori cancer support whanau programme.  We plan to undertake approximately 10-12 key informant interviews. We will complement the information obtained from the key informant interviews with secondary data documents related to cancer support, including the six cancer treatment centres throughout Aotearoa/NZ and specific district health boards who provide information on cancer support available to patients.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Thematic analyses will be undertaken on the interview transcripts using the following steps: (i) familiarizing with the data by repeated reading of the transcripts; (ii) coding the transcripts by hand; (iii) searching for themes; (iv) reviewing and refining the themes using qualitative analysis software NVIVO (QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Australia); and (iv) comparing the established themes with the entire data set.  A paper trail will document methodological and analytic decisions to ensure procedural rigour.
We will then use a multiple case study analysis (Stake, 2006) which emphasizes better understanding of each of the cases included in the project as well as providing a basis for cross case comparisons. The initial framework developed for the whanau support programme will serve as the basis for this stage of the analysis that considers all of the data together (Aims 1-3).  Thus, a before and after programme implementation approach will be utilised to evaluate the key themes (for each case individually and also for cross case comparison) of: (a) whanau supportive care needs and whether the programme design successfully did or did not meet those needs including in its capacity to be dynamic based on the changing needs of the group; (b) MHP and/or policy environment; (c) whanau and community engagement (including cancer providers, clinicians, funders, managers, policy makers, community leaders);and (d) gaps and challenges in sustainability including the evidence and practice around sustainability and ways forward in terms of improving or promoting sustainable programmes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project seeks to address critical gaps in knowledge about supportive cancer care for patients and whanau using a kaupapa Maori model of care. The research involves three distinct phases (Aims 1-3), of a cancer support whanau programme within the three Maori health provider (MHP) organisations who are the co-investigators (CIs) on this study. 
Aim 1 - To develop a Maori cancer support whanau programme including a framework of sustainability as a core component. The cancer support whanau programme will be tailored to the working context of each Maori provider setting and the types/range of cancer services available to them. We will use Gruen et als (2008) integrated approach for health programme planning as a guiding framework for development of the programme incorporating the key features of sustainability, for exploring the data generated from the study (interviews with key informants, whanau participants and document review) and then its contribution to the evaluation and subsequent refinement of the programme.
 Aim 2 - To implement a Maori cancer support whanau programme.  A Maori cancer support whanau programme means incorporating tikanga, karakia, manaakitanga, pono, tika and aroha. These principles will be central to the way in which the training is carried out and will underpin the development and delivery of the programme itself. The whanau support programmes will run continuously over a one year period and participants will be invited onto the programme as they are identified by each MHP organisation. 
Aim 3 - To evaluate the effectiveness of a Maori cancer support whanau programme. After 1 year,  a sample of whanau (10 from each case) from each of the programme sites will be interviewed to explore the challenges and benefits following implementation of the programme.  Whanau will be asked how they came to attend the programme and how participation has affected their lives, as well as their families. Documents pertaining to the programme will also be examined. Host organisation factors will also be examined including the size of the MHP and distance to nearest cancer treatment centre, government responsiveness, policy and identified priorities for cancer care and cancer services. We will also review the programme in relation to aspects of sustainability, providing a platform for how to increase the likelihood of sustained effective programmes.  Additionally, we will explore how knowledge of sustainability and its influences could contribute to research agendas more broadly in terms of the translation and dissemination of effective practices at a national level alongside informing policy more broadly in the cancer control area. The evidence gathered from all of the study phases, development, implementation and evaluation, will contribute to refinement of the initial framework and development of a final version of the whanau support programme.
