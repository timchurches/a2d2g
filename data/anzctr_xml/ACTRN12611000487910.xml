  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of chronic administration of three natural supplements on cognition, cardiovascular function and biological measures.
The primary aim of this project is to determine whether 12 months administration of the natural supplements Bacopa monniera (EBm), Pycnogenol (PYC) and an antioxident/micronutrient combination formula improve cognitive functioning in a healthy older population. The
secondary aims of this project are to investigate the mechanisms underpinning any cognitive effects of EBm, PYC and the combination formula by examining the relationship between cognition, biochemical and cardiovascular measures and to investigate the time course of any
improvements. The study will follow a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, between-group design.
Participants will be required to consume one of four types of supplements (EBm, PYC, combination formula or placebo) daily for 12-months. We will measure performance on different cognitive tasks, mood, cardiovascular and biochemical measures before treatment (baseline), 3-months, 6-months and 12-months after consuming the treatment.</summary>
