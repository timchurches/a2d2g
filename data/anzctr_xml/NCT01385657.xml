  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint in the study is the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients treated with REGN668 or Placebo from baseline through Week 12.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary endpoint in the study is to characterize PK profile of study drug REGN668 from baseline through Week 12. - PK profile includes, but is not limited to, the following:
AUC: Area Under the concentration Curve computed from time zero to the time of last concentration of study drug
Cmax: the peak concentration of study drug
Tmax: time to peak concentration of study drug</outcome>
