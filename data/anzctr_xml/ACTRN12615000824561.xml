    <interventions>This RCT will compare traditional face to face rehabilitation to a telerehabilitation program. 

The study will comprise approximately 70 THR patients randomly assigned to a face-to-face group or telerehabilitation group. 

The telerehabilitation protocol will involve a program similar in timing and content to the face-to-face rehabilitation program, except delivery will be directly into the homes of the participant via telerehabilitation technology on an iPad. The application used to deliver this rehabilitation is Wellpepper Clinic by Wellpepper, Inc. Wellpepper is an application enabling healthcare professionals to create exercise programs that patients follow on a tablet device. The application provides notifications to complete the exercises, pre-recorded videos and instructions of their exercises and also enables the patient to record pain levels and difficulty at the conclusion of the exercise. Patients can contact their health care provider through a messaging system built in to the application. The healthcare professional has a clinic version of Wellpepper installed on a tablet that enables them to review and adjust exercises and communicate with all patients under their care. 
On discharge from hospital, participants randomised to the telerehabilitation group will either be provided an iPad with Wellpepper installed or if owning an iPad, have Wellpepper installed by a member of the research team prior to their discharge. They will undergo a single one to one twenty minute training session in the use of the Wellpepper application and eHAB system on iPads.
Telerehabilitation participants will have videos and instructions installed on to their Wellpepper application targeting strengthening exercises for quadriceps, hip abductors, extensors and flexors. They will receive three notifications per day via the Wellpepper application reminding them to perform their home exercise program (HEP). Participants will be expected to perform their HEP each time they receive a notification. Each HEP session will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. At the conclusion of each exercise they will be prompted by the application to record how much pain they experienced during the exercise and how difficult they found the exercise. Once recorded, this information becomes immediately available to the physiotherapist. A physiotherapist will review the Wellpepper clinic application weekly to review participants progress, adjust exercises as required and respond to any communication via the messaging system. Patients who have not accessed the application and recorded exercises in Wellpepper over 3 consecutive days will be contacted via telephone to discuss their progress. At two weeks following hospital discharge, participants will receive a thirty minute physiotherapy session via real time video-conferencing using the eHAB system. This session will enable analysis and advice regarding gait retraining and exercise progression. Following this session participants will continue to use the Wellpepper application to facilitate them performing their HEP for approximately twenty minutes, three times per day until six weeks post-operatively.

    <comparator>On discharge from hospital, participants randomised to the face-to-face group will receive usual care defined as: a paper HEP targeting strengthening exercises for quadriceps, hip abductors, extensors and flexors; they will be advised to perform their HEP three times per day and provided with an exercise diary to record exercise compliance; at two, four and six weeks post-operatively they will attend QEII Jubilee Hospital Physiotherapy Outpatients Department for a 30 minute face-to-face physiotherapy session with a focus on reviewing and progressing their HEP and gait re-training.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were conducted based on the primary outcome, the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). Using existing pre-post THR HOOS data, calculations using both a non-inferiority method and a test-of-difference method were undertaken to ensure sufficient powering of the study.
Method one used a non-inferiority power calculation as described by Jones 1996. 
 
Delta was taken from the minimally clinical important improvements (MCII) for pain, symptoms and Quality of Life (QOL) components of the HOOS as established by Paulsen 2014. Standard deviation values were taken from Duivenvoorden 2013  who investigated anxiety and depressive symptoms before and after THR using the HOOS as an outcome measure. The value used was the standard deviation of the change in HOOS pain, symptoms and QOL scores from pre-operatively to 12 months post-operative. Calculations were based on 80% power. Duivenvoorden documented change in scores for all five sub-scales of the HOOS however Paulsen only reported on three of the five sub-scales of the HOOS, pain, symptoms and QOL. Sample sizes were therefore determined using each of the three HOOS sub-scales, pain, symptoms and QOL. QOL values yielded the largest sample size of 30 per group.
Method two calculated sample size using the hypothesis testing method described by Lindsey 2001. 

 
 This method ensures adequate sample size so that any meaningful difference between groups will be detected. Values for   were taken from Duivenvoorden. The meaningful difference values used were MCIIs established by Paulsen. Effect size was assumed to be 0.5. QOL values yielded the largest sample size of 30 per group.
Both methods yielded a sample size of 30 per group. Accounting for a 15% drop out rate, a sample size of 35 per group is required, equating to a total of 70 participants.


Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses as recommended in the extension of the CONSORT guideline for non-inferiority trials will be performed. The treatment effect of each intervention will first be computed by comparing the pre-to-post intervention measures. Non-inferiority will be implied if the treatment effect of the telerehabilitation intervention is within the minimally clinical important improvement values of the control group. Treatment effects will be calculated on the pre-to-post intervention outcome. A secondary analysis will be performed on the post treatment to 6 month outcome. The clinical treatment effect of each intervention group will be further analysed using a one-tailed independent sample t-test on pre-to-post intervention changes across the range of outcome measures. An alpha level of 0.05 will be used for this analysis. In addition to intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputation (best subsets regression) will be used to replace missing data to determine its effect on the observed results.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total hip replacement (THR) is the gold standard for management of severe hip osteoarthritis. A rising trend has seen an increase of approximately 40% over the last decade with almost 40,000 THRs being performed in Australia in 2013. Systematic reviews have demonstrated the benefits of physiotherapy delivered physical rehabilitation programs following THR which are effective in increasing quadriceps, hip abductor, extensor and flexor strength, walking speed and cadence and function.

Although rehabilitation has clear benefits, many people who have had a THR find it difficult to access health care. The elderly demographic coupled with the risk of THR dislocation post-operatively can make travel difficult. Few patients can afford to self fund domiciliary rehabilitation and the public health system has limited scope to provide services outside of its centres. For patients living outside metropolitan areas access issues become magnified. 

This study will aim to determine if a telerehabilitation program delivered remotely is as effective as face to face rehabilitation in the THR population. 

The effectiveness of the telerehabilitation program will be determined via a randomised controlled trial comparing a traditional face to face rehabilitation program to a telerehabilitation program delivered directly in to patients homes.
