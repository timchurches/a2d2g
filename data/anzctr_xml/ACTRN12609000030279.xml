  <interventions>
    <interventions>A Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication involves repair of the crural defect in the diaphragm, together with a 360 degree wrap of the fundus of the stomach around the lower end of the intra-abdominal oesophagus. This is performed laparoscopically and is a single intervention</interventions>
    <comparator>Laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication involves repair of the crural defect in the diaphragm and fashioning a 270 degree posterior wrap of the oesophagus with the fundus of the stomach. This is a single intervention</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: surgery</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Long term outcome was measured by means of patient staistfaction scores of the following questions: would you have repeat surgery if you had to choose again/ would you recommend surgery to others/are you better off than before surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>For this particular study, these questions were asked to the entire study population at a fixed time point (2005), 4 years after the last patient was enrolled, as the focus of this study was long-term follow-up</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A computer-generated randomization chart for 100 patients was printed and kept in sealed opaque envelopes by the department secretary who did not otherwise particpate in the study. The randomization took place by means of a telephone call from theatre once it was determined that a laparoscopic anti-reflux operation was feasible. Patients and those collecting follow-up data were blinded as to the procedure performed.</concealment>
