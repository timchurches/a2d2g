  <interventions>
    <interventions>In order to investigate the equi-efficacy of DHEA (orally administered via oral strip technology) versus standard troche delivered DHEA. Oral Strip Technology (OST) encompasses a rapid drug releasing product that is presented as a dissolvable strip orally applied. This technology has been used for local action, rapid release products and for bucco-adhesive systems that are retained for longer periods in the oral cavity to release a drug in a controlled fashion. OST offers an alternate platform for molecules that undergo first pass metabolism and for delivery of compounds. Allocation: Non-Randomised, Treatment: 6 week run-in period on standard treatment (DHEA Troches 'lozenges'); 6 weeks treatment of new delivery system (DHEA oral strips)
Endpoint Classification: Efficacy and safety, Patient-specific dosing as per GPs instruction in the range of 100150 mg / day oral dose.
</interventions>
    <comparator>To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DHEA oral hormone strips in their equivalent therapeutic activity compared to standard DHEA treatment in a troche. 15 participants on troche for SIX weeks. 15 participants on strip for SIX weeks. </comparator>
