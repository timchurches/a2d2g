  <interventions>
    <interventions>An open trial of a CBT-based intervention for smoking, in conjunction with varenicline. The Intervention:
(a) The non-pharmacological component: The intervention will consist of 6 once-weekly sessions of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) of 1-hour duration, followed by three 1-hour booster sessions at weeks 8 and 10 and 12. Treatment will be delivered according to our treatment manual. Specific components of therapy include: case formulation and feedback from assessment, psychoeducation, motivation enhancement, mood/craving monitoring, mindfulness training, cognitive restructuring (identifying and managing unhelpful automatic thought patterns), enhancement of non-smoking related activities, pleasant events scheduling, coping with cravings (cigarettes), problem-solving, schema change methods, refusal skills and relapse prevention and/or management. During each therapy session, discussion and skills practice will focus on the particular unhealthy behaviours identified as most important/problematic by the participant.  Opportunities will be taken by the therapists to integrate messages/skill development about other lifestyle factors as appropriate.  Self-help material is provided throughout the treatment period, according to the unhealthy lifestyle behaviour being discussed in the session. 

(b) The pharmacological component: Varenicline will be provided to participants at each visit. Dose titration will follow that adopted by Gonzalez and colleagues (2006) and as outlined in the Monthly Index of Medical Specialties (MIMS) Australia (Oct/Nov 2008), viz.: 0.5mg daily  for days 1-3; 1mg daily for days 4-7, and 1mg twice daily (the target dose) from days 8 to 84.  The dose is administered by oral tablets.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking cessation.  The outcome will be assessed using the following measures: 1. Opiate Treatment Index (OTI,) to estimate average daily use of tobacco during the month prior to assessment, point prevalence and continuous abstinence.
2. Readiness and Motivation to Quit Smoking Questionnaire (Crittenden et al., 1994).
3. The Fagerstom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) (Fagerstrom et al, 1996).
4. Breath levels of carbon monoxide will be measured using a Micro 11 Smokerlyser.
5. The Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale Revised (self and observer rating).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, post 12 week intervention and 3 months thereafter.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life: This will be assessed using the abbreviated World Health Organisation Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF is a self-report generic quality of life instrument which assesses quality of life across four domains, including physical health, psychological wellbeing, social relationships and the environment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, post 12 week intervention and 3 months thereafter.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychiatric symptomatology will be assessed using the following measures:
1. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) a well-validated measure of psychotic symptoms.
2. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) a well validated self-report measure of depressed mood, with a specific item on suicidality.
3. The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) a widely used and validated assessment of manic symptomatology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, post 12 week intervention and 3 months thereafter.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>General functioning will be assessed using the following measures:
1. Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) clinician-rated indicator of general functioning.
2. The Medical Outcome Survey SF-12(Ware et al, 1995) - a 12-item measure of functional status relating to health.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, post 12 week intervention and 3 months thereafter.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rates of smoking are very high (&gt;70%) amongst people with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and this contributes to overall cardiovascular disease and other health risk, and contributes to premature morbidity. Current treatments  targeting smoking in this group have had unsatisfactory outcomes, leaving a major gap in service provision. This study aims to evaluate a validated cognitive-behavioural smoking cessation intervention together with Varenicline, a novel smoking cessation medication. Given that this agent has the potential to have psychiatric side effects in people with a predisposition to mental illness, comprehensive safety checks will be put in place to ensure safety of participants.</summary>
