    <studytitle>Treatment of Comorbid Depression and Substance Abuse in Young People</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A cross-over study to evaluate the effects of a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention, followed by a randomised trial of sertraline/placebo (for non-responders to CBT only) in the treatment of comorbid depression and substance misuse to improve outcome in depression and substance use levels.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a naturalistic, prospective study of a targeted two-stage intervention, comprising a 10-session Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) intervention and a randomised 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sertraline for partial and non-responders to the CBT intervention at week 6.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy measures: symptomatic improvement measured in change scores.  Self-report ratings of depression and substance use and clinician-rated measures of depression, substance use and functioning will be collected, and participants will be asked to provide several urine drug tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at baseline and followed up at weeks 16, 42, 68 and 120. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In addition, biological outcome and safety measures including vital signs, weight and routine clinical bloods will be reviewed from the clinical notes. For participants who consent to the genetic study, blood will be taken and assayed for the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). DNA will be extracted from the buffy coat of these samples and sent to the Australian Genome Research Facility for genotyping of the 5-HTTLPR alleles.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to treat a sub-sample of these young people with an adjunctive integrated CBT intervention and to examine the acceptability of this treatment approach within this population. In addition, this study seeks to explore predictors of treatment outcome so as to inform the further development of this integrated intervention. The study will also include a pilot placebo-controlled trial of sertraline for those young people who fail to or only partially respond to the CBT intervention, so as to determine whether adjunctive anti-depressant treatment improves clinical response in this population. The relationship between genetic variants of the 5-HTT and treatment response to both the CBT arm and SSRI treatment will also be explored.</summary>
