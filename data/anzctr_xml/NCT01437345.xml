    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All Outcome Measures - Establish a standardized muscle testing protocol including both manual and quantitative muscle testing as well as function testing for use in children and adults with infantile onset FSHD.
To describe the clinical phenotypes of infantile FSHD; separately in the early infantile group (onset before age 5) and late onset group (onset between 5 and 10 years of age).
To evaluate the impact of physical impairment, secondary health conditions, activity limitations and disability caused by FSHD on health-related quality of life and disability across different age groups; as well as to evaluate the utility of the FSHD clinical severity scale.
To evaluate potential genetic modifiers of clinical phenotypes and disease progression in infantile FSHD.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an observational study that aims to advance our knowledge on infantile onset
      FSHD. The study will include 50 participants of all ages who have presented with symptoms of
      FSHD between birth and 10 years of age. Study participation will involve a single day of
      assessments at one of the participating CINRG centers (to include physical exam, cognitive
      testing, eye exam, hearing test, strength testing and speech evaluations). The procedures may
      be split over additional days for scheduling purposes.</summary>
