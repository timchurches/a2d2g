    <concealment>Women with anticipated vaginal delivery were enrolled between 30 to 32weeks gestation after informing them in detail about the study during antenatal clinic. After, they were assured that their participation is entirely voluntary and an individual written consent was then obtained.   The consented women were allocated into either experimental or control using a randomisation sequence. Based on the sequence of treatments generated using this method, treatment groups (A and B) were written on pieces of cardboard paper, put into sealed opaque envelopes before they were given to study participants. Each opaque envelope had a serial number on it.  Those in the experimental group were informed to bring someone of their choice to  act as a companion during labour. The experimental group consisted of women that received routine care and social support while the controls received only routine care. Each study participant was monitored for clinical outcomes from the onset of established labour till two hours after childbirth.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence was generated using a table of random numbers. Random permuted blocks were used to ensure a balanced design. The blocks are the possible permutations of a sequence of four allocations - two women each belonging to the experimental and control groups. There are 6 possible arrangements of this sequence (ABAB, ABBA, BABA, BBAA, BAAB, AABB) - where A and B represent the groups. On the table, numbers 1 to 6 were assigned to each arrangement and those outside this range were excluded. Based on the sequence of treatments generated using this method, treatment groups (A and B) were written on pieces of cardboard paper and put into sealed opaque envelopes. Each of the opaque envelopes had a serial number on it.

Two trained research assistants (RAs) non-medical staff,  supervised the randomisation procedure at every ANC. On each clinic day, consented women that met the inclusion criteria were given serial numbers with allotted treatment group based on their arrival time. Only the statistician and RAs  had access to the list of numbers used to prevent clinicians’ influence on the randomisation..  Each subject opens the opaque envelope in the presence of the RAs, and the assigned treatment group was recorded on the woman’s medical record file.. The research protocol was closely monitored by the RAs to avoid bias and also, to ensure that all subjects were assigned to treatment groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Offering social support during childbirth is not practiced in most Nigerian health facilities despite lots of benefits that have been reported elsewhere. This support service involves staying be side women in labour by either her immediate relations  husbands, sisters or mother, or trained person (doula). The support person (companion) offers words of encouragements, pray, massage the back or hands, and also assist the woman in labour to express her views/concerns to the health care providers. The reported benefit includes shorter duration of labour; reduce risk of delivering by caesarean section, better satisfying labour experience and earlier time to initiate breastfeeding. This has made many hospitals in developed countries to adopt this policy in their maternity care despite availability of adequate method of pain relief during labour and childbirth. 
In Nigeria, women mostly delivered either at home or in mission houses where there labour is supervised by unskilled birth attendants. The policy at most Nigerian health facilities do not permit family members or trained support persons to be by the side of a woman in labour. In addition, pain relief practice is not optimally offered as there is no facility (manpower and equipment) for epidural analgesia.
The study explored the possibility of reproducing the benefits of social support in our settings and also seeks to determine whether it could be promoted as a potential strategy to reducing caesarean section rate as a primary outcome. The secondary outcomes measured were duration of active phase of labour, need for pain relief during childbirth, and experience during childbirth.</summary>
