  <interventions>
    <interventions>The ACT IYM included a number of intervention initiatives over the two year intervention period to support healthy nutrition and physical activity systems at school. School Project Officers participated in a two-day workshop prior to intervention commencement led by research investigators to inform on the aims of the intervention, to develop school specific objectives and action plans to meet aims and objectives. Intervention schools developed, implemented and evaluated a healthy food at school policy where foods available at school were categorised into 'traffic light' system based on nutritional quality. Red foods were low in nutritional value and were limited in the school. Schools addressed food technology streams to ensure nutrition theory and foods prepared at school were healthy. Foods available at school events were to be of nutritional value. Initiatives to support physical activity at school included increasing the number and range of organised sports at school, upgrading of equipment available for student use, and dedicating space for students to be physically active. Dedicated staff members were given roles of School Project Officers and were from Health or Physical Education backgrounds. School Project Officers championed change within schools and completed half yearly performance reports to monitor adherence to intervention objectives. 
ACT Government funded the ACT IYM, with intervention school receiving $50,000 for intervention related expenses such as equipment, staff hours and advisory services (Nutrition Australia for example), and comparison schools received $5,000. This program was a joint Australian, State and Territory Government initiative under the National Partnership Agreement on Preventative Health. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Australian Capital Territory It's Your Move is a community-based obesity prevention intervention for secondary school students, aiming to promote and support healthy nutrition and physical activity systems. It is expected that students experiencing healthier nutrition and physical activity systems will prevent an increase in the number of adolescents classified as overweight or obesity.</summary>
