    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a computer-based, patient controlled, interactive multimedia educational tool on knowledge transfer and patient learning in a foot and ankle private practice clinical setting.  This will be accomplished by identifying consecutive patients that are suitable candidates for hallux valgus correction, lateral ligament reconstruction, first metatarsal phalangeal fusion, morton's neuroma excision, or ankle arthroscopy surgery</outcome>

The surgeon will explain the study and instruct patients to confirm their willingness to participate in the trial during thier consultation at the Victorian Orthopaedic foot and ankle clinic.  After a discussion with the surgeon the patient will be asked to complete a knowledge questionnaire.  They will then be asked to watch the multimedia module and again complete the same questionnaire.</concealment>

    <summary>We hypothesise that multimedia patient education technology is superior to  the traditional surgeon patient verbal process of obtaining informed consent for a variety of orthopaedic procedures including lateral ligament reconstruction, hallux valgus deformity correction, first metatarsal phalangeal fusion, Mortons neuroma resection, and ankle arthroscopy.</summary>
