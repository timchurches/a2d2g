             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             Subjects with coagulation, reticulocyte, or Hgb values outside the normal range should
             always be excluded from enrollment.

             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory].

             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the
             opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere
             with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Subjects who have asthma or a history of asthma, (e.g., for any FTIH where risk of
             bronchoconstriction is unknown, or compound specific where risk of
             bronchoconstriction).

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

    <summary>GSK2251052 ((S)-3-(aminomethyl)-7-(3-hydroxypropoxy)-1-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1-benzoxaborole
      hydrochloride) is a Gram negative antibacterial compound currently in development for the
      treatment of hospital acquired Gram negative infection (including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and
      Enterobacter spp.) This study will be conducted in two (2) parts, with single oral doses
      being explored in Part A (500, 1000, and 2000 mg) and repeat oral doses (1000 and 2000 mg,
      b.i.d.) being explored in Part B. Parts A and B will be single-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled, dose-rising studies in healthy subjects to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral GSK2251052.</summary>
