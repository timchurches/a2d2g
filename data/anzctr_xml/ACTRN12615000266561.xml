  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effectiveness of using either radiotherapy or Imiquimod to treat lentigo maligna (LM), when surgery is not possible, is refused, or fails.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a biopsy proven LM. 

Study details: 
Surgery is the standard treatment for people diagnosed with LM. However for some people, it may not be possible due to the location of their LM lesion(s). 
Currently, the Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Treatment Guidelines recommend radiotherapy for the treatment of LM however there is no clinical trial evidence for this and a trial is needed to prove which treatment is safer and more effective. Some clinicians may also recommend the use of a cream called Imiquimod. Although not currently licensed for treatment use in LM, there is some evidence to suggest that it is both safe and effective in treating LM. 

Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to either standard care radiotherapy or 12 weeks of treatment with imiquimod cream 5 times a week. 

All participants will be followed up to 24 months and attend regular visits with their study doctor to monitor side effects and treatment response. </summary>
