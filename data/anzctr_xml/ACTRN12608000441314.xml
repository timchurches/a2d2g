    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio using a block randomization schedule to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or Placebo (normal saline) in an intravenous bag covered in black cover for masking.  The randomiser is an in-build computer program within an on-line web database and patient is assigned the treatment group after registration and confirmation of eligibility. A concealed print-out of treatment allocation will be passed to the ED nurse instructing the dose of tPA or placebo to be prepared. The treatment (tPA versus placebo) will be concealed to the neurologist, ophthalmologist and trial data collector/analyser.</concealment>
    <sequence>The method used to generate the sequence in which the subject is randomised is by simple randomisation by using a randomisation table from a statistic book.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is an eye Stroke,  usually caused by the blood vessel supplying the eye being blocked, resulting in the eye not working.  Usually, once the eye stroke occurs, the vision in the eye is severely affected and recovery is minimal. Unfortunately, most standard treatments at the moment do not improve vision.  On average, most patient are not able to see the biggest letter on the eye chart out of the affected eye after the eye stroke. 

Some centres overseas have looked at using the medication used in heart attack (tPA) in eye stroke using a procedure to deliver the medication to the blocked blood vessel.  The results are preliminary but promising.  Most of the studies delivers the drug through an invasive procedure to deliver the medication close to where the blood vessel blockage is near the eye.  Another way to deliver the medication is through a drip.  This is the method for treatment in acute stroke of the brain when people present within a certain time window.  
This study aims to see if admininstration of the medication through a drip may improve the vision in acute eye stroke yet reducing the side effects of bleeing.</summary>
