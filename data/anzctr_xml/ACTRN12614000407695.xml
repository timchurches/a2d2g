    <studytitle>Use of acetylcysteine as an adjuvant treatment for patients with acute organophosphorus pesticides poisoning</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In adult patients with acute organophosphorus pesticides poisoning could the use of N-acetylcysteine besides the standard treatment compared to the use of the standard treatment alone reduce mortality? </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>N-acetylcysteine will be given orally, as a dose of 600 mg three times daily for three days. If the patient vomits any dose within 1 hour of administration, the dose will be repeated.

Standard treatment: atropine administration (bolus dose of 2 to 5 mg IV, repeated every 10 to 15 minutes until dryness of bronchial secretions is clinically evident, then atropine injections will be given intermittently to patients as needed</interventions>
