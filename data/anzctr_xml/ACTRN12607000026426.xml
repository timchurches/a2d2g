    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Random allocation occurs in a central office by research staff who are not involved in participant assessment or program delivery . Allocation is kept in a sealed envelope and concealed from couples, the researcher determing study eligibility, and midwife educators until all assessment information is returned and the couple meets eligibility criteria. After that point allocation concealement is no longer possible as one condition is a couple based education porgam and the other a woman only education condition.</concealment>
    <sequence>A coin toss determines the allocation for a couple (heads = intervention), and the next couple who returns their assessment receives the opposite allocation. This ensures that equal numbers of couples are assignment to the intervention and control. The coin toss procedure is repeated until all couples are assigned.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to test the effects of a couple based education program (Couple CARE for Parents) with couples having their first baby. We will assign couples to receive Couple CARE for Parents or usual woman focused education and support. We predict that Couple CARE for Parents will enhance couple relationship satisfaction, individual adjustment and parenting.</summary>
