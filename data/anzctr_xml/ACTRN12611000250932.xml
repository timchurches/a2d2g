  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects are intially subdivided into drug and non drug use with regards to maintenance of their lipid/blood sugar stability.  This will allow us to more easily monitor any differences in these two groups should they occur. Patients are then randomised to treatment i.e. continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or non treatment (no CPAP). CPAP will be used during sleep where possible throughout the trial period (approximately 12 months) once randomised to tthe CPAP group. All subjects will be reviewed with a monthly health maintenance questionnaire for the 12 month duration of the trial.   Ultrasound, lipid and fasting blood sugar testing will be carried out at screening, 3 , 6 , 9  and 12 months (trial conclusion). CPAP group will have hours of use monitored at monthly intervals throughout the trial following an intial acclimatisation period which will have several follow ups in a week, if required, to help the patient settle to the treatment. Monthly follow ups maybe phone/face to face excluding the 3, 6, 9 and 12 month visit which will be face to face.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects randomised to the non treatment group will routinely be screened with a health maintenance questionaire including; maintenance of weight, blood pressure, general health, stable lipid and BSL. Routine questionnaire screening will be monthly for the 12 month duration of the trial. Test subjects will additionally use continuous positive airway therapy(CPAP) at all possible sleep times to prevent sleep disordered breathing and snoring for the duration of the trial. All subjects will undergo carotid ultrasound at screening, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Lipid and fasting blood sugar will also be taken/reviewed at the 3,6,9 and 12 month visits.  CPAP subjects will have hours of use reviewed at monthly intervals following an intial acclimatisation period which would have several phone/face to face contacts (subject preference) in the week or longer (per subject negotiation).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Snoring and mild sleep disordered breathing (SDB) are a common consequence of increased upper airway resistance during sleep.  Habitual snoring (every night or almost every night) without overt obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) is common in the community.  Increasingly it is recognized that snoring and mild SDB are not just an annoying social problem but may pose real risks to health.  Emerging research is highly suggestive of an independent role in the occurence of hypertension, stroke, coronary and carotid atherosclosis.  The aim of this study is to further explore the linkage between heavy snoring with mild SDB and early carotid artery atherosclerosis by looking for regression or stabilisation of early changes of carotid atherosclerosis in heavy snorers with mild non-hypoxic SDB when snoring and SDB are prevented by the use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).</summary>
