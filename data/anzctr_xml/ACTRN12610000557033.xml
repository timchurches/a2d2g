  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in intervention group will have no cast post fixation of their ankle fracture. They will go in a moonboot for comfort only, and will be shown range of motion ankle joint exercises by physiotherapist on the ward prior to discharge. They will still be non weight bearing for six weeks. No formal outpateint physiotherapy sessions will take place in the first six weeks. The frequency of exercises will not be specified as the importance here is placed on allowing the patient freedom to move their ankle at their will post surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cast treatment for six weeks post ankle fracture fixation with non weight bearing restriction on operated limb. After six weeks, the patients in both groups will be allowed to weight bear as tolerated, and will be encouraged to work on range of motion of their ankle joint by the clinician in our clinic. If patients desire, they will be referred to physiotherapist as per our current practice.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Return to work. This will be assessed via query to ACC (Accident Compensation and Claim) organisation with regards to the date the patients return to 'light duty', 'medium duty', 'heavy duty', and 'full time' work. We believe this is the most accurate method as patient's own account may be unreliable at times.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The query to ACC will be made at six months following ankle fracture fixation, as by this stage we expect all our patients to return to work.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ankle function score (based on questionnaire and examination in outpatient clinic)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At twelve weeks post ankle fracture fixation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complications of surgery including infection and failure of fixation</outcome>
      <timepoint>At two weeks post fixation - wound check will reveal any infection (defined as wound infection requiring intravenous antibiotics and admission for our study purposes)
At six weeks post fixation - the xrays will reveal failure of fixation.
Any readmission to our hospital in first six weeks will be noted in six weeks clinic visit.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients with ankle fractures requiring surgery at Whangarei Hospital, New Zealand will be enrolled if they consent. Typically we wait for 7 days before swelling is acceptable for internal fixation and patients can use this time to make their decision.

Allocation concealment method for this study is sealed opaque envelopes. This will be opened by the operating surgeon at commencement of surgery.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be achieved by using randomisation table created by a computer software. Envelopes with either "no cast" or "cast" will be opened during surgery. These envelopes will be in a box in acute theatre.

There will be no stratification.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ankle fractures are common and frequently require fixation. The current practice in Whangarei Hospital and most centres around New Zealand is to immobilise ankles post fixation in a cast for six weeks in order to protect the ankle from wound breakdown and to allow fracture to heal. However, there have been studies over the years that confirm early mobilisation post ankle fixation results in early return to work and no significant complications. A recent literature review confirmed that only one study out of nine showed a higher rate of infection in early mobilisation group. 
Our aim is to confirm the positive findings of the literature for our local population. If early mobilisation group in our study return to work sooner and have no further complications compared to cast group, this will change our practice at Whangarei Hospital and potentially at other centres around New Zealand.</summary>
