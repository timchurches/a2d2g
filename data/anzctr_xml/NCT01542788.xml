Treatment: drugs: RBV
Ribavirin (RBV) was administered as a tablet orally according to package insert weight-based dosing recommendations (&lt; 75kg = 1000 mg and = 75 kg = 1200 mg).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This multicenter study was to evaluate subjects with chronic genotype 2 or 3 HCV infection
      who were interferon (IFN) ineligible, IFN intolerant or unwilling to take IFN. Participants
      were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir (SOF)+ribavirin (RBV), or placebo to
      match SOF+placebo to match RBV. Randomization was stratified by presence/absence of
      cirrhosis. Approximately 20% of participants may have had evidence of cirrhosis at screening.</summary>
