  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will undergo the same physiotherapy treatment with the same physiotherapist. They will receive 12 individual sessions of physiotherapy of 1 hour each, scheduled 3 times per week. Treatment will begin 6 months post-operatively.
In the experimental group, we will add motor imagery exercises into classical physiotherapy session during the last 15 minutes of the session. Practically they will practice a sequence of motor imagery exercises (kinesthetic and visual imagery). The control group will be subjected to a period of neutral activities during equivalent time. Accordingly they will spend the last 15 minutes of the session to discuss with the physiotherapist of world news not related to their illness.
the 45 minutes of classical physiotherapy included: quadriceps strengthening exercises, proprioceptive exercises and gait training exercises (maximum knee flexion during swing phase).
Motor imagery is defined as the mental representation of an action without any concomitant movement. 
During each motor imagery session, we used visual imagery  that requires self-visualization of a movement from a first- (internal visual imagery) or third-person (external visual imagery) perspective and kinesthetic imagery that requires to feel movement and to perceive muscle contractions mentally.Participants performed 2 blocks of each set with a 10-s rest period between rehearsals and 2-min rest period between blocks. 
The physiotherapist checked whether the participants did not contract their muscles or move their knees during motor imagery exercises. 
All exercises should be showed firstly by the experimenter and secondly the participants should do one trial with the contra lateral limb before starting with the operated limb. 
During motor imagery training, the physiotherapist read the same imagery script specific for each exercise to ensure that the participants received similar motor imagery instructions.

An informed consent including the description and the schedule of the rehabilitation program will be signed by all participants. Furthermore all participants will provide a signature at the end of every session.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Classical physiotherapy protocol includes modalities to enhance quadriceps strength and to improve functional impairments especially walking:
- active resisted exercises for quadriceps muscle
- proprioceptive exercises
- gait training (maximum knee flexion during swing phase)
In the experimental group, we will add motor imagery exercises into classical physiotherapy session during the last 15 minutes of the session. Practically they will practice a sequence of motor imagery exercises (kinesthetic and visual imagery). The control group will be subjected to a period of neutral activities during equivalent time. Accordingly they will spend the last 15 minutes of the session to discuss with the physiotherapist of world news not related to their illness.

This is a pilot study that may help us test the existence of a significant statistical effect without a clear assumption on its size and power. Thus, it would help us later on to determine the exact sample size needed in order to have a good statistical power. Regarding the actual difficulties encountered in our clinic to recruit participants, we assume that 10 participants per group is a good beginning for such a pilot study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Motor imagery (MI) is the mental representation of a movement without any motor output.
The majority of studies on MI practice have been conducted in the field of neurological conditions and after peripheral injuries to decrease pain and facilitate motor and functional recovery.
However, there is no study in the literature dealing with the effect of MI training and its integration into physiotherapy program following total knee arthroplasty.
quadriceps strength, gait performance and daily activities will be measured before and after a classical intervention (Control Group: classical physiotherapy + neutral activity) or a MI intervention (MI Group: classical physiotherapy + MI exercises).
Stronger muscle, better gait performance and better functional outcomes are expected in the MI group.
