  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will receive eight sessions of acupuncture twice a week over four weeks. A registered and experienced acupuncturist will deliver the acupuncture. At each session, participants will receive manual acupuncture for a duration of 20-30 minutes at tender points at or close to the site of pain condition. Four to eight points are needled. A record of each acupuncture session is kept. To monitor compliance and adherence participants are sent reminders for the acupuncture appointments. We also offer a flexible schedule to accommodate the participants who cannot come within working hours. The participants in this study were also part of a psychophysics research project determining their pain adaptability through a cold pressor test (the psychophysics research project is not a clinical trial so it does not have a registration number). At the end of the acupuncture treatment participants will undergo psychophysics tests. Please see information about secondary outcome measures. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We anticipate to recruit 90 participants with chronic non-specific low back pain participants or knee osteoarthritis. This is a pilot study; we will use the results to calculate the sample size for future studies. Commonly it is accepted that psychophysics studies have 20-40 people per group. 

The Statistical Program for Social Science (SPSS, version 22.0) and Labchart8 will be used for data analyses. Categorical and numerical data of baseline pain and, demographic characteristics such as gender and age will be analysed with chi square test and t-tests, respectively, to determine comparability of the groups. Missing data will be dealt with using the last value carried forward method or according to individual manual of questionnaires. Two-way ANOVA (Group: pain adaptive and pain non-adaptive; time) will be used to examine the treatment effect and the interaction of pain adaptability and time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic non-specific low back pain and knee osteoarthritis are among the most prevailing chronic pain conditions. Despite the a wide array of treatment options available, not everyone receives satisfactory pain relief. This may be because people respond differently to pain treatments. An optimal and safe treatment is necessary.  
This project aims to determine whether people with two forms of pain adaptability respond differently to local acupuncture needling. We test this aim in people with knee osteoarthritis or low back pain. The pain adaptability of the participants has previously been determined using a cold pressor test. The acupuncturist is blinded from participants pain adaptability and delivers an acupuncture treatment of 8 sessions. The response to acupuncture is measured by assessing the change in pain at the knee or lower back through a pain diary before and after the acupuncture treatment. This project will contribute to the development of individualised medicine by targeting those who respond better to acupuncture.</summary>
