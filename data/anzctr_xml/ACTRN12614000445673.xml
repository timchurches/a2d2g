  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Nintendo Wii console has been shown to provide both physical and cognitive benefits for the elderly. Playing Wii in groups can also provide an opportunity to interact with others, which may in turn encourage relationships to form. These relationships are based on shared interests and activities. 
This research aims to investigate the mental health of elderly nursing home residents who are encouraged to participant in group activities involving the Wii console, compared with elderly residents with no intervention. 
A sample of approximately 40 elderly adults aged 65 years and older who are currently living in a residential nursing home will be assigned to either the intervention group) or a control group (no intervention) based on their place of residence. Participants will complete a mental status examination eligibility questionnaire to determine if they have dementia or other health concerns preventing the use of the Wii. Demographics information, self-rated health scale, geriatric depression scale, social support provisional scale, intervention expectancy scale and three visual analogue scales measuring sense of belonging and mood will also be completed. The scores received on the Wii and time spent playing will be recorded by the residents.  Residents will be invited to participate in a qualitative interview at the end of the intervention.  
The results will provide a theoretical basis for future cost effective intervention programs to be implemented in nursing homes.
