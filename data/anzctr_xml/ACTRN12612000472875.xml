  <interventions>
    <interventions>After approval of ethics committee of King Abdul Aziz university hospital, informed, written consent will be obtained from 90 ASA class I or II patients undergoing elective caesarean section.  IV cannula will be established.  500 mL of 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (voluven) will be administered over 20 min. combined epidural- spinal anesthesia will be performed. 10 mg of heavy bupivacaine 0.5% mixed with 20 micro g fentanyl will be injected into the subarachnoid space without any injection via epidural catheter. following that patients were randomly assigned into one of three equal groups of thirty patients each by using sealed envelope method. The randomization was dependent on the time allowed for each patient to be maintained on sitting position after intrathecal injection. In the four groups (group A, B, C and D) the patients were maintained in sitting position for 3, 5, 7 and 9 minutes consequatively before turning them into supine position. 3 min time was considered as a control group.</interventions>
    <comparator>the 3 min group was considered as a control group and compared to the active groups where patients were kept sitting for 5, 7, &amp; 9 minaccording to the assigned group.</comparator>
