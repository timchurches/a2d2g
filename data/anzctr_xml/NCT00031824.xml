    <summary>RATIONALE: Hydroxychloroquine may decrease the immune response and be effective in treating
      chronic graft-versus-host disease. It is not yet known if standard therapy for
      graft-versus-host disease is more effective with or without hydroxychloroquine.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of standard therapy alone
      with that of standard therapy plus hydroxychloroquine in treating patients who have newly
      diagnosed chronic graft-versus-host disease.</summary>
