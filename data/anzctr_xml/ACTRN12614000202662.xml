  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with acute urinary retention will be randomized into 2 groups. Patients in group A will recieve 1 tablet of Alfuzocin 10 mg once daily plus 1 capsule of celecoxib 200 mg once daily, for 3 days and then will have a Trial WithOut Catheter (TWOC). The monitor adherence to treatment is going to be monitored by methods of drug tablet return. The TWOC includes the removal of the Foley catheter and monitoring of first urination after 3 days of initial catheterization.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in group B will recieve 1 tablet of Alfuzocin 10 mg once daily plus 1 capsule of placebo (looking similar to the celecoxib capsule in color, weight, and shape) once daily (for 3 days and then will have a TWOC).</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the percentage of TWOC (Trial without catheter) between the two groups of patients. Success of TWOC was defined if patients had a PVR (post void residual) &lt; 100ml after voiding at least 100 mL of urine and did not require recatheterization for a period of 24 hours.
The PVR is going to be measured by ultrasound scan.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 days after initial catheterization.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If there is a statistical significant difference in PVR (Post Void Residual) volume in the first voiding after Foley catheter removal between the two groups of patients.
The PVR is going to be measured by ultrasound scan</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 days after initial catheterization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>If there is a statistical significant difference in max flow rate (Qmax) in the first voiding after Foley catheter removal between the two groups of patients. Patients will have an uroflow test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 days after initial catheterization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To record the side effects of each treatment. Possible side effects of treatment include headache, gastric pain, nausea, vomiting, hypertension etc. These side effects are going to be assessed by methods of interviewing the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 days after initial catheterization.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most frequent benign neoplasm in men. It is estimated that many of patients suffering from this disease will experience acute urinary retention (AUR). The immediate management of AUR requires bladder decompression by catheterization. Up to now, alpha1-Blockers are used routinely before catheter removal and considered an appropriate treatment option according to European Urology Association guidelines. This study is the first double-blind prospective study assessing the impact of Celecoxib (200mg), an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) added to the standard treatment (a-blocker) on the outcome of a trial without catheter (TWOC) after a first episode of AUR related to BPH.</summary>
