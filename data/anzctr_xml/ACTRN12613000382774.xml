  <interventions>
    <interventions>G115 (Ginsana SA, Boehringer Ingelheim Group company) is standardised extract of the species Panax Ginseng C. A. Meyer that contains 4% ginsenosides. G115 capsules will be provided as gel filled soft capsules for oral intake. Each capsule is 100 mg, so subjects will take 2 capsules each time, twice daily.

Eligible subjects will be randomised to receive 24 weeks of treatment with ginseng extract capsules (400 mg/day), which will be supplied in 12 week packs. Subjects will attend 2 appointments during the 24 week treatment period, each visit will involve symptom assessment, collection and distribution of Participant Diaries, completion of 2 questionnaires (SGRQ and CAT), a 6MWT and lung function tests. They will receive the second pack of trial medication (12 weeks worth) and relief medication and complete a Patient Opinion of Chinese Medicine Questionnaire (mid-treatment) and Short Form 36 questionnaire (end of treatment). Blood sample will be taken at the end of treatment. 

There will be a followup period of 24 weeks after the treatment period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Matching placebo capsules (Ginsana SA, Boehringer Ingelheim Group Company) will be used. Placebo capsules will appear identical to the G115 capsules. After the run-in period, subjects will be randomised to receive 24 weeks of treatment with placebo capsules (400 mg/day), which will be supplied in 12 week packs, providing enough medication to last between visits. Placebo capsules will be provided as gel filled soft capsules for oral intake. Each capsule is 100 mg, so subjects will take 2 capsules each time, twice daily. 

Ingredients of the placebo capsules are : Lactose, Silicon dioxide, Lecithin, Soya lecithin, Wax mixture, Rapeseed oil, Ethyl vanillin, Gelatine, Glycerol 85%, Iron oxide black, Iron oxide red, Dried substance from Anidrisorb 85/70 (85% solution), soya-bean oil, soya oil.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation is based on the effect size reported in a multi-centre trial in China (Zheng et al,2008). For the proposed study, to achieve 30% difference between the ginseng extract and placebo treatment groups with an 80% power and a two-tailed significance level of 5%, it is estimated that a sample size of 100 subjects per group will be required, that is, 200 in total. </statisticalmethods>
