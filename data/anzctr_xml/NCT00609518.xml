    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - pemetrexed
Other interventions - Folic acid
Other interventions - Folic Acid
Other interventions - Vitamin B12
Treatment: drugs - dexamethasone
Treatment: drugs - dexamethasone

Active Comparator: Standard Vitamin and Steroid Schedule + Pemetrexed - Standard vitamin and steroid schedule that is used with pemetrexed consisting of a minimum of 5 daily doses of folic acid before first pemetrexed dose and dexamethasone on day before, day of, and day after treatment.

Experimental: Simplified Vitamin and Steroid Schedule + Pemetrexed - Simplified vitamin and steroid schedule to be used with pemetrexed consisting of 2 daily doses of folic acid before first pemetrexed dose and dexamethasone on day of treatment only.


Treatment: drugs: pemetrexed
500 mg/m^2 intravenous infusion on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Number of Cycles: Until progression or to a maximum of 6 cycles.

Other interventions: Folic acid
350-1000 micrograms taken orally for at least 5 daily doses during the 7-day period prior to the first dose of pemetrexed then continues daily throughout treatment until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.

Other interventions: Folic Acid
350-1000 micrograms taken orally for two consecutive daily doses of folic acid the day before and the day of the first dose of pemetrexed the continues throughout treatment and for 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.

Other interventions: Vitamin B12
1000 micrograms intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 during the week prior to the first dose of pemetrexed then further injections given approximately every 9 weeks until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.

Treatment: drugs: dexamethasone
4 mg taken orally [or equivalent] twice per day the day before, the day of, and the day after the first day of pemetrexed. Continue to give dexamethasone twice per day the day before, the day of, and the day after each dose of pemetrexed.

Treatment: drugs: dexamethasone
4 mg taken orally [or equivalent] twice per day on the day of the first dose of pemetrexed. Continue to give dexamethasone twice per day on the day of each dose of pemetrexed.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety: Number of Participants With Drug-Related Grade 3 or 4 Toxicity - Results are presented for the number of participants with drug-related Grade 3 or 4 toxicity/adverse event (AE). Grades range from 0 (none) to 5 (death), with Grade 3 and 4 being defined as follows:
Grade 0 = No AE; Grade 1 = Mild AE; Grade 2 = Moderate AE; Grade 3 = Severe AE; Grade 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; Grade 5 = Death related to AE. A detailed list of Serious and non-serious adverse events is provided in the Reported Adverse Event section.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first dose of treatment to last dose of treatment plus 30 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Participants With Best Overall Tumor Response (Response Rate) - Response defined per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria: Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR)=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease=20% increase in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria. Best Overall Tumor Response is complete response plus partial response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until disease progression, new therapy initiated, or death from any cause, up to 12 months after enrollment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival is the duration from randomization to death. For patients who are alive, overall survival is censored at the date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization (=4 weeks from baseline visit) to 12 months after randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Defined as the time from date of first dose to the first observation of disease progression, or death due to any cause. For patients who are alive and have not progressed, PFS is censored at the date of last radiological assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization (=4 weeks from baseline visit) to 12 months after randomization</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chemotherapy for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. Patients are given
      folic acid, vitamin B12 and steroids, both before and during treatment, to reduce the side
      effects associated with pemetrexed. The aim is whether it is possible to simplify the folic
      acid and steroid schedule without increasing toxicity.</summary>
