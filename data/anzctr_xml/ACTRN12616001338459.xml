  <interventions>
    <interventions>Supervised cardiac rehabilitation exercise program consisting of high intensity interval aerobic 40 mins performed twice weekly for 6 weeks. These will be held at the Robina Health Precinct gymnasium and will be integrated within the cardiac rehabilitation class. The classes will be supervised by a physiotherapist or Exercise Physiologist with Bachelor degrees or Masters Degree and a cardiac nurse. This will consist of a 5 min warm up, 2x4 mins on a treadmill or cycle ergometer at 85-90% VO2peak, interspersed with 2 mins at 50-60% VO2peak, and 10 minute cool down. </interventions>
    <comparator>Supervised cardiac rehabilitation exercise program consisting of moderate continuous aerobic at 50-70% VO2max and resistance training for 60 mins performed twice weekly for 6 weeks at the Robina Health Precinct in small group settings. The resistance training comprises 10 mins of light resistance training. 1-2 sets of 12 reps including leg press or wall squats, bicep curls, wall push ups, heel raises and step ups. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods> Clinical and treatment related outcomes include both categorical and continuous measures. Appropriate statistical testing will be conducted to identify significant differences between treatment and control groups at 6 wks and 6 months post intervention (for readmission rates). Where there is significant heterogeneity among individuals outcome measures, mixed effects statistical models will be used incorporating baseline, 6 week and 6 month data. The sample size was calculated using the mean number from 10 RCTs identified as comparing HIIT and MCT in the cardiac population (n=65.6) as well as using a sample size calculator with 95% certainty, confidence interval of 12.19 and population of 1500 (number of admissions of eligible patients to cardiac rehabilitation/year within the Gold Coast Health Service District. (n=62). A further calculator (G power) was also used. Standard deviation was assumed to be 2 with a power of 0.9 and significance level of 0.05 with effect size of 1. The difference between groups was assumed to be 2. The sample size calculated was 46. As we are trialling a different exercise dosage to the literature our sample size was chosen as 62.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1) The primary outcome is to assess the immediate benefits (patient outcomes, health care utilisation costs, program uptake, adherence, and compliance) and longer term benefits (readmission rates, length of hospital stay and time to return to work) of implementing an innovative exercise model (HITT) in cardiac rehabilitation patients compared to current practice. The hypothesis that HITT participants will achieve superior functional capacity changes and strength in 40 mins compared with 60 mins for the control group will be assessed. The hypothesis that it can be completed in less time and be more financially viable will also be assessed. This could lead to a change in rehabilitative exercise practice and positively impact costs associated with this high healthcare burden, whilst improving health service delivery and ultimately patient outcomes.
2) Secondary outcomes are to assess if HIIT using a 2x4 min dosage produces change in Vo2 peak comparable to previous RCTs within the literature. </summary>
