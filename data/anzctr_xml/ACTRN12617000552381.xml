  <interventions>
    <interventions>540 individuals in total will be recruited. This cohort will be recruited in three glucose profile groups (newly diagnosed diabetic, pre-diabetic, normal glucose) of 180 individuals each, split evenly between Australian and Chinese sites such that 90 individuals of each glucose group is recruited in each country. Each glucose group in each country will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio between intervention and control. All participants randomised to the initial intervention treatment, and participants from the diabetic and pre-diabetic glucose groups from the initial control treatment will be followed up for the full duration of 2 years. Participants from the normal glucose group who are randomised to the initial control treatment will not be followed up after 12 weeks.

Initial intervention:
3 exercise sessions per week, 2 sessions supervised in person by an Exercise Physiologist, consisting of High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) at 85-95% Maximum Heart Rate (HRmax) for approximately 15 minutes including warm up and cool down, using a treadmill, cycle ergometer, or land based walking as appropriate, and Progressive Resistance Training (PRT) at 60-80% of 1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) using 8 resistance exercises of various major muscle groups, and 1 session of HIIT unsupervised per week, all for 12 weeks.  The supervised sessions will be prescribed and delivered individually, either in an individual setting or in a group of up to three, as circumstances dictate. Compliance with this intervention will be measured by a record of sessions attended, which will be kept by trial staff, in conjunction with an exercise diary issued by the trial and kept by the participant for all unsupervised exercise sessions.

After 12 weeks of the initial intervention/control treatment all participants who were randomised to the HIIT intervention will be re-randomised to either a follow up intervention (increased support group) or a follow up control treatment (text message support program group) and instructed to continue exercising independently.

Follow-up intervention:
An increased support group continuing until the 12 month follow up: Participants will be given a Fitbit physical activity monitoring device at week 12 of the exercise program and instructed to wear it every day. They will be taught how to use the Fitbit to ensure they reach 85-95% of their HR max for their HIIT sessions.
Participants will be instructed to upload their data to an online database through which the researchers will track participants progress including heart rate data, estimated energy expenditure, body weight and exercise episodes. If participants are not meeting the targets for the HIIT exercise sessions they will be contacted using the escalating methods of email, text message or phone calls. 
The triggers for contact will be: 
1.	If a participant has not worn their Fitbit for two consecutive weeks an email will be sent. If there is no contact within a week, a text message will be sent. If there is still no contact within another week, the participant will be contacted by phone to discuss possible barriers to adherence and methods to enhance the process. 
2.	If the participant has worn the FitBit but has not achieved the prescribed HR for HIIT for at least one session per week, they will be sent an email after one week, a text message after two weeks, and called by phone after three weeks. 
3.	If a participant demonstrates compliance with their HIIT sessions, a positive feedback text message will be sent on a monthly basis to encourage them to continue. 
4.	If a participant demonstrates repeated non-compliance with the HIIT sessions, they will be invited to come back for a supervised session with the Exercise Physiologist to address any problems. 

Analysis of results will compare initial intervention groups against each other, maintenance intervention groups against each other, and Australian and Chinese cohorts against each other.

    <statisticalmethods>The glucose groups will be combined for the primary outcome analyses examining the differences in the change of liver steatosis between intervention and the control groups. As the percentage of participants that has liver steatosis, defined as at least 5% of the liver being composed of lipid, will likely differ based on glucose group and effects of exercise may differ within groups, we plan to investigate the change in liver steatosis within glucose groups as well as combined.

Previous research that has shown high intensity exercise can reduce liver fat by 2.62% (SE 1.0%) and the mean difference between placebo and exercise groups was approximately 3.6 %.  Participants in this study were overweight or obese and therefore likely to have less percentage liver fat than those with prediabetes and diabetes (and overweight/obese). The study has been therefore powered to show a 3% mean difference between the intervention and control groups for each glucose group due to the variance by glucose group.

By power calculation, 90 participants per glucose category of pre-diabetes, recent onset type 2 diabetes and normal glucose groups, will give power of 90% to show at least a 3% mean difference in liver fat by NMR spectroscopy measures with a standard deviation of 4% as found in our previous studies and taking into account a dropout rate of 15% at 12 weeks. Thus 270 participants will be recruited at the Australian site for analysis of the primary endpoint. 270 participants will also be recruited at the Chinese site for simultaneous analysis of the primary endpoint at their site, with data from their cohort. 

In the pre-defined secondary end-points, Australian and Chinese cohort data will be compared.

For the sub study RCT there is a lack of research in this area and it is therefore quite difficult to know upon what data to base the power calculation. We hypothesize that those randomised to the support group will complete 30% more HIIT sessions than the text message group and the standard deviation could be approximately 20%. This would be measured by the self-reported diaries and we would also use the Active PAL to examine objectively measured physical activity. If we assume that there will be a further 15% drop out rate of 15% at 12 months this would mean 100 participants in the exercise arm would be followed up. This would give greater than 90% power to detect a difference of 30%, with a standard deviation of 20%.  

The primary outcome will be assessed by analysis of covariance to compare percentage liver fat change (quantified by 1H-MRS) (baseline to 12 weeks) between the intervention and control group.  Baseline liver fat percentage and glucose group will be included as covariates.  All participants will be included in the primary analysis and missing data will be imputed by the multiple imputation method. A similar analysis will be used to compare the secondary outcomes of change in liver fat from baseline to 1 and 2-year follow-up. Other outcomes will be evaluated using generalised mixed modelling and will be dependent on the data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to:
1. compare baseline phenotypes amongst those with recently identified prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, in Sydney, Australia and in Shanghai, China.
2. examine the effect of an exercise program on changes in metabolic end-points, complications, surrogate biomarkers, gut microbial profile and cognitive measures. 
3. examine the effectiveness of an intervention to improve exercise maintenance.

Study Hypotheses:
1. The phenotypes amongst those with recently identified prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, in Sydney, Australia and in Shanghai, China, differ in their body composition and adiposity (by DXA scan and abdominal MRI), and degree of insulin deficiency (by insulin, glucose and C-peptide measures).
2. A structured exercise program involving high intensity interval training (HIIT) and resistance exercise will lead to improved percentage of liver steatosis (1H-MRS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (steatosis greater than or equal to 5.5% and insulin-fibrosis measures), body composition, metabolic end-points (including HbA1c, fructosamine), lesser organ complications (including albuminuria, cardiac diastolic dysfunction, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy), improved surrogate blood biomarkers of complications (including CD monocyte markers, CTGF and FAP), and more normal gut microbial profile, mood state and cognition. 
3. An intervention aiming to improve exercise maintenance will result in improved exercise adherence, sustained outcomes in exercise parameters (adherence to exercise amount, greater intensity) and cardiovascular fitness, NAFLD, body composition, improved metabolic end-points, lesser organ complications, improved surrogate biomarkers of complications, and more normal gut microbial profile, mood state and cognitive function.</summary>
