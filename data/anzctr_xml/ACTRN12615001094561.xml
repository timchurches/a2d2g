    <interventions>Study participants will receive a combination treatment of laser bypass (chorioretinal venous anastomosis, L-CRA) and intraocular injections of Lucentis. Both treatments are approved for this condition. This is a phaseIV study that follows on from the L-CVBS study (ACTRN12612000004864). The laser L-CRA treatment will occur first, with the Lucentis injections commencing 4-5 weeks later. 

The Ellex Integre S laser will be used to create the anastomosis. Two sites will be chosen, one above and one below the optic disc. Both will be over a tributary of a major quadratic vein at least 2 disc diameters away from the optic disc. It is not possible to be specific about  the location as this will depend on the individual anatomical arrangement in each participant's eye. The spot size is 50um whilst the power will be up to 4W (depends on the degree of cataract), and duration of 0.1 seconds. There is only one laser treatment session that consists of two attempts to establish a functional L-CRA. 

Following the L-CRA treatment, participants will commence monthly injections of Lucentis (Ranibizumab). Lucentis is a TGA approved treatment for this condition, and has recently been placed on the PBS. The Lucentis will be obtained through the PBS authority by the investigator. The dose for each intravitreal injection is 2.3mg/0.23mL(10mg/mL) solution, the volume injected is 50ul. There will be a loading dose of three injections, each at 4 week intervals. Participants will be monitored monthly until Month 6. and if during this time the participant's visual acuity drops and/or the oedema has returns, Lucentis treatment will continue (at monthly intervals) until the visual acuity and/or oedema stabilises. From Month 6- Month 12, the visits will occur once every 2 months, provided the participant's visual acuity is stable and there is no macula oedema. If an injection occurs, then the visits revert back to monthly until visual acuity and macula oedema stabilise. Likewise, in the second year of the study, visits may occur once every 3 months if visual acuity and macula oedema are stable, but if there is a drop in visual acuity and/or macula oedema returns, monthly Lucentis injections will resume until visual acuity and/or the oedema stablises. Visits may then gradually move to once very 2 months and then once every three months.  In summary, participants receive 3 Lucentis injections at monthly intervals (loading dose) and then further Lucentis treatment will only be administered if visual acuity drops and/or macula oedema returns. The study duration is 2 years.

    <statisticalmethods>50 patients will be recruited from the Investigator's clinic at Lions Eye Institute over a 2 year time period. All participants who present with a central retinal vein occlusion who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be asked if they wish to participate in the study.  Because this is a phase IV study, no sample size calculations were used to determine this number. The number is based on the experience from the previous phase III study (L-CVBS study). 

Data will be continuously analysed and response patterns compared with published results using monotherapy. Individual characteristics within the data set (e.g. duration, presenting BCVA, degree of ischaemia, concurrent medical conditions, smoking etc.) will be analysed for any evidence of modification of treatment effect.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a monitoring study (phase IV) for participants with swelling in the back of the eye (macula oedema) that has been caused by a blockage to the main vein (retinal vein) draining the back of the eye (central retinal vein occlusion). The current treatment for this condition is a series of injections at monthly intervals of anti-VEGF antibodies (e.g. Lucentis or Avastin) into the back of the eye.  Whilst this treatment works well, there is often an ongoing need for the eye injections.  A laser treatment developed at the Lions Eye Institute, creates a channel from the retina (back of the eye) to the choroid (layer above the retina) for the blood to drain (laser bypass treatment). In the L-CVBS study participants who received the eye injections and laser bypass treatment require fewer eye injections longer term than participants who only receive the eye injections. Because the laser bypass and injection treatments work differently to address the swelling caused by the blockage, the combination of using both treatments tends to give patients a better visual outcome with fewer injections required.  Recruitment for the L-CVBS study has closed, and this new study is a follow on study, where all participants will receive eye injections and the laser bypass treatment. 

Participants with a macula oedema that is caused by a central retinal vein occlusion will be asked if they would like to participate in this study (consent obtained first). If eligible, all participants will receive the laser bypass treatment followed by the Lucentis injections. The standard loading dose of a monthly Lucentis injection for the first three months will be followed. Participants will be monitored monthly until Month 6. If there is evidence of macula oedema and/or vision loss, further monthly injections will be given until the participants condition stabilises. If after Month 6 visual and macula oedema stability is achieved, the visits can be extended to once every two months until Month 12. If stability is maintained from Month 12, then the visits can be extended to once every three months in the second year. But if visual acuity drops and/or if macular oedema is present, then the eye injections will resume and the visits will be monthly until stability is achieved. We hope to show that fewer injections are required to achieve visual and anatomic stability compared to studies where only Lucentis injections are used.
