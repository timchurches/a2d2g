  <interventions>
    <interventions>The experimental group will participate in the SPARX program, an online, interactive, fantasy game based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), designed to prevent and treat depression in young people. The gaming component allows the participant to choose an avatar and then undertake a number of skill-building challenges in the context of a fantasy world. This component is supplemented by direct instruction, education and activities (or homework) provided by a guide avatar. SPARX consists of seven modules (levels) which cover: finding hope, being active, dealing with emotions, problem solving, recognizing and challenging unhelpful thought and bringing it altogether. SPARX is delivered via the internet in school classrooms over the course of 5 weeks. Participants spend approximately 30-40 mins on the program per week. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be allocated to the lifeSTYLE program, an attention match control condition. This program requires participants to complete online open ended questions that probe health factors, physical and artistic activities, education and hobbies, social, financial, and family roles, work habits and stress, medications, pain and nutrition. Each week it provides an online package of educational material with information about health risks, in order to match levels of interactivity. lifeSTYLE is also delivered via the internet in school classrooms over the course of 5 weeks. Participants spend approximately 30-40 mins on the program per week. A previous trial demonstrated no difference in preference for this form of control condition relative to an active website arm.

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 1600 students will be recruited for this trial. In community samples, between 8 and 20% of young people will develop depression over an 18 month period and the rates of conversion to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) are even higher in individuals who have sub-threshold symptoms. Power will be achieved primarily by recruiting a sample from mid to late adolescence where conversion rates are high (up to 15%), and undertaking the intervention in anticipation of a universal stressor. Calculations of required sample size were based on detecting a post-intervention effect size of 0.20 for the primary outcome measure. This is a small effect but reflects the universal nature of this intervention. Power was set at .80, a = .05 (two-tailed) and correlation of .5 assumed between baseline and endpoint scores. To allow for possible clustering effects (participants from the same school having characteristics and outcomes more alike than between schools) a design effect was calculated assuming an intraclass correlation (ICC) of 0.02 and an average class size of 25. The estimate of the ICC was derived from previous Australian school-based studies that have found non-significant class effects (i.e., non- significant intraclass correlation) and a value of .02. The estimated sample size was 1166. To accommodate an attrition or non-return of endpoint data rate of approximately 20%, (our previous school based trials reported 84%-88% completion at post-test, and 81% at 6 months) we set the target sample size at 1600, or 800 students (approximately 60 classes of 25) per condition. Power calculations for these are sufficient to examine all other secondary outcome effects with the exception of incidence/recurrence of MDD. Analysis of predictors will involve correlations. No mediation or moderation analyses are claimed, so power is also sufficient. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Using Randomised Controlled Trial methodology, this study investigates the effectiveness of a universal prevention intervention for depression in adolescents prior to the Higher School Certificate (HSC). Students in 30 schools across New South Wales (NSW) will be randomly allocated to receive an online, automated, preventative Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) program or an online control program focused on health and wellbeing. Students will participate in the intervention in February of Year 12, and will complete assessment measures pre- and post-intervention, approximately 6 months later (prior to the Trial HSC) and at 18-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure will be symptom levels of depression. Secondary outcomes include academic performance, incidence/recurrence of depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour. Cost effectiveness, as well as predictors of treatment response and adherence will also be measured. Additionally, the effect of the intervention on parental mental health and wellbeing will be examined.</summary>
