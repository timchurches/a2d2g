Experimental: Arm I (Patients off-therapy before callback-Induction only) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin sulfate IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, oral prednisone 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover (G-CSF is held on day 8). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease.

Experimental: Arm II (RER with CR [ABVE-PC, IFRT]) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, prednisone PO 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover (G-CSF is held on day 8). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease. Patients receive an additional 2 courses of ABVE-PC. Patients with sustained CR undergo IFRT approximately 3 weeks after the last day of ABVE course 4.

Experimental: Arm III (RER with CR [ABVE-PC]) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, prednisone PO 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1.

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease. Patients receive an additional 2 courses of ABVE-PC. Patients with sustained CR are randomized to receive no further treatment.

Experimental: Arm IV (RER with less than CR [ABVE-PC, IFRT]) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, prednisone PO 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover (G-CSF is held on day 8). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease. Patients receive an additional 2 courses of ABVE-PC. Patients with VGPR, PR or SD undergo IFRT approximately 3 weeks after the last day of ABVE-PC course 4 for 5 days a week.

Experimental: Arm V (RER with PD) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, prednisone PO 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 2 and continuing until blood counts recover (G-CSF is held on day 8). Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease. Patients with PD are taken off therapy.

Experimental: Arm VI (SER [DECA, ABVE-PC, IFRT]) - Patients receive dexamethasone IV over 15 minutes, etoposide IV over 3 hours, and cytarabine IV over 3 hours on days 1-2. Patients receive 2 drops of dexamethasone ophthalmic solution every 6 hours on days 1, 2 and 3. Patients also receive cisplatin PO or IV over 12 hours as pre-hydration followed by continuous IV over 6 hours on day 1 and G-CSF SC beginning on day 3 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive 2 additional courses of ABVE-PC chemotherapy. Patients with sustained complete or partial response undergo IFRT approximately 3 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy.

Experimental: Arm VII (SER [ABVE-PC, IFRT]) - Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 10-30 minutes on days 1-2, bleomycin IV over 10-20 minutes or SC and vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, prednisone PO 2 or 3 times daily on days 1-7, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying different chemotherapy regimens given with or
      without radiation therapy to compare how well they work in treating children with newly
      diagnosed Hodgkin's disease. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving the drugs in different combinations
      may kill more cancer cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer cells.
      It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without additional chemotherapy
      and/or radiation therapy in treating Hodgkin's disease.</summary>
