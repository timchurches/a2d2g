  <interventions>
    <interventions>Laparoscopic adrenal surgery. This involves the removal of the adrenal gland by laparoscopic instruments via a transperitoneal lateral approach. This is the only surgical procedure we perform in this trial</interventions>
    <comparator>The participants in the control group have subclinical Cushing's syndrome in adrenal incidentalomas and they continue to receive conservative treatment for this condition. At the entry in the study, all patients in the conservarive group are in medical treatment that is different for each clinical disease. Patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome presenting diabetes mellitus are in antidiabetic medication (oral antidiabetic medication or insulin) and they continue to have their therapy; patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome presenting arterial hypertension are in antihypertensive treatment and they continue to have their therapy;patients with subclinical Cushing's syndrome presenting hypertriglyceridemia are in statin therapy and they continue to have their therapy. The study will continue enough to have a mean follow-up of 7 years for each enrolled patient.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical outcome of subclinical Cushing's syndrome patients who underwent adrenalectomy versus those managed conservatively measured with laboratory test and clinical parameters.
Diabetes mellitus is measured with plasma concentration of fasting glucose (normal, &lt; 110 mg/dL); arterial hypertension with  systolic and diastolic values of blood pressure (normal, systolic &lt; 150 mmHg; diastolic &lt; 90 mmHg); obesity with body mass index (BMI) calculated as weight in kilograms divided per height in meter squared; osteoporosis by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD), i.e. the amount of calcium in bone regions, evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>All participants in the surgical group are assessed 6 and 12 months after surgery and then yearly by two experienced endocrinologists to monitor any improvements in clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and comorbidities. 
All participants in the control group are assessed yearly during the follow-up period by two experienced endocrinologists to monitor any improvements in clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and comorbidities. 
The study will continue enough to have a mean follow-up of 7 years for each enrolled patient.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We compared the clinical outcome of patients with subclinical Cushings syndrome due to an adrenal incidentaloma randomly assigned to undergo surgery (n = 23) or close follow-up (n = 22). Laparoscopic adrenalectomy was more beneficial than conservative management for subclinical Cushings syndrome patients complying with our selection criteria.</summary>
