    <interventions>Sucrose 25% and distraction (Group 2):
2 mls will be administered slowly over 15 to 30 seconds orally via a needle-less syringe immediately prior to the infants immunisation injections. The infants will receive the combined Haemophilus influenzae type B/Meningococcal C vaccine (Hib-MenCCV) as an intramuscular injection, and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) as a subcutaneous injection (2 separate injections, one in each upper arm) by the Immunisation Nurse. The technique for administration of the injections by the immunisation nurses will be in accordance with the recommendations as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook. The injection, immunisation procedure, injection sites and order of each injection will be consistent for all infants across the study settings. A battery-operated bubble maker with colourful flashing lights will be used by the researcher to distract the infants immediately following the administration of the oral solution, and will continue until completion of the last injection. All infants will be placed in the cuddle position for the injections whereby the child sits sideways on the lap of the parent/guardian, with the arm to be injected held close to the childs body while the other arm is tucked under the armpit and behind the back of the parent/guardian who secures the infants exposed arm at the elbow as outlined in the Australian Immunisation Handbook.The volume of the sucrose (2 millilitres) used in this study is consistent with previous studies in this age group, and minimises the amount of sucrose administered.

Breastfeeding infants whose parents choose to breastfeed during immunisation;
Infants who have received an analgesic in the previous 24 hours including paracetamol, so as to not affect the response to painful stimuli during the procedure;
Infants who cannot receive their immunisation due to the presence of immunisation risk factors as cited in the Australian Immunisation Handbook (and as determined by the Immunisation Nurses);
Infants who are not able to be administered a sugar solution (as reported by the parents), and
Non-English speaking parents/guardians that do not have access to English translation at the time of the enrolment.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A research nurse familiar with the immunisation clinics will be present at the clinic to approach parents attending the clinic. If an infant is eligible, the research nurse will explain the study, determine the parent’s/guardian’s interest in participation, and obtain informed consent. Following parental consent to participate in the study, the researcher will record brief demographical data (e.g. number of other children, infant’s general health status) that will be provided by the parent/guardian.
The study pharmacist will prepare either 2 millilitres of 25% sucrose, 65% sucrose, or sterile water in capped needle-less syringes according to the allocation sequence. Solution syringes will be labelled with the study  number only, and will be placed in an opaque sealed and numbered envelope and opened sequentially for each participating infant. A placebo (sterile water) in addition to distraction (control group) is used to maintain blinding of the interventions to the researchers, nurses and parents, and avoid performance and detection bias. Study solutions will be prepared on a monthly basis in identical syringes. As all the solutions are colourless and odourless and differences in viscosity will not be apparent, and the allocation sequence will be blinded. Infants will receive one of the three solutions according to the next sequentially numbered envelope with the number recorded in the study data file and the infant’s record. Treatment allocation will remain unknown to the investigators until completion of the trial and completion of summary statistics. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Immunisation is regarded as one of the most significant preventive health measures of all time. Since the implementation of immunisation programs worldwide, there has been a substantial reduction in both morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases. Most vaccines, however, require a needle puncture and infants receive up to 14 separate injections within the first 18 months of life. Up to four separate injections may be required on the one
occasion in high risk infants. Sucrose 25% is now a widely used strategy for the management of needle related pain in Australian neonatal intensive care units, special care nurseries and postnatal units in newborn infants. However, the results from a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that there is a lack of evidence to recommend sucrose for the management of needle-related pain in older infants. The authors recommended that further research is
required to determine the effectiveness of sucrose, and also determine the most effective concentration in older, larger infants beyond the newborn period.</summary>
