    <interventions>Anastomosis versus stoma formation. 
Both procedures are used in standard surgical practice for necrotizing enterocolitis, the choice (in babies meeting the inclusion criteria of the present study) is determined by the surgeon's preference. Allocation of the terms "intervention" and "comparator" are therefore arbitary; for this section we will discuss stoma under intervention and anastomosis under comparator.
The whole operation (including and anaesthetic, the cut to open up the abdomen, removal of the diseased bowel and dealing with the two ends) takes about 2-3 hours. After removing the diseased bowel, the two ends are joined together using stitches.  A potential complication of an anastomosis is that it can leak and cause peritonitis or an abscess. This occurs uncommonly.</interventions>
    <comparator>A stoma is an opening of bowel onto the skin. As for an anastomosis, the whole operation takes about 2-3 hours. After removing the diseased bowel either one or both of the cut ends are sewn to the skin so bowel contents can leak into a bag. Some surgeons think a stoma may be "safer" than an anastomosis because it should not leak. The A further operation later on when the baby's condition has improved is necessary to close the stoma. A stoma however can cause several complications itself, such as prolapse.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by consultant paediatric surgeons and neonatologists. The paediatric surgeon will describe the trial to the neonate's parent(s)/care giver(s) at the time of getting consent for the study.
Randomization will be done on-line in theatre at the time of confirmation that both stoma and primary anastomosis are feasible. Theatre staff will login to the STAT trial website. The surgeon who invites the participant onto the trial and performs the surgery will be unaware of which group a patient will be allocated to at the time of determining eligability. The allocation occurs through a central computer at the Institute of Child Health in London.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be allocated to groups by weighted minimization using the following criteria: Weight at enrolment; Mechanical ventilation required; Inotropic support required; Extent of disease; Intestine involved.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease of babies' intestine which is associated with high mortality. The incidence of the disease is increasing in parallel with greater survival of premature babies. Babies with advanced NEC need surgery and it is not clear which is the best operation for them. After the removal of the intestine affected by NEC, some surgeons perform a stoma: an opening is made to the bowel from the skin and stool is collected into a bag; other surgeons prefer instead perform an anastomosis which requires the joining of the two ends of the intestine. Each operation has advantages and disadvantages. This trial will establish which is the best operation (i.e. stoma or anastomosis) to enhance the recovery of the intestine and improve survival. 
The hypothesis to be tested is that primary anastomosis after intestinal resection offers significant advantages to neonates with NEC including more rapid recovery of the intestine and therefore shorter duration of time to full feeding.</summary>
