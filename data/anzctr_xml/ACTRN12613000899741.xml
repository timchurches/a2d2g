  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is comprised of nine sub-studies, with separate recruitment conducted for each sub-study.

Gut motility (measured by a manometric tube, study A, F-H), gastric emptying (measured by 2D ultrasound and breath testing, studies B-E, I), blood glucose, gut hormones release, insulin concentrations, appetite perceptions (measured by Visual Analogue Scales, VAS) and energy intake during a buffet meal, will be measured. 

Study A, F-H: Subjects enrolled in each sub-study will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion, each of the intraduodenal infusions described for that study. All intraduodenal infusions are administered over a 90-min period. All visits within a sub-study are separated by 3-7 days.
Study A (i) 0.15 kcal/min L-leucine, (ii) 0.45 kcal/min L-leucine, or (iii) saline (control). 
Study F (i) 0.45 kcal/min L-leucine, (ii) 0.15 kcal/min L-tryptophan, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control).
Study G (i) 0.45 kcal/min L-leucine, (ii) 0.4 kcal/min Lauric Acid, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control).
Study H (i) 0.15 kcal/min L-tryptophan, (ii) 0.4 kcal/min lauric acid, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control).
Blood samples will be collected and VAS completed every 15 min from t = -15 to 90 min. At t = 90 min, the manometric assembly will be removed and subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. 

Studies B-E, I: Subjects enrolled in each sub-study will receive, in randomized, double-blind fashion, each of the intragastric bolus infusions described for that study. Infusions will be administered over 3 minutes using a feeding tube. Study visits will be separated by 3-7 days.
Study B (i) 5g L-leucine, (ii) 10g L-leucine, or (iii) saline (control)
Study C (i) 3g L-tryptophan, (ii) 1.5g L-tryptophan, or (iii) saline (control)
Study D (i) 10g L-leucine, (ii) 3g L-tryptophan, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control)
Study E (i) 10g L-leucine, (ii) 6g lauric acid, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control). 
Study I (i) 3g L-tryptophan, (ii) 6g lauric acid, (iii) combination of (i) and (ii), (iv) saline (control)
For each study visit, a mixed nutrient drink (Ensure, 400 kcal, 300ml) will be administered 15 min after the infusion (t=0). Blood samples will be collected and VAS completed every 15 min from t = -15 to 60 min. Gastric emptying measurements will be taken at t= -15 and every 5 min from t = 0 to 60 min. At t = 60 min, subjects will be presented with a cold, buffet-style meal. 

For all studies, subjects will be allowed 30 min to freely consume the buffet meal until comfortably full. At t = 120 min (study A, F-H) or t = 90 min (studies B-E, I), a final blood sample will be taken, and VAS administered</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A questionnaire is answered by the volunteer, and based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria,  eligibility is determined. A signed informed consent is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised treatment for each study visit, using a randomised table which was created on an excel spread sheet. Randomisation involved contacting the holder (study assistant) of the randomisation table to inform them of the next subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocationg a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution on each study day. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is increasing evidence that nutrient stimuli in the gut, especially in the small intestine, induce changes in gut motor and hormonal functions that play a central role in the control of energy intake and blood glucose. Previous research by our group has shown individual amino acids (L-tryptophan) and free fatty acids (lauric acid) to markedly reduce energy intake at a subsequent meal when administered intraduodenally or orally, respectively. This study aims to investigate the effects of the amino acids L-leucine, alone or in combination with L-tryptophan or lauric acid, on gut motility, gut hormone release, blood glucose control and energy intake in healthy lean individuals and obese patients with T2DM. We hypothesise that L-leucine, administered in combination with L-tryptophan or lauric acid, will take advantage of the several pathways activated by these two classes of nutrients enhancing their potency and thus, resulting in a marked improvement in the beneficial effects on gut functions and energy intake regulation previously associated with these nutrients alone.</summary>
