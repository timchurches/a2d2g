  <interventions>
    <interventions>The group metacognitive treatment protocol (Anderson &amp; Campbell, 2011) involves weekly two-hour group sessions, held over six weeks. Two follow-up sessions will also be held at 1 month and 3 months after the final treatment session. Minor amendments may be made to the protocol to ensure it is appropriate for an adolescent population, though the session structure will remain intact and involves the following components: Session 1 involves psychoeducation about maintain factors including repetitive negative thinking, metacognitive beliefs and counterproductive coping strategies. Session 2 involves targeting beliefs about the uncontrollability of worry and introduces attentional training and worry postponement. Session 3 involves challenging negative metacognitions about the danger of repetitive negative thinking and consists of evidence testing and behavioural experiments as homework. Session 4 focuses on challenging positive metacognitive beliefs, again through the process of evidence testing and behavioural experiments. Session 5 consists of increased emphasis on worry postponement and the use of active coping. Session 6 involves a review and the development of individual management plans. The follow-up sessions will involve a review of progress and management plans. Treatment fidelity will be ensured through adherence to the treatment manual in weekly supervision sessions. Sessions will also be recorded and rated for adherence by an independent rater. Groups will be facilitated by clinical psychology trainees under the supervision of experienced clinical psychologists, including the treatment manual author who has run the group numerous times with adult participants.

    <statisticalmethods>Treatment acceptability will be evaluated by recording of attendance and drop-out rates, in addition to client feedback on a brief treatment acceptability questionnaire completed at the conclusion of treatment. Scores on the acceptability measure will be summed to calculate a total score. Higher scores are indicative of a greater degree of client acceptability of the treatment program. 
Treatment outcome will be determined by calculating the proportion of participants who have achieved reliable and clinically significant change, based on the criteria suggested by Jacobson and Traux (1991). Pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up (1 month, 3 month) scores on each outcome measure will be compared (e.g., pre-treatment to post-treatment) for each participant. 
No formal sample size calculation performed. The treatment group will comprise 6-8 participants, as this size is recommended to allow for therapists to attend appropriately to clients idiosyncratic beliefs within transdiagnostic group treatment (McEvoy et al., 2015).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence to suggest that it may be of benefit to look at the common (transdiagnostic) processes that appear to exist across psychological disorders, rather than the typical approach of splitting into discrete disorders. Suggested processes include metacognition (beliefs about our thinking, which can be both positive and negative) and repetitive negative thinking (RNT), which includes worry and rumination. Metacognitive therapy has been used as a treatment approach across a range of mental disorders to target these proposed common underlying processes of metacognition and repetitive negative thinking and has shown promising results in studies with adult participants. There is evidence to suggest that similarities may also outweigh differences between psychological disorders in youth, particularly adolescents. Support is growing for an extension of models related to transdiagnostic processes of metacognition and repetitive negative thinking from adults to adolescents, although studies of the benefits of metacognitive therapy in adolescents have been limited. New research coming from the adult literature has shown that group metacognitive therapy is as beneficial as individual treatment protocols, but is delivered in a much briefer time frame and is found to be benefit individuals with a range of mental health diagnoses. The aim of the proposed study is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the acceptability and efficacy of brief group metacognitive therapy (MCT) targeting repetitive negative thinking for adolescents with a diagnosed emotional disorder. </summary>
