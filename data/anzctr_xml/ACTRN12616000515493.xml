  <interventions>
    <interventions>Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is currently the preferred method of anticoagulating the extracorporeal circuit used in continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).
The citrate solution is infused into the blood before the filter and a residual amount circulates back into the patients bloodstream prior to metabolism by the liver.
At present, surrogate measures of questionable utility are used to assess the presence or otherwise of citrate toxicity.
In this study, participants undergoing CRRT using RCA will have blood and ultrafiltrate collected three times a day for the duration of their CRRT (approx. 7 days).
These samples will be analysed to ascertain the plasma concentration of citrate and the clearance of citrate across the haemofilter membrane.
Participants will be monitored in the usual way during treatment.</interventions>

      <timepoint>For the duration of CRRT.
Measurements will be taken at 0600hrs, 1400hrs and 2200hrs each day.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serial assessment of citrate clearance across the haemofilter.
Clearance (C) will be calculated using the simultaneous values for ultrafiltrate concentration (U), plasma concentration (P) and ultrafiltrate flow rate (F) as C = UxF/P.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For the duration of the CRRT.
Ultrafiltrate will be sampled at the same times as the plasma samples are taken, that is, 0600hrs, 1400hrs and 2200hrs each day. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical methods will be largely descriptive.
No formal power calculation was performed as the intention is to describe a single population rather than to discriminate between two populations.
Therefore, sample size was estimated from the number required to approximate a normal population distribution. A figure of 30 to 50 is generally agreed as sufficient.
The data collected will be analysed to ascertain the mean plasma citrate and its standard deviation.
To assess the utility of using clearance data to predict filter failure, These data will be analysed as a time-to-event series.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to quantify to plasma concentration of citrate when using RCA with CRRT.
We expect to establish a mean and standard deviation for the plasma concentration.
Our secondary aim is to measure citrate clearance across the haemofilter over time.
We hope to show that this measure is sensitive enough to predict filter failure.</summary>
