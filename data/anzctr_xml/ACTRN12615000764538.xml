Statistical Analysis Plan*	
*Data double entered. Analysis by intention-to-treat and outcomes analysed in terms of change from baseline.
*Descriptive statistics (means, quartiles, standard deviations, ranges and proportions) generated for all variables included in the study.
*Standard bivariate tests (T tests and chi-square) will evaluate any potential systematic differences at baselines.
*Paired T tests to measure changes within-groups and between-groups between the preoperative and postoperative assessments.
*Changes that occur in continuous data over the entire study period analysed using a 2-way repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to estimate the change between the randomised groups, with baseline values of the response variables as the covariate along with group allocation.
*Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summarised by assigned treatment group. 
*Categorical variables will be summarised by frequencies and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according to the number of patients for whom data are available. 
*Continuous variables will be summarised by mean and standard deviation as well as quartiles.
*Regression analysis will be undertaken to account for potential confounding variables such as age, co-morbidities, dominant arm and type of tear.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rotator cuff tears are the most common condition affecting the shoulder. Conservative treatment can involve pain medication, corticosteroid injection, activity modification and physiotherapy. Surgical treatment is considered when conservative management has failed and quality of life is significantly impacted by shoulder dysfunction.

In the rehabilitation phase following rotator cuff repair, patients follow a set protocol determined by the surgeon. There is currently no agreement on whether one rehabilitation approach is better than the other. One study found that patients that underwent a shoulder program for 4-6 weeks before surgery had better function and reduced pain in the rehabilitation phase compared to a delayed program group. 

Pre-operative programs for patients scheduled for spinal surgery and total knee replacements have demonstrated some encouraging results. This type of program has not been used for patients awaiting rotator cuff surgery. The effects of such a program on patient post-operative expectations, function and quality of life have not been investigated.

The purpose of this research is to investigate whether the addition of a prehabilitation program to routine pre-operative care will result in better function, quality of life and post-operative expectations for patients awaiting shoulder surgery. 

The second aim of this research is to study the effect of prehabilitation on pain, shoulder range of movement, strength and exercise endurance. In addition, it may possibly reduce the need for surgery.

It is hypothesised that addition of prehabilitation to optimise physical and mental preparation will improve post-operative outcome than usual care (waiting list). </summary>
