    <interventions>This is a 4-month community-based randomised controlled trial in which sedentary women aged 45-65 years will participate in a multi-modal exercise program involving progressive resistance training and functional balance/mobility activities and be randomised to receive either: 1) a milk-based fortified supplement (powder dissolved in water) or 2) a milk-based non-fortified energy matched drink/powder (dissolved in water). The fortified milk product (FMP, 30 g dose, 2x per day at breakfast and lunch or within 1-2 hours of each exercise session: total 60 g/d) is largely comprised of milk powder (skim and whole), vitamins, minerals, complex milk lipids, and a small amount of hydrolysed fish collagen. It also contains low levels of Vitamins B12, B6, E and C. Each drink will contain  approximately 418 kJ, 9 g protein, 634 mg calcium, 7.5 ug vitamin D, 86 mg magnesium and 2 mg zinc.  The exercise program will be run within community leisure centres, individually tailored and supervised by qualified trainers. All participants will train twice a week within the leisure centres (45-60 minutes each) and after week 5 will be asked to complete one additional home based training session per week (15-20 minutes). The training will target all major muscle groups and participants will perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions at a moderate to high intensity. Training will be made progressively more challenging by incorporating the principle of progressive overload. Training will be supervised by accredited exercise trainers. Participants in both groups will be asked to consume their supplemental drink daily, once with breakfast and once at lunch/dinner (and within 1-2 hours after the exercise sessions on the three training days). Exercise logs and completed exercise cards will be regularly checked by the trainers and will be used to monitor exercise adherence. Adherence to the supplemental drink will be monitored using a daily food calendar.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the comparator group will also undertake the same exercise program as those in the intervention group, but will consume a non-fortified energy matched drink product (30 g dose, 2x per day, total dose 60 g/d.  The placebo (PLA) will predominantly containing carbohydrates (rice powder and whole milk powder), with no added vitamins or minerals.</comparator>

They will be initially screened on the telephone to determine if they qualify for the study based on the above inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants will then be asked to wear a pedometer for 7 consecutive days to determine their average daily step count. Those who qualify (&lt;7500 steps per day or &lt;9000 steps per day if &gt;9 hours daily sedentary time) will undergo a blood test to determine if their renal function permits them to take part.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 240 participants in total (120 per treatment arm) was determined using baseline and 12 week follow up data from a cohort of women currently participating in the Fonterra Reduced Steps intervention trial. From a preliminary analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for the change in ascending stair climb power between baseline and 12 weeks of a subset of the trial data we obtained a standard deviation of 32.0 W. The sample size required to detect a difference between the dairy supplement and placebo of 12.5 W with a significance of 5% and a power of 80% is 104 subjects per treatment arm. To allow for 15% attrition, 240 subjects (120 per treatment arm) will be recruited in total.

Data will be analysed on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. Wherever possible, we will obtain endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised participants in our final ITT analysis.  Analyses will be based primarily on the difference for the change over time from baseline, and in addition, the raw data will be subjected to repeated measures analysis of covariance using mixed models approach. Analysis of (co)variance will be followed by post-hoc comparisons using Tukeys t test. Data will be log transformed if required to achieve homogeneity of variance. Sensitivity analysis [per protocol] will also be undertaken that only includes those who have achieved at least 90% compliance to nutrition supplement and &gt;=66% (2 of 3 sessions per week) compliance to exercise sessions. Significance is declared if P&lt;0.05. Analyses will be performed using appropriate statistical software such as Stata, SAS, SPSS, or R.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project will investigate the effect of a dairy-derived nutritional supplement on physical health, mobility and well-being when combined with a physical activity program in 45-65 year-old women identified as habitually sedentary. The project has been designed to determine whether supplementation augments the positive response to a healthy lifestyle that includes moderate-level physical activity, and therefore whether supplementation is a beneficial addition to a healthy, active lifestyle. This is a 4-month randomised controlled trial in which 240 healthy, sedentary women will be randomised to receive: 1) a Fortified Milk Product (FMP) containing addition protein, vitamin D and calcium or a Non-Fortified drink (NFD). All women will also be asked to undertake a supervised gym-based exercise program twice a week under the supervision of accredited exercise trainers and one home-based training session. The multimodal exercise program will consist of strength, mobility and balance/functional training. Participants will undergo testing at baseline and after completion of the intervention (week 16) in the clinical lab at Deakin University. The main outcome for the study is functional muscle power, Secondary outcomes include: muscle strength, function, mobility and balance, body composition, cardiovascular health (blood pressure), circulating bone, cartilage, inflammatory and hormonal markers and perceptions of health, Dietary and physical activity habits will also be assessed. This study is important as the findings will underpin more precise exercise and nutrition guidelines for the prevention (and management) of age-related loss in muscle health and function in sedentary middle-aged adults, along with the ongoing refinement of community-based initiatives for the management of these age-related changes.</summary>
