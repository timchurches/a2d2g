  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis coli, other diseases requiring elective coloproctectomy with a permanent ileostomy</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Creation of a  continent stoma with the TIES-III System in gastroenterological surgery. The system prevents seepage and eliminates the need for wearing an external appliance (e.g. pouch/bag) on the abdomen for collection of faeces or urine. 

The duration of the intervention is similar to the duration of intervention for conventional ileostomy. Patients will be followed during 24 months after intervention. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Grades have been defined to evaluate the performance of the study device. 

Leakage is defined as ocular or haptic / tactile detection of at least one drip of waste fluid, alternatively enough of leaking substance to be ocularly or hapticly detected.

The success criterion is defined by a grade 0 to 2 of leakage. If leakage grade is higher than 2 then this will be considered as a failure:
-	Grade 0: total absence of leakage
-	Grade 1: leakage is observed at 3 hours or more after the last evacuation
-	Grade 2: leakage is observed between 2 hours and less than 3 hours after the last evacuation
-	Grade 3: leakage is observed between 1 hour and less than 2 hours after the last evacuation
-	Grade 4: leakage is observed immediately or less than 1 hour after the last evacuation

To be noted that in certain circumstances or events the device function may be altered. In such a case the use of a poach will be prescribed and success evaluation will be temporary stopped.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective is to evaluate the safety and performance of the TIES system used to secure the evacuation of the ileum content. This device should provide a system with total absence or limited appearance of leakage when the lid is used and between two evacuations of the ileum content.  

The study subjects are patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis coli, other diseases requiring elective coloproctectomy with a permanent ileostomy, patients with a failing conventional or continent ileostomy</summary>
