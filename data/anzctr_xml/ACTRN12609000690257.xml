  <interventions>
    <interventions>Systemic hypothermia is accomplished by an initial rapid infusion of 30ml per kg of ice-cold Hartmann's solution into a 16 guage peripheral intravenous catheter at 100 ml per minute, using a pressure bag. The target temperature of 33 degrees is achieved within about 30 minutes. Hypothermia is maintained by the use of a Therapeutic Goods Association approved endovascular cooling catheter which is inserted into the femoral vein and positioned with the catheter tip in the Inferior Vena Cava below the diaphragm. The endovascular cooling catheters use a heat exchange element within which circulates chilled sterile 0.9% saline within a closed internal circulatory system. The patient's rectal core temperature is monitored and provides a feedback system to the cooling system to maintain target temperature and control rewarming. the patient is cooled at 33 degrees for 24 hours and is rewarmed slowly to 37 degrees over 12 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants who are randomised to normothermia receive active routine care in the Acute Stroke Unit. Temperature is to be kept less than 38 degrees as per usual treatment post acute stroke.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infarct expansion and penumbral salvage: Mean percent penumbral salvage from baseline computerised tomography (CT)scan confirming acute Middle Cerebral Artery Ischaemic stroke to 30 day computerised tomography scan, hypothermia versus normothermia groups. Penumbral salvage is defined as tissue salvaged/tissue at risk in terms of lesion volume.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline CT scan and clinical assessment is attended on patients when first admitted to the emergency department. The CT scan is repeated 30 days post stroke to observe the outcome. The participant clinical outcome follow-up measures are attended 90 days post stroke.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and Clinical: Mortality, neurological deterioration as measured by a decline in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) of 4 points or more, catheter related complications, infective complications and thromboembolic complications in addition to all other events fulfilling standard definitions of adverse and serious events will be monitored and documented. The NIHSS will be performed at baseline, 24 hours, 7 days as well as any time a clinical neurological deterioration is suspected. A standard battery of clinical outcome measures will be performed at 90 days - NIHSS, modified rankin scale(mRS), and Barthel Index(BI). Favourable outcomes will be defined as mRS &lt; 3, BI &gt;90, NIHSS &lt; 4.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline CT scan and clinical assessment is attended on patients when first admitted to the emergency department. The CT scan is repeated 30 days post stroke to observe the outcome. The participant clinical outcome follow-up measures are attended 90 days post stroke.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will select acute MCA territory ischaemic stroke patients presenting within 6 hours of onset, with imaging evidence of potentially salvageable brain tissue extending over greater than 100% of the hypoperfused tissue volume. Patients presenting within 3 hours from onset treated with an intravenous thrombolytic medication will be eligible for inclusion in the study. The neurologist obtains informed consent from the patient prior to randomisation. An information statement is given to the patient and the patient is able to read and understand the procedure prior to agreeing to participate. The project is awaiting guardianship approval to obtain person-responsible consent. The patient is aware that they may be randomised to either the hypothermia or normothermia arm of the trial. The on-call stroke nurse or Study Coordinator obtains an opaque gold envelope from a locked cupboard containing CHIL randomisation envelopes in a specified numerical order. The next available envelope is selected and opened in front of an indepenent  witness in the emergency department to reveal the treatment allocation. Once randomisation occurs, the patient is informed of the intervention/control treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation will be by centre. Randomization will occur at the co-ordinating centre by calling the co-ordinating research nurse who will give the assignment. The sequence will be generated using random number generation (STATA 6.0; Stata Corp. 1999 Statistical Software: Release 5.0 College Station, TX: Stata Corporation).</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This research program will involve two parallel international trials. both designed as a proof of concept randomised controlled trials. The principle aims of these studies are to examine whether mild hypothermia, administered either by systemic (Australian trial) or local head cooling (Chinese trial) attenuates infarct expansion and salvages penumbral brain tissue using imaging outcome parameters. The safety and tolerability of the interventions will also be assessed. We will select acute MCA territory ischaemic stroke patients presenting within 6 hours of onset, with imaging evidence of potentially salvageable brain tissue extending over greater than 100% of the hypoperfused tissue volume. Patients presenting within 3 hours from onset treated with intravenous tPA will be eligible for inclusion in both countries.</designfeatures>
