  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aging is associated with a progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle function. Nutritional interventions which can help maintain muscle health during middle-age may improve quality of life in later years. The objective of the study is to evaluate the post-prandial effects of dairy products on muscle protein synthesis and muscle metabolism biomarkers. The study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel design. 48 healthy middle-aged males (45-60 yrs), BMI 18-30kg/m2 will be recruited, and muscle composition and muscle function tests conducted. After an overnight fast, subjects will consume one of six dairy beverages containing an equivalent content of 20g protein as standard milk protein concentrate (MPC1/20), 20g protein as propriety milk protein concentrate (MPC2/20), 20g protein as standard whey protein concentrate (WPC1/20), 20g protein as propriety whey protein concentrate (WPC2/20), 14g protein as propriety milk protein concentrate (MPC2/14) or 8g protein as propriety milk protein concentrate (MPC2/8).  Muscle protein synthesis will be determined based on a primed constant infusion of L-[ring-(13)C(6)]phenylalanine and L-[ring-(2)H(2)]tyrosine. The primary end-points are muscle protein synthesis rate, plasma and muscle metabolism biomarkers.</summary>
