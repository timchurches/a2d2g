  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the effect of metformin therapy on the expression of genes in endometrial tissue on biopsy encoding:
1)	proteins in the LKB1/AMPK pathway, which inhibits cell proliferation; 
2)	mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which stimulates endometrial growth;
3)	the cytochrome P450 enzyme, aromatase, which is essential for oestrogen biosynthesis in the endometrium, and hence endometrial growth.
These are co-primary outcomes as they are dependent variables

    <statisticalmethods>The primary study outcome is the effect of metformin on the pathway whereby metformin inhibits mTOR action, the pathway whereby it stimulates p53 and inhibits the cell cycle, and the pathway whereby it inhibits aromatase expression via AMPK and sequestration of CRTC2 in the endometrium of women at high risk of, or who have, EH. 
In an earlier study, hyperproliferative and hyperplastic endometrial tissue from 24 women receiving tamoxifen exhibited higher phosphorylation levels at specific amino residues of AKT in the order of (2.6 to 3.5 fold) and for mTOR (10 to 20 fold) compared with benign endometrial tissue from non treated patients (n=28). Our hypothesis is that metformin therapy will reverse this effect. 
Based on our previous research, we anticipate about 20% of women will not have evaluable endometrial biopsy samples. Thus, taking a pragmatic approach, we will recruit 130 women and randomise half (65) to each treatment. Allowing for a conservative 20% non completion rate and 20% unevaluable samples, we aim to have evaluable endometrial tissue and study data for 40 women per treatment arm. 
The distribution of the data will be examined and non normally distributed data will be transformed. Baseline levels in the treatment groups will be examined. If there are no significant between- group differences at baseline, comparison of between-group differences at the end of the study would be by t-test (or non-parametric equivalent). If there is any chance baseline difference, then an analysis of variance will be performed, adjusting for the baseline difference. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if we can prevent the development of uterine cancer in women who need to take tamoxifen therapy. 

We will investigate whether metformin, commonly used to treat diabetes, blocks cell pathways by which tamoxifen (and oestrogen) stimulates growth of the lining of the uterus.

This study will enable us to determine if there is a potential role for metformin
a) to prevent changes to the uterine lining in women treated with tamoxifen 
b) possibly prevent cancer of the uterus 

This study also offers a unique opportunity for us to determine whether all women with breast cancer should have ultrasound of their uterus before starting tamoxifen and after one year of therapy. 

Reasons for the study:
Over 75% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia have hormone sensitive cancer. Of these, at least 1/3 will be treated with a drug called tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen action. A recent large study has shown that 10 years of tamoxifen therapy is more effective than 5 years in prolonging survival. 

However, a downside of tamoxifen therapy is a 75% increase in the risk of uterine (endometrial) cancer. 

Presently there is no treatment to prevent endometrial cancer in women treated with tamoxifen, or for that matter for women in general. Endometrial cancer, the most common gynaecologic cancer, affects approximately 1 in 73 Australian women by the age of 75 years and 1 in 52 by the age of 85 years. 

We do know that: 
	tamoxifen is associated with a 7 fold increase in endometrial cancer over 5 years
	most women who develop an endometrial abnormality on tamoxifen do so in the first year of treatment
	1 in 5 women have an endometrial abnormality before starting tamoxifen (this increases the risk for tamoxifen-induced changes)


We will recruit women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer who are
	postmenopausal, 
	less than 75 years old 
	not diabetic.
