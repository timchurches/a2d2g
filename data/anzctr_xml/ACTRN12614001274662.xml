  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study of  the effects of alternative programming options/combinations, as part of routine standard of care, on chronic intractable back and/or leg pain in patients currently implanted with the Boston Scientific Corporation spinal cord stimulator (BSC SCS).  

Patients will be followed up 7-10 days following re-programming, and then periodically, as per standard of care, throughout the entire study period (until the study is closed - approximately 24 months).  No outcome assessments are conducted post 7-10 days.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected and analysed using PASW Statistics 18.0. Non-parametric 2-tailed cross sectional and pair-wise comparisons will be undertaken between conventional buzzing stimulation and paraesthesia free stimulation. Significance will be set at the 0.05 level.  

This is an exploratory study, therefore there is no predefined sample size justification.  Large sample sizes in exploratory studies are desired to allow for subgroup analysis and hypothesis generation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prospective, observational study. Subjects who have inadequate pain relief from their currently implanted conventional spinal cord stimulator (Boston Scientific Corp.) will be evaluated for eligibility in this study.

The study aims at investigating alternative programming combinations for these spinal cord devices. The programming algorithms are within the currently approved limits for the device. We hope to reduce the stimulation (paraesthesia) to a level in which it is no longer felt by the patient (subthreshold stimulation) but still provides improved pain relief and prolonged optimal therapy for patients with chronic back and leg pain.

The potential outcomes of this project have vast applications in chronic pain patients, where patients will often tolerate side effects such as uncomfortable stimulation sensations, so that their pain may be controlled.</summary>
