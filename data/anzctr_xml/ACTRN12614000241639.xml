  <interventions>
    <interventions>Maternal cardiovascular indices eg. cardiac output (CO)and systemic vascular resistances (SVR)of 20 women with spontaneous miscarriages &lt;12 weeks,will be recorded non-invasively using a continuous wave Doppler ultrasound probe placed at the suprasternal notch to insonate the velocity of blood flow through the aortic valve, using the USCOM cardiac output monitor (USCOM Ltd. Sydney, Australia).  This will take approximately 1 minute.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will comprise 20 women with healthy early pregnancies (between 8-11 gestational weeks), in whom their maternal cardiovascular indices will be similarly recorded with the USCOM cardiac output monitor.</comparator>

  <outcomes>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was based on Lo Prestis study (Lo Presti et al., Pregnancy Hypertension 2013) that found a mean (SD) SVR of 1400 (300) dyne.sec-1cm-5  in women who had spontaneous abortions compared to those with normal healthy early pregnancies. Prospective power analysis showed that a sample size of 18 patients per group would be required to detect a 20% difference in the primary outcome at a significance level of 5% and power of 80%. We will therefore recruit 20 patients to account for drop-outs.Data will be analysed using SPSS version 20.0. The following tests will be used to compare data between the two groups: Students t-test for patient demographics and other parametric data; Mann-Whitney U-test for non-parametric data; Fishers exact test for proportions. p&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this observational prospective cohort study is to compare maternal cardiovascular indices of 20 women with healthy early pregnancies (8-11 weeks gestation) with that of 20 women who have experienced spontaneous miscarriages, to see if there is a difference in systemic vascular resistances (SVR) [the primary outcome of interest]. This information will help in our understanding of a subset of womens possible causes for miscarriages in early pregnancy, as prior research indicates that some women may have higher SVR and abnormal adaptations to normal pregnancy. </summary>
