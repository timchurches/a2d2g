  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1 Year Pregnancy Rate - Pregnancy rate is defined as the cumulative percentage of pregnancies occuring within the time frame. The primary endpoint for this study is the pregnancy prevention rate after one year of reliance on the Adiana System for pregnancy prevention. The pregnancy rate was evaluated for all participants who underwent successful bilateral treatment and who had demonstrated tubal occlusion by hysterosalpingogram (HSG) at the end of the Waiting Period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device Placement Rate - Defined as successful bilateral tubal access followed by successful bilateral RF treatment and matrix placement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After First Treatment Attempt</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device Placement Rate - Defined as successful bilateral tubal access followed by successful bilateral RF treatment and matrix placement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Including Second Treatment Attempt</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Satisfaction With Placement Procedure - Determined by verbal questions up to 48 hours post placement. Endpoint reported represents minimum percentage of participants reporting somewhat satisfied, satisfied or very satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Satisfaction With Device Wearing - Determined by verbal questions during periodic follow-up contacts. Endpoint reported represents minimum percentage of subjects reporting somewhat satisfied, satisfied or very satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Waiting Period (1-Month, 2-Months, 3-Months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Satisfaction With Device Wearing - Determined by verbal questions during periodic follow-up contacts. Endpoint reported represents minimum percentage of subjects reporting somewhat satisfied, satisfied or very satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Wearing Period (3-Months, 6-Months, 9-Months, 12-Months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Comfort With Placement Procedure - Determined by verbal questions two hours following procedure or at discharge from facility, whichever came first. Endpoint reported represents minimum percentage of participants reporting any discomfort or pain experienced during the procedure as the same as or less than they expected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-Procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Comfort With Placement Procedure - Determined by verbal questions up to 48 hours post placement. Endpoint reported represents minimum percentage of participants reporting any discomfort or pain experienced in first 48 hours following procedure as the same as they expected, less than they expected or no pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Comfort With Device Wearing - Determined by verbal questions during periodic follow-up contacts. Endpoint represents minimum percentage of subjects reporting good, very good or excellent comfort.</outcome>

      <outcome>3 Year Pregnancy Rate - Pregnancy rate is defined as the cumulative percentage of pregnancies occuring within the time frame. The pregnancy rate was evaluated for all participants who underwent successful bilateral treatment and who had demonstrated tubal occlusion by hysterosalpingogram (HSG) at the end of the Waiting Period who have been followed for up to 3 years.</outcome>
