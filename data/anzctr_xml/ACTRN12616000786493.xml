  <interventions>
    <interventions>Neoadjuvant therapy on day 1 of each cycle for 4 cycles (cycle duration is 3 weeks)
Epirubicin 90mg/m2 intravenously
Paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 intravenously

Surgery
Surgical review 2-3 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, if operable surgery planned for within the next week. Timing based on surgeon availability. 
Surgery performed by specialist Breast Endocrine Surgical Unit. With larger tumours I.e. &gt;5 cm original size, mastectomy recommended. Axillary dissection recommended for all patients. The duration of the surgical procedure is dependent on the tumour size, complexity of presentation and the procedure used.

Adjuvant chemotherapy will commence when patient is deemed by their treating Medical Oncologist to have fully recovered from surgery. Usual time frame anticipated to be 4-6 weeks post-operatively.
Adjuvant therapy (CMF) on days 1 and 8 of each cycle for 4 cycles (cycle duration is 4 weeks)
Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 intravenously
Methotrexate 40 mg/ intravenously
Fluorouracil 600mg/m2 intravenously

Radiotherapy
Radiotherapy to chest wall/breast including supraclavicular node. Can begin any time after completion of the 1st cycle of CMF. Radiotherapy is planned for all patients and anticipated to commence no earlier than 2nd cycle of CMF chemotherapy, at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist. Radiotherapy administered, including the dose, frequency and duration and any other relevant parameters at the discretion of the treating Radiation Oncologist.

Hormonal therapy
Tamoxifen 20mg orally per day administered to patients with ER +ve cancers to commence following the completion of all chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Planned duration of Tamoxifen therapy is 5 years. Patient compliance is monitored by patient self-report of dosing to treating Medical Oncologist.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II study will determine whether the combination of Paclitaxel and Epirubicin can be used safely in the neoadjuvant setting in women with locally advanced breast cancer.  The study will determine whether, in a multi-centre setting, the activity of this combination is maintained with acceptable toxicity. The study will also determine the disease free survival and overall survival in patients with locally advanced breast cancer, treated with neoadjuvant Paclitaxel and Epirubicin followed by definitive local surgery and radiotherapy and adjuvant Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Fluorouracil.  </summary>
