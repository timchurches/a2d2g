  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1 - Physical activity module designed to persuade via central route information processing (i.e., deep and critical thinking):

The module in this condition consists of 12 slides., Participants are asked to sit in front of the computer in the laboratory and view the slides in their own time . Participants can only view the slides once and can not view a previous slide once they click 'next',  Topics covered include the benefits of physical activity, the physical activity guidelines for Australian adults (published by the Department of health and ageing)  and how to get started and stay committed to physical activity.  The slide content was developed by the lead researcher, drawing from content developed for previous intervention research (e.g., http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4594649/). 

The materials in this condition emphasise facts relating to physical activity and physical activity behaviour change. Strong arguments are presented in a clear and direct manner. No weak arguments are presented and emotional appeals are not used (including humour and emotive language).  </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2 - Physical activity module designed to persuade via peripheral route information processing (i.e., feelings, heuristics):

The module in this condition consists of 16 slides,  Participants are asked to sit in front of the computer in the laboratory and view the slides in their own time . Topics covered include the benefits of physical activity, what physical activity is recommended and how to get started and stay committed to physical activity.  

In contrast to arm 1, the materials in this condition utilize positive images (e.g., sunsets, fun physical activity) and narratives to convey key messages and to increase associations between physical activity and positive feelings. Text is used to create a narrative that people can identify with, rather than to emphasise facts.  </comparator>

      <outcome>Physical Activity intentions 

The following 3-items  (Courneya et al., 1999; Courneya, 1994; Rhodes &amp; Courneya, 2003) will be used to assessed physical activity intentions:

1) In the next week, my goal is to be physically active (response option 1- not at all to 7 every day)
2)Over the next week, I intend to engage in physical activity __ times per week (open response option)
3)I intent to engage in physical activity at least every other day over the next week ( (response option 1- not at all to 7 every day)

Responses are summed together to form overall intention score, with higher scores equating to higher intentions. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate post-intervention </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived message effectiveness 
A 3-item perceived effectiveness scale, adapted from Fishbein et al (2002) and Jensen (2012)  will be used to assess the perceived persuasiveness of the messages. The three items are were the materials convincing, would  people your age who are not already active be more likely to become active after viewing the materials? and Would the materials be helpful for convincing your friends and family to become more physically active? with 4-point response options: definitely no, no, yes, and definitely yes.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate post-intervention </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Need for cognition will be assessed so that it can be examined as an effect modifier 

 The 18-Item Need for Cognition Scale developed by Cacioppo, Feng Kao and Petty (1984) will be utilised. It is based on the original work by Cacioppo and Petty (1982) and is a shortened form scale of the original 34-item scale and was deemed to be more efficient   than the 34-item scale. Item examples include I would prefer complex to simple problems and thinking is not my idea of fun</outcome>

    <concealment>Individuals interested in participating are asked to complete a screening questionnaire online. All individuals are assigned a unique identification number, Algorithms are used to determine if individuals are eligible. If eligible they are denoted as such in the database. The file is then downloaded from the website and uploaded into R.  The allocation script that was developed a priori is then run for eligible individuals only to randomise them into study groups  on a ratio of 1:1 using random block sizes. This is carried out by a statistician with de-identified data.  The statistician then provides the research team with  the allocation sequence. </concealment>

Assuming that high (low) NFC individuals have 5 min (3 min) attention spans when matched with website (ie central vs peripheral) and 1 min (1 min) spans when mis-matched, and assuming normally distributed attention spans with a common standard deviation of 2 min, then simulations indicate that with 50 individuals (25 in each group) there is at least 80% power to detect an interaction between NFC (high v low) and treatment (central v peripheral) when the prevalence of high NFC is between 30% and 70% of the randomized population. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Providing individuals with physical activity advice and guidance can help to improve their physical activity behavior. This is especially the case when individuals are motivated to read the information and are able to understand it and consider it thoughtfully. There is some evidence that providing people with information that is matched to their cognitive processing style, known as need for cognition, increases motivation and ability to read the messages presented. Further, there is evidence that this in turn is associated with greater improvements in attitudes and behaviors.  This has been shown in a health context before (e.g., mammogram utilization), but evidence in the physical activity field is lacking. Given that interventions matched to participants need for cognition are more resource intensive to develop than unmatched interventions (requiring at least double the intervention materials), research examining the impact of matching to need for cognition in the physical activity domain is needed before this technique is adopted en masse in this area.   

We aim to examine how stimuli optimized for central route (deep thinking) processing compared to peripheral route processing (use of simple cues) are processed by individuals with higher and lower need for cognition and the impact of this on the persuasiveness of the materials. This will be achieved in a mixed method laboratory-based study, with outcomes assessed using eye-trackers, combined with  brief questionnaires and qualitative interview.

We hypothesize that individuals who are shown materials that best match their cognitive processing style will show greater attention to the materials and less distraction when processing them (assessed by eye tracking devices) compared to individuals who are shown materials that do not match their cognitive processing style. Further, we anticipate that greater attention will be associated with more positive ratings of the intervention materials and greater motivation for physical activity participation (assessed via self-report; quantitative and qualitative methods).  

Overall, this study will provide valuable insights into how to develop physical activity messages  and in doing so may help to inform the development of more effective physical activity interventions in the future.  </summary>
