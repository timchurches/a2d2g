    <interventions>Parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT). PCIT is a family-behavioural treatment for parent-child dyads, where the young child (2-7years of age) has severe behaviour problems and/or there are serious concerns regarding parenting. Parents and their child attend weekly therapy sessions (45-60 minutes in length) and commit to 5 minute therapy homework (recorded daily). 
The PCIT therapist coaches the parent (from behind a one-way screen using a transmitting and receiving device), during live parent-child interactions.  
PCIT is a manualised programme where parents complete weekly rating scales to monitor their child's behaviour (self-report), homework compliance (self-report) and the parent-child relationship (assessed by the therapist using a standardised coding sheet). To ensure treatment integrity, the therapist completes weekly session integrity checklists, video-tapes sessions, and attends monthly PCIT supervision. Additionally a random selection of videotaped sessions will be assessed by an external PCIT supervisor, to ensure inter-rater reliability of 80%. 
PCIT has two phases of treatment. Child Directed Interaction (CDI), where the parent learns to follow their child's lead during play and how to use the positive PRIDE skills of giving labelled Praise, Reflecting  appropriate language, Imitating play sequences, Describing how their child plays and showing Enjoyment when they are with their child. They also learn to refrain from using questions, commands and negative talk during interactions with their child. Any annoying or obnoxious behaviour is handled with active ignoring and positive redirecting and play stops for any dangerous and destructive play. During CDI the relationship develops warmth and the interactions become more positive. In order to master this phase of treatment and move on to phase two,the parent must give 10 Labelled Praises, 10 Behavioural Descriptions, 10 Reflections of language, and use no more than 3 questions, commands or negative talk, in a 5 minute play sequence. The child's behaviour must have improved and their play become more organised according to the parental reports and therapist observations.
In the second phase of treatment, Parent Directed Interaction (PDI), the parent learns to give good commands, set limits and boundaries and a sensitive discipline process to handle non-compliance. The child learns to listen and make good choices. Mastery criteria for PDI is when the parent can give 4 positively stated commands (using the correct process 75% of the time) and the child is able to comply 75% of the time. Therapy does not stop until master criteria is reached and the child's behaviour ratings has fallen well below normal limits according to the Eyberg Child Behavioural Inventory (ECBI) i.e a total score of 115 or below. 
For this study, collation of data will stop after 12 sessions of therapy.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Eyberg Child Behaviour Inventory (ECBI) is a measure of child behaviour (2-16years). A score of 131 and above is considered within the clinical range. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The ECBI is measured weekly and allows an opportunity to show incremental changes. It will also be measured at 3month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding Sheet -III (DPICS-III). This is a behavioural coding system that measures the quality of parent-child social interactions used specifically for PCIT. An abbreviated coding manual (DPICS-A) is used by all PCIT therapist and requires 80% inter-rater reliability for competency. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The DPICS -III is completed on a weekly basis allowing both parent and child mastery criteria to be assessed. It will also be measured at 3month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST): This is a brief screening questionnaire to find out about peoples use of psychoactive substances. It was developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO). It is designed to be used by healthcare workers to help identify potential substance use problems. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ: SE):  This is completed by the study participant about their child/ren. There are different forms depending on the age of the child, reflecting their developmental period. There are between 2236 questions with, most of the time, sometimes, and rarely or never as the range of answers available. Each questionnaire addresses seven crucial behavioural areas: self-regulation, compliance, communication, adaptive functioning, autonomy, affect, and interaction with people. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Completed pre and post treatment and at 3 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ages and Stages Questionnaire Third Edition (ASQ-3):  This is completed by the study participant about their child/ren. It consists of 30 questions which assist in determining a young child's progress in each developmental area and whether there are any developmental delays. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Completed at pre and post treatment and at 3 month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We will compare pre and post treatment levels of child behaviour using the ECBI as the primary outcome measure. The ECBI is completed on a weekly basis during treatment, so we are able to measure incremental improvement.  Adjusted differences and 95% confidence intervals will be generated to summarise programme effects. Linear Mixed Models (LMM) analysis will be performed on maternal outcome data to investigate time and participant effects. In the LMM model, the clinical measure will be set as the dependent variable, time as a fixed factor, and participant as a random factor. Pair wise comparisons will be conducted to further investigate the time effect (i.e. whether the change occurred between baseline and post-intervention or between post-intervention and follow-up point). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study looking at the feasibility and utility of delivering Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) to vulnerable New Zealand families in two real world settings, an Infant Mental Health service (where the children and or their parents have mental health issues) and a residential parenting service for mothers and their children (who are under the care of Child Youth and Family). We will explore whether PCIT is acceptable and useful as a therapy for these two vulnerable communities. We will also explore whether the outcomes reported in large scale randomised control trials can be replicated in the real-world.  The findings will then be used to inform the design of a large-scale RCT.</summary>
