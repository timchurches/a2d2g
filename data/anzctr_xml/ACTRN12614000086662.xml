  <interventions>
    <interventions>1 hour, 3 times/per 18 week strength exercise program in 2 phases targeting the quadriceps muscles in people in IBM.  Sessions will held in as a group and supervised by a senior physiotherapist in a tertiary hospital. 
Phase 1: establishing baseline.  5-6weeks of traditional moderate intensity strength training program (1 hour 3x/wk).
Exercises: squats, leg extensions, inner range quadriceps exercises, leg press.
repetitions: 8-12, 3 sets
Load: approx 60% of maximum lift

Phase 2: 12 weeks strength training at low intensity accompanied by partial occlusion of blood flow to quadriceps via blood pressure cuff placed around thigh.  The cuff will remain inflated and around the thigh during exercises.
exercises: as above
repetitions: 15
load: 20-50% of maximum lift
occlusion pressures: ~50% of systolic blood pressure</interventions>
