  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants consume 2 protein meals consisting of 19.5gms of dairy protein per meal. The meals are consumed on 2 different occasions with an interval of at least 1 week between the meals.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants consume 1 no protein meal.  This meal is carbohydrate only and is consumed on 1 occasion, with at least a 1 week interval between the other meals (protein meals)</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether ingestion of protein and especially dairy protein, increases the secretion of insulin and thus it's anti-inflammatory activity. The plasma insulin secretion  will be measured using a commercial kit (Roche) on a Hitachi E170 autoanalyser.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The insulin levels will be measured at baseline, 1 hour and 4 hour intervals after consuming the meals.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Markers of inflammation-Plasma levels of IL-6, will be measured by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (R&amp;D Systems) Plasma Free fatty acid levels will be measured using a commercial kit from Roche Diagnostics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All these blood samples will be taken at baseline, 1 hour and 4 hours after the meal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma Glucose will be measured by a routine method in the hospital diagnostic laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All these blood samples will be taken at baseline, 1 hour and 4 hours after the meal.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pro-inflammatory cytokines concentrations are elevated in the fasting and postprandial state and are thought to contribute to the high risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in obesity. Ingestion of protein and especially dairy protein, increases the secretion of insulin that has anti-inflammatory activity.  The study aims to determine whether ingestion of dairy protein with or without carbohydrate decreases postprandial levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in obese women. The findings will be highly relevant to the use of high -protein diets in the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes.</summary>
