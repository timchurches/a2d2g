  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in this cross over study will wear 17 randomly allocated, commercially available contact lenses (maximum 4 lens types per visit) over 5 visits. Each visit is approximately 1.5 hours in duration where each lens type will be worn for 40 minutes contralaterally. An overnight washout between visits is required. Higher order aberration profile will be measured with the EyeMapper. The EyeMapper is a non-invasive novel instrument designed to measure refractive errors and higher order abberations of the eye over wide angles of view.</interventions>
    <comparator>At the Basline visit (Visit 1), control lens (Lotrafilcon B) to be worn in both eyes for approximately 40 minutes and then lenses will be removed.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the global higher order aberrations between different commercial contact lenses</outcome>
      <timepoint>Aberration profile measurements will be carried out with a non-invasive novel instrument (EyeMapper) at all 5 scheduled visits. For each lens type, aberration measurement will take approximately 20 minutes.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the global retinal image quality between different commercial contact lenses</outcome>
      <timepoint>Retinal image quality measurements will be carried out with a non-invasive novel instrument (EyeMapper) at all 5 scheduled visits. For each lens type, retinal image quality measurements will take approximately 20 minutes.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent.
Be 18 to 35 years old, male or female.
Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator.
Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses.
Have a prescription that is myopic between -0.25 to -4.00D (inclusive).

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.
Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sjogrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.  Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.
Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.
Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial. 

NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used.

Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.
Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Contraindications to contact lens wear.
Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.
Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks for long-term studies and 48 hours between short-term studies.
Pregnancy*.

*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>

    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The planned number of participants is a minimum of 40. Enrolment will take place over approximately 2 months.

Participants will be screened for general clinical trial suitability by way of a routine eye examination which includes refraction, visual acuity and general eye health.  Informed consent will be obtained prior to any clinical trial procedures.  Both experienced contact lens wearers and neophytes (participants with no prior lens wear experience) will be enrolled into lens wear. 

 The order of administering the various contact lens designs will be randomised for all participants. Concealed allocation will be by way of central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>The control lens will not be randomised, it will be tested bilaterally on both eyes in the first stage. 
All other 16 test lens types will be divided into groups of 4. Each group of 4 lens types will be tested on the same stage. The four lens types within each stage will be randomly allocated based on a randomization plan generated at www.randomization.com. The random sequence will be generated to create a random permutation of lens types where each participant receives all the 4 lens types in random order.</sequence>
