    <statisticalmethods>The primary study outcome is the QoR-40 score at 24 hours post-operatively. The sample size calculation is based on the assumption that a difference in QoR-40 score of 10 or more is significant. This results in a total of 80 participants, 40 in each group.
Analysis will be conducted after recruitment in a blinded manner. 
No interim analysis will be conducted.

    <summary>To compare QoR-40 scores twenty-four hours post-operatively in patients who have undergone general anaesthesia using propofol infusion as maintenance to those in whom sevoflurane inhalation is used as maintenance.
To compare rates of nausea and vomiting, pain scores and opioid consumption twenty-four hours post-operatively in patients who have undergone general anaesthesia using intravenous agents only as maintenance to those in whom sevoflurane inhalation is used as maintenance.
To achieve this, participants will be asked to complete Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaires, one for pain and one for nausea, at baseline and at the twenty-four hour post-operative visit. </summary>
