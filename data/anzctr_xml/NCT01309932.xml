    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if combination therapy with Pegylated Interferon
      Lambda (BMS-914143) plus Ribavirin (RBV) with a single direct antiviral agent (BMS-790052 or
      BMS-650032) for 24 weeks is effective and safe for treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC)
      compared to current standard therapy with Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a plus RBV for 48
      weeks.</summary>
