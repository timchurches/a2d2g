  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is experimental human and animal data to support a role for bacteria and / or bacterial products in the cause of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohns disease. Furthermore antibiotics have been shown in some cases to provide beneficial effects in IBD. In the last few years there has been increasing interest in probiotic agents in the treatment of various gastrointestinal conditions. The aims of this trial are to 1) determine the efficacy of probiotic therapy upon clinical parameters in children with IBD 2) determine the efficacy of probiotic therapy upon quality of life parameters in children with IBD 3) define the effects of probiotic therapy in children with IBD upon markers of inflammation both standard and novel 4) define the effects of probiotic therapy in children with IBD upon gut bacteria and 5) to document the tolerance and acceptability of probiotic therapy in children with IBD</summary>
