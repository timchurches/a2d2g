  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with chronic stable angina receive Ivabradine Hydrochloride tablets 5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks,and then if resting heart rate is greater than 80bpm,participants take 7.5mg twice a day for 8 weeks; if resting heart rate is less than or equal to 80bpm,participants take 5mg twice a day for 8 weeks.
The subjects had only one drug number.Investigators should keep an account of the actual dose,and record the grant and recovery of drugs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients with chronic stable angina receive Atenolol tablets 12.5 mg twice a day for 4 weeks,and then if resting heart rate is greater than 80bpm,participants take 25mg twice a day for 8 weeks; if resting heart rate is less than or equal to 80bpm,participants take 12.5mg twice a day for 8 weeks.
