  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of 120 ASA physical status I and II were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n=40) before induction of anesthesia. Patients of group dexamethasone (group D) were administrated 8 mg dexamethasone intravenous infusion before induction of anesthesia. Patients of group propofol (group P) were infused to sub hypnotic (1 mg/kg/h)  propofol during operation. Patients of group control (group C) were applied infusion of 10% intralipid until the end of surgery. The incidence of PONV, needs for rescue analgesic and antiemetic were recorded in the first 24 h postoperatively.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Before study, sample size was determined by power analysis, assuming that the total incidence of PONV in the placebo group would be 70%, with a 35% reduction in the incidence of PONV in the treatment group with alpha error was set at 0.05 and beta error at 0.2. According to power analysis, any group size of 31 patients was considered adequate. We decided to enroll 40 patients per group to allow dropout. The post-hoc test which was held during the statistical evaluation showed 31 patients for the propofol group and 35 patients for the dexamethasone group were needed. Statistical analysis was performed using the program of SPSS20. One way ANOVA was used to compare the differences of numeric data among the groups. Chi-squared test was used for categorical data. Level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are distressful common side-effects following laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) .The reported incidence of PONV is 4672% in patients undergoing LC if prophylactic antiemetic is not given 
As an anesthetic agent, propofol is highly effective drug preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting , thus it has been used by a number of anesthesiologist.It was demonstrated that continuous infusion of sub hypnotic propofol prevents PONV in female patients receiving intravenous patient-controlled analgesia .
Glucocorticoids have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immune-modulating and antiemetic effects. But, their effect mechanisms are not fully clarified . Dexamethasone, as an glucocorticoid, has been used as an antiemetic drug in patients receiving chemotherapy for more than 25 years .Several prospective studies have shown that severity of PONV associated with LC is reduced by dexamethasone.
The primary aim of this prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and continuous infusion of sub hypnotic propofol to prevent PONV in patients undergoing LC. Secondary aim of this study was to determine the rescue antiemetic and analgesic in the first 24 hours after LC.
