    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Approximately 100 male subjects aged between 45-80 years of age will be recruited from databases and public media outlets. Following preliminary screening via telephone, potential subjects will attend the clinic for an information session and will be requested to provide their consent for inclusion in the trial. Consenting potential subjects will undergo a medical assessment including lifestyle, current medications, physical assessment and medical history; this data will be used for the comprehensive screening and to provide contextual data for the study.

The trial product is sent to already randomised and in numbered containers (001-100) so administering staff are blinded to allocation.

Once enrolled in the trial, participants will be randomly allocated to either the placebo comparator group (n=50) or the active intervention group (n=50). Enrolled participants will be allocated a sequential number from 0001 to 0100 determined by the order in which they are enrolled. Subjects will be allocated a (randomised) TPC that corresponds with their allocation number; for example, participant 0034 will receive TPC 0034.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation code used to identify TPCs is a sequential number (0001 to 00100) generated by the Random Allocation Software</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to assess the effectiveness of Ageratum conyzoides on day-time and night time urinary frequency, symptoms of BPH, sleep quality and on SHBG and serum testosterone levels. Due to the ant-inflammatory and analgesic actions of Ageratum conyzoides, it has a long history of use traditionally in Caribbean folk medicine for a number of mens health issues including prostate and urinary problems. The investigational product is a tablet - form herbal medicine, containing 250mg of Ageratum conyzoides extract. The daily dose will be 1 capsule per day taken with the evening meal, taken over 3 consecutive months.</summary>
