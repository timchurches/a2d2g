    <interventions>This is a prospective, multi-centre, open-label study, randomised controlled trial of elotuzumab-cyclosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone (E-CTD) compared with cyclophosphamide-thalidomide-dexamethasone (CTD). All patients will meet the eligibility criteria at registration and recruitment will continue until 300 patients have been randomised.  Randomisation will occur in a 2:1 ratio with 2 patients randomised to the E-CTD arm for every 1 patient randomised to the CTD arm.  Patients will not be replaced after randomisation occurs.

Treatment is as follows, with cycle durations of 28 days:
 
EXPERIMENTAL ARM (E-CTD):  
Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 = Elotuzumab (10mg/kg IV weekly) + Cyclophosphamide (500mg oral tablet weekly) + Thalidomide (100mg oral capsule, once daily at night-time) + Dexamethasone (28 mg oral tablet weekly AND 8 mg IV weekly);
Cycle 3 and beyond = Elotuzumab (20mg/kg IV day 1) + Cyclophosphamide (500mg oral tablet weekly) + Thalidomide (100mg oral capsule, once daily at night-time) + Dexamethasone (28 mg oral tablet AND 8 mg IV on day 1; 40 mg oral tablet on days 8, 15, and 22).
To be repeated every 28 days, with tumour assessment every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then for overall survival every 12 weeks.

CONTROL ARM (CTD)
Cyclophosphamide (500mg oral tablet weekly) + Thalidomide (100mg oral capsule, once daily at night-time) + Dexamethasone (40 mg oral tablet weekly).
To be repeated every 28 days, with tumour assessment every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then for survival every 12 weeks.

Median expected duration of treatment is 12 months in the experimental arm, and 8 months in the control arm.
Except for an emergency situation in which proper care for the protection, safety and well-being of the trial participant requires that an alternative treatment be used, the trial shall be conducted exactly as described in the approved protocol. It is the responsibility of the investigator to document any protocol deviations in the appropriate log and the subjects case report form (CRF), accompanied by a suitable explanation and to satisfy any reporting requirements of their local Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).

The choice of agents for venous thromboembolism, anti-viral, acid reflux and bisphosphonate prophylaxis will be as per institutional protocol. Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of patient consent or study closure.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the progression free survival (PFS) with E-CTD when compared to CTD for the treatment of RRMM</outcome>
      <timepoint>PFS will be measured from the date of randomisation to the date of the first documented progression, according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, or the date of death.  At the time of analysis, patients not deemed lost-to-follow-up, will have their PFS censored at the study censor date for PFS (the earliest of the last dates of assessment of patients not known to have died and not deemed lost to follow up).  Patients deemed lost-to-follow up will have their PFS censored at the earlier of their last date of assessment or the study censor date for PFS.

Patients will be assessed for survival every 3 months after documentation of progression or the initiation of a new anti-cancer therapy, until the median follow up has reached 48 months or when all patients have either withdrawn, died, or been deemed lost to follow up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the overall response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) (ORR + minimal response) achieved with E-CTD when compared with CTD for the treatment of RRMM.  These are composite outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis of ORR will take place when all patients remaining on the study have been assessed for objective response as per IMWG response criteria.  The ORR will be calculated as the proportion of randomised patients in each arm who achieve a partial response or better.  The same approach will also be used to investigate the CBR in each arm (the proportion of randomised patients in each arm who achieve an MR or better).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the overall survival (OS) with E-CTD when compared with CTD for the treatment of RRMM.</outcome>
      <timepoint>OS will be measured from the date of randomisation to the date of death.  Patients not deemed lost-to-follow-up will have their OS censored at the study censor date for OS (the earliest of the last dates of contact of patients not known to have died and not deemed lost to follow up).  Patients deemed lost to follow up will have their OS censored at the earlier of their date of last contact or the study censor date for OS.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity in patients achieving serological CR, and the impact of MRD on PFS.  These are composite outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Euroflow 8 colour multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) will be performed on bone marrow aspirate samples taken at suspected CR.  MRD negativity in patients achieving serological CR will be summarised by treatment arm, as proportions will be reported.  The impact of MRD negativity on PFS will be investigated by fitting time to MRD negativity as an additional time-varying covariate in the Cox PH model that also includes covariates for treatment arm and the randomisation strata.</timepoint>

    <summary>PURPOSE
The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of elotuzumab when combined with cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (E-CTD) when compared to a standard cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone (CTD) triplet for the treatment of relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM)

WHO IS IT FOR?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are over 18 years, have been diagnosed with RRMM, have had between 1-3 prior lines of therapy (may include autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant (induction followed by ASCT and maintenance is one line of therapy), and do not have central nervous system involvement with the disease.

STUDY DETAILS
Enrolled participants who meet the eligibility criteria at registration will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio with 2 patients randomised to the E-CTD arm for every 1 patient randomised to the CTD arm.  Treatment in both arms will include a combination of weekly intravenous infusions, and daily and weekly oral tablets.  Patients will receive treatment in 28 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal or consent.  Patients will be followed up every 4 weeks for MM response until disease progression, and then every 12 weeks for survival.  The trial duration is estimated at approximately 4.75 years.

OUTCOMES
It is hoped that the findings of this trial will determine whether the addition of elotuzumab to a standard cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone triplet will improve progression free survival in relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma patients
