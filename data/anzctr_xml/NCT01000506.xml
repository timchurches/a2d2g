  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Clinically Significant Exacerbations of Asthma Per Year - Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma are defined as worsening of asthma which required use of oral/systemic corticosteroids (for participants on maintenance oral corticosteroids [OCS], an exacerbation requiring OCS is defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days) and/or hospitalization and/or emergency department (ED) visit. The frequency of clinically significant exacerbations of asthma over the 52-week treatment period is expressed as exacerbation rate per year. Analysis of the number of exacerbations was performed using a negative binomial regression model with covariates of treatment group, Baseline (BL) maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), region, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and BL percent (%) predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and with logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable</outcome>

      <outcome>Time to First Clinically Significant Exacerbation Requiring Oral or Systemic Corticosteroid, Hospitalization and/ or ED Visit - Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma are defined as worsening of asthma which required use of oral/systemic corticosteroids (for participants on maintenance OCS, an exacerbation requiring OCS is defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days) and/or hospitalization and/or ED visit. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of an exacerbation is expressed as percentage of participants with an exacerbation over time (by Week 16, Week 32 and Week 52).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Exacerbations Requiring Hospitalization (Including Intubation and Admittance to an Intensive Care Unit [ICU]) or ED Visit Per Year - The frequency of exacerbations of asthma requiring hospitalization (including intubation and admittance to an intensive care unit [ICU]) or ED visit over the 52-week treatment period is expressed as exacerbation rate per year. Analysis of the number of exacerbations was performed using a negative binomial regression model with covariates of treatment group, Baseline (BL) maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), region, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and BL percent (%) predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and with logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable.</outcome>

      <outcome>Time to First Exacerbation Requiring Hospitalization or ED Visit - Exacerbations of asthma requiring hospitalization or ED visit were assessed.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of All Recorded Exacerbations Per Year - Clinically significant exacerbations (ex) of asthma are defined as worsening of asthma which required use of oral/systemic corticosteroids (for par. on maintenance OCS, an ex requiring OCS is defined as the use of oral/systemic corticosteroids at least double the existing maintenance dose for at least 3 days) and/or hospitalization and/or ED visit. In the case, an event described as an ex was not associated with a deterioration in &gt;=1 of the objectives of eDiary parameters, the investigator (inv) provided an explanation to support the decision for defining the event as an ex. All recorded ex were defined as those recorded by inv, regardless of the outcome of the ex review process. Analysis was performed using Negative Binomial regression model with covariates of treatment group, BL maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), region, ex in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and BL % predicted FEV1, and with logarithm of time on treatment as an offset variable.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 Over the 52-week Treatment Period - FEV1 is defined as the volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs in 1 second. Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements were taken by spirometry at each clinic visit. The change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of Baseline, region, Baseline maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable), treatment and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by Baseline and visit by treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Baseline up to Week 52 or EW</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Post-bronchodilator FEV1 Over the 52-week Treatment Period - FEV1 is defined as the volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs in 1 second. Post-bronchodilator FEV1 measurements were taken by spirometry at Baseline, Week 16, Week 32 and Week 52. Post bronchodilator values were recorded following reversibility testing, using the maximum post bronchodilator method. Participants unable to achieve &gt;=12% reversibility and 200 mL change at Visit 1, reversibility test was repeated at Visit 2. These procedures to achieve the maximum post-bronchodilator are generated by the Asthma Clinical Research Network. The change from Baseline is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of Baseline, region, Baseline maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable), treatment and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by Baseline and visit by treatment</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score Over the 52-week Treatment Period - The ACQ-6 is a six-item questionnaire. The six questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheeze) and use of short-acting bronchodilator over the previous week. The response options for all these questions consist of a 0 (no impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation) scale. The overall ACQ score is calculated as the mean of the 6 questions and therefore ranges between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). Change from BL is defined as the difference between the value of the endpoint at the time point of interest and BL value. Analysis was performed using mixed model repeated measures with covariates of BL, region, BL maintenance OCS therapy (OCS vs. no OCS), exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable), BL % predicted FEV1, treatment and visit, plus interaction terms for visit by BL and visit by treatment group.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to show whether mepolizumab given every 4 weeks intravenously
      (i.v.) can reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations in subjects with severe asthma
      despite receiving high doses of standard asthma medications. The study will look at different
      doses of mepolizumab in comparison to a placebo.</summary>
