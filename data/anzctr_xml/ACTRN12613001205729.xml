  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effect of probenecid on cephalexin has already been studied in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but with less accurate methods and fewer volunteers.  We wish to repeat the study using highly accurate methods and 10 volunteers.  The boosting effect of probenecid on cephalexin may have very widespread positive medical, social and economic consequences.  For example, it may allow cephalexin (with probenecid) to be given only twice daily rather than three or four times daily (on its own) for people in the community with mild infections, improving convenience and compliance.  In addition, probenecid-boosted oral cephalexin may be as powerful as intravenous antibiotics, meaning that fewer patients with moderate infections will need admission to hospital, selected patients will be able to be discharged from hospital earlier, and commonly prescribed outpatient intravenous antibiotic programmes will no longer be needed in many situations.  This could save NZ up to $4 million in health-care costs per year and improve patient outcomes.  
  
I was approved an almost identical study by the NZ Ethics Committee last year (NZ HDEC # NZ/1/4C71012), which I did not register as a clinical trial with ANZCTR but was completed with very clear and positive results.  I am in the process of applying for approval of the probenecid and cephalexin study with the NZ Ethics Committee.</summary>
