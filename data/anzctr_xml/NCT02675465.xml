  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ATB200
Treatment: drugs - AT2221

Experimental: ATB200 - In Stage 1, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following sequential single ascending doses of intravenously infused ATB200 for 3 dosing periods.

Experimental: ATB200 + AT2221 - In Stage 2, safety, tolerability, and PK will be evaluated following single- and multiple-ascending dose combinations of ATB200 co-administered with AT2221 (Miglustat) In Stage 3, long term safety and efficacy will be assessed following 24 month treatment of ATB200 co-administered with AT2221 (Miglustat)
