  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, randomised, double-blind cross-over study of 30 heart failure patients on aspirin. They will have aspirin (oral) stopped for 4 weeks and then be randomised to 2 groups. Group 1 will be aspirin (orally 100mg) and placebo  for 6 weeks and then a 4 week no drug and then Ticagrelor (orally) for 6 weeks. Group 2: will be on Ticagrelor for 6 weeks, no drug for 4 weeks, and then aspirin and placebo (bd  for 6 weeks. The patients will be followed up for 20 weeks. 
Group 1 patients will be treated with aspirin and  placebo bd (twice a day) for 6 weeks.Group 2 patients Ticagrelor 90 mg bd for 6 weeks and then cross over.
For monitoring this trial in regards to adherance. The patients will be followed up  by the Trial Co-ordinator and Principal Investigator at the  followup visits. The drugs will be dispensed by pharmacy at each visit. The patients will be screened and adverse events and compliance will be sought at each visit  and and electrolytes and BNP checked at at all visits as well.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study will examine the differences in NT-Pro BNP and arterial pressure waveforms between aspirin and Ticagrelor in Heart Failure patients.
The  comparator/ control treatment is aspirin plus placebo (placebo will  be a sucrose tablet orally)  vs just ticagrelor </comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary endpoint is  the change fluid loading using biomarker NT-pro B type Natriuretic peptide</outcome>
      <timepoint>Difference is afterload using peripheral waveform analysis using tonometry. Both of these endpoints have shown to discriminate between Aspirin and Clopidogrel in heart failure patients. It is anticipated that the difference will be even more marked with Ticagrelor because of the additive prostacyclin mechanism.
At the end of this study we should be able to examine the differences in NT-proBNP between aspirin and ticagrelor patients (12 months duration)
BNP, medical history, vital signs, weight, FBC, UEC's,  and arterial studies will be measured at each visit.  At baseline, week 4, week 10, week 14, week 20. 5 visits in total.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aspirin increases pulsatile afterload by enhancing wave reflection in the presence of ace inhibitors -a similiar result is expected of ticagrelor but has not been tested previously. The pulsatile afterload will be recorded using an arterial pressure waveform onto a computer using arterial applanation tonometry. This is a simple non invasive test which is performed with the subject lying down. A small pencil like probe is placed over the artery at the wrist and at the side of the neck. Each recording takes about 5 minutes and is entirely painless and noninvasive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the study -we should be able to examine the differences of arterial pressure waveforms changes between Aspirin and Ticagrelor in heart failure patients
(Arterial pressure waveforms will be measured at all visits basline, week 4, week 10, week 14 and week 20.) 5 visits in total.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measure risk reduction in death and or hospitalization  at 12  months. At each scheduled trial visit a medical history will be taken and any adverse events will be documented. A  follow up phone call will be carried out at week 24. These patients are routinely followed up in the heart failure clinic at regular intervals as part of their routine care.</outcome>
      <timepoint>If results are significant (difference in volume and vascular loading) in this pilot study - a further application for a large scale clinical trial will be completed after 12 months from the baseline. These patients will be followed up in the clinic as part of usual care for heart failure paitents at approximately every 6 weeks or sooner under the the discretion of the treating physician.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The drugs will stored and managed in  St VIncent's Hospital pharmacy by the Clinical trial pharmacist. After randomisation, initial treatment is according to group 1 (aspirin) or 2 (Ticagrelor). After completion of the first phase the patient is crossed over to the second treatment. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be completed using an on-line random number generator website (http:www. randomizer.org/form.htm). The generated numbers are placed in consecutive patient envelopes, blinded to investigators. </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Patient' s are on usual aspirin, all patients have  a 4 week wash out (no aspirin) and are then randomised to group 1  (aspirin plus placebo) or group 2 (ticagrelor) for 6 weeks, then all groups have a 4 week wash out and cross over.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data will be recorded during the study in Excel spreadsheets for analysis. Analysis will be completed on blinded data, with subsequent unblinding to dtermine the drug effect. 30 patients is what is reasonable to enroll given the time period. 30 patients can provide scientifcally significant results with statistical anaylsis.</statisticalmethods>
