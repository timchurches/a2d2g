  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-centre, single-agent, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation extension study of EBC-46 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated administrations of EBC-46 in patients who have successfully completed the main protocol (QB46C-H01, ANZCTR Trial ID: ACTRN12614000685617). 
Patients will undergo a screening visit up to 3 months after completing the QB46C-H01 study.  Treatment will be a single dose administered via intratumoural injection with safety monitoring for 21 days. Patients will be required to return for follow up assessments on Day 2, Day 8 (plus or minus 1 day), Day 15 (plus or minus 1 day) and Day 22 (plus or minus 1 day). Treatments will continue no sooner than 1 week since the last injection and will conclude when disease progression or intolerance presents.
Patients will initially receive the same dose level as they received in QB46C-H01 (if tolerated) or lower (if not tolerated or there is less tumour mass requiring dosing). Lower doses will be considered for patients who experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) or Grade &gt; 3 adverse event (AE) in the QB46C-H01 study or if the tumour burden requires less EBC-46.
The dose may be escalated to a higher level if that higher dose level has been demonstrated to be well-tolerated in the QB46C-H01 study (based on the incidence and severity of AEs and DLTs in the QB46C-H01 study) as determined by the Safety Review Committee. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety and tolerability of EBC-46 when administered via intratumoural injection(s). This will be determined by evaluation of the safety parameters collected during the study, including:
- Laboratory tests;
- 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG);
- AEs/SAEs (toxicities will be assessed using the CTCAE V4.03);
- Local injection site reactions;
- Vital signs; and
- Wound healing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Between Day 1 and Day 22 for each treatment. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effects of EBC-46 on tumour size will be evaluated by using calliper measurements, where possible. RECIST 1.1 guidelines will be applied to evaluate response and change in treated (up to three target tumours) and non-treated (up to five non-target) tumour size(s). Volumetric analysis will also be conducted for target and non-target tumours. Callipers will be used to estimate tumour volume, and to estimate tumour response based on tumour volume relative to baseline measurements, where possible. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Calliper measurements, where possible, will be taken at baseline and weekly to Day 22 for each treatment period. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a new investigational drug called EBC-46 in participants with cancer. Who is it for? 
Patients may be eligible to join this study if they have already participated in the preceding study (QB46C-H01), are aged 18 years or more and have been diagnosed with a cutaneous, subcutaneous, head and neck*, or nodal tumour. 
*except for pharyngeal, laryngeal and tongue base tumours and those tumours in the anterior neck (from posterior border of sternocleidomastoid on each side).
Study details:
All participants in this study will receive an EBC-46 injection(s) directly into a tumour(s). This will occur in the form of consecutive treatment periods, at least a week apart. EBC-46 may lead to breakdown of tumour blood vessels and recruitment and activation of white blood cells. This leads to rapid tumour cell death. Participants will be monitored for 3 weeks following each EBC-46 injection in order to evaluate safety, tolerability and tumour response. Treatments will continue until disease progression or intolerance presents.
The results from this study will be analysed to see if it is worthwhile for this new drug to be tested in future studies involving larger numbers of cancer participants. </summary>
