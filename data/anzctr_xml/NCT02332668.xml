  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two-part study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in pediatric participants who have any of
      the following types of cancer:

        -  advanced melanoma (6 months to &lt;18 years of age),

        -  advanced, relapsed or refractory programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive malignant
           solid tumor or other lymphoma (6 months to &lt;18 years of age),

        -  relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (rrcHL) (3 years to &lt;18 years of age),
           or

        -  advanced relapsed or refractory microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors (6
           months to &lt;18 years of age).

      Part 1 will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD), confirm
      the dose, and find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for pembrolizumab therapy. Part 2 will
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy at the pediatric RP2D.

      The primary hypothesis of this study is that intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab
      to children with either advanced melanoma; a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory
      solid tumor or other lymphoma; advanced, relapsed or refractory MSI-H solid tumor; or rrcHL,
      will result in an Objective Response Rate (ORR) greater than 10% for at least one of these
      types of cancer.</summary>
