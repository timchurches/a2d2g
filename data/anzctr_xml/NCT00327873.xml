  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main goal of this study is to establish the effectiveness of palliative oxygen in the
      context within which it is usually provided--relief of the sensation of breathlessness and
      improvement in quality of life for people with maximally-treated life-limiting illness.</summary>
