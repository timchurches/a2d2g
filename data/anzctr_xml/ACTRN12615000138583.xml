  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of balance training delivered through a tablet computer in peoples homes. Participants will be asked to do the balance exercises unsupervised for at least two hours per week for 2 years. The exercises will be tailored to the participants balance abilities for the duration of the trial. 

* Dose will gradually increase from 40 min per week (week 1,2), to 60 min (week 3,4), 80 min (week 5,6), 100 min (week 7, 8) and 120 min from week 9 onwards. Participants will be encouraged to undertake at least 120 min per week for the trial duration. 
* Intensity of the balance exercises is adjusted as performance improves to ensure that exercises remain challenging. Progression of training intensity is guided by an inbuilt coach based on data from recent training activity. 


STUDY PROTOCOL
* Participants will receive a tablet computer with the 'Standing Tall' balance training program and exercise equipment (foam mat, box, exercise mat). 
* During an initial home visit (~2 hours), the exercise trainer (exercise physiologist or physiotherapist) will explain to the participant how to use the 'Standing Tall' program. The exercise trainer will perform an initial balance assessment to ensure that the exercises are tailored to the participant's balance abilities and deliver balance training instructions. The exercise trainer will also explain how to use other features of the Standing Tall app; such as scheduling exercises, tracking progress, setting goals, accessing additional information. 
* Participants will receive a follow-up home visit at 4 weeks (~1 hour) to ensure safe use and progression of training and discuss any issues related to using the program. 
* Participant adherence (training volume, frequency) will be monitored following automatic data transfer to a server, and will be examined weekly. Participants are reminded of their training dose within the app. Participants not engaging in the minimum weekly training dose for 2 consecutive weeks will be contacted by telephone to discuss any issues and to encourage adherence for the first 6 months.
* Phone support will be available and additional home visits will be offered as needed/requested for the entire duration of the study (i.e. 2 years).

    <comparator>Control group participants will receive a health promotion education program focused on health-related information relevant to older adults (e.g. healthy diet, medications), delivered through the tablet computer with weekly fact sheets, in addition to usual care for the entire duration of the study (i.e. 2 years).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Accidental falls remain an important problem for older people. Exercise has proven to be the single most effective intervention to reduce falls. However, sustained adherence to these interventions is poor. Our Standing Tall program is designed in line with evidence-based, best-practice principles for fall prevention that will not only aim to improve balance and reduce falls but also has the potential to maximize long-term adherence. </summary>
