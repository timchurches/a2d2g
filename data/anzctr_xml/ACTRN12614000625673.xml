  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 3-month exercise intervention will be undertaken by all recruited participants. Group Aex will receive supervision of an exercise physiologist (EP) during the second dialysis session of each week. Participants are instructed to exercise at a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 13 on a Borg scale. Each exercise session will be 30-60 minutes long during the first two of dialysis treatment for that day.  Progression of exercise duration over the 3 months period is expected, but will be determined by participant response to the program. Using a stationary bike that is placed in front of the clients dialysis chair, a warm up of 5-15 minutes will be completed followed by a 10 minute rest.  After the rest clients will continue with exercise at the specified intensity for (up to) 30 to 60 minutes.  In line with evidence based practice, participants will be constantly monitored by the exercise physiologist who will review the exercise prescription and aim to progressively update the loading (intensity) over time as individual participant adaptation occurs. Participants will be asked to refrain from adding extra exercise activities for the course of the intervention period. </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator/control Group Bex, will be prescribed with the same exercise protocol except with an additional non-EP supervised exercise session every week. The dialysis nurse will provide the stationary bike for participants to exercise and confirm the exercise intensity and duration with the participants. Therefore, participants undergo 1 supervised and 1 unsupervised session per week throughout the 3 month treatment period.</comparator>

    <concealment>All subjects must have documented medical clearance prior to entering this research project. A medical referral form for participants in the project will be forwarded to each participant’s medical advisor for completion. 

Each subject’s referral and medical history form will be screened before admission to this project, using guidelines outlined by the American College of Sports Medicine.

The participants will be randomised to either a once-weekly (Group Aex) or twice-weekly (Group Bex) cycling exercise group. Randomisation assignments were generated by an investigator who was not involved in testing or training and delivered to patients with sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelops. </concealment>
    <sequence>A simple randomisation process using sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelops described by Doig et al (2005) will be used.
A colleague of the investigators will prepare 2 sets of 20 opaque sealed envelops. In each envelop, a sheet of standard size paper marked with the treatment group will be folded to fit into the envelop. A sheet of carbon paper is placed on top of the folder treatment allocation paper with the carbon side facing the paper. A sheet of foil is folded over both sides of the carbon-treatment allocation paper combination before inserting into a blank envelop, with the carbon paper closest to the front of the envelop. The foil wrapper ensures that the envelop is opaque. The envelop is sealed and the person preparing the envelops will sign his name, in pen, over the top of the envelop seal. The first set of 20 is for treatment 1 (once weekly cycling) and the second set of 20 is for treatment 2 (twice weekly cycling). The two sets of envelops will then be combined and shuffle thoroughly as one would a deck of cards. Once satisfied, a unique number on the front of each envelop is marked sequentially from 1 to 40, in pen. The carbon paper inside the envelop will transfer this number to the allocation paper inside. The envelops are then placed into a container in numerical order, ready for use.

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 34 people would be needed (17 in each group) to achieve 80% power to detect an overall improvement of 35 m, assuming a 20 metre improvement in the once week  group and 50 metre improvement  in the twice a week group.  Assuming attrition is about 10%, an increase of 3 in each group is warranted, resulting in a final sample size estimate of 40.
  
Hypotheses in this study are focused on overall change, rather than a difference in change between the groups.  Therefore, analyses for primary outcomes will focus on the pre-post differences in measures overall.  The main outcomes in this study are assumed to be continuous and normally-distributed.  Therefore, dependent samples t-tests will be used to examine the overall change in 6-minute walk, quality of life and lean tissue mass after treatment.  Exploratory analyses between the groups will be conducted once the primary hypotheses have been performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this research project is to examine changes in health outcomes following the introduction of a single or two cycling exercise sessions a week to kidney failure patients. We hypothesise that after 12 weeks of either once or twice weekly of cycling sessions per week, health outcomes are improved. </summary>
