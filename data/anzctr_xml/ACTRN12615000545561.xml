Trial samples
 Product, Dosage &amp; Administration
 The Probiotics
     The probiotic which used in this study is Hexbio by B-Corbes. Hexbio is orange-flavoured granules, which prepared in sealed aluminium, foil pouches. Itssafety for consumption was ascertained with an Acute Oral Toxicty Test. The test was carried out by PSB Singapore and dated 06/04/2009. 
                        Hexbio contains 6 strains of live bacteria:
1.	Lactobacillus acidophilus
2.	Lactobacillus casei
3.	Lactobacillus lactis
4.	Bifidobacterium bifidum
5.	Bifidobacterium longum
6.	Bifidobacterium infantis

These bacteria in this probiotic are all acid and bile resistant. They are highly compatible and able to adhere to the intestinal wall. The concentration of the bacteria in Hexbio is 30 billion colony-forming units.
Both probiotic and placebo were prepared in sealed aluminium foil pouches which labelled as A (Placebo) and B (Probiotics) respectively. 
b) Differences between Probiotic &amp; Placebo Preparation

Probiotic	Placebo
1.	Orange-flavoured granules	Ascorbic acid
2.	30 billion colony forming units	Skim milk powder
3.	Lactose
4.	Sealed in aluminium foil pouches
5.	Labelled as A
6.	Weight : 30g




 Administration (Dosage &amp; Duration)
The probiotic and placebo group administered their respective preparation 2 times per day for consecutive 7 days prior to operation day. 
1st Dose : 0800H
2nd Dose : 2000H
The preparations were administered by diluting it with a glass (50cc) of room temperature water. 

Instruction
i.	Subjects are requested to consume trial samples for seven (7) days prior to date of operation.
ii.	 Patients will be followed up in the ward after surgery.



Recruitment
i.	Subjects will be recruited from University Hospital of Malaya; or
ii.	Subjects will be recruited from Surgical Clinic , Univeristy Hospital ; or
iii.	Questionnaire will be administered to screen the fulfilment of the criteria prior to enrollment.
iv.	Qualified subjects will be provided with information of the study and informed consent to be obtained.



 Study duration
Length of the study was continued until patients consume normal diet or discharge. They were reviewed by dietician team for  calorie &amp;   requirement intake

Diet during the study
i.	Continue with the usual normal diets.
ii.	Consume given trial samples (Probiotic or Placebo) 2 times a day, either before or after meal.
iii.	Avoid consuming any other probiotics products to prevent confusion

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Return of normal gut function 
as defined as the oral tolerance of 80% or more of calculated nutritional requirements (kcal /day) for a minimum consecutive period of 48 hours.

Caloric requirement was calculated according to the Harris Benedict equation:

Energy Requirement Equations

Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE) 

Men: BMR = 66 + (13.7 X wt in kg) + (5 X ht in cm) - (6.8 X age in  years) 

Women: BMR = 655 + (9.6 X wt in kg) + (1.8 X ht in cm) - (4.7 X age in years) 


Calculated Caloric Requirements (CCR):
CCR  =  BEE  x  activity factor (1.2)  x  stress factor (1.4)


Patients were  followed up in the ward after surgery and reviewed by Dietitian Team for  daily calorie &amp;      requirement intake

Calculated standardized differences :1.02631
The sample calculation demonstrated that a minimum 20 patients required in each arm of study to demonstrate a difference in return of gut function at 5 per cent level of significance with a power of 90 per cent.

Results for non-normally distributed continuous data were expressed as median and compared by means of the Mann-Whitney U test.  Statistical significance was considered at the 5 per cent level Statistical data were analyzed by using SPSS for Windows version 21.    </statisticalmethods>
