  <interventions>
    <interventions>The first step in the treatment process will begin with an initial phone screening interview to determine interest in the study and eligibility for the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants who are eligible for the study will attend the Curtin University Psychology Clinic for a pre-assessment. Informational materials will include several questionnaires (pre-baseline, baseline, and post-treatment) that will be administered on a weekly basis. Participants will then be given all pre-baseline measures to complete. Thereafter, participants will complete the baseline measures remotely over three to seven weeks to determine a stable baseline. The treatment protocol will be Behavioural Activation (BA) developed by Martell et al. (2001, 2010). BA was developed with the aim of increasing activation and engagement in the amount of meaningful and rewarding activities via techniques called activity scheduling and self-monitoring that enables a functional assessment to be formed to identify the contingencies maintaining passive, avoidant, responding and factors that can promote goal-directed behaviour. The 1 hour sessions per week for clients will involve completing weekly measures to track symptoms, psychoeducation about pathological grief and BA, and defining goals for treatment; self-monitoring and activity records; completion of functional assessment to identify contingencies maintaining avoidant responding, links between symptoms and behaviours; identification of grief loops and implementing alternative behavioural responding using activation skills to break loops; troubleshooting barriers and self-management plan to recognise signs of relapse. Resources used during these sessions will include the weekly questionnaires, weekly activity monitoring charts and behavioural activities for participants to try each week. The intervention will be tailored to each individual such that specific behaviours tasks will be meaningful and purposeful to the client. involve identifying and scheduling goal-congruent, rewarding activities tailored to the client; For each client this will involve determining behaviours and contexts that can be manipulated to encourage change; recognising avoidant behaviours and potential barriers to identified activities during activity scheduling; and altering those unhelpful behaviours so they are more effective. The duration of the treatment will be 12 x 1 hours sessions one/week over 12 weeks. The intervention will be delivered one on one (individually) face to face at the Curtin University Psychology Clinic. The intervention will be delivered by a provisional psychologist completing their Master of Psychology. 
To assess integrity in the delivery of the 12-week BA treatment and adherence to the treatment protocol, the Quality of Behavioural Activation Scale (Q-BAS; Dimidjian, Hubley, Martell, Herman, &amp; Dobson, 2016) will be completed by the primary researcher at the completion of each session with each participant. The scale assesses how well BA was implemented across 14 domains using a Likert scale (0 = very poor to 6 = excellent). An independent supervisor with expertise in the area BA will randomly select 20% of weekly session video recordings to review protocol adherence.

    <statisticalmethods>A community-derived convenience sample will be used for this study comprising four bereaved individuals, a minimum of 6 months after the death of someone close to them. This sample size was selected as this is a small case series which will allow us to explore individualised, detailed information on experiences of grief. Although three participants would enable us to examine changes using a staggered time series, four participants will be recruited in the event that participant attrition occurs.
Data will be analysed via graphical representation and visual inspection whereby scores at baseline, session by session treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up on the outlined self-report measures will be plotted for each participant as they pass through the same stages of treatment at different starting points. The relationship between activation and symptom severity will be examined using cross-lagged correlations to test whether behavioural activation changes proceed, co-occur with, or lag behind changes in pathological grief symptom severity. Differences among participants based on activation-pathological grief patterns will then be examined. The methodology outlined by Jacobson and Truax (1991) will be used to indicate whether participants experienced reliable and clinically significant change using pre, mid, and post-treatment data. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study seeks to complement the results from prior studies by examining
the feasibility of a 12-week intervention of Behavioural Activation (BA) among four bereaved individuals withProlonged Grief Disorder (PGD). The first reason for examining this was that BA is grounded in a clear conceptual basis such that promoting individuals who are experiencing grief complications to engage in rewarding and meaningful activities, can disconfirm
negative cognitions, increase mood, and reduce pathological grief. Secondly,
although studies have found that cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) based treatments are effective for individuals experiencing pathological grief, the literature emphasises that a one size fits all approach will not meet the needs of all bereaved. For example, prolonged exposure may be contraindicated for those who find processing death scenes traumatic (Boelen, van den Bout, &amp; van den Hout, 2006), thus suggesting a range of approaches to treatment is needed and highlighting the need to examine for whom interventions will be most effective. While many studies hypothesise that BA addresses the transdiagnostic mechanisms underlying post-loss psychopathology, little is known about the mechanisms of change that BA is responsible for targeting and producing beneficial results, or for whom the
interventions will be most effective. While studies suggest a range of treatment
approaches is needed to address the unique nature of grief, many interventions have
several components. Currently, it is unclear which components of CBT-based
interventions for PGD (e.g., psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, BA, exposure
to grief cues) are essential to alleviate PGD symptomatology, and it is possible that
some treatment components may be masking less effective components. For
example, there are components of many PGD interventions that are similar to BA
and involve increasing approach behaviour and social restoration. An understanding
of the mechanisms of change may clarify which components of psychotherapy are
essential and most effective for the clinical improvements seen in PGD treatment
studies, which is imperative in order to determine which bereaved individuals are
likely to benefit from which types of interventions. Thus, the proposed study aimed to
investigate the feasibility and acceptability of BA in reducing prolonged grief
symptomatology and explore patterns of symptomatic and functional change based
upon weekly assessments to monitor symptoms and track the hypothesised
mechanisms of change. We hypothesised that: (a) enhancing individuals
engagement with meaningful reinforcement via BA will result in pre-post decreases
in PGD, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) symptomatology, and (b) activation will be the mechanism of change underlying reductions in rumination and avoidance that characterise PGD. </summary>
