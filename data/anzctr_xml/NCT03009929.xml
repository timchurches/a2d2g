  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whereas there are several validated systems for reporting postoperative complications, there
      are only a few and not prospectively validated systems for reporting intraoperative
      complications. The investigators developed a definition and CLASSification for Intraoperative
      Complications CLASSIC within a Delphi study involving international interdisciplinary
      experts. As both surgery and anaesthesia may be involved in complications in the
      perioperative period, all patient-related intraoperative complications occurring between skin
      incision and closure are considered in this reporting system.

      The aim of this international multicentre observational cohort study is to assess the
      validity and practicability of this newly derived classification system CLASSIC in patient
      undergoing an in-hospital surgical procedure. Providing an easy applicable and
      internationally validated classification system is a contribution to improve quality of
      health care and patient safety.</summary>
