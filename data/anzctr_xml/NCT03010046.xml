  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending,
      single-infusion, sequential group study. Single, ascending doses will be administered to
      approximately 56 subjects, with an option for 1 additional multi-dose cohort in approximately
      8 subjects. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of ANX005 administered as an
      intravenous infusion as a single agent and in combination with intravenous immunoglobulin
      (IVIg). The optional multi-dose cohort will evaluate either additional subjects at the
      maximum tolerated dose or ANX005 administered as 2 infusions.</summary>
