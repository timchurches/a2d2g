  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 scoops of study powder containing 9g prebiotics (scGOS/IcFOS 9:1 ratio) will be mixed with food or beverage and consumed orally once daily by the participating pregnant women from study entry (18-20 weeks gestation) until 6 months of lactation. Compliance with the intervention will be assessed by questions asked at regular phone calls and appointment visits during the intervention period. The participating women will also be asked to return any unused study powder tins for reweighing as another measure of compliance at the end of the intervention period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immune studies will be performed using mononuclear cells from a blood sample on 120 infants at 6 months of age. We will assess the effect of the intervention on a composite outcome incorporating: innate immune responses to microbial products, including inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-12 and IL-10) responses to a range of toll-like receptor ligands; effector T cell responses to mitogens and allergens including Th2 (IL-13, IL-5), Th1 (IFN-gamma) and IL-10 responses in the supernatants; regulatory T cell responses including the numbers and function of CD4+C25+CD127 cells and expression of regulatory marker FOXP3+.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this composite primary outcome, infant stool samples will be analysed for eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), as measures of local gut inflammation and immune function.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this composite secondary outcome, the development of allergic disease (eczema and/or food allergy) in the infant, will be determined by completion of interview-administered questions and the infant will be examined for signs of allergic disease.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this composite secondary outcome, the child's sensitisation to food and/or aeroallergens will be assessed by allergy skin prick testing (SPT) with histamine and control solutions in accordance with standard clinical methods as outlined in the 2009 ASCIA Skin Prick Testing for the Diagnosis of Allergic Disease: A manual for practitioners.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We can detect differences in aspects of immune function in studies of this size or smaller, including differences in cytokine detection in our previous intervention studies using probiotics in pregnancy.  Although no specific sample size calculations were done for the composite primary outcome for this trial, the subgroup of 120 (60 per group) infant blood samples at 6 months of age that will be selected for immunological studies will be sufficient to detect biologically relevant differences in proposed immune outcomes. This is based on our extensive experience with similar populations. 
All analyses will be on an intention-to-treat basis. 
For the biological analysis: continuous variables (e.g. cytokines) will be compared between groups with linear regression models (transformation of the outcome variable will be employed as required to meet the assumptions of the linear regression model) to allow for adjustment of confounders. Binary variables will be compared using logistic regression to allow for adjustment of relevant prognostic baseline variables and confounding post-randomisation interactions.

For the clinical analysis, the proportion of children with diagnosed allergic disease at 12 months of age will be compared between treatment groups using an identity binomial generalized linear model, adjusting for the pre-specified prognostic stratification variables. Differences in secondary clinical outcomes will be examined in the same way.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will recruit pregnant women to receive either a prebiotic supplement or a placebo supplement. They will be asked to take the supplement from 18-20 weeks gestation until their baby is 6 months of age. We will then examine whether supplementing the mothers diet during pregnancy and breastfeeding with the prebiotic powder will reduce the development of allergies in her child. Both study groups will include children deemed to be at high risk of allergic disease (based on family allergy history).</summary>
