      <outcome>Postoperative pain intensity was simulated by visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10, of which 0 indicated no pain, and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Postoperative pain intensity was rated at postoperative hours 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients satisfaction was evaluated by 10-point numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10, which 0 indicated not pleased, and 10 is very satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients satisfaction was evaluated on postoperative 24 h</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Side effects include tachycardia, hypotension,hyoxemia,nausea and vomiting,in which  tachycardia is assessed with electrocardiogram, hypotension  is assessed with sphygmomanometry, hyoxemia is assessed with blood oxygen saturation monitor. nausea and vomiting is documented by patients'complaint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary outcomes will be assessed from the administration of the bilateral superficial cervical plexus until 24 hours post surgery. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Our sample size calculation for the two-tailed testing of the bilaterl superficial cervial plexus block superiority hypothesis was based on the global QoR-40 scores. A power analysis using a type I error estimate of 5% (alpha = 0.05) and a power (1-beta) of 80% indicated that a sample of 31 subjects per group would be required. To account for the loss of some study participants,74 subjectswere enrolled in this study.
Analyses were performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data were expressed as mean [standard deviation (SD)] or median [interquartile range (IQR)] and compared with independent t-test or MannWhitney U test, respectively. Categorical variables were reported as the number of patients (%) and evaluated by the Fishers exact test or the chi-squre test where appropriate. All reported P-values are two-tailed, and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistical significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thyroidectomy is widely performed as ambulatory surgery, however, its problems of postoperative pain and nausea and vomiting still exist under the condition of using analgesics and antemetic drugs. These complications delay patientsrecovery and discharge, and increase the overall health care costs. Therefore, we encourage various therapies that combined complementary and alternative analgesic techniques with drug, such as nerve block and psychotherapy. Plenty of evidences shows that ultrasound-guided bilateral superficial cervical plexus block has no intra-operative complication or systemic toxicity of ropivacaine, adverse effects were of short duration and did not affect surgery. These features show that ultrasound-guided bilateral superficial cervical plexus block is feasible and provides similar results to other regional techniques during thyroidectomy. but from the perspective of patients, ultrasound-guided bilateral superficial cervical plexus block for the recovery quality after thyroidectomy has not been fully embodied. Therefore, we designed a prospective, randomized study to verify the assumption that preoperative ultrasound-guided bilateral superficial cervical plexus block can improve the quality of recovery after thyroidectomy.</summary>
