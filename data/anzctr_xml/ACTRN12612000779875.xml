  <interventions>
    <interventions>Panobinostat (LBH589) in an oral formulation (capsules)

In Phase I, there will be three dose levels studied. At dose level 1, participants will receive 20 mg of Panobinostat on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (a weekly regime). If this dose is well tolerated a second group of patients will be recruited and the dose increased to 25 mg of Panobinostat weekly and finally, a third group of patients will receive 30 mg of study drug. The VCD regimen is the same for all patients with all drugs given weekly and each 4-week block considered as one cycle. 
Patients will receive a total of 6 cycles (6 months) of treatment at their allocated dose of Panobinostat combined with VCD

In Phase II, 10 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose level of Panobinostat (determined from Phase I) in combination with VCD 
This group of patients will also receive a total of 6 cycles (6 months) of treatment.

Dosages of the other components also given weekly are
 Velcade (Bortezomib) 1.6mg/m2 (subcutaneously) 
Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 (orally) 
Dexamethasone 40mg (orally)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to monitor the side effects and tolerance of a gradual increase in the dose of Panobinostat when given in combination with Bortezomib (Velcade), Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone or VCD, in people who have symptomatic Multiple Myeloma that has not been previously treated. The effect of using Panobinostat in combination with Bortezomib has been studied and shown to produce a good response. The study will also monitor the disease response, progression free survival and overall survival It is being conducted over 4 sites in New Zealand. In Phase I, there will be three dose levels studied. At dose level 1, participants will receive 20 mg of Panobinostat on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (a weekly regime). If this dose is well tolerated a second group of patients will be recruited and the dose increased to 25 mg of Panobinostat weekly and finally, a third group of patients will receive 30 mg of study drug. The VCD regimen is the same for all patients with all drugs given weekly and each 4-week block considered as one cycle
In Phase II, 10 patients will be treated at the maximum tolerated dose level of Panobinostat in combination with VCD and be monitored for disease response with each cycle, and undergo a complete disease reassessment on completion or change of therapy. Patients in Phase I or Phase II will receive a total of 6 cycles of treatment. An Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant and/or additional chemotherapy may be given as consolidation therapy.</summary>
