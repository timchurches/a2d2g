  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, half the participants will be receive PF530 and the other half, Betaferon comparator in Period 1. After a 14 day washout period, participants will swap over so that those who received PF530 will be receive Betaferon comparator and vice versa in Period 2.
PF530/Betaferon comparator is given as a single dose of 0.25mg given as a subcutaneous injection in both study periods.
The study will consist of two parts (Part I and Part II). Twelve participants will be enrolled in Part I, and the results of this part will determine how many participants will be enrolled in Part II.

The PK parameters will be summarised by treatment received. The individual and mean PK concentrations will also be presented graphically. The comparison of PK parameters will be based on a 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the population geometric means (test/reference), in particular Cmax and AUC. 
The PD parameters will be summarized by treatment received and presented graphically as needed. If appropriate, the comparison of PD parameters will be based on a 90% confidence interval for the ratio of the population geometric means (test/reference). 
All PK and PD endpoints will be analyzed and compared without a pre-specified hierarchical order.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of new interferon beta-1b product called PF530.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 to 50 years and are in good general health. Females must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

Study details
The study will consist of two parts (Part I and Part II). Twelve participants will be enrolled in Part I, and the results of this part will determine how many participants will be enrolled in Part II.

The study is divided into a screening phase lasting about 4 weeks and an on-study phase. The on-study phase will be broken into 2 periods with at least a 14 day gap (called a wash-out) between each period to ensure that the study drug is completely gone from your body before the next period starts. Doses will be administered subcutaneously (under the skin), with participants receiving PF530 in one period and BETAFERON in the other period. The order in which you receive those doses (i.e. in period 1 or period 2) will be random. The chance of receiving PF530 first compared to BETAFERON is 1:1. Which treatment you receive first (PF530 or BETAFERON) will not be known by the study staff or yourself. The study dose will be given to you by a clinical unit staff member. Study doses will be administered in the abdomen.
Initially in Part I, the first 2 participants will receive a randomised dose  one with PF530 and one with BETAFERON - on the morning of Day 1 and will complete 48 hours of monitoring by site staff before the remaining participants receive their dose. This is referred to as a sentinel dosing. Dosing of the remaining participants will depend on safety information obtained from the 2 sentinel participants.
Each of the two study periods will include a confinement period of 5 days and 4 nights, commencing the day before your dosing each period. After leaving the clinical unit on Day 4, you will be required to attend the unit at the same time each morning on Days 5, 6 &amp; 7 for a brief appointment.
Your total involvement in the study will be approximately 8 weeks. It is anticipated that each visit will last from 1-2 hours depending on the procedures required. These will include: blood and urine sampling; physical examination; vital signs; medical history, concomitant medications and adverse events (AE) assessment; completion of questionnaires.</summary>
