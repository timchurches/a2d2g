  <interventions>
    <interventions>Quittr is an innovative smartphone app designed to support smokers through a quit attempt. It provides useful health and financial statistics, educational/behavioural support content, an achievement system, and novel game features that are designed to entice the smoker remain engaged with the app for longer, thereby improving their likelihood of success.

Participants can use the app at their discretion, but are prompted to check in regularly through daily notifications.

To determine whether these game features work as intended, we are enrolling participants at random into one of two groups. The first group has the full features of the Quittr app enabled, while the second group has the game features disabled. This will allow us to detect differences in the outcomes reported for each group.

We will also monitor usage analytics, to determine how engaged the smoker is with the various features of the apps over time.

The intervention group will have access to the full features of Quittr, including the "Tappy Town" incentivisation game and QuitCoin rewards. They will be granted QuitCoins in return for positive behaviours that are likely to improve their chances of quitting smoking (i.e. not smoking, consuming educational content, checking in regularly). The QuitCoins can be redeemed in the Tappy Town incentivisation game. This is a city builder/clicker style game that allows the player to incrementally grow a city by placing a variety of buildings/improvements into the game map. As the city grows so does its income potential, allowing the player to afford gradually more grand buildings and improvements. Some of the best buildings/improvements available in the game can only be purchased by redeeming QuitCoins. The control group will not have access to the Tappy Town game or the associated QuitCoins (at least until after their 28-day trial expires), but the app will otherwise function identically.

The trial will be in effect over a 28-day period from participant enrolment, with enrolment open between 1/06/2017 and 1/11/2017. After the participant reaches 28-days they will be automatically switched back to the fully featured version of the game, and will retain their access to the app.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will have access to the Quittr app which includes all the progress statistics, educational content, achievements system, and a cravings distraction mini-game. However, they will not have access to the "Tappy Town" incentivisation game and will not be rewarded with QuitCoins for successfully engaging with key systems in the app.

After the 28-day trial period ends, the control group will revert to "normal" fully featured status, gaining access to the games features.</comparator>

    <summary>This study will investigate the effectiveness of Quittr, a smoking cessation app.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a current smoker interested in starting a quit attempt.

Study details
Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have access to full features Quittr, which include health and financial statistics, educational/behavioural support content, an achievement system, and novel game features. Participants in the other group will have access to the same features except the game. After 28-days the study will end, but participants will continue to have access to the full featured version of the app indefinitely.

Participants will be prompted to indicate how many cigarettes they smoke each day, and usage data will be automatically recorded to a web service. Smoking activity, engagement and retention of users will be determined after the 28 day trial window closes.

Participants who indicate they have successfully quit smoking at the end of the trial will optionally be able to demonstrate this using a self-administered cotinine urine analysis test strip. Volunteers will be posted an simple test kit, asked to photograph the result strip, and return the photograph by email. In return, the volunteer will be granted a $40 gift card as remuneration.</summary>
