  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether a patient controlled tissue expander can
      improve the results and patient experience in breast reconstruction. The study hypothesis is
      that patient controlled expansion will lead to rapid and more comfortable outcomes than
      historical precedents.</summary>
