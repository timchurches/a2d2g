  <interventions>
    <interventions>The primary aim of the intervention education modules is to increase physicians knowledge and the implementation of GOLD guideline recommendations by the physicians. In this intervention we will use the Virtual Medical Academy. This is a medical online education project that aims to adapt the tools of technical progress to provide a medical education platform through a variety of products such as lectures, courses and tutorials submitted by different display methods. Physicians in the intervention group will be offered and provided by login name and password (physicians are allowed to change their password) and the link for modules. They will be asked to complete all lectures within a 2-weeks period. The lectures will be provided as a five modules: 1) brief introduction about the GOLD training modules; 2) GOLD recommendations lecture and management of COPD; 3) Spirometry; 4) pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR); and 5) GOLD evaluation sheet to use during consult with patients with COPD). Each module will include from 1 to 6 short videos (each video will be around (5-15 minutes). Each module will take from 15 minutes to 1 hour to complete. If physicians have questions regarding the module, they are asked to send an email to the investigator (Mohammed Alsubaeie) by email. In addition, all included intervention physicians will be invited to attend a two hours live general discussion lecture via Virtual Medical Academy two weeks after the completion of the initial training. This live lecture will be optional for physicians who have further questions or discussion points. The investigator and study physician will attend this discussion to answer and discuss any questions provided by physicians regarding the GOLD training modules. The physicians will be monitored by the investigators using online monitoring in order to monitor adherence to the intervention</interventions>

    <concealment>In this study the census survey method will be used because the target number is small. We will consider five of the 22 hospitals assessed in a previous study (paper currently written). Based on this study we know that the other hospitals are referring most COPD patients to these five hospitals for specialised care. In our previous study it was concluded that these five hospitals have already reasonable services in terms of management of COPD such as respiratory physicians, spirometry and intensive care units available. None of the other 17 hospitals had respiratory physicians nor spirometry services available. All physicians who provide COPD-specific care in these five hospitals in the eastern province (Eastern are (n=4) and Al Ahsa area (n=1)) will be asked to participate.</concealment>
    <sequence>In this cluster randomized controlled study, five government hospitals in the eastern province (Eastern area (n=4) and Al Ahsa area (n=1)) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group or control group based on the hospital size (number of beds) using paper and envelopes. The investigator will write down each name of these five hospitals on a paper and put it inside an envelope. Then, the investigator will ask an independent person to select envelopes for intervention group and envelopes for control group. 
 
Physicians in the five hospitals who are providing COPD care will not be randomized because the randomization will be performed on the hospitals level. Physicians will be asked to participate and to give informed consent. Our study assesses the effects of GOLD-guideline training on knowledge, readiness to change and the actual implementation of the guidelines in physicians who are providing COPD care in these government hospitals. Assessments will be performed at baseline, directly after the intervention (2 weeks), and 12 months after the intervention.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations:

Although we are going to recruit all internal and respiratory physicians in the five government hospitals in the eastern province, we have performed a power analysis to calculate the required sample size. The primary outcome variable in this study is the difference in mean score of physicians knowledge between groups post-test (12 months). The mean score for physicians knowledge was 52.1 (SD 8.4) at baseline and 65.1 at post-test.

Using 80% power, a 5% alpha level, and an intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.005, a sample size of 6 physicians per hospital is needed to detect a clinical significant difference of 10 points in physicians knowledge score between the intervention and control group, assuming a standard deviation of 8.4 and a worst case correlation of zero between baseline and follow up scores. We expect a drop-out rate of 20%, for this reason we need to recruit 8 physicians per hospital. We expect to be able to recruit around 50 physicians (10 physicians in each hospital) based on a previous study that we conducted in the eastern province (paper is currently written).

Statistical analysis:  
All data will be entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. Descriptive data for baseline characteristics will be reported.
The primary analysis will use a mixed effects linear regression models, clustering over hospitals to account for correlated readings. Statistical significance will be reported when P values were &lt;0.05.
