  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is an exercise program called FitSkills. The program matches a young person with disability with a mentor from their community and the pair exercise together at their local public gym (one-to-one), for an hour, twice a week for 12 weeks (24 sessions in total). The program comprises individually tailored exercise and plans for on-going participation in exercise. 
The exercise content comprises weight and aerobic training, individually tailored to the young person with disability. The exercise program (including the intensity) will be prescribed by members of the research team according to international guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). The exercise program will be planned with the young person with disability and their family through a telephone interview and incorporating details from their baseline assessment to help determine what their training goals are, their preferences for type of exercise and their impairment(s).

The intervention also includes a transition phase in the final weeks to plan ongoing participation in exercise after FitSkills. This transition phase will comprise a face-to-face session with a member of the research team to help the participant plan their on-going participation in exercise and/or physical activity (e.g. what activity, where it will be done, who it will be done with, cost, equipment required) and a booklet with information about benefits of continuing to exercise, how they can participate in exercise and where they can participate in exercise. 

The mentor exercises with the young person with disability. The mentors will be students enrolled in Allied Health courses (any discipline, any year level) at two universities in Melbourne, Australia (La Trobe University and Australian Catholic University). Mentors are volunteers who are selected based on residential location and will hold a current police and working with children check. Mentors are matched with a young person with disability from the same locality. All mentors complete a 3-hour face-to-face group training session on program content and motivational strategies conducted at either the university campus or at the facilities of one of our partner organisations. The training will be delivered by a member of the research team. Mentors are provided with written materials that include information about disability, an outline of the exercise program and advice for how the program should be delivered. 

As mentors may not have pre-existing knowledge of exercise training or disability, they will maintain fortnightly contact with a member of the research team to address issues that arise, and to ensure that the intervention is being carried our as per protocol (i.e. the team member will check that the program continues to be delivered according to the ACSM guidelines). To monitor intervention fidelity, participants and mentors will document their programs in an exercise logbook, including exercise type and dose, adverse events or missed sessions. The exercise logbooks will be collected at the end of the intervention and data about the program analysed by members of the research team (e.g. number of sessions attended or intensity progression for exercises performed). Analysis of the exercise logbook data will help identify any issues with intervention fidelity and this information will be used to maintain or improve fidelity at subsequent sites during roll-out of the program. </interventions>
    <comparator>The study design is a stepped wedge cohort design with 8 sites and 4 cluster groups.  This design sequentially introduces the intervention to 8 gyms (sites) in random order. After an initial 3-month baseline period when no sites are exposed (control phase), at 3-month intervals sites are randomised to cross from control to intervention phase until all sites have implemented FitSkills. Each gym site represents a cluster unit. The trial design will comprise four cluster groups each containing two randomly allocated cluster units. One cluster group (2 sites) will commence the intervention every 3 months. A member of the research team who is not involved in recruitment, assessment or delivery of the intervention, will randomise the order of the 8 sites using web-based software. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility: will be measured: (1) using data from our partner organisations to map numbers of their constituents living close to FitSkills sites and comparing to the number of enrolments; (2) comparing numbers of enquiries with enrolments in FitSkills; (3) documenting wait-lists and mentor expressions of interest; (4) using data from exercise logbooks documenting attendance and involvement during FitSkills, intervention fidelity (including exercise intensity), and adverse events; (5) gaining perspectives of youth with disability, their families and mentors, and gym management and staff on FitSkills from semi-structured interviews; Data on the experience of youth with disability of the gym context will also be measured by the Self-reported Experiences of Activity Settings and Measure of Environmental Qualities of Activity Settings questionnaires; and (6) reviewing each sites disability policy and procedures using National Information Communication Awareness Network (NICAN) guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>(1) Mapping of the numbers of members from partner organisations living close to sites will occur prior to recruitment. These numbers will be and compared to the number of enrolments immediately before implementation of the intervention at each site.  
(2) The number of enquiries will be compared with the numbers of enrolments in FitSkills immediately before implementation of the intervention at each site
(3) numbers of our wait-lists and mentor expressions of interest will be documented at 3-month intervals throughout the 2 year data collection period 
(4) data from exercise logbooks documenting attendance, adherence (intervention fidelity) during FitSkills, and adverse events will be analysed at the end of each program.
(5) the perspectives of youth with disability, their families and mentors, and gym management and staff on FitSkills from semi-structured interviews will be collected immediately after the intervention. Questionnaires about the experience of youth with disability of the gym context will be measured immediately after the program also.
(6) a review of each sites disability policy and procedures using National Information Communication Awareness Network (NICAN) guidelines will be performed prior to the implementation of FitSkills</timepoint>

      <outcome>Economic analysis (composite outcome), taking a societal perspective, will be completed. Data to inform the economic analysis will be collected from participants and their families on socioeconomic status (employment, income, carer requirement, leisure), attendance (time, travel, out-of-pocket expenses) and health service use if injured (hospital attendance, admission, consultations, investigations). Data will be collected from mentors to determine their participation (time, travel, out-of-pocket expenses). Mentor time will be costed at university rates. Annual cost of capital (equipment, space) at the sites will be costed according to the opportunity cost method. Reasonable rental equivalent will be used to cost space. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost per quality adjusted life years saved will be calculated comparing costs and health related quality of life outcomes between FitSkills and no intervention based on difference in costs and the health related quality of life utility index between the pre- and post-intervention periods.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>FitSkills is an exercise program that matches a young person with disability with a mentor and the pair exercise together at their local gym, for an hour, twice a week for 12 weeks. The program comprises individually tailored exercise and plans for on-going participation in exercise. Together with 7 partner organisations, we will complete a research translation project through a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial using a cohort design, with embedded health economics evaluation.
The trial design sequentially introduces FitSkills to 8 gyms (sites) in random order. After a control period, at regular intervals sites are randomised to cross from control to intervention phase until all sites have implemented FitSkills. We will recruit 160 youth with disability (any type) aged 13-30 years through our partner organisations. Data collection at 8 time points will continue throughout the trial at 3-month intervals (i.e. an assessment is conducted every 3 months for 24 months). We will collect data on: participant demographics and socioeconomics; participation; health-related quality of life; physical activity; attitudes to exercise; walking capacity; program feasibility; and attitudes to disability for mentors, gym staff and gym patrons at the participating sites.</summary>
