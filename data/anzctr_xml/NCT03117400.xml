  <interventions>
    <interventions>Bland blue defect - The defect after endoscopic mucosal resection of the colonic large laterally spreading lesion (20mm or more) is blue without any other defect features (as described in the second group, 'non bland blue defect'). The blue is the result of the submucosal injection of dye (indigo carmine), used to lift lesions before starting the resection.

Non bland blue defect - The defect after endoscopic mucosal resection of the colonic large laterally spreading lesion (20mm or more) is not just blue, but contains other defect features, such as visible vessels, herniation of vessels, submucosal fat, exposed muscle, fibrous bands, submucosal haemorrhage or non stained submucosa.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date there are no available data on the utility of the endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)
      defect in stratifying the risk of immediate or delayed adverse outcomes, particularly
      clinically significant post EMR bleeding (CSPEB).

      The investigators aimed to analyse the data to determine if any of these EMR defect features
      allow us to estimate the risk of CSPEB. This will help endoscopists to identify defects with
      a high risk of adverse outcomes and may translate into improved patient outcomes.</summary>
