    <interventions>Provision of a brain tumour-specific question prompt list (QPL) within two weeks of first neurosurgical consultation.  The QPL provides patients with a list of questions which have been useful to previous patients. It aims to assist individuals to actively participate in their clinical consultations through
asking proposed questions of healthcare providers. The QPL is thus designed to provide a framework within
which patients and carers can organise their information needs and follow pathways to obtain desired information at the preferred level.  That is, the QPL prompts patients to ask relevant questions of their health care providers.  The QPL will be given to participants immediately following the first data collection interview by the researcher.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard information brochure "About brain tumours" produced The Cancer Council Queensland.  Headings in the brochure are, 'Understanding your brain tumour', 'What to expect', 'Lobe of the brain', 'Suggestions for coping', 'Brain Tumour Support Service' and 'How to find out more'.  As with the QPL, this will be given to participants immediately following the first data collection interview by the researcher.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of a communication tool called It's okay to ask in facilitating information exchange for adults with brain tumours. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you: 
1. live in Queensland 
2. have been diagnosed with a primary brain tumour 
3. have attended initial consultation with selected neurosurgeons in the last 2 weeks. 

Trial details 
A question prompt list (QPL) is a structured list of questions for a patient or their carer to ask a doctor if they want to. It is designed to encourage participants to ask questions in the medical consultation, empowering them to seek answers to important questions, and enabling them to share personalised information. 

Work is underway to develop a QPL specifically for adults diagnosed with a primary brain tumour and their caregivers. This pilot study aims to determine: 
1. if the QPL is acceptable to participants 
2. if and how participants use it 
3. the requirements for implementing the QPL 
4. how well it works in improving information exchange.</summary>
