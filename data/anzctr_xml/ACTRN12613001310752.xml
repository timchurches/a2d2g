Recruitment, setting and participants
One independent school from the Hunter Region will be recruited with a target recruitment of 60 students. The School Principal and Sports Organiser / Head of Sport will be contacted and invited to participate in the study. Eligible study participants will be adolescent boys and girls in Grade 9/10 (3rd and 4th year of secondary school) attending the school.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be conducted using both an intention-to-treat analysis and completers analysis with an assumption of no change from baseline for those with missing data. Main and interaction effects for all primary and secondary outcome variables will then be determined by using repeated measures ANOVA and simple ANCOVA with the pre-test for each group used to adjust the post-test. Data analysis will be undertaken using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) with differences between treatment groups being considered statistically significant at p greater than or equal to 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a resistance training program (CrossFit Teens) for improving fitness, psychological adjustment, cognitive functioning, and self-esteem in secondary school students. Participants from Grades 9 &amp; 10 in a NSW Secondary School will be randomly randomised by class into the intervention (CrossFit) conditions or into the control group (normal PE and sport lessons). The program will be delivered by qualified CrossFit instructors 2 x week (45-1hr) for 8 weeks. The study aims to answer the following research questions
1)	What are the effects of CrossFit training on health-related fitness in adolescents?
2)	What are the effects of CrossFit training on resistance training skill levels of adolescents?
3)	What are the effects of CrossFit training on self-esteem in adolescents?
4)	What are the effects of CrossFit training on psychological adjustment in adolescents?
5)	 What are the effects of CrossFit training on cognitive functioning in adolescents?
Participants will be assessed before and after the intervention using a battery of physical tests and a questionnaire.</summary>
