  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention stores will receive salt-reduced white bread (300mg/100g) on their store shelves for 12 weeks.

The bread packaging will not be distinguishable from the control bread, however the markings on the carton the bread is packed in will differ to reduce the risk of the reduced salt bread being delivered to the control community or vice versa. In addition the price look up code (PLU) differed between the breads, to allow us to ensure that the correct bread is being sold in control and intervention stores. </interventions>

    <designfeatures>The study will include four periods in 2015: baseline (23 weeks, February-July), wash-in (six weeks, July-August), follow-up (12 weeks, August-November) and wash-out (six weeks, November-December).

This study was originally planned as a randomised controlled trial however changes to the baking location and supply route of the bread during the baseline period meant that many of the participating communities were unable to receive the reduced salt bread. For this reason, the study was adapted to a non-randomised controlled design, with allocation to intervention or control mostly determined by supply route of study bread for participating stores. Stores were blinded to their allocation.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To investigate the effects of a reduced sodium bread on sales and overall sodium intake in remote Indigenous communities.

Study design: Communities stores will receive salt-reduced study bread (300mg/100g) (intervention communities) or regular salt study bread (400mg/100g) (control communities) to stock on store shelves for 12 weeks. 

Population: Remote Indigenous communities serviced by Arnhemland Progress Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA) or Outback Stores (OBS) in Northern Territory, Western Australia or South Australia and where Study bread represents &gt;=45% of the market share for bread sales will be invited to the study (29 communities meet this criteria).

Outcomes:
- Change in sales (market share and total dollars)
- Change in total sodium of all food and drink purchases
