  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single-center, randomized controlled, study using induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) infection to characterize the effectiveness of griseofulvin as a potential treatment of early Plasmodium falciparum blood stage infection in healthy volunteers.
All participants receive a malaria inoculum injection of ~ 1,800 viable P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes on Day 0. The study will be conducted in 2 cohorts (n= 6 in each, consisting of 2 control subjects and 4 experimental subjects) using different oral tablet doses of griseofulvin in each of the cohorts. As a stratergy to monitor adherence to the treatment tablet will be administered under direct observation followed by ingestion of food.   The experimental subjects enrolled in the experimental arm of cohort 1 (n=4) will be given 1g of griseofulvin administered in two doses of 500 mg each one in the morning (AM) and one in the Evening (PM) for 4 days, beginning on Day 6. Experimental Subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 (n=4) will be administered a single dose of 2000 mg of griseofulvin on Day 6. Control arm subjects in both cohort 1 (n=2) and cohort 2 (n=2) will be treated with Mefloquine once their parasitemia reaches the target level of 1,000 parasites/ml.
</interventions>
    <comparator>MEFLOQUINE:
Control subjects in both cohorts 1 and 2 (n=2 each) will receive a single dose of 10 mg/kg in an oral tablet form once the threshold for commencement of treatment is reached (= 1000 parasites/ml) as determined by PCR quantification

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Volunteers will be adults (males or non pregnant females), aged between 18 and 45 years who do not live alone (from Day 1 until at least the end of the antimalarial drug treatment).
2. Volunteers must have a BMI within the range 1830 kg/m2 and must weigh more than 50kg in adults in which the proposed dose has already been used.
3. Volunteers must understand the procedures involved and agree to participate in the study by giving fully informed, written consent.
4. Be contactable and available for the duration of the trial and be available up to 2 weeks following end of study visit. (maximum of 8 weeks).
5. Volunteers must be non-smokers for at least three months prior to screening. 
6. This study will only be conducted in healthy male volunteers (that do not plan father children in the next 6 months) and female volunteers of non-childbearing potential (i.e. those who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation or who are post-menopausal). As a precautionary measure, pregnancy testing will be conducted at screening on all eligible females, at the baseline assessment prior inoculation, prior to dosing and at the end of the study. 
7. Good peripheral venous access.

This is an exploratory study designed to determine the effect on parasite growth kinetics of two predefined drug exposures. Pre-clinical data indicate an effect is likely to be observed, and if none is seen in a cohort of this size (n=4,) it is unlikely that a clinical significant effect will be observed.
