  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to no screening will not undergo regular non-invasive testing for CAD while on the kidney transplant wait list. 

The current practice for wait list patients is to be screened every 1-2 years based on perceived risk of CAD. At any time, if patients develop symptoms of CAD, they will be treated according to local standard of care.

The duration of study is 4 years, with possible extension to 5 years for Canadian sites. Canadian transplant candidates typically wait longer than Australia/NZ candidates, hence the rationale for an extra year of follow up to capture patients who have been transplanted. Patients in this group will followed up 3 months and 12 months post-date of transplant. Transplanted patients will exit the study 12 months post-date of transplant.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to routine screening will undergo noninvasive testing for coronary artery disease every year or second yearly as determined by local transplant centre practice.  The duration of screening in the control is same as the intervention group (4-5 years depending on country).
Patients transplanted during the study will be followed for 12 months post-date of transplant and will exit study. This applies for both SCREENING and NO SCREENING groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary efficacy: major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as any of the following: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, emergency revascularisation, hospitalisation with unstable angina.

The outcome will be assessed by:
1) Notification to the transplant coordinators when patients are admitted in hospital (this is the usual standard of care in wait-listed patients).
2) The trial coordinator will gather electronic medical records, letters. procedure notes and will fill in the relevant case record form on the REDCap database (managed by Sydney local health district). All data are encrypted and stored on servers at SLHD, where it is backed up.
3) Patients will be followed up 6 monthly (alternating by phone and clinic visits) where trial coordinators will discuss any hospitalisations with the patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>We will analyse time to MACE, within a 4 year study period (Australia and New Zealand) and 5-year study period (Canada)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Health related quality of life</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, then 6 monthly thereafter for the duration of the study (4-5 years).

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data on resource use will be obtained in two ways. First through identification of tests, procedures and doctors visits related to cardiac and renal management for all study participants from randomisation to study end as recorded in the patient diaries and trial case report forms. 
Second, Australian participants will have their records linked to the Admitted Patient Data Collection, Emergency Department Data Collection, and through Medicare for all Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) outpatient visits, procedures and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for medicines.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Efficacy outcomes will be analysed using intention to treat.  A significance level of 5% shall be used for all analyses, unless otherwise specified. All analyses will be adjusted for site.
The primary analysis will be an analysis of the time to first occurrence of the primary outcome MACE, using a Cox model with treatment arm as a covariate and stratified by site. This analysis will provide an estimate of the HR, a p-value and CI. Non-inferiority will be claimed if the 95%CI of the HR lies entirely lower than an HR value of 1.25, with the screening arm being the referent group. Superiority will be claimed if the 95%CI lies entirely lower than 1.  Proportional hazards assumption will be assessed using log-log survival plots and Schoenfeld residuals.
The outcome of all-cause mortality will also be analyse using a Cox model. The time to all other outcomes will be analysed using a competing risk model, with the competing risk being death. Outcomes which can occur more than once will also be analysed using an Andersen and Gill model. This model is a natural extension of the Cox model and unlike the Poisson or Negative Binomial models for count data, does not require the assumption of a constant event rate over time. Robust standard errors using the Sandwich estimator will be applied to ensure the correct p-value and CIs are calculated. 
All time to event data will also be graphically summarised using a Kaplan Meier or cumulative incidence curves comparing the two treatment arms. 


Sample size calculation
We conservatively estimate an average MACE rate of 6%: MACE rates in the U.S. range from 8.7 % in the first year after a kidney transplant to 13.2 % per year on the waiting list. Using a MACE rate of 6% per year and non-inferiority defined as a Hazard Ratio (HR) of MACE &lt; 1.25, randomization of 3306 patients will give us 80% power using a two-sided 5% significance level. An HR of 1.25 equates to an absolute difference in MACE being &lt;1.4% higher in the non-screening group compared to the regular screening group (i.e. 7.4% versus 6.0 %).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of death while on the kidney transplant waiting list and after transplantation. Current standard care involves screening for coronary artery disease prior to waitlist entry, then every 1-2 years, according to perceived risk, until transplanted. The aim of screening is two-fold. Firstly to identify patients with asymptomatic coronary disease to enable either correction, by bypass surgery or angioplasty, or removal of the patient from the list, with the ultimate aim of preventing premature cardiovascular mortality at the time of, or soon after kidney transplantation. Secondly, from a societal perspective, to prevent mis-direction of scarce donor organs into recipients who experience early mortality. This current screening strategy is not evidence based, has substantial known and potential harms, and is very costly. Two major issues of uncertainty require addressing in sequence: (1) whether to periodically screen asymptomatic wait-listed patients for occult coronary artery disease; and (2) whether to revascularise coronary stenoses in asymptomatic patients prior to transplantation. The CARSK study seeks to address the first of these 2 issues.

CARSK aims to
1. Test the hypothesis that after screening for wait list entry, no further screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) is non-inferior to the current standard care which is screening all asymptomatic wait-listed patients for CAD at regular intervals.
2. Compare the benefits and costs of not screening versus regular CAD screening from a health system perspective.
