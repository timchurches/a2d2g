  <interventions>
    <interventions>At the time of inadvertant dural puncture participants allocated to have an intrathecal catheter will have the epidural catheter threaded through the epidural needle into the intrathecal space. The epidural needle is removed and the epidural catheter can now function as an intrathecal catheter as it is left in the intrathecal space and not the epidural space. It is left in situ for 24-48 hours unless there is a clinical indication to remove it earlier. If labour analgesia or surgical anaesthesia is required this can be provided by administering local anaesthetic drugs such as Ropivacaine or Bupivicaine with or without an opioid such as fentanyl down the intrathecal catheter.</interventions>
    <comparator>At the time of inadvertant dural puncture participants allocated to have the epidural resited will have the epidural needle removed from the intrathecal space and resited so that the epidural catheter is placed correctly in the epidural space. It is left in situ until it is no longer needed for labour analgesia or anaesthesia for surgery. It will be removed usually within 48 hours of placement unless there is a clinical indication to remove it earlier/later. If labour analgesia or surgical anaesthesia is required this can be provided by administering local anaesthetic drugs such as Ropivacaine or Bupivicaine with or without an opioid such as fentanyl down the epidural catheter as per the anaesthetist's usual practice</comparator>
