  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Optimal pelvic floor muscle function is known to assist bladder and bowel function and
      control, pelvic organ support, as well as other areas of health. It is also known that
      problems in some of tehse areas can be a consequence of pelvic surgery. By addressing the
      requirements for good bladder and bowel function/control, and organ support in the early
      post-surgery phase when tissue repair and scar formation are critical, it is proposed that
      there will be a rduction in the longterm prevalence of bladder problems, bowel difficulties
      and weakened pelvic floor and abdominal muscles in post-surgery patients. This study is a
      randomised controlled trial to compare patients undergoing a physiotherapy-supervised pelvic
      floor muscle training and behavioural therapy program with a control group. It is
      hypothesised that at the 12 month post-operative follow-up assessment, the treatment group
      will demonstrate better outcomes in bladder and bowel function and control, as well as
      stronger pelvic floor muscle contractile strength than the control group.</summary>
