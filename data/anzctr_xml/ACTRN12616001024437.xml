  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients will be divided into two groups .The first groups will receive continuous epidural infusion for analgesia and the second groups will receive continuous preperitoneal infusion for analgesia. The intervention group is the preperitoneal group in which a multiholed catheter will be placed by surgeon in the preperitoneal space at the end of surgery giving ropivacaine 0.5% 5ml/h by continuous infusion for 48 hours postoperative after giving bolus dose of 15 ml of lidocaine 2%</interventions>
    <comparator>After resection of abdominal or pelvic tumours patients will be randomaly divided into two equal groups .The first group will have an epidural catheter as a sole of postoperative analgesia .While the second group will have continuous preperitonial catheter as  an alternative analgesia. The comparator group will have epidural catheter giving 15 ml of xylocaine 2% as bolus dose followed by ropivacaine continuous infusion 0.5% 5ml/h for 48 hours postoperative</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>data will be analyzed using SPSS statistics for windows version 20.0.The mean and SD will be calculated for all continuous variables, and in case of normal distribution ,paired or independent test will be carried out ,whereas Mann-Whitney U test will be performed for normally distributed variables. G power program (3.0.10) was used to calculate sample size with priory analysis. VAS .Effect size was chosen as 0.8 (large effect size),alpha error was 0.05 and power  of 0.8 was used .The resulted sample size was 20 patients for each group. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative pain after major abdoiminal and pelvic operation is a challenging issue. the ideal method  of pain control is by inserting epidural catheter. But preperitonial catheter insertion is a new technique .So this study will be conducted to compare between two different techniques in control of pain postoperative.</summary>
