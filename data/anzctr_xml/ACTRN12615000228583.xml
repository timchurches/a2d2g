  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1:Internet-based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for pathological gambling. Content of treatment involved assessment, psychoeducation, strategies to challenge gambling related cognitions, and strategies to reduce gambling related behaviours. There were four therapists involved in the program. Each therapist had experience delivering Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and held provisional registration as psychologists. Each psychologist undertook weekly supervision with the primary author (Casey). There were six session total, with one session completed per week over the internet. Each session was expected to take participants approximately 1 hour to complete. Adherence was monitored by recording the number of online sessions completed by each participant. </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: active treatment control condition (Internet-based Motivation, Feedback, and Support) in which participants had access to only selected portions of the I-CBT program. These portions focused on the monitoring of gambling behaviours, provided participants with feedback on their progress as well as supportive messages. There were four therapists involved in the program. Each therapist had experience delivering Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and held provisional registration as psychologists. Each psychologist undertook weekly supervision with the primary author (Casey). Each I-MFS session took approximately 5-10 minutes to complete. Arm 3: a waitlist control condition.   All sessions are completed online, once a week for six weeks. Participants in Arm 3: the waitlist control condition were randomly allocated to Arm 1 or Arm 2 after the 6 week waitlist period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to investigate an internet based treatment for pathological gambling. Participants were randomly allocated to three groups; an internet based treatment based on cognitive behavioural strategies, an internet based treatment based on motivational and supportive techniques, and a waitlist control. The two treatment groups consists of one weekly session, for six weeks duration. Participants in the waitlist control group were offered treatment on completion of the six week wait period. Measures were taken pre treatment, mid treatment/ wait, and post treatment/ wait, as well as some weekly measures throughout treatment.</summary>
