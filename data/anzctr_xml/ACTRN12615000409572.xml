  <interventions>
    <interventions>The pumping technique: To such end, the subject  place in a supine position with knees bent and the therapist standing on the left hand side of the patient, near the abdominal area. The left hand goes under the costal border to lift the costal chest. The right hand rests on the lower chest on the right side to compress the liver through the costal wall. The lower hand lifts the ribs while the upper hand exerts compression. The patient is asked to inhale deeply, and on exhaling the compression is performed with the hands, and during deep inspiration. This will be repeated for 10 respiratory cycles. Thus, through the anteroposterior contact on the liver, using the costal inspiration, which lowers the diaphragm, the liver is pumped</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the Control Group followed exactly the same process for measurements, positions, contacts and breathing as the Experimental Group, with the only exception being the pumping. In lieu of any force, the therapist's hands will limited to accompanying the respiratory movements with no compression.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The osteopathic treatment of the liver has been recommended in several types of disorders in order to increase and improve the liver function. However, there are no studies to support its effectiveness. 
Therefore, through the Doppler ultrasound, we inten to evaluate the effect of the osteopathic manual pumping of liver technique on changes in the portal venous flow in patients with different symptoms.

The conceptual hypothesis of our study will be that "the manual treatment of the liver improves the velocity of the flow of the portal vein," so that a visceral manual operation may change the function of the viscera itself and in our study the values of portal haemodynamics.</summary>
