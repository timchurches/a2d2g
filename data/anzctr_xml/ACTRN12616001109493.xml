  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-centre, prospective randomised controlled study, evaluating the effect of integrated specialised clinics for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
The specialised AF-Clinics include structured AF management and aggressive risk factor management. 

The study population comprises patients with AF presenting to the emergency department or cardiology outpatient department. Patients in the active (intervention) group, all undergo protocolised clinical investigation, including an echocardiogram, 24 hour Holter monitoring or treadmill (to assess rate control), laboratory testing (thyroid function and cardiovascular profile) and ECG, before visiting the specialised AF outpatient clinic (iCARE-AF clinic). The treatment team includes e.g. cardiologists, electrophysiologists, general practitioners, specialised nurses, and pharmacists, providing an integrated compehensive approach to AF management. The specialised nurse is the casemanager and care coordinator. The intervention period for each participant is two years.

During 3 monthly consultations (30-45 minutes) in the first year, patients will visit the nurse who will take their medical history and screen for cardiovascular (CV) risk factors. The nurse provides structured education, tailored to the patients abilities and needs, incorporating the cardiac condition, possible complications, diagnostic test results, treatment options and risk factor management. 

In the intervention the care provider uses a decision-support software for comprehensive AF and CV risk management. The software serves as an electronic checklist to prevent incomplete diagnostic and therapeutic guideline-adherent AF and CV risk management and can be used for patient educational goals. The software is designed as a tool to assist both care provider and patient (e.g. in order to provide tailored care and education, which requires active patient input and participation during consultations). In fact, this system is considered to navigate and support decision making in the treatment team throughout the entire care process. 

CV Risk Factor Management will be performed using an approach that has been successfully used in a prior study from our group and was assessed and approved by the RAH HREC. This includes the following elements:

WEIGHT LOSS will be addressed by using structured multidisciplinary motivational and goal-directed face-to-face visits every 3 months in the first year, and every 6 months thereafter. Patients will be encouraged to utilize support counseling in scheduled reviews,  Nutritional behavior reflection, barriers to goal achievement and nutritional decision coaching will be addressed in the 20-40 minute counseling sessions. Verbal and written tailored educational material will be provided. The participant will be able to schedule additional intervening visits in the event of an impending relapse. If additional support is required, 24-hour email and telephone contact will be available.

Initial weight reduction will be attempted by a meal plan and behavior modification program, with emphasis on education for permanent lifestyle changes and behavior modification program. The initial goal will be to reduce body weight by 10% from baseline. 

Lifestyle Journal - Participants in the intervention group will be instructed to maintain a self-monitoring lifestyle journal, covering dietary intake and excercise.

Exercise  Physical activity is initially prescribed  at 20 minutes of low intensity based on participant's choice (e.g. walking, aqua-aerobics) thrice weekly, increasing to  200 min of moderate-intensity physical activity weekly, Type of activity and duration is logged into the lifestyle journal. Excercise is planned for total follow-up.

CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT - Coexistent CV risk factors as indicated below, will be identified through historical patient records and fasting plasma testing. Following identification, optimal management according to current evidence based practice guidelines will be addressed by the nurse/cardiologist in 30-45 min. consultations and referral to dedicated specialists (e.g. diabetes and sleep disordered breathing) if indicated.

HYPERTENSION  Patients will be asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) twice daily using a home-automated monitor. In addition, exercise stress testing will be performed to determine the presence of exercise-induced hypertension. Increase in blood pressure to over 200/100 with exercise will be considered further evidence to optimize control. Initial therapeutic advice will include dietary salt restriction and weight loss with increase in aerobic physical activity. Pharmacotherapy will be initiated using angiotensin-aldosterone axis active agents by preference, and other agents where necessary to achieve a target BP of &lt;130/80mmHg in rest on at least 80% of random patient acquired blood pressure readings as listed above. In addition, echocardiography will be used to monitor any objective evidence of end-organ injury (e.g. left ventricular hypertrophy). Changes in the dose and number of anti-hypertensive agents will be recorded at each 3 monthly visit.

GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND HYPER-INSULINEMIA - If fasting glucose is between 100 and 125mg/dL, a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test will be performed. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) will be initially managed with lifestyle measures such as diet and aerobic exercise. If patients are unable to maintain glycosylated hemoglobin values below 6.5 percent after three months, metformin will be started. Patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c&gt;7%) will be referred to diabetes clinic.

HYPERLIPIDEMIA  Management of dyslipidemia will be in accordance with the evidence based practice guidelines. Initially lifestyle measures will be used. If patients are unable to achieve LDL-Cholesterol of less than 100mg/dL after 3 months then statin will be initiated. Fibrates will be used for isolated cases of hypertriglyceridemia (TG &gt; 500mg/dL) or added to statin therapy if TG&gt; 200mg/dL and non-HDL cholesterol was &gt;130mg/dL after 3 months of therapeutic life style measures. 

SLEEP APNEA - Patients will be referred to a dedicated sleep disorder unit for overnight polysommnography. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will be prescribed in the presence of a clinically compatible history of sleep apnea and sleep study results (Respitory Disturbance Index [RDI] and desaturation levels). Generally, continued lifestyle measures with periodic evaluation may be pursued if RDI= 15-30, CPAP will be prescribed if RDI &gt;30. 

SMOKING - The 5A (Ask, Assess, Advice, Assist and Arrange follow up) structured smoking cessation framework will be adapted. Smokers will be offered behavioral support and follow-up within the specialised clinic. Pharmacotherapy may be added.

ALCOHOL -  Written and verbal counseling will be provided aiming to reduce alcohol intake (3 standard drinks  per week) with abstinence as ultimate goal.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary (composite) endpoint of the study is survival time to first hospitalisation or death from any cause within two years from randomisation. A two-year cumulative incidence of 21% has been assumed in the standard care (control) group based on prior results (Hendriks et al. 2012). 
The trial is powered to detect a 6% decrease in cumulative incidence in the integrated care (active) group using the log rank test with overall Type I error probability alpha=0.05 (two-sided) and power  1-beta=0.80 (one-sided). A minimum follow-up of two years from recruitment is planned. A 20% dropout rate per year in each group is assumed. Overall, the trial will enroll a minimum of 688 patients in each group, including a 10% increment to cover unexpected withdrawals, and asuming the study continues to completion. Thus, the total study population comprises 1376 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major public health burden with an estimated 33.5 million patients globally in 2010, and evidence suggests that these figures continue rising. AF contributes to a high burden on the health care system mainly due to AF hospitalisations with an annual cost of $ 3.46 billion in Australia alone.

Management of AF, including cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, is often not according evidence based guidelines leading to poor outcomes in these patients. 

Integrated care management has been recognised as a way to reorganise medical treatment for patients with chronic diseases. Recent data demonstrates the importance of protocol driven AF-Clinics. A randomised trial in Europe demonstrated integrated care in a specialized protocol-driven AF-Clinic being superior in terms of cardiovascular hospitalisation and mortality, compared to usual care. An Australian trial comparing aggressive CV risk factor management with usual care in AF patients demonstrated a significant reduction of AF symptom burden and severity and improved arrhythmia free survival. Both trials were conducted in a single-centre setting.

In the proposed trial, structured AF management including aggressive risk factor management will be integrated in a protocol-driven, specialised iCARE-AF Clinic. This clinic integrates significant care components and focusses on the collaboration between important disciplines and involving patients in the care process, following a patient-centred and multidisciplinary approach. 

It is hypothesised that this iCARE-AF Clinic will reduce all-cause hospitalisation and mortality in patients with AF (primary endpoint). To test this hypothesis, the iCARE-AF clinic will be compared with standard of care in a prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial, involving 5 teaching centres in Australia. Follow-up will be 24 months.
