  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. All participants will receive usual care, however, one group will additionally receive strengthening exercises for the lower limbs together with nutrition care.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    These exercise sessions will last no longer than 45 minutes two times per week for 12 weeks. We will measure leg strength in the physiotherapy gymnasium before and after the 12 weeks of exercises and then one month after the exercises have finished to see if the effects are retained. Participants will also be interviewed by the Dietitian pre and post treatment and at a 4 week follow up to determine their nutrition risks, status, nutrition goals and nutrition care plan. There will be weekly follow up by the Dietitian and Nutrition Technician to check the effectiveness of the plan and achievement of goals.</interventions>
