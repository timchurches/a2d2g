    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK3342830
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: GSK3342830 single dose in Part 1 - Enrolled subject will receive single escalation dose of GSK3342830. The escalating doses will be evaluated in six cohorts as A- 250 mg, B-500 mg, C-1000 mg, D-2000 mg, E-4000 mg, and F-=&lt;6000 mg. In each cohort 6 subjects will receive GSK3342830 in form of infusion for 1 h, therefore approximately 36 subjects will receive GSK3342830. Dose escalation will be based on evaluation of the preceding dose levels in the study.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo single dose in Part 1 - Enrolled subject will receive single escalation dose of placebo. In each cohort, 2 subjects will receive placebo in form of infusion for 1 h, therefore approximately 12 subjects will receive placebo.

Experimental: GSK3342830 repeat Dose in Part 2 - Enrolled subject will receive repeat escalating dose of GSK3342830. GSK3342830 as a single IV infusion will be administered on Day 1, TID (8 hours apart) IV infusions on Days 2 through 14, and a single IV infusion on Day 15. The escalating doses will be evaluated in three cohorts as G-1000 mg, H-2000 and I-4000 mg. In each cohort 8 subjects will receive GSK3342830 in form of infusion for 1 h, therefore approximately 24 subjects will receive GSK3342830. The starting dose and maximum dose may change based on clinical safety and PK findings in Part 1 or earlier doses in Part 2 respectively.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo repeat Dose in Part 2 - Enrolled subject will receive repeat escalation dose of placebo. Placebo as a single IV infusion will be administered on Day 1, TID (8 hours apart) IV infusions on Days 2 through 14, and a single IV infusion on Day 15. In each cohort, 2 subjects will receive placebo in form of infusion for 1 h, therefore approximately 6 subjects will receive placebo.


Treatment: drugs: GSK3342830
A pyrogen free lyophilized formulation, white to yellowish brown powder containing 1000 mg of GSK3342830A (as free base) per vial. The reconstituted solution looks like a clear, colorless to yellow or brownish yellow liquid, free from visible particulate matter will be administered as IV infusion over 1 hour.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
A clear and colorless solution containing 0.9% sodium chloride. It will administered as IV infusion over 1 hour.

             infarction, bundle branch block and Any conduction abnormality (including but not

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A phase I, first-time-in-human (FTIH), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      dose-escalation study is conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of GSK3342830 after administration of single intravenous (IV) infusion in Part 1
      and repeat IV infusion in Part 2 in healthy subjects. Part 1 will investigate escalating
      single IV doses of GSK3342830. Part 2, will investigate escalating repeat IV doses of
      GSK3342830 with repeat dosing for 15 days as follows: a single IV infusion on Day 1, TID
      (three times a day) IV infusions on Days 2 through 14 (approximately every 8 hours), and a
      single IV infusion on Day 15. The planned starting GSK3342830 dose in Part 1 is 250 milligram
      (mg) administered as a single IV infusion. The dose is planned to increase in subsequent
      cohorts to 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and less than or equal to (=) 6000 mg. Part 1 will be
      divided into 6 cohorts (A-F) and each cohort will enroll 10 subjects (6 in active and 2 in
      placebo). Dose escalation will be conducted only if it is supported by the preliminary
      safety, tolerability, and PK results from the preceding dose levels in the study. The repeat
      dose escalation component (Part 2) of this study will be planned to be initiated after
      completion and evaluation of the all single dose cohorts up to and including 4000 mg.</summary>
