  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1: Formal education in form of Written Handout
- Written handout will include subtitles of: What is a Stent? Why do you need a stent? What side effects should I expect? When should I see a doctor for stent symptoms? When will the stent be removed? What can I do with the stent in place?  It will also include a visual image of the stent within kidney, ureter and bladder.
- Written information will be provided on the ward after stent insertion and prior to discharge.  Patients will be given this information handout to keep.
- This intervention will technically last until their followup phone call which will occur within 3 months and after their stent is removed (stents are usually removed between 2-6 weeks).

Intervention 2: Formal education in form of Written Handout AND Informative Video
- The Written handout is exactly the same as Intervention 1.
- The informative video will include a visual(animated) projection of the stent and where it lies anatomically.  Otherwise, the information provided will be the same as the written handout except that it will include audio as well as visual information.  Again, it will be the same information as the written handout.
- Both these forms of education will occur after stent insertion and before discharge.  Patients can keep their written handout and will be able to view the informative video only once.
- The duration of the intervention will be until they receive their phone call after stent extraction and within 3 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator is standard education (verbal non-prepared information).
This standard education varies between which doctor relays information to the patient.  Generally, it is expected of the doctors in the department to cover with the patient what a stent is, what it is used for and also what side-effects are to be expected with a stent.  Patients are also advised of when to seek medical attention.
Standard education is provided after a stent is inserted prior to discharge.
The duration of the compariator is within 3 months after the stent is removed (usually after 2-6 weeks).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presentation to medical service (General Practitioner or Emergency Department)

Patients will be contacted over the telephone and asked a series of questions.  The first question will ensure the patient has consented to be questioned for research purposes.  The second question will be whether the patient has presented to an emergency department or general practitioner with stent related symptoms.  To check that these are stent symptoms, they will be asked if they experienced abdominal, pelvic or flank pain, increased urinary frequency, pain on passing urine, symptoms of sepsis (fevers, night sweats, rigors) or asked to elaborate on any other symptoms

Results will be recorded on a database</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be contacted within 3 months of stent insertion and after they have received intervention or comparator (usually immediately after stent insertion) AND after they have had their stent out (usually within 2-6 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prescription of antibiotics

During the phone questionnaire, patients will be asked if they were prescribed antibiotics by the health service provider that they saw.  Results will be recorded on a database.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be contacted within 3 months of stent insertion and after they have received intervention or comparator (usually immediately after stent insertion) AND after they have had their stent out (usually within 2-6 weeks)</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Main data for analysis will include whether or not patients present to their GP, ED or neither.  Patient symptoms will be analysed as well as what treatment was provided to the patient.
The overall cohort of 150 patients is an estimate of how many stents will be inserted in the time-frame allowable for this research project (1 year).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research study is to assess whether patient education alters the frequency of representations to a doctor, following insertion of a ureteric stent for calculus (stone) disease.
Patients who have ureteric stents placed for stone disease will be approached for this study.  They will be consented to:
1. Placement of their name on a register 
2. Being contacted within 3 months by telephone where they will be asked whether they presented to their General Practitioner (GP) or Emergency Department (ED) for stent symptoms and if so, what the symptoms were.
3. GP may be called to clarify further information

Patients involved in the study will be randomised (through time of presentation) to either standard care, education leaflet or education leaflet as well as educational video.
Participants in the study will then be contacted by telephone within 3 months of stent insertion and questioned regarding presentations to their GP or ED.  If they did, they will be asked regarding what symptoms they presented for and the health provider may be contacted to clarify further information.
The data will be evaluated to review if different levels of education may affect the representation rate following stent insertion.
