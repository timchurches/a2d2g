  <interventions>
    <interventions>Administration of inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (CSL brand Fluvax). 
1.Dosage used 0.5mL
2.Administered as deep subcutaneous injection in deltoid region
3.Single administration of injection only to all participants.
4.Overall intervention period 1 month, single dose only though given on Day 0 and all subjects followed until day 28.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment
Those individuals in the control arm did not receive an injection (ie no placebo) on Day 0 and as such the trial was not blinded. They literally received no treatment. The control individuals who did not receive the vaccine on Day 0 were offerred to receive the vaccine on Day 28 if they wished.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: Immunological response to the influenza vaccine measured by haemagglutination-inhibition assays (HAI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titres measured by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>BVAS (Birmingham vasculitis activity score) clinically assessed. BVAS was assessed by a telephone conversation with the patient and asking specific questions as part of a set questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of biochemical markers including creatinine, c-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin. These markers were measured by a diagnostic laboratory. Creatinine was measured by a kinetic colour test using the Jaffe method to quantitatively determine the creatinine concentration in an individual's serum. An immuno-turbidimetric test was used for the quantitative determination of C-reactive protein (CRP) in human serum. Albumin was measured by dye binding and read by a diagnostic analyser.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Autoantibody production by the healthy control group in response to the vaccination including rheumatoid factor, double-stranded DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, total IgG (immune globulin G) and total IgM (immune globulin M). Levels of anti-myeloperoxidase and anti-proteinase 3 as the ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) were also measured.  Levels of anti-myeloperoxidase, anti-proteinase and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide were all measured using commercial ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) kits in duplicate. Total IgG and IgM and rheumatoid factor were measured by nephelometry in a diagnostic laboratory.  Double-stranded DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid), was measured by radioimmunoassay also by a diagnostic laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with ANCA (Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) vasculitis and healthy individuals were recruited to assess their response to influenza vaccination. It was anticipated that the the response to the vaccine by the patients would be less than the healthy control group, but still sufficient to provide protection against the influenza virus.  The response of healthy individuals and those with ANCA vasculitis will be compared. Patients with ANCA vasculitis were monitored throughout the study to determine whether the influenza vaccination caused any change in their disease activity.</summary>
