    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Idelalisib
Treatment: drugs - Bendamustine
Treatment: drugs - Rituximab
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Idelalisib+bendamustine+rituximab - Participants will receive idelalisib for 96 weeks plus bendamustine+rituximab for 21 weeks.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo+bendamustine+rituximab - Participants will receive placebo to match idelalisib for 96 weeks plus bendamustine+rituximab for 21 weeks.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the interval from randomization to the first documentation of definitive disease progression or death from any cause. Definitive disease progression is CLL progression based on standard criteria, excluding lymphocytosis alone. PFS was to be assessed by an independent review committee (IRC).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Response Rate - Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete or partial response. ORR was to be assessed by an IRC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nodal Response Rate - Nodal response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a 50% decrease from baseline in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular diameters of index lesions. Nodal response rate was to be assessed by an IRC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complete Response Rate - Complete response rate is defined as the proportion of participants who achieve a confirmed complete response. Complete response rate was to be assessed by an IRC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - Overall survival is defined as the interval from randomization to death from any cause. Overall survival was to be assessed by an IRC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Minimal Residual Disease Negativity Rate at Week 36 - Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate is defined as the proportion of participants with MRD &lt; 10^-4 assessed by flow cytometry in bone marrow at Week 36 after therapy initiation or at least 12 weeks after the last dose of rituximab or bendamustine (whichever is later) for participants receiving the final dose of rituximab after the original scheduled date. MRD negativity rate was to be assessed by an IRC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 22 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the progression-free survival in
      participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who would otherwise
      be suitable for bendamustine and rituximab treatment as standard of care.

      An increased rate of deaths and serious adverse events (SAEs) among participants with
      front-line CLL and early-line indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) treated with idelalisib in
      combination with standard therapies was observed by the independent data monitoring committee
      (DMC) during regular review of 3 Gilead Phase 3 studies. Gilead reviewed the unblinded data
      and terminated this study in agreement with the DMC recommendation and in consultation with
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</summary>
