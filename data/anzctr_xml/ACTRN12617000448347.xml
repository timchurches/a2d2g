  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-The patients refered to EUS examination for regular etiologies such as pancreatic cysts, subepithelial lesions, investigation of common bile duct Stones etc will be examined for hepatic parenchymal stiffness using the software for elastography measurement that is already available with the device. This procedure will add  only 2-3 minutes to the EUS examination. A seperate and dedicated EUS session will not be planned for the whole patient groups. Those having accompanying Chronic hepatitis B or C or nonalcoholic hepatitis will be evaluated as the study group.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who are evaluated by endoscopic ultrasound for other causes such as subepithelial lesions, pancreatic cysts, etiology of chronic pancreatitis will also be evaluated for the hepatic elastography during the same session. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>

    </primaryOutcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relationship between the liver elastography measures obtained by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and the histologic liver fibrosis amount in chronic hepatitis patients who have undergone a liver biopsy within the last one year of the EUS procedure. For this outcome, we will not require a liver biopsy but only review the records of the patients.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a good tool for real-time visualization of the left liver lobe and it has a software to measure the liver elastography which shows the stiffness of the liver. The comparison of EUS-liver elastography and liver biopsy parameters of inflammation and fibrosis is not known. Although EUS is an invasive endoscopic procedure, it has unique beneficial role for the evaluation of subepithelial masses of gastrointestinal tractus such as esophageal varices, common bile duct anomalies such as stones, pancreatic cysts, mediastinal masses....etc. During EUS examination for any indication, the operator can easyly evaluate the liver and can add the liver stiffness findings to the report. This study aims to prospectively evaluate the value of EUS-liver elastographic measurements in patients with chronic hepatitis B, C and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who were referred to EUS for other indications. The patients who have biopsies in the last 2 years of the EUS-examination will be compared by their EUS- elastography findings and biopsy findings. There will be a control group who have no known positivity for viral hepatitis serology and no liver disease.</summary>
