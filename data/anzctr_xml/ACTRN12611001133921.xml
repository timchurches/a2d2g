    <studytitle>A Randomized Trial To Assess The Importance of Human Menopausal Gonadotropin Co-stimulation in In Vitro Fertilization Programs</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The impact of human menopausal gonadotropin on follicular fluid hormone levels, embryo quality and IVF outcome in infertile women with mild male factor, unexplained and tubal factor infertility at ages between 25-35, undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant FSH versus recombinant FSH+HMG</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The long COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) protocol is used in which the GnRH analogue (Leuprolide acetate )was administered in a dose of 1 mg/day subcutaneously starting in the mid-luteal phase of the preceding cycle (on the 21st day of preceding cycle). After down regulation (that is, pituitary desensitization) with leuprolide acetate;
Arm 1 was stimulated only with subcutaneous recombinant FSH, the starting dose was between 150-450 IU depending on the patient's characteristics and the treatment was terminated when 2 or more follicules greater than 17mm in diameter was obtained; 
Arm 2 was stimulated with subcutaneous recombinant FSH and intramuscular HMG (human menopausal gonadotropin, 1 or 2 ampoules depending on the patient's characteristics) from the beginning and both drugs were continued till 2 or more follicules of 17mm in diameter was obtained;
Arm 3 was stimulated with subcutaneous recombinant FSH and intramuscular HMG was added to the stimulation protocol when a 10 mm follicle developed  and both drugs were continued till 2 or more follicules of 17mm in diameter was obtained</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control [controlled ovarian stimulation with recombinant FSH (subcutaneous injection) and adding HMG (intramuscular injection) co-stimulation for differing durations of time] Recombinant FSH is started within a dose range of 150-450 U depending on the patient's characteristics and HMG co-stimulation is added as 1 or 2 ampoules as needed. All three arms of the study were compared with each other trying to assess the superiority of one arm to the others on the outcomes as embryo quality, implantation and clinical pregnancy rates and the hormonal milleu of the intrafollicular fluid. Arm 1 is actually the control treatment;however, recombinant FSH treatment is not the standart treatment in IVF stimulation protocols. Treatments can directly start with HMG stimulation or co-stimulation with HMG can be added as in Arms 2 and 3. With this study we tried to find out if co-stimulation with HMG and the duration of HMG stimulation was superior to pure recombinant FSH stimulation on the outcome measures as the embryo quality, the implantation and the clinical pregnancy rates. And if it happens that one is superior then, as the secondary outcome of the study the difference of the intrafollicular hormonal milleu of each arm will be assessed.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>embryo quality
Quality of the day 3 embryos were assessed using the following criteria :
Grade 1 embryo (G1): no fragmentation, homogenous blastomeres 
Grade 2 embryo (G2) : &lt; %20 fragmantation, equal or unequal blastomeres
Grade 3 embryo (G3): %20- 50 fragmantation,  unequal blastomeres
Grade 4 embriyo (G4) : &gt;%50 fragmantation unequal blastomeres
An inverted phase contrast microscope (Olympus, Japan) at X200 or X400 magnification was used for the evaluation of embryo quality.</outcome>

      <timepoint>Transvaginal Ultrasonography 3-5 weeks after embryo transfer. Three weeks after the embryo transfer gestational sac/s were assessed on transvaginal ultrasonography in those who were beta HCG positive. And a second transvaginal ultrasound is performed on the fifth week of embryo transfer for assessment of fetal heart beat.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recombinant FSH and HMG (human menopausal gonadotropin) are commonly used in ovarian stimulation protocols. Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these two alternatives in IVF and reported conflicting results. The objective of this prospective randomized study is to analyze IVF outcomes of patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with FSH versus FSH-HMG for unexplained, tubal factor and mild male factor infertility.</summary>
