  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each study participant will be observed for a duration of 3 months after intervention commencement in this study, for the reduction of the effects of preoperative corneal astigmatism on postoperative refraction after cataract surgery with implantation of enVista Toric Intraocular Lens (IOL) in one or both eyes.
The enVista Toric Intraocular Lens is a single piece posterior chamber intraocular lens developed to replace the human crystalline lens in adult patients in whom the cataractous human lens has been removed during cataract surgery. 
The duration of the full cataract surgery is approximately 30 minutes of which the implantation procedure of enVista Intraocular lens is approximately 5 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dioptric change in cylinder (absolute preoperative corneal cylinder minus absolute residual postoperative refractive astigmatism, with the postoperative astigmatism converted to the corneal plane)
This is assessed with Keratometry and manifest refraction. The values of preoperative and postoperative astigmatism will be compared to identify the Dioptric change in astigmatism.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Uncorrected Distance Visual Acuity (UCDVA)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Manifest Refraction Spherical Equivalent (MRSE) accuracy to target.
This is assessed with manifest refraction. Refraction is performed subjectively to obtain the refractive value. It will be compared with the value of the target refraction per IOL power calculation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative Refractive Astigmatism
This is assessed with manifest refraction. Refraction is performed subjectively to obtain the refractive astigmatism value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1-2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative Refractive Astigmatism accuracy to target
This is assessed with manifest refraction. Refraction is performed subjectively to obtain the refractive value. It will be compared with the value of the target refraction per IOL power calculation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in absolute cylinder
This is assessed with manifest refraction. Refraction is performed subjectively to obtain the refractive value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Spectacle Independence
This is assessed with Patient Questionnaire.
The name of the Questionnaire is Bausch + Lomb Study #846 Patient Questionnaire.
There are questions which will require participants to provide answer to how often they wear eyeglasses, type of corrective eyeglasses, frequency of wearing eyeglasses etc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Summary of Intraoperative Complications
Examples of known intraoperative complications include capsular tear, wound leak, corneal edema, IOL optic decentration.
They are assessed during cataract surgery, under the microscope of the phacoemulsification machine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day of intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Summary of Ocular Adverse Events (AEs)
Examples of Ocular Adverse Events include anterior uveitis, IOL opacities, raised IOP, retinal detachment, macular edema.
They are assessed with Slit Lamp biomicroscopy, funduscopy or Optical Coherence Tomography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day of intervention commencement, and at 1-2 days, 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative Best Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (BCDVA) by visit window</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1-2 week, 1 month and 3 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects must have a best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) projected to be better than 20/32 (or equivalent) after toric IOL implantation, have a target postoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) projected to be within +/-0.37D and postoperative residual astigmatism of less than or equal to 0.50D as reflected by the Toric calculator</inclusivecriteria>
