  <interventions>
    <interventions>Locking plate have recently been developed for the internal fixation of fractures, and are gaining widespread acceptance. This technique includes a plate and several screws.  These screws can be locked in the plate. Locking plates have several advantages over traditional screw/plate constructs. There is improved angular stability because each screw acts as a small fixed-angled device. One can thus obtain better fixation in osteoporotic bone, and there is the opportunity to use unicortical, rather than bicortical screws.The locking plate is widely used in clinical practice, but is rarely used for intertrochanteric fracture in this study. It is applied in the operation for just once.  The whole process would be completed during the operation, taking about 1 hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>The gamma nail is an implant specifically designed for the fixation of intertrochantric and subtrochantric femoral fractures. It is inserted into the pulp cavity along the axis of the femoral bone and is fixed by screws. Now it is considered to be the comparablely better treatment for intertrochanteric fracture. In this study, we set it as control group. It is applied and completed just once during the operation, taking about 1 hour.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intertrochanteric fractures are common nowadays. Though there are several methods described in the literature for this kind of fracture,  the optimal one is still in controversy. Gamma was considered to be a good choice for intertrochanteric hip fractrues, but it still has many limitations such as cracking the lateral trochanter. The locking plate was used to treat some other fractures such as distal femoral fracture. In recent days, some specialists proposed that locking plate could be used for intertrochanteric fractures. Now some mechanical test has confirmed it in laboratory.
This study attempts to determine whether locking plates can achieve an equal or better outcome compared with gamma nails for intertrochanteric hip fractures.</summary>
