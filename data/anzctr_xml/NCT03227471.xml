  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first-in-human and proof-of-concept study of VX-445. The study includes 6 parts.
      Parts A, B, and C will be conducted in healthy subjects. Parts D, E, and F will be conducted
      in subjects with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous for the F508del mutation of the CF
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (F/F genotype), or who are heterozygous for
      the F508del mutation and a minimal function (MF) CFTR mutation not likely to respond to TEZ,
      IVA, or TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes).</summary>
