  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants assigned to the exercise group will be required to complete three sessions per week of home-based physical activity for the duration of their treatment. Participants treatment duration will be determined by medical staff as treatment progresses, and is not altered by participation in this study. Prescription of the physical activity program will be implemented in accordance with the special precautions for cancer populations. Patients will be supervised for up to 3 weeks by an Exercise Physiologists to ensure correct exercise technique and intensity are achieved. Following this, patients will complete the final weeks of home-based physical activity on their own with reference to exercise booklets and DVDs, plus follow-up weekly phone calls and occasional visits during the intervention.  A second group of participants will be placed on a waitlist and will complete the same home-based physical activity program following treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active; waitlist group. Will commence the home-based program for 10 weeks, at 3 months post-treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Composition assessed using Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during treatment (time point to be determined by pilot testing), post-transplant and 3 months post-transplant. (Treatment duration for high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is completely dependent upon the individual patients response to treatment. For example, if the patient responds well to chemotherapy, they may have a shorter duration of treatment compared to a patient who is slower to respond. Therefore specific 'weeks' of treatment cannot be given as it is variable. Follow-up testing for each patient will occur when they have a transplant and 3 months after that time.)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aerobic fitness will be assessed using an incremental exercise protocol on a cycle ergometer (Varberg, Sweden) used previously in a similar population (Courneya et al. 2003). Participants will perform continuous and incremental 2-minute workloads at 60 rpm until the criteria for peak oxygen consumption is reached. The initial power output of the exercise task will be 30 W and each subsequent power output will be increased by 15 W. Peak oxygen consumption will be determined by the highest minute value for oxygen recorded at the end of the test. Heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood pressure assessments will be obtained at the end of each workload.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during treatment (time point to be determined by pilot testing), post-transplant and 3 months post-transplant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G) scale, in addition to the SF-36.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during treatment (time point to be determined by pilot testing), post-transplant and 3 months post-transplant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All pertinent medical records will be obtained from the treating staff at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in order to obtain clinical measures of blood markers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during treatment (time point to be determined by pilot testing), post-transplant and 3 months post-transplant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dynamic muscular strength is assessed by determining the weight for a 1 repetition maximum (RM) effort while doing a resistance exercise, however regression equations have been developed to estimate 1RM from a multiple repetition test making the testing safer for deconditioned participants. Participants will perform 10 repetitions of a given exercise lifting the heaviest weight they can whilst maintaining good exercise technique.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, during treatment (time point to be determined by pilot testing), post-transplant and 3 months post-transplant.</timepoint>

      <outcome>The Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS) will be used to measure symptom distress in participants.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prospect of surviving cancer has improved over the past two decades and strategies to enhance survival are now a priority of research. This research aims to investigate the possible deleterious effects of high dose chemotherapy (HDC) and autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT), and assess the efficacy of a home-based physical activity program implemented during treatment in patients with lymphoma treated with HDC and ASCT, on the physiological and psychosocial outcomes that can possibly negatively impact the health status of patients. Outcome measures will include aerobic fitness, body composition, quality of life, blood markers, strength, physical activity levels, fatigue and symptom distress, which are currently not well understood in this population. Aims; 1. To assess the level of physiological and psychosocial deterioration up to three months post-chemotherapy as a result of HDC and ASCT as treatment for lymphoma. 2. To assess the efficacy of a home-based physical activity program completed during treatment compared to waitlisted participants on physiological and psychosocial deterioration as a result of HDC and ASCT as treatment for lymphoma. 3. To provide guidelines for future exercise interventions in patients with lymphoma treated with HDC and ASCT.</summary>
