  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will be conducted over 5 days. On day one, participants citric acid and UNDW cough thresholds will be obtained. Citric acid cough threshold will be obtained by exposing participants to incrementally increasing concentrations of citric acid (ranging from 0.01 mol/L  1.2mol/L), based on the protocol by Monroe et al. (2014). Cough threshold is defined as the lowest concentration of citric acid capable of eliciting a C2 cough response. (Monroe et al, 2014). 
UNDW cough threshold is defined as the lowest concentration (nebuliser flow rate) capable of eliciting at least one cough across two distinct trials, separated by 30 minutes. The UNDW cough threshold protocol is based on Fontana, Pantaelo, Lavorini, Maluccio, et al. (1999). In this study, the nebuliser range was 0.08-4.45 ml/min and the nebuliser output was adjusted in steps corresponding to 5% of the max attainable direct current (DC) output. Participant will be exposed to the UNDW for 1 minute at each flow rate until they cough.

Following phase one, participants will be randomly assigned to a supra-threshold group (with an UNDW flow rate 1.6 times above the participants cough threshold) or a sub-threshold group (with an UNDW flow rate of 1.6 times below the participants cough threshold). These values were based on a study by Fontana, Pantaelo, Lavorini, Maluccio, et al. (1999). A no-treatment control group will also be included. Repeated rapid stimulation of UNDW, in 4 minute cycles of 10 sec on, 30 sec off x 6 times (totalling 1 minute of direct UNDW stimulation per cycle), will be used to stimulate and enhance the cough reflex. These 4 minute cycles will be repeated 12 times per session. Between each cycle, there will be a 5-6 minute break during which respiratory measures will be taken. Sessions will occur twice daily for 4 days. 

Comparisons between these groups will determine the optimal and safest stimulation parameters to enhance the cough reflex. Outcome measures will include pre-treatment, mid-treatment (3 days) and post-treatment (5 days) citric acid cough reflex threshold testing. Respiratory measures (spirometry and forced expiratory volume in 1 second) will be taken throughout and in between stimulation to ensure the safety of the protocol.

    <statisticalmethods>As this is the first study of its kind to explore the potential for cough reflex rehabilitation, there is no published research available to provide appropriate data to support sample size calculation. 24 participants will be recruited to the study, with 8 participants assigned to each group, as recommended by the respiratory physiology team. This will enable the research team to evaluate the presence and size of an effect and ensure the safety of the protocol on healthy individuals. Following the results of this initial pilot study, an accurate sample size calculation will be performed for subsequent studies using the same methodology.

Data Analysis:
Outcome measures will include citric acid cough reflex thresholds, taken on day 1, prior to the treatment protocol and day 3, three and day 5, following the treatment protocol.
Data analysis will involve comparing the citric acid cough reflex threshold at three time points (independent variables) (1) baseline, (2) mid treatment and (3) post treatment, for all participants. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to evaluate whether a statistically significant difference in citric acid cough reflex thresholds exists between any of the groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: This project seeks to answer the clinical question of whether it is possible to rehabilitate the cough reflex. Dysphagia refers to disordered swallowing, the nature of which can be neurological, structural (due to injury or cancer), or developmental. Patients with dysphagia are at high risk of dystussia (impairment of the cough reflex), which is unsurprising given the close association of the neural, anatomical and physiological mechanisms involved in both reflexes. Coughing serves as a vital airway protective mechanism, and is of particular importance for patients with dysphagia, for which
aspiration (when food/liquid enters the airway below the vocal cords) frequently occurs. In the absence of an intact cough reflex, these patients are at risk of silent aspiration (aspiration in the absence of triggering a cough reflex) and aspiration pneumonia (lung infection from inhalation of food/liquids) and are generally considered unsafe for oral intake. Both the sensory and motor components of the cough reflex can be impaired. The citric acid cough reflex test (CRT) is a reliable, objective, clinically applicable assessment of cough sensitivity that enables clinicians to identify patients at risk of silent aspiration with high sensitivity and specificity (Miles et al, 2013; Miles &amp; Huckabee, 2013, Miles et al, 2014). The introduction of a CRT protocol for acute stroke patients in Christchurch Hospital alone reduced the prevalence of aspiration pneumonia from 26% to 11%, with estimated savings of $1.4 million [press release - Retrieved from
http://www.cdhb.health.nz/News/Media-Releases/Pages/Outstanding-Quality-Improvement-
Innovation-Awards.aspx)]. While clinicians can now identify patients with an absent or impaired cough reflex at bedside, there are currently no treatments available for them. Many patients are placed on non-oral methods of feeding and are not prescribed swallowing rehabilitation exercises to promote their recovery, due to their high risk of aspiration and pulmonary system compromise. Successful rehabilitation of the cough reflex would offer patients the opportunity to engage in swallowing rehabilitation while maintaining adequate airway protection. It would also offer clinicians the opportunity to assume an active rehabilitation role.
Objectives: This aim of this study is to determine the optimal parameters to safely enhance cough reflex sensitivity (as measured by citric acid cough reflex threshold) in healthy individuals, using ultrasonically nebulised distilled water (UNDW), which is a known tussigenic agent currently used in cough challenge tests.</summary>
