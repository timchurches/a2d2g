    <summary>This study comprises of a dose-escalation and dose expansion phase and will determine the
      maximum tolerated dose of oral Panobinostat on a continuous schedule in adult in combination
      with bortezomib. Safety, tolerability, PK and PD profile of the combined treatments will be
      assessed as secondary objectives. Dose expansion phase will explore in a non continuous
      Panobinostat schedule with bortezomib and dexamethasone, safety and tolerability and PK
      profile of Panobinostat and Bortezomib with and without Dexamethasone</summary>
