  <interventions>
    <interventions>Around 80 adult patients undergoing surgery for fractured neck of femur during the 3 month study period will be chosen for. observation. They will have their temperature measured by tympanic thermometer at different time points from their arrival at operating theatre until they reach the post anaesthesia care unit following their surgery. The temperatures will be measured in the holding bay, operating theatre and in the post anaesthesia care unit. Temperatures on arrival and departure from each station will be recorded along with details of patient, surgery and anaesthesia as per the audit form. The warming methods currently practised in the operating theatre will not be interfered with. A note will be made of the warming measures utilized perioperatively. Length of stay in the recovery room will be recorded. Tympanic thermometer will be used for the study. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For hypothermic subjects, a temperature difference of 0.2 degree celsius between any time point is considered clinically significant. Hypothermia is defined as temperature &lt; 36 degree Celsius. Prevalence of hypothermia will be calculated at different time points based on the formula: (n with hypothermia/sample n) x 100%. 
Sample size was estimated based on expected medium effect size (0.5), using Cohens convention values. An a level of 0.05 was selected, with a power level of 0.80. Based on the subjects acting as their own controls, these values determined the sample size estimate of n = 63.  With 20% loss, the number of patients recruited is planned  be 75.
Data analysis will be performed using SPSS (version 21) and will use descriptive statistics to summarise demographic and baseline patient characteristics of the sample. Continuous variables (i.e. time-based temperatures) will be summarised with means, standard deviations, with confidence intervals set at 95%. Within group differences will be examined using parametric tests of difference (T-test, ANOVA; provided distribution assumptions are met) i.e. mean differences in outcome measures (temperature) between groups at different time points. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to investigate differences (in temperature) over time.  Differences in length of stay in the recovery room will be examined using t-test, to compare differences at different temperature-change cut-off points. Significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Unintended perioperative hypothermia, defined as a core body temperature less than 36 degree celsius is not uncommon in elderly surgical patient. In the operating theatre, a combination of altered thermoregulatory mechanisms induced by anaesthesia and cooler ambient temperatures cause a decrease in core temperature.Unintended perioperative hypothermia can result in increased complications such increased surgical site infection,  adverse cardiovascular events, delayed recovery from anaesthesia, increased surgical bleeding, impaired immune function, prolonged recovery room stay and hospitalization and increased costs. Different modalities of warming patients have been suggested such as forced air warmers or Bair Huggers, warming intravenous fluids, pre-warming patients from 30 minutes before surgery, warmed cotton blankets, but on many occasions, they have not been very effectively used resulting in unintended hypothermia. Elderly patients are more prone to hypothermia because of increase in frailty, comorbidities, impaired thermoregulation with age. In the current study, we aim to study the changes to the body temperature in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery through the perioperative course .</summary>
