  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5-year Relapse-free Survival Rate - Relapse-free survival (RFS) was defined as time from randomization to disease relapse or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients without disease relapse were censored at last disease assessment date known of free of relapse. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 5-year RFS rate in the intent-to-treat (ITT) patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>assessed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5-year Overall Survival Rate - Overall survival (OS) was defined as time from randomization to death from any cause. Patients still alive were censored at last known alive date. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate 5-year OS rate in the ITT patients.</outcome>

    <summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not yet known
      whether treatment with interferon alfa is more effective than observation alone for stage II
      or stage III melanoma that has been completely removed surgically.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high dose interferon alfa to see how
      well it works compared to observation only in treating patients with stage II or stage III
      melanoma that has been completely removed by surgery.</summary>
