Total and phospho-AMPK will be determined by Western Blot analysis.
Total and phospho-CTRC2 will be determined by Western Blot analysis.
Immunochemistry will be conducted to ascertain the subcellular localization of the CTRC2</outcome>

  <trial_design>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women will be randomized to receive either 1500mg of metformin daily or no treatment. Randomization will be stratified by body mass index( BMI) to ensure that the numbers of women with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 and those with a body mass index (BMI )&gt; 30 are balanced in the two arms of the study. Two balanced randomization lists each containing 60 numbers have been generated for this study. List number 1 contains the numbers 1-60 (for women with a body mass index (BMI) &lt;30) and list 2 the numbers 61-120 (for women with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30). Participants who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a study number in consecutive order (a number between 1 and 60 for women with a body mass index (BMI) &lt; 30 and numbers 61-120 for women with a body mass index ( BMI)&gt;30). In order to maintain allocation concealment, a piece of paper with the group allocation (metformin or no treatment) assigned to each study number in the randomization list will be put into opaque envelopes numbered consecutively 1- 120. Randomization will occur when the envelope with the patientâ€™s study number on it is opened.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effect of metformin on breast tissue in well women intending to undergo reduction mammoplasty. There is an interest in the possibility that metformin could decrease breast cancer incidence or cancer related deaths. Our proposed research is to examine the effects of metformin treatment on LKB1 expression and activity, AMPK phosphorylation and CRTC2 phosphorylation and translocation, as tissue in vivo and to explore relationships between identified cellular effects with serum indicators of insulin resistance.</summary>
