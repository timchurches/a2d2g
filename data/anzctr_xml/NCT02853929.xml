    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the Infanrix hexa
      booster dose given at 11-18 months of age to infants who received primary vaccination at 6-14
      weeks. All infants in this booster study were born to pregnant women who participated in the
      study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] and having received the full primary vaccination series as
      per protocol requirement in study 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048.</summary>
