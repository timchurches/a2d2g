  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study looking at disease control and joint structure preservation in people with Rheumatoid Arthritis treated with non-biologic agents and Adalimumab. This involves a descriptive comparism of MRI features using RAMRIS scores in participants with varying degrees of disease control taking adalimumab and conventional DMARD therapy in a cross sectional analysis. A second longitudinal analysis will be performed assessing plain radiographs of hands and feet with a conventional radiological scoring system and correlated with the baseline MRI appearances. There are 7 study visits over an 18 months period.</interventions>

      <outcome>To assess the impact of disease control on MRI manifestations and joint structure preservation in Rheumaotid Arthritis (RA) patients treated with Adalimumab and non-biological agents.
This involves a descriptive comparism of MRI features using RAMRIS scores in participants with varying degrees of disease control taking adalimumab and conventional DMARD therapy in a cross sectional analysis. A second longitudinal analysis will be performed assessing plain radiographs of hands and feet with a conventional radiological scoring system and correlated with the baseline MRI appearances. Clincial assessments ae scheduled every 3 months. Routine blood samples will be analysed including inflammatory markers. A joint assessment will be performed and patient assessment of disease activity recorded in order to calculate the DAS28 score. This score is used as a measure of disease activity. There are 7 study visits over an 18 months period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study duration is 18 months. Assessment every 3 months.

Total of 7 study visits over 18 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To correlate baseline MRI features with subsequent radiological progression as assessed by plain radiographs.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease which when left untreated leads to long term joint damage, loss of function and a reduced life expectancy. There is evidence that by treating RA early with combination therapies the damage to the joints may be much less and function preserved. Following on from this observation, many rheumatologists think aiming for a specific end point to prevent progressive joint damage should be introduced. However, new TNF agents such as Adalimumab seem to protect against damage more than do conventional therapies even when signs and symptoms of arthritis are equally controlled. The explanation for this is unclear and needs to be explored further.</summary>
