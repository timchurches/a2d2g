  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single intradermal injection of 0.1 ml of sterile water to the most painful point, or central to the most painful area of backpain as indicated by the woman. The injection is administered when  the woman descibes the backpain during any stage of labour, as being equal to or greater than seven on a Visual analogue Scale (VAS).</interventions>
    <comparator>Four intradermal injections of 0.1 ml of sterile water to the skin surrounding the Michaelis rhomboid. The injections are administered when  the woman descibes the backpain during any stage of labour, as being equal to or greater than seven on a Visual analogue Scale (VAS). The four injections are administered during a single contraction, by two midwives.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to see if the single sterile water injection technique is as effective as the standard four injection technique in relieving  lower back pain during labour and birth. If the difference in pain relief between the two techniques, thirty minutes after injection(s) is no greater or less than 1 centremeter on the VAS, the trial will have proven it's hypothesis</summary>
