    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Enteral feeding formula

Other: Standard Therapy Group - Standard therapy group. Will receive high carbohydrate, low fat enteral feeding, (16.7% protein, 30% fat and 53.3% carbohydrate). The target rate is determined by the treating physician and dietician, for a minimum of 5 days following randomisation.

Other: Alternative Therapy Group - 2.Alternative therapy group will receive high-fat, low carbohydrate enteral feeding, (16.7% protein, 55.2% fat and 28.1% carbohydrates. At a target rate determined by the treating physician and dietician, for a maximum of 5 days following randomisation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of different feeding solutions on patients
      with breathing difficulty being supported by a breathing machine.

      The aim of the study is to determine if high fat-low carbohydrate feeding reduces the carbon
      dioxide production in patients with respiratory failure.</summary>
