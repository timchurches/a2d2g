    <interventions>Specific Balance Strategy Exercise Program.  Subjects in the intervention group will attend a one hour twice-weekly specific balance-strategy training program for 12 weeks.  The program will be delivered using work-stations that target the multiple elements of balance that are integral to efficient balance and mobility.  Content of this program will include functional strength training and flexibility exercises that load trunk and lower limb muscles in all planes of movement, exercises for postural control and tasks that challenge medio-lateral stability and work participants at the limits of their stability; tasks that foster the use of ankle, hip, stepping and suspension strategies along with speed and efficient reaction times will be used. The program and tasks will be progressed by adding surface and visual challenges and by adding dual / multiple tasks.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical and laboratory balance measures
Clinical measures include functional reach (Duncan et al, 1990) measures reaching forward to the limits of stability from a bilateral stance position;lateral reach with right and left hands (Brauer et al 1999) measures reaching sideways to the limits of stability from a bilateral stance position;the functional step test with right and left foot (Hill et al 1996) measures speed of performing a dynamic standing task with the number of repeated steps on and of  a block 7.5 cm in height, in 15 seconds recorded;	timed up and go (TUG) test (Shumway-Cook et al, 2000) measures the time taken to stand up from a chair, walk three metres as quickly and safely as possible past a line on the floor, turn around, walk back to the chair and sit down with the back against the chair;	time up and go cognitive test (Shumway-Cook et al 2000) measures the time taken to complete the TUG test while the subject counts backward by three from a randomly selected number between 20 and 100;rapid stepping test (Mendall &amp; Alexander, 2000) measures the time taken to make 24 random steps as fast as possible under the tester's command;	timed tandem walk measures the time taken to complete 10 tandem steps forward, backwards and then with eyes open and closed (Fregley et al, 1968) 


Laboratory measures of postural stability will be measured by recording velocity of sway using the Balance Master force-plate system (Neurocom, Balance Master 6.0) while the protocol for the modified Clinical Test for the Sensory Integration of Balance (mCTSIB) (Shumway-Cook and Horak, 1986) and Single Limb Stance (Bohannon et al, 1984) are carried out.

Modified Clinical test for sensory integration of balance (mCTSIB) involves standing on a firm surface (eyes open, eyes closed) and then on a foam surface (eyes open, eyes closed). The test has established validity (Alhanti et al, 1997; Di Fabio et al, 1990; Cohen, 1993; Newton, 1995; Teasdale et al 1991), retest and inter-tester reliability (Liston et al, 1996) and is a valid measure of changes in postural stability across the 40 to 60 age period (Low Choy et al, 2003). The test manipulates the senses and determines reliance on vision under conditions of proprioceptive conflict.  When the propriocetpive system is challenged by standing on a high-density foam pad with eyes closed, the vestibular system assists to resolve this conflict and maintain postural stability.  When the vestibular system is inefficient, increased postural sway and/or a fall may result. 
 
Single limb stance test (Bohannon et al, 1984, Newton 1989) with right foot with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC);left foot with EO and EC
This test challenges balance with the narrower base of support condition and with the removal of vision, reveals those subject reliant on vision for balance. This test is important to include as the single limb stance test has been shown to be an important predictor of injurious (serious) falls in older people (Vellas et al, 1997).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 3 months, 9 months and 24 months after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measures of somatosensory function:-	Tactile acuity: Monofilaments of set sizes (1-7) will be applied to the ankle, heel and big toe to determine threshold sensation. The size of the monofilament at threshold sensation will be recorded. 
-	Vibration sense: An electronic vibration sense unit, vibrating at 200 Hz will be applied to tibial tuberosity to determine threshold vibration perception. The vibration amplitude at threshold perception will be recorded.
-	Joint position sense: The difference in big toe position (degrees) will be determined by asking subjects to match the big toe position either side of a large, Perspex protractor.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measures of muscle: strength and length
Tests of strength will be measured using a spring gauge which will be applied at 90 degrees to the quadriceps and hip external rotators in sitting and the hip adductor and abductor muscles in supine lying.  

- Measure of Ankle Flexibility (weight-bearing dorsiflexion) 
Test of ankle flexibility will be measured using the knee-to-wall principle with a tape measure.  The participant stand in front of a wall with the test foot's second toe and midline of the hell and knee maintained in a plane perpendicular to the wall.  The participant slowly lunged forward into talocrural dorsiflexion until the knee contacted the wall and progressively move the foot back to the point where the knee could just touch the wall with the hell sustained on the ground.</outcome>

      <outcome>Habitual activity level will be rated using a self report method which offers categories for exercise across a six point scale according the frequency and intensity of activity regularly undertaken (Hirvensalo et al, 2000).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine whether a specific balance strategy training program is an effective form of exercise for healthy, but less active women aged between 40 to 60 years that can control the rate of decline in balance and sensori-motor function across the menopause transition. Whether participation leads to adoption of more active lifestyle will also be observed.  A similar though not quite as challenging evidence based program that targeted the multiple elements of balance has been shown to be effective in older adults. This study will determine if undertaken during the pre-clinical period of balance decline it helps to prevent/reverse the detrimental balance decline that occurs in women during the menopause transition.  Should the participants sustain the level of activity post- intervention a safer, healthier lifestyle is likely to ensue evidenced by enhanced self-perceived health status, reduction in fall rate and increased cardiovascular fitness. The study will also look at factors associated with compliance and motivation with uptake of exercise to develop more effective strategies for implementation of programs that are attractive and beneficial for this age group.</summary>
