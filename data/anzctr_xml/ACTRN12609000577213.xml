  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will receive a single oral dose of BNC210. The dose  will be administered as a suspension in 10 mL of vehicle. The starting dose will be 5 mg, with 3-fold escalations up to 150 mg, which will be doses of 5, 15 and 50 mg and 150 mg, then 2 fold escalations  thereafter with doses of 300, 600 and 1200 mg.</interventions>
    <comparator>placebo - the placebo will be 10 mL of the liquid vehicle minus the active ingredient and will be taken as a single oral dose</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetics of single doses of BNC210. Plasma and urine samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic assessment. The samples will be assayed by a validated Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) method which is specific for the determination of BNC210</outcome>
      <timepoint>from baseline to 32 hours post dose</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the clinical tolerability of single doses of BNC210. This will be assessed using scheduled adverse event probes, spontaneous adverse event reporting, physical examination, routine laboratory investigations, Electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital sign evaluations plus clinical chemistry analysis (haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis)</outcome>
      <timepoint>from baseline to 8 days (+/- 3 days ) post dosing</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effects of BNC210 on neurological and psychiatric symptoms using Bond and Lader visual analogue scales.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from baseline to 32 hours post dose</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify a dose range to be used in subsequent trials.</outcome>
      <timepoint>from baseline to 8 days (+/- 3 days ) post dosing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

2.	Have a laboratory value at the Screening Visit that is outside the normal range, unless it is judged by the Investigator as not clinically significant after appropriate evaluation.
3.	A score of more than two standard deviations from the mean on any of the key nine scales in the SCL-90-R (registered trademark) 
4.	Any medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator may adversely impact on the participants ability to complete the study.

17.	Smoke &gt;5 cigarettes per day.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be entered into the study sequentially and will be randomly allocated to active drug or placebo using a randomisation table created by computer software. In order to maintain the blinding of subject treatment assignments all study site personnel (with the exception of the Pharmacist or designee who is responsible for preparing the study treatment) will be blinded to treatment assignment.  All study site personnel performing subject assessments will not be informed of the subjectâ€™s treatment assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation -an electronically generated randomisation code created by computer software which will be supplied to the sponsor-contracted pharmacist by the CRO. The pharmacist will number the drug doses so that the allocation of subjects to placebo or active dose will be concealed from the clinical trial site personnel</sequence>

    <summary>This is a phase I trial to assess the safety and tolerability of a new anti-anxiety drug over a wide range of doses. This will enable doses, that are safe and produce good levels of drug in the body, to be selected for further studies in which measurement of anti-anxiety activity may be done.</summary>
