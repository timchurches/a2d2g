  <interventions>
    <interventions>High intensity progressive resistance and impact loading exercise program (HiRIT)
- Two training sessions of 30-40 minutes per week on non-consecutive days for 8 months 
- Group exercise program with a maximum of 8 participants per class and trainer, led by an experienced instructor (the instructor is either an exercise scientist trained in power lifting or an exercise physiologist)
- The program consists of three weight lifting exercises, one impact exercise and two balance exercises that vary each session
- Load and intensity of the lifting and impact exercise will be gradually and individually increased
- Five sets of five repetitions at 80-85% 1RM will be performed for each of the three lifting exercises

- The classes will take place at The Bone Clinic, Coorparoo, Brisbane, QLD 
- Adherence will be assessed by the instructor and the study participants. Participants will be given an exercise diary to report the sessions attended, weights lifted, any muscle soreness, injuries, falls and changes in medication.  The latter details will also be reported verbally to the investigators. 

- 50% of the participants will be on antiresorptive bone medication. Participants will be block randomized based on presence or absence of bone medication intake. 


</interventions>
    <comparator>Pilates program
- Two training sessions of 30-40 minutes per week on non-consecutive days for 8 months 
- Group exercise program with a maximum of 8 participants per class and trainer, led by an experienced instructor (certified Pilates instructor)
- The program consists of mat-based Pilates exercises.
- Adherence will be assessed by the instructor and the study participants. Participants will be given an exercise diary to report the sessions attended, any muscle soreness, injuries, falls and changes in medication.  The latter details will also be reported verbally to the investigators. 

- 50% of the participants will be on antiresorptive bone medication. Participants will be block randomized based on presence or absence of bone medication intake. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination: 
A total of 160 (n=40 in each group) postmenopausal women will be recruited. The sample size calculation was based on the LIFTMOR trial, a previous study which examined the effect of the same HiRIT program on bone health in postmenopausal women. 
With a sample size of 160 women we will have 80% power to detect changes in hip BMD and &gt;99% power to detect changes in lumbar spine BMD. 
Sample size calculations were conducted using an online calculator (https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/stats/ssize/n2.html).

Statistical analysis: 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS statistical software. In all analyses a p-value of 0.05 (two-sided) will be considered a threshold for statistical significance. 
Descriptive analyses will be run for participant characteristics and biometrics. Repeated measures ANCOVA will be conducted to examine treatment effects on all outcome variables adjusting for any variables that differ between groups at baseline.  Intention-to-treat analyses will be conducted along with per-protocol analyses to examine specific outcomes of participants completing the full 8 months of training with at least 80% compliance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoporosis is a condition of greatly increased risk of low trauma fracture.  Certain medications and exercises have been shown to increase bone density and decrease fracture risk. The additive effect of those two interventions might yield greater benefits as they have distinct individual effects. While osteoporosis medication has been shown to increase bone mass and reduce fracture, exercise improves bone, muscle and balance thereby reducing falls. 
This study will determine the independent and combined effect of exercise and bone medication on bone health in postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporosis. It will also compare the efficacy of two different exercise programs  a resistance and impact training program (HiRIT) and a Pilates exercise program. </summary>
