  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of use in humans of the
      TAXUS Petal Paclitaxel-Eluting Bifurcation Coronary Stent System in the treatment of de novo
      lesions in native coronary arteries involving a major side branch. The TAXUS® Petal is an
      investigational device with an indication of improving coronary artery luminal diameter while
      maintaining side branch access in subjects with symptomatic ischemic disease due to discrete
      atherosclerotic bifurcation lesions</summary>
