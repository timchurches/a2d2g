  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be prevalence of malaria and anemia in under-five children and pregnant women. Mass blood investigation for all under-five children and pregnant women is being done in the selected Gots  three times a year.

    <concealment>Villages (Gots) in Gilgel Gibe  field research centre were stratified into North and South in relation to the reservoir of Gilgel Gibe hydroelecteric dam. Gots in the north direction of the reservoir were selected randomly as intervention whereas  villages in the South direction of the dam were selected to be control groups and both groups are within the same distance (15 Km) from the reservoir. For this trail, 22 Gots (11 interventions and 11 controls) were included. All households, under-five chilren and pregnant women in the selected 
Gots were involved in the study. Since, the study is community triat, it was the Gots/villages which were allocated into treatment and control villages centrally using computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Efforts devoted to understanding the biology of the malaria parasite and mosquito vector in the past 2 decades have resulted in new and improved tools against malaria. However, there is paucity of researches on human behavior regarding the proper use of Insecticide Treated Nets to prevent malaria in vulnerable groups (under-five children and pregnant mothers). This study assesses the effect of training of heads of the households and subsequent follow up for use of Insecticide Treated Nets  and integrated community network system on the burden of malaria. The study will employ randomized community trial to be conducted in Gilgel Gibe Field Research Center, Southwest Ethiopia. To avoid the effect of contamination, villages in the field research center were stratified into North and South in relation to the reservoir of the dam. One of the directions will be selected as intervention site by simple random sampling technique. A total of 22 Gotes (11 in the intervention and 11 in the control) were included in the study. Control and intervention villages will have similar distance(15 K.m)  from the reservoir of the dam. 
Baseline survey on socio-economic status; knowledge, perception and use of Insecticide Treated Nets  and prevalence of malaria in under-five children and pregnant women will be undertaken in both the intervention and control group. The study will be conducted for 3 years (Feb 2009 - Dec 2011). The intervention consists of training of the heads of the households about the proper use of Insecticide Treated Nets  for vulnerable groups and establishing community network system that makes the training sustainable. Tailored training and demonstration about use of Insecticide Treated Nets  will be given to the heads of the households by community leaders using local language. Information Education communication materials e.g. training manuals, pamphlets and posters will be prepared by local language. After training, there will be monitoring of use of Insecticide Treated Nets  in each household in the intervention village. The community leaders and community health agents will use checklist to assess the proper use of Insecticide Treated Nets  in each house. At the end of the intervention, proper use of Insecticide Treated Nets  and burden of malaria in under-five children and pregnant women will be assessed in both the intervention and control villages. Data will be entered into computer, edited, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS-12 statistical soft ware. Descriptive statistics will be done to measure the burden of malaria and the use of Insecticide Treated Nets . Multivariate logistic regression technique supported by qualitative findings will be done to assess the effect of the intervention while controlling confounding variables. There is a possibility of hampering the training activities during sowing and harvesting season where training will be planned in consultation with the community. Proper and sustainable use of Insecticide Treated Nets  and reduced incidence of malaria is the expected outcomes of the study</summary>
