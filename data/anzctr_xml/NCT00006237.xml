Active Comparator: Arm I - Patients receive interferon alfa IV on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4 followed by interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5 of weeks 5-52 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Experimental: Arm II - Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by vinblastine IV on days 1-4.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. It is
      not yet known whether interferon alfa is more effective with or without combination
      chemotherapy and interleukin-2 for melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or
      without combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, plus
      interleukin-2, in treating patients who have melanoma.</summary>
