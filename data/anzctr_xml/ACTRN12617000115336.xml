  <interventions>
    <interventions>One target muscle group will be selected on one side of the body from the following muscles: the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, wrist flexors, wrist extensors, knee flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors or ankle plantarflexors. This will be chosen by the physiotherapist in consultation with the participant.  A target muscle group in participants allocated to the Treatment group will be trained once a day, six times a week for 8 weeks. The sessions will be supervised in the hospital or rehabilitation centre at which the participant is an inpatient.  Training on five of the days will be supervised by a qualified therapist, while the other day will be supervised by a family member/carer where possible or a qualified therapist if they are available.  Participants will aim to perform 200 repeat contractions of the target muscle group during each session, and this will be completed within a 30-minute time frame.  
The strength training will be progressed as possible.  Initially, participants who are very weak and unable to move through a full range of motion (ROM) with gravity eliminated will be encouraged to focus on increasing their ROM during the 200 contractions. Once a participant can readily move 200 times through a full ROM with gravity eliminated, they will be required to move against gravity. Again, initially they will focus on attaining full ROM against gravity during all 200 contractions.  Once participants can move 200 times through full ROM against gravity then resistance will be slowly introduced. In addition, participants will also continue to receive usual care (see Control group). The details of the training provided to participants will be recorded by the therapist in a training diary. </interventions>
    <comparator>All participants in the Control group will continue to receive usual care. This will involve training for activities of daily living as considered necessary by the patient and their treating therapist (e.g. training to transfer). Participants will also receive any type of strength training program deemed appropriate by their treating therapist to all muscles with the exception of the target muscle group. The target muscle group can receive up to two sessions per week of progressive resistance training if this is thought to be appropriate by the treating physiotherapist. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle strength: Muscle strength will be measured using the Manual Muscle Test on a 13-point scale. This scale is adapted from the traditional 0 to 5-point Manual Muscle Test but utilises pluses and minuses. </outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants perceptions of strength: At the completion of the trial participants will be asked to rate their impressions of change in strength of the target muscle group on a 15-point scale where -7 indicates a very great deal worse, 0 indicates no change and +7 indicates a very great deal better. </outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants perceptions of function: At the completion of the trial participants will be asked to rate their impressions of change in their ability to use the target muscle group for functional activities on a 15-point scale where -7 indicates a very great deal worse, 0 indicates no change and +7 indicates a very great deal better for each muscle group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Therapists expectation of final strength: Prior to the baseline assessment, the treating therapist will be asked to estimate how much the target muscle will improve in strength over the study period. Specifically, the therapist will be asked to estimate the grade that they expect the target muscle to be at the end of the 8-week study period (on a 13-point manual muscle test). This prediction will be used to calculate the difference between predicted and actual muscle strength at 8-weeks.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will occur via sealed opaque envelopes which will be sequentially numbered and held by an independent person at an off-site location.  Initially, physiotherapists from the Spinal Cord Injury Units will ask suitable inpatients if they are interested in participating. Interested participants will then be visited by the site investigator who will undertake a pre-screening assessment. If the participant meets the inclusion criteria, he/she will be invited to participate and provide consent.    Once the baseline assessments of the participant has been completed, trial staff will contact the independent person, who will open the next envelope and reveal the group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A secure random-allocation schedule will be computer-generated prior to commencement of the trial by an independent person and kept at a central off-site location. The randomisation schedule will be blocked (1:1) and stratified (by site) using small permuted blocks to ensure equal (or near equal) numbers of participants are randomised to the treatment and control condition at each site (provided the last block is completed). . </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An important goal of physiotherapy for people with spinal cord injuries is to increase strength. In those who are very weak (with muscle groups of less than grade 3 strength), physiotherapists tend to rely on repetitious contractions to increase strength. This is based on theories about neural plasticity and the need for repeated movement to prompt neural recovery.  Despite the widespread use of repetitious contractions to increase strength in very weak muscles, it is not known whether this is an effective training paradigm.

The trial will be a pragmatic multi-centre, assessor-blinded between participant randomised controlled trial. The aim of our project is to determine the best way of providing physiotherapy treatment, specifically to compare the therapeutic benefits of repetitious practise with usual care, to usual care alone to increase strength in very weak partially-paralysed muscles of people with recent spinal cord injury. 

One target muscle group with less than grade 3 strength will be selected on one side of the body from the following muscles: the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, wrist flexors, wrist extensors, knee flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsiflexors or ankle plantarflexors.   Eligible participants will be randomised to either the Treatment group or the Control group.  Participants allocated to the Treatment group will do 200 repetitions of isolated contractions of the target muscle on one side of their body as well as usual care.  Participants allocated to the Control group will receive usual care alone.  The intervention will be provided for 8 weeks.  All outcomes will be collected at baseline and at 8 weeks.</summary>
