Change from baseline at each visit was analyzed for Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain. The Week 16 visit (follow-up) was designed for safety rather than efficacy, thus Week 16 Patient's Assessment of Arthritis Pain data were collected, but not analyzed.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis Pain at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 - Subjects answered: "Considering all the ways your arthritis affects you, how are you feeling today?" Subjects responded by using a 0 - 100 mm VAS where 0=very well and 100=very poorly. Change from baseline at each visit was analyzed for Patient's Global Assessment. The Week 16 visit (follow-up) was designed for safety rather than efficacy, thus Week 16 Patient's Global Assessment of Arthritis Pain data were collected, but not analyzed.</outcome>

Response recorded using 5-point scale: 1=Very Good, 2=Good, 3=Fair, 4=Poor and 5=Very Poor. Change from baseline at each visit was analyzed for Physician's Global Assessment. The Week 16 visit (follow-up) was designed for safety rather than efficacy thus Week 16 Physician's Global Assessment of Arthritis Pain data were collected but not analyzed.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 - HAQ-DI assesses degree of difficulty experienced in daily activity categories (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and other activities) over the past week. There are 20 questions and difficulty is scored from 0 (none), 1 (some), 2 (much) and 3 (unable to do). Scores were then averaged to give the disability index (scale of 0 to 3). Change from baseline at each visit was analyzed. The Week 16 visit (follow-up) was designed for safety rather than efficacy, thus Week 16 HAQ-DI data were collected but not analyzed.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Using CRP (DAS28-4[CRP]) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 - DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated using the following formula:
DAS28- 4(CRP) = 0.56 v28 Tender Joint Count + 0.28 v28 Swollen Joint Count + 0.36*natural logarithm(CRP + 1) + 0.014*Patient Global Assessment + 0.96. DAS28 provides a number on a scale (0 to 10) indicating current disease activity. A score above 5.1 means high disease activity and a score below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Change from baseline at each visit was analyzed for DAS28-4 (CRP). The Week 16 visit (follow-up) was designed for safety rather than efficacy, thus Week 16 DAS28-4 (CRP) data were collected, but not analyzed.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mean Orthostatic Blood Pressure (BP) - Supine BP was recorded after 5 minutes lying down; subjects then sat for 2 minutes then stood for 2 minutes and standing BP was recorded. Orthostatic BP = either a systolic BP drop &gt; 20 mmHg, or diastolic BP drop &gt; 10 mmHg and/or drop in systolic BP &lt; 90 mmHg. If a subject met the orthostatic criteria, they were required to complete 2 additional readings to provide a triplicate reading. The means of replicate BP values were used in the analysis. Baseline = the latest non-missing value from a range of pre-treatment visits. Change from baseline to Week 16 was analyzed for orthostatic BP.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary at Weeks 4 and 12 - The SF-36 v.2 (Acute version) is a 36-item generic health status measure that measures 8 general health concepts: Physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Each domain of the eight domains and the summary concept (physical component score) are scored to yield values between 0 (worst) and 100 (best).
