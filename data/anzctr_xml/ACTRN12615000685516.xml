  <interventions>
    <interventions>Main objective is to study the amount variations of pulmonary water measured by simple thermodilution during the first 48 hours in the intensive care after Pulmonary endarterectomy. The PiCCO-Technology allows monitoring by a minimally invasive method, hemodynamic and volumetric parameters. PiCCO technology is based on transpulmonary thermodilution and contour analysis of the pulse wave. Data thermodilution and analysis of pulse wave are collected using a pulmonary artery catheter and a central venous catheter inserted into the jugular position operating room. A first series of thermodilutions transpulmonary is formed by injection on a center line of the right jugular, three boluses of 15 ml of cold physiological saline solution at 4 degrees Celsius temperature. If there was a difference in cardiac output value of more than 20% between thermodilutions two other thermodilutions are performed. The measured values are the average of three thermodilutions and the extreme values are removed. They also show the values of volumes and analysis of the pulse wave intra-thoracic. Data is collected once a day, an hour after the patient arrival in intensive care unit, and 24 and 48 hours after surgery.

    <comparator>Patients were divided according to pulmonary vascular resistance values as severe Chronic thrombo-embolic pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance &gt; 11.25 UW) or non-severe (pulmonary vascular resistance less or equal to 11.25 UW). All patients in both groups underwent pulmonary endarterectomy. No changes in technique or medical management occurred during the study period.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The comparison of the impact or value judgment criteria between the two groups of patients will be analyzed using conventional methods. Categorical variables will be interpreted using a X2 test, comparing the average with a Student t test.
Univariate analysis factors associated with an amount of lung water&gt; 10mL / kg will be carried out with a logistic regression including changes in pulmonary resistance and an analysis of the correlations between the measured values and continuous water quantity pulmonary in univariate and then the modeling aid.
On the basis of a relevant 30% increase in ELW in patients with severe CTEPH compared with patients without severe CTEPH, we calculated that 30 patients could test the null hypothesis at 0.05 significance with a power of 0.80.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most common and most serious after pulmonary endarterectomy thromboembolic (PET) complications  is edema reperfusion. Monitoring by transpulmonary thermodilution is commonly used in intensive care.
 It could allow a quantitative measurement of reperfusion edema by objective measurement and study its possible associations with the hemodynamic and ventilatory parameters.</summary>
