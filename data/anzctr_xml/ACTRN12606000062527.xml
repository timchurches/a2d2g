  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to compare the efficacy of a three-month supervised fitness centre-based exercise programme to an unsupervised home-based exercise programme in improving fitness and psychosocial functioning in a traumatic brain injured population. We aim to carry out a multi-centre, assessor blinded, randomised controlled trial with parallel group design to compare the two interventions. We hypothesize that a supervised fitness-centre based exercise programme, compared to an unsupervised home-based programme will show significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, depression and community integration.</summary>
