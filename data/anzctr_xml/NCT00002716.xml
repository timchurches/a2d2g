    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - dexamethasone
Treatment: drugs - floxuridine

Treatment: surgery - laparotomy
Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery

Experimental: Arm I - laparotomy + conventional surgery + chemotherapy - Patients undergo laparotomy for placement of a hepatic artery catheter and then subcutaneous placement of a hepatic artery infusion pump. Patients with unresected primary disease also undergo resection at the time of catheter and pump placement. Beginning within 1-2 weeks after surgery, patients receive floxuridine, dexamethasone, and leucovorin calcium (CF) via continuous hepatic artery infusion on days 1-14. Treatment for patients continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Quality of life and medical resource utilization are assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then at 18 months.
Patients are followed every 3 months.

Experimental: Arm II - conventional surgery + chemotherapy - Patients receive CF IV and fluorouracil IV on days 1-5. Patients with unresected primary disease undergo resection within 3-4 weeks before initiation of chemotherapy.
Treatment for patients continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Quality of life and medical resource utilization are assessed at baseline, every 3 months for 1 year, and then at 18 months.
Patients are followed every 3 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not
      yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective for metastatic colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of intrahepatic floxuridine,
      leucovorin, and dexamethasone with that of systemic fluorouracil and leucovorin in treating
      patients who have unresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer.</summary>
