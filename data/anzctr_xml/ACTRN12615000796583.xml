  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves the surgical replacement of the hip joint performed by an orthopaedic surgeon using  the Minihip Stem (Corin Ltd) hip prosthesis. This stem is designed as a femoral neck preserving, short prosthesis with the philosophy of bone preservation in the proximal area (metaphysis) of the femur. 
Surgical approach will be via the direct anterior approach. Approximate duration of the surgical procedure is 60-90 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention involves the surgical replacement of the hip joint performed by an orthopaedic surgeon using  the Metafix Stem (Corin Ltd) hip prosthesis. This stem is a conventional hip stem prosthesis, that does not preserve the femoral neck. Conventional hip stems are the most commonly utilised femoral prostheses and are standard of care.
Surgical approach will be via the direct anterior approach. Approximate duration of the surgical procedure is 60-90 minutes.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomly assigned to either group with a 1:1 allocation as per a computer generated randomization schedule by using permuted blocks of random sizes. The block sizes will not be disclosed, to ensure concealment. Participants will be randomized using the Interactive Voice response System provided by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Center, which is an online central randomization service. Allocation concealment will be ensured, as the service will not release the randomization code until just before the patient is going to be operated has been recruited into the trial, which takes place after all baseline measurements have been completed. The investigators will obtain this code just before the start of the surgery.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation sequence will be generated by the IVRS by the NHMRC-CTC applying a permuted block design with random blocks stratified by age. The randomization list remains with them for the whole duration of the study. Thus, randomization will be conducted without any influence of the principal investigators.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline patient demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, other) and clinical characteristics (height, weight, BMI, ROM, leg length) will be summarised for each study arm using means and SD, or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables.

Pilot data available for 20 patients has been used to conservatively estimate the difference in horizontal femoral offset (baseline - 3 month) between the groups is 7mm, with a standard deviation of 6. Based on this information, the sample size required for this study has been calculated as 32 patients (16 patients per group) to detect a statistically significant difference in the mean difference in the horizontal femoral offset at 3 months compared to baseline (primary outcome) between the study groups using the independent t-test. Taking into account the possibility of cross-overs from the NPP arm to standard arm and drop outs we have increased the sample size estimation to 20 patients per group.
This sample size will allow us to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 0.90. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical study is a single centre, prospective, randomized, participant-blinded trial enrolling 40 patients to receive either a Cementless Neck Preserving stem or a Conventional Hip stem Prosthesis.
Neck preserving prostheses to offer a more physiological load transmission across the femur, the nature of achieving a stable press-fit means that the stem must adapt to the geometry of the bone. As patient anatomy is highly variable, there is limited ability to adjust the femoral offset, centre of rotation, femoral anteversion and leg length. It is unclear whether anatomical restoration, offered by neck preserving prostheses is comparable to conventional prostheses. The success of the neck preserving systems relies on the precise positioning and sizing of the implant and the excellent long-term durability of the ceramic bearings. 
Hence, we propose a randomized comparative study to assess and compare the anatomical head centre, gait analysis and bone remodelling of two parallel groups receiving either a Neck preserving or a Conventional hip stem prosthesis by the direct anterior approach. 
Antero-posterior and modified Budin x-rays will be analysed at preoperatively, 3 months, 12 months, 2 years and 5 years to assess femoral head offset, stem orientation and leg length.
DEXA (bone density) scans will be assessed pre-operatively and 12 months to measure femoral bone density, with the aim of assessing bone remodelling after total hip replacement.
Spatial-Temporal gait analysis will be used to quantify measurement of standard gait (6 minute walking test  6MWT) and sit-to-stand   preoperatively, 3 months and 12 months.
Standard, functional parameters will be assessed pre-operatively, 3 months, 12 months, 2 years and 5 years.
