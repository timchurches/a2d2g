      <outcome>Time to Recurrence of Mood Event During the Double Blind Treatment Phase - A mood event is defined as one of the following during the double-blind phase:
(1) Fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed., Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for manic, mixed manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. (2) Required treatment intervention for manic, mixed manic, hypomanic, or depressive symptoms with any antipsychotic (other than study drug), antidepressant, mood stabilizer (other than lithium or divalproex), anxiolytic agents, benzodiazepine (beyond dosage allowed for anxiety, agitation, or insomnia). (3) Psychiatric hospitalization for any bipolar mood episode. (4) Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) or Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score = 18 or Clinical Global Impression Bipolar Version, Severity of Illness (CGI BP S) score = 4 at 2 consecutive assessments no more than 10 days apart.

      <outcome>Change From Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOCF) in YMRS Total Score - the YMRS is an 11-item instrument used to assess the severity of mania in subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Ratings are based on patient self-reporting, combined with clinician observation (accorded greater score). The YMRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 11 items. The YMRS total score ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores are associated with greater severity of maia.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change Fro Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOCF) in QIDS-SR(16) Total Score - The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item self-report measure of depressive symptomatology which uses a computerized assessment interface for administration. The scoring system for the QIDS-SR16 converts responses to 16 separate items into nine DSM-IV symptom criterion domains. The nine domains comprise: depressed mood (Item 5); concentration/decision making (Item 10); self outlook (Item 11); suicidal ideation (Item 12); decreased interest (Item 13); decreased energy (Item 14); sleep disturbance (initial, middle, and late insomnia or hypersomnia) (highest score of Items 1 to 4); appetite/weight disturbance (highest score of Items 6 to 9); and psychomotor disturbance (highest score of Items 15 and 16). The QIDS-SR16 total score is calculated as the sum of the 9 domain scores. The QIDS-SR16 total score ranges from 0 to 27 with a high score indicating more severe symptoms.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOF) in PANSS Positive Symptom (PANNS-P) Subscale Score - The PANSS-P is a subset of items in the PANSS, an interview-based measure of the severity of psychopathology in adults with psychotic disorders. The measure contains seven questions to assess delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinations behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. An anchored Likert scale from 1-7, where values of 2 and above indicate the presence of progressively more severe symptoms, is used to score each item. The PANSS-P subscale score is the sum of the 7 items and ranges from 7 through 49. A higher score is associated with greater illness severity.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOCF) in SDS Total Score - The SDS is a composite of three self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which three major sectors in the patient's life are impaired by depressive symptoms. The SDS total score is calculated as the sum of the 3 items. The SDS total score ranges from 0 to 30. Higher scores are associated with greater severity of global functional impairments. If a subject has not worked/studied at all during the past week for reasons unrelated to the disorder, the SDS total score will be set to missing.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOCF) in PIRS-2 Total Score - The PIRS-2 is a 2-item self-report of insomnia assessed via a computer interface. Each item is scored from 0-3. The PIRS-2 total score is calculated as the sum of the 2 items. The PIRS total score ranges from 0 to 6. Higher scores are associated with greater severity of insomnia.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Double-blind Baseline to Week 28 (LOCF) in Q-LES-Q-SF Percent Maximum Possible Score - The Q-LES-Q-SF is a 16-item self-report measure of the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction in various areas of daily living. The questionnaire was developed and validated for use in depressed outpatient subjects and has eight summary scales that reflect major areas of functioning: physical health, mood, leisure time activities, social relationships, general activities, work, household duties and school/coursework. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). The Q-LES-Q-SF percentage maximum possible score is calculated as 100 Ã— (Raw Score - 14 [Minimum Score]) / (70 [Maximum Score] - 14 [Minimum Score]). Higher percent maximum scores indicate better quality of life.</outcome>
