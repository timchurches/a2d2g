  <interventions>
    <interventions>B: Screening (The screening involves patients to complete the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) at a computer in the waiting area which is connected to the Internet. They also answered questions about the largest amount they consumed in a single episode in the last 4 weeks, the duration of the episode, their age, gender, and ethnicity. It takes 3 minutes.), information leaflet (An educational leaflet providing information on the effects of alcohol and recommended upper limits for low-risk consumption) plus assessment of alcohol use, perceptions of peer drinking norms, and problems 4 weeks later. The assessment involves a 14-day retrospective account of drinks per day, the Alcohol Problems Scale - 14 items, the Academic Role Expectations and Alcohol Scale - 5 items, estimates of others' drinking (7 items) and their height and weight. Median completion time is 11 minutes.
C: Web-based motivational intervention (single-dose); including comparison of patient's drinking with age/gender norms and recommended upper limits. This intervention takes 11 minutes to answer the questions (see above) plus the time required to read the feedback, which we estimate to be 3-5 minutes. Overall, total time is approximately 15 minutes.
D: Web-based motivational intervention (multi-dose); as in C, provided at the commencement of the trial, at 6 months and at 12 months. This intervention takes 15 minutes at baseline and a further 10 minutes four weeks later for assessment and feedback.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Research staff involved in the trial were not informed of participantsâ€™ group allocation during intervention or follow-up. The generation of the sequence and loading of it into the server database were conducted by off-site staff who were not involved in the implementation of the trial on site, who never came into contact with study participants. Participants were informed that they were participating in a series of surveys about their drinking. Thier perceptions were checked in a pilot study, and found to be consistent with the aim to conceal group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random sequence was generated in Microsoft Excel using the rand function, and this was loaded into the server which administered the intervention.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Subjects were blind. Note: there were no assessors or therapists as such: all done by computer. The intervention, assessment, and analysis may therefore be said to have been conducted blindly.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is compelling evidence for the efficacy of screening and brief intervention (SBI) for hazardous drinking, yet it is not widely available in primary healthcare. Electronic (computer/web-based) intervention offers the prospect of ease, simplicity, and economy of access. 
The objective was to examine whether electronic SBI (single- and multi-intervention) reduces hazardous drinking and related problems compared with an information leaflet alone (control condition).
Design and Setting: Randomized controlled trial at a university health service (enrolment 8/2003), with follow-up measures taken at 6 and 12 months.</summary>
