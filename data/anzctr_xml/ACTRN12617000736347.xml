  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is an observational study following patients with stroke to examine stress levels at 4, 8 &amp; 12 months post stroke to determine if stress has a detrimental effect on recovery after stroke. Participants will be recruited from John Hunter Hospital wards G2, E1 or Rankin Park Centre (Hunter New England Health Local Health District) following the primary stroke event. A hair sample will be collected immediately post-recruitment. An advantage of hair cortisol analysis is that the hair present on the head at time of admission only represents stress events that have happened prior to the stroke. Therefore, samples collected at or near the time of admission will effectively provide an index of pre-stroke stress levels for the patient. Important stroke details and demographic characteristics will also be recorded (NIHSS, mRS). 

Follow-up assessments: Participants will be assessed at 4, 8 and 12 months post-stroke. Each of these sessions will include a hair sample being taken and the following outcome measures: recovery (Stroke Impact Scale); Resiliency (using the CD-RISC and the BRS), Perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), cognitive function (CANTAB, particularly subscales directed towards sustained attention and executive function), Fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and Anxiety and Depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will monitor people with stroke for excessive stress levels by through follow up in the community. People with recent stroke will be asked to provide a hair sample whilst  in hospital for their stroke. The people with stroke will then be followed up in the community and asked to provide a hair sample and complete surveys regarding current levels of stress. Study participants will be recruited through the John Hunter Hospital and followed up at 4, 8 and 12 months post stroke.
The study aims to provide a novel way of measuring stress levels through hair cortisol analysis ( previously undone) in stroke patients and determine whether there is a link between recovery after stroke and stress levels.
