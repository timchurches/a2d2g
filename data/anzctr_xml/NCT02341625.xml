    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - BMS-986148
Other interventions - Nivolumab

Experimental: Part 1: Ascending dose of BMS-986148 - BMS-986148 Intravenous injection at increasing doses on specific days until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Five cancers will be studied in this part: mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer. Alternate dose and schedules may be explored.

Experimental: Part 2: Expansion dose of BMS-986148 - BMS-986148 Intravenous injection of Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on specific days. Five cancers will be studied in this part: mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer.

Experimental: Part 3A: Ascending dose of BMS-986148 - Set dose of nivolumab and BMS-986148 intravenous injection at increasing doses on specific days until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. Five cancers will be studied in this part: mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer.

Experimental: Part 3B: Expansion dose of BMS-986148 - Set dose of nivolumab and BMS-986148 intravenous injection at or below maximum tolerated dose on specific days. Five cancers will be studied in this part: mesothelioma, pancreatic, ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer.
