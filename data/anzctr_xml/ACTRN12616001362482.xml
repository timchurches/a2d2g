  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undertake mobility training using a Wii Fit U for 25 min per session, three times a week for 8 weeks in their home or school. After screening all games in the Wii Fit U, eight have been selected for mobility training (Ski jump, Table tilt, Perfect 10, Obstacle course, Ultimate obstacle course, Balance bubble, Hula hoop challenge, Step dance). These games consist of a wide range of activities related to mobility, such as squatting, standing, leaning, stepping, or trunk control, as well as being of varying levels of difficulty, and have progression built into the game. Each session will consist of 4 randomly selected games. Random permuted blocks will be used so that after every block (of 4 sessions), all activities will have been practiced the same amount. The score from each game will be used as feedback and motivation.  Each participant will be assigned a therapist with at least one year of work-related experience in rehabilitation. This therapist will monitor adherence to the intervention through the Wii software which will record the frequency of use. Before the beginning of training, the therapist will ensure that the participant and parents understand the eight games. They will then supervise one session a week and will also be available to be contacted should the participant or parents require assistance. Participants will continue with usual care (such as physical or occupational therapy) and the amount (total length of time) will be recorded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recently, virtual reality in the form of interactive computer games, has been proposed as a potentially promising method of pediatric rehabilitation that meets the requirements of being motivating and engaging, while providing an opportunity for practice and repetition within a virtual environment. Wii Fit U Activities include a dozen fun lower limb activities which provide immediate feedback. Also, they are easy to pick up and play and come with progression built in so that the more difficult levels are able to challenge even the most experienced gamers. These features make it a cost-effective way to provide virtual reality training for mobility. Furthermore, in our previous randomized controlled trial of Wii Sports Resort in the upper limb, we found that the participants completed 554 sessions out of a possible 576, an adherence rate of 96%. Parents were excited that gaming enabled their children to do more things with and like their peers. Therefore, we plan to further examine the effect of Wii activities in the lower limb of children with cerebral palsy. Our aim is, for children with cerebral palsy who are able to understand simple instructions, to improve balance, strength, walking, and participation via Wii Fit U activity training.
