  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is very common in patients who require dialysis treatment for kidney failure. There are two main types of dialysis treatment available for patients with kidney failure. Firstly there is peritoneal dialysis where fluids are run into and out of a soft plastic tube inserted into the patients abdomen with a minor surgical procedure. Toxins are removed as they diffuse across the membrane in the abdomen and are flushed out in the fluid. The second type is haemodialysis where toxins are removed from the blood stream as the blood is circulated through a filter outside the body. 
There may be differing effects on the circulation and elements in the blood stream from these two quite different treatments. The aim of this research study is to see which treatment has the best effect on the heart and blood vessels and substances in the blood stream that indicate the degree of stress and inflammation present in the body. The heart and blood vessels will be assessed by a variety of probes outside the body that measure their stiffness, thickness and ability to contract and relax. We are aiming to find out whether one or other form of dialysis may be more beneficial over the first year by assessing the heart and blood vessels and substances in the blood. This may lead to recommendations for the initial form of dialysis treatment used.</summary>
