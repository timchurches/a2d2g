  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be early commencement of aquatic physiotherapy (six days) following total hip and total knee replacement surgery.  This will occur during a standard subacute rehabilitation stay.  Participants will undergo a standardised wound dressing procedure to ensure wounds have appropriate and safe waterproof cover.  Participants will be provided with an individualised program, based on the initial physical assessment performed by the treating physiotherapist, as per usual clinical care.  All components of the intervention will be individualised according to the participant's clinical requirement, as per standard practice. This will include duration and frequency of exercises, exercises selected and number of aquatic physiotherapy sessions.  The aquatic exercises will be provided by a subacute physiotherapist.  All exercises will be individually documented, including use of properties of water, such as depth of water, buoyancy, turbulence and hydrostatic pressure. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will commence aquatic physiotherapy approximately 14 days post-surgery, which is current standard practice.   Participants will be provided with an individualised program, based on the initial physical assessment performed by the treating physiotherapist, as per usual clinical care.  The aquatic exercises will be provided by a subacute physiotherapist.  All exercises will be individually documented, including use of properties of water, such as depth of water, buoyancy, turbulence and hydrostatic pressure. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure for the randomised controlled trial will be the de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI).  The DEMMI will be compared between groups with a repeated measures ANOVA with the fixed effects factor variables of Group and Time.  Subacute length of stay and overall (acute and subacute) length of stay will be compared between groups  using an independent-samples t-tests if the data is normally distributed or Mann-Whitney U tests if it is not normally distributed.  Other outcome measures will be compared between groups using a repeated measures ANOVA.  The primary intervention effect will be estimated along with 95% confidence interval levels.    
A cost-benefit analysis calculation will be carried out to determine the cost-effectiveness of the early immersion.  Variables included in this calculation will be wound dressings, staffing costs and inpatient admission costs.  The significance level will be recorded as 0.05 (a=0.05). Statistical analysis will be performed using STATA (Version 14; Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).

A power analysis for an independent sample t-test was conducted to determine a sufficient sample size using an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.80, a medium to large effect size (d = 0.7). There will be an equal allocation of participants into each group. Based on these assumptions, the desired sample size in each group is 30 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aquatic Physiotherapy has been shown to improve the ability of people to move and function following total hip and knee replacement surgery. The primary aim of this study is to examine if early commencement of aquatic physiotherapy (6 days after surgery) improves function, as compared to standard commencement of aquatic physiotherapy (typically 14 days after surgery- once the wound has healed). Patients attending undergoing total hip replacement or total knee replacement surgery at Dandenong or Moorabbin Hospital who require in-hospital rehabilitation at Dandenong Hospital or the Kingston Centre will be recruited to participate in a randomised controlled trial. One group of participants will receive aquatic physiotherapy 6 days following surgery (intervention), whilst the other group will wait 14 days to commence aquatic physiotherapy as per standard practice (control). A total of 60 people will be randomly assigned to one of these groups. The main measure used to evaluate the intervention will be the de Morton Mobility Index, a measure of walking and balance. A range of other measures will also be administered to evaluate the effect of early aquatic physiotherapy on the ability to function, length of hospital stay, pain, walking speed, quality of life, cost of wound dressings and presence of wound infections. These outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, on discharge from rehabilitation.  Function, pain, quality of life, function and presence of wound infections will also be assessed at 6 weeks following surgery. </summary>
