  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To establish whether intensive follow up of persons admitted to hospital with heart failure, in an out patient clinic setting is more effective than usual follow up.  Also, if treatment of heart failure guided by levels of the hormone BNP is better than treatment guided by usual assessment guidelines.

The three possible treatment groups are:
1. Usual Care Group: Individuals will be followed up via standard health care channels ie GP visits, OP clinic visits.
2. Clinical Group: This group will be reviewed at 3 monthly out patient clinics and  a standardised clinical score will be applied to guide treatment regimes.
3. NBNP Group: Also reviewed by the research team at 3 monthly intervals and heart failure treatments are to be guided by NBNP values.

Patients will either continue their health care treatment post discharge via the normal channels, or will be followed up at 3 month intervals, with treatment guided by NBNP levels and/or clinical assessment tools.</summary>
