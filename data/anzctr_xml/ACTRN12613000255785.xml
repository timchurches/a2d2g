  <interventions>
    <interventions>A pre- and post-test design will be used in which a questionnaire will be distributed to the childs parent/caregiver to be completed before dental treatment under GA and another similar questionnaire will be distributed one month after GA.  Each questionnaire comprises two global items, 33 P-CPQ items and 14 FIS items. These are scored using 5-point Likert-type response options. A P-CPQ consists of 33 items, measuring oral symptoms (six items), functional limitations (eight items), emotional well-being (nine items), and social well-being (ten items). A FIS scale consists of 14 items, measuring parental/family activity (five items), parental emotions (four items), and family conflict (four items). The scores for both P-CPQ and FIS will be computed and compared as a total and for each subscale. 

The intervention includes providing the children affected by dental  caries with complete oral rehabilitation, including dental fillings, pulp therapy, and/or extraction.  The dental treatment will be provided in the operating room while the child patient under standard general anesthesia. The dental treatment may require up to 3 hours and will be completed in a single session. The treatment will not be repeated.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Dental treatment under GA will have a positive impact on OHRQoL of children and their families, as percieved and reported by the child's parents. The questionnaire will assess parent's perception to child's quality of life after dental treatment and the effects of this improvement, if achieved, on family using a Family Impact Scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and after 4-8 weeks of treatment. The assessment will be completed once in each interval (i.e., at baseline before dental treatment and after 4-8 weeks of dental treatment).  Dental treatment will be copmleted in one session. </timepoint>
