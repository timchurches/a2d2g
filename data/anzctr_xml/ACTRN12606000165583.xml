  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients receiving intravenous chemotherapy may require a central venous catheter (CVC) to enable effective delivery of the cytotoxic treatment. This is usually because of either difficult peripheral venous access or prolonged infusional chemotherapy schedules. This study is a randomised clinical trial comparing two types of CVC, the peripherally inserted central venous catheter (PICC) and the subcutaneously implanted port catheter (PORT catheter). The primary end point is CVC related complications.

Background

The last three decades have seen an increase in the use of chronic indwelling central venous catheter devices (CVC) in the setting of cancer treatment. CVCs enable effective delivery of chemotherapy into the venous system, and are particularly useful when peripheral venous access is otherwise difficult or when prolonged infusions of chemotherapy are required. The CVC also facilitates outpatient based therapy.</summary>
