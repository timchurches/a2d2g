  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two intervention groups will be involved (directly supervised and indirectly supervised groups). Participants in the directly supervised group will receive 1:1 exercise supervision, while participants in the indirectly supervised group will receive standard supervision (typically 1:5 to 1:10 supervisor:participant ratio). Participants from both exercise interventions will receive an exercise program incorporating aerobic, resistance, balance and flexibility training. Participants are required to complete the exercise program twice per week, with each session lasting 60 minutes. Exercise sessions will be performed at a moderate-vigorous intensity (55-85% heart rate reserve) as per American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. 
The supervisors role is to provide guidance (e.g. exercise technique) and motivation for the participant. Supervision will be provided by third year undergraduate Exercise and Sports Science students, directly overseen by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist (Exercise and Sports Science Australia) who is responsible for all testing and exercise prescription.
Exercise will be performed at an on-site gymnasium and on-site athletics track.
The total duration of the exercise intervention is 16 weeks, with testing at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. 
Adherence to the exercise program will be encouraged through 1:1 supervision, with adherence being monitored with a log book detailing session attendance and exercises performed.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive exercise prescription as per intervention groups however no supervision or access to on-site facilities will be provided. Pre-, mid- and post-testing.
The total duration of the exercise intervention is 16 weeks, with testing at baseline, 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations were based on an expected moderate difference in change in fitness (effect size d=0.4; unpublished pilot data) between the three groups. To achieve 95% power at an alpha level of 0.05 considering the repeated measures design with three groups, 69 participants are required. To account for potential attrition (up to 44% in workplace studies; Faghri, 2008) a sample size of 99 will be targeted for recruitment. 
The changes in physical activity level, physical fitness, cardiovascular risk and health-related quality of life will be compared between interventions and over time using SPSS statistics version 22 computer software via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of a workplace exercise intervention on cardiovascular disease risk, physical fitness and psychological health in adults aged 18-65 years working within an academic institution. It is hypothesised
that adherence to a regular exercise program will result in decreased cardiovascular disease risk and increased physical fitness and psychological health.</summary>
