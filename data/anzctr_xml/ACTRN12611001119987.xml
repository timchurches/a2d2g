  <interventions>
    <interventions>A brief (30 minute) moderate intensity weight-lifting exercise task, performed only once immediately prior to receipt of the vaccine. The task includes 4 exercises using weights machines (2 lower body, 2 upper body), which are performed at 60% of previously determined single-repetition maximal strength. All exercise is supervised in the STRONG medicine centre at Balmain hospital, supervised by an exercise physiologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Quiet rest (30 minutes), with participants seated in a chair. Vaccination will be administered after this resting period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute exercise mildly activates the immune system; we have found that a short bout of exercise immediately before receiving a vaccine helps your immune system to respond better and give you more protection from disease. This has been seen in young healthy adults; now we want to test this unusual idea in people who could benefit most: the elderly. Those aged over 65 years are at greatest risk for influenza illness, and have been found to show weakest and worst maintained responses to vaccination. As such, a simple, safe, cheap and cost-effective intervention to enhance the vaccine response in the elderly is highly relevant and offers a unique, promising possibility that should be explored to better protect the elderly from flu.</summary>
