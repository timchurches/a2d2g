  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients (CF and non-CF Controls) will be asked to complete the following at baseline, during and after an respiratory exacerbation/worsening. 
1. CF and Sleep related questionnaires (Duration: 1/2 hour)
2. Oxygen (Duration: 3 nights) and Activity home monitoring (Duration: 7 days) watches
3. Sleep study (Duration: 1 night)
4. Neurocognitive testing battery on a computer (Duration: 2 hours)
5. Blood tests (part of routine care)

Testing during and after an exacerbation applies to CF patients. Post exacerbation testing will be performed 4 weeks post recovery. 

Non CF controls will be invited to perform testing during a baseline visit and in the same time frame of an exacerbation for the matched CF participant (within 4-6 weeks). 

Patients will be monitored for their first exacerbation over the 21 month trial duration period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Non-CF control subjects will be age and education matched and will be invited to perform similar tests (see above).  

Testing will occur during a baseline visit and in the same time frame of an exacerbation for the matched CF participant (within 4-6 weeks). </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>CF patients will be compared with an age and education matched non-CF control group with respect to the sleep and cognitive outcomes tested (primary outcome is the PVT) using linear regression modelling. The effect of group will be examined, controlling for BMI, age, and years of education. Response to treatment of CF exacerbations (mean change with 95% confidence limits) will be assessed by paired-t-test, and also by mixed effects modelling to control for changes in oxygen saturation on the change in performance.

A total of 30 CF patients will be studied. This will provide 80% power to detect a 0.531ms difference in response times between the two groups (assume SD=0.5ms, alpha 0.05, controlling for circadian effects). Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, the sample is powered to detect a 0.6ms change in response times (at 80% power, within subject SD=0.5ms). A total of 30 non-CF controls will also be studied.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be an observational study in CF patients with mild lung disease, examining the relationship between neurocognitive function and sleep parameters. Additional factors to be studied include hypoxemia, inflammatory markers, circadian rhythm and mood.

CF participants will be tested at baseline, during and after lung exacerbation. Age and education matched non-CF controls will be invited to participate as well. 

Summary of tests to be performed at each visit:
1. Sleep study with high density EEG
2. Blood tests
3. Activity and oxygen monitoring with watches
4. Neurocognitive tests and Questionnaires.
