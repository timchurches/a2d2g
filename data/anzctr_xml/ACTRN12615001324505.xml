  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to test the safety as well as define the normal and abnormal scan appearances following injection of a radioactive substance called Gallium-68 tris-hydroxypyridinone  prostate specific membrane antigen (Ga-68 THP-PSMA) and imaging with positron emission tomography (PET).

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you have prostate adenocarcinoma and are scheduled to undergo a prostatectomy.

Study details: In this study, we will use a radioactive molecule (called Gallium-68) that, after injection into a vein, specifically attaches to prostate cancer cells by binding to a receptor called PSMA. You will need to visit the hospital for an additional occasion for approximately 4 hours. An intravenous line will be inserted into a vein in each arm, one to give the investigational product, and another for sampling your blood during the scan. Ga-68 THP-PSMA will be injected and several scans performed over a 3 hour period. You will be closely observed throughout this period with regular recording of your vital signs.

The radioactive molecule used in this study is not approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). This study will help inform the utility of this agent for imaging prostate cancer, and design of future larger studies assessing accuracy.</summary>
