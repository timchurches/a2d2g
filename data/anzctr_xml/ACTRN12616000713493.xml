  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a cluster randomised, stepped wedge, study. Up to 29,400 patients planned to be enrolled at up to 12 clinical sites in New Zealand. Procedural details will be recorded in the national ANZACSQI registry. Patients in the nonfasted arm (intervention) can have free fluids right up to the procedure and will be recommended to not eat within 2 hours of the procedure and will be supervised by nursing staff prior to the procedure.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Number of clusters: 6 large sites, 6 small sites 
Number of time periods: 7 time periods, 4 months per period 
Number of steps: 6 steps in total, two clusters per step 
Randomisation: Two clusters will be randomly allocated to each step, switching from control to intervention phase at scheduled time period (stratified by site size, with 1 large and 1 small site crossed over at each step) 
Blinding: Open label
 
Sample size: A total sample size of 29,400 patients from 12 hospital sites (clusters), with on average 350 patients recruited per time period at each site over 7 study periods of four months (T1-T7), will provide at least 95% power at 2.5% level of significance (one-sided) to detect a non-inferiority margin of 0.6% in the proportion of vomiting with or without aspiration pneumonitis. The control rate was estimated at 0.6% with fasting and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient was set at 0.05. 
 
Statistical analysis: Treatment evaluation will be performed on the principle of intention to treat. The statistical test on the primary outcome will be one-sided at 2.5% level of significance, or two-sided at 5% level.  Noninferiority will be evaluated by observing whether the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence intervals for the risk difference in vomiting rate between non-fasting and fasting phases was above the noninferiority margin of 0.6%. Generalized linear mixed model will be used to evaluate the intervention effect, with a random effect for cluster and fixed effects for the implementation phase and study time period. The point estimate and 95% confidence interval will be reported using an appropriate link function.
