  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>The primary aim of this study is to explore parameters (including interactions) that influence the preservation and / or enhancement of mental health (acuity and functioning) after physical fatigue (induced by repetition of a Wingate cycle test) and /or consumption of a blackcurrant extract.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a full factorial study design that will allow us to test the effect of both physical fatigue and efficacy of blackcurrant nutritional intervention on cognitive performance as well as identify potential interactions. Participants will be randomised into one of the four treatment groups; Group 1; placebo and no exercise, Group 2; placebo and intensive fatiguing exercise, Group 3; blackcurrant extract and no exercise and Group 4; blackcurrant extract and intensive fatiguing exercise. The blackcurrant extract used in this study is made commercially by Just-the-Berries (Nelson, NZ), and is an anthocyanin rich (freeze-dried) extract (30%) made entirely of New Zealand Blackcurrants. Furthermore, the dose used in this study is ~ 1g (equivalent to 250 mg anthocyanins). On the day of the trial, participants will be asked to consume a gelatine capsule containing either a blackcurrant extract or placebo (equivalent fructose and glucose), after 1 hour they will be asked to either  to relax for 10 minutes or perform  Wingate cycle test (30 second cycle at maximum power [80-100 watts] on a stationary  ergometer with a 4% body weight  braking torque) with a 1 min resting interval until they fatigue (usually 4-5 repeats); indicated by a drop in power output in the last 10 seconds of the 30 second cycle or verbal indication by the participant. The participant will then be asked to repeat the cognitive performance task followed by another 30 second Wingate test using the same conditions described above.   </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive performance </outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive performance will be assessed at a familiarisation session as well as in the main part of the trial. In the main trial, participants will be asked to perform a series of computerised tasks designed to test cognitive functioning  prior to and immediately after either (a) performing repeated (usually 4-5) 30 second Wingate cycle tests designed to induce a physical fatigue or (b) a 10 min relaxation period. Cognitive performance will be tested using 5 tasks; stroop, digit symbol substitution, backward digit span, trail making and complex reaction time, which examine various aspects of cognitive processing.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical exercise performance </outcome>
      <timepoint>Exercise performance is assessed on a stationary cycle ergometer, participants will be asked to cycle at maximum speed at braking torque (4% body weight) for 30 seconds. Using the participants physical performance measures; cycle work output [peak/average], physical fatigue index, lactate threshold [anaerobic capacity], blood glucose and ratings of perceived exertion parameters, we aim to assess changes in physical performance in the main trial before and after exercise-induced fatigue or 10 min relaxation.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oxidative stress and antioxidant paramters</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes in oxidative stress and antioxidant status will be measured at specific times during the main trial; (i) pre-treatment; blackcurrant or placebo, (ii) just before and (iii) immediately after exercise-induced fatigue or relaxation period, and finally (iv) after a 20 minutes recovery period. We will measure changes in the following plasma oxidative stress parameters, (a) radical oxygen species using fluorescence assay using hydrolysed DCF, (b) superoxide, (c) nitric oxide, (d) protein carbonyls and (e) lipid peroxidation  malondialdehyde (MDA) using commercially available assay kits (Abcam). Antioxidant status will be assessed by changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase and GPx activity in PBS washed (x2) erythrocytes using in house colorimetric bioassays and plasma total antioxidant capacity measured using hydrolysed fluorescent probe DCF and H2O2 as the pro-oxidant stimulus.   </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Leukcoyte mitochondrial DNA fragility</outcome>
      <timepoint>Mitochondrial fragility will be measured at (i) pre-treatment; blackcurrant or placebo, (ii) just before and (iii) immediately after exercise-induced fatigue or relaxation period, and finally (iv) after a 20 minutes recovery period. We aim to determine the effect of blackcurrant consumption and/or exercise-induced fatigue on mitochondrial DNA. This involves isolating leukocyte DNA and using nested PCR methodology using specific oilgonucleotides that recognise a specific region of mitochondrial DNA that is susceptible to oxidative stress.    </timepoint>

    <concealment>(a) Recruitment. Participants will be recruited from a flyer posted on the appropriate notice boards local research institutes and community gyms. All interested individuals will have an initial chat with the trial coordinator and be provided with information sheet, health and fitness questionnaires and consent forms to take home for discussion with friends, family or whanau. Potential participants will have 2 weeks to decide whether they would like to take part in the study.
(b) This is full factorial design. Particpants will allocated into one of four groups; Group 1; placebo and no exercise, Group 2; placebo and physical fatigue, Group 3; blackcurrant and no exercise and Group 4; blackcurrant and physical fatigue. Study investigators and particpants will be blinded from dietary intervention but not from the physcial intervention (relaxation or exercie-induced physical fatigue). Allocation of dietary intervention is undertaken by a fellow scientist who is not involved in this study. Participant treatment allocation is held concealed until completion of the trial and analysis of the data is finished. Furthermore, participants will be given their dietary treatmtent as an opaque gelatin capsule, which will mask the blackcurrant extract or placebo, and asked to take the treatment quickly with a galss of water. They will also be supervised so they don't attempt to pull the capsule apart.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean. (i) Interaction between the consumption of a blackcurrant extract and exercise-induced fatigue on cognitive performance. The effect sizes associated with the  blackcurrant extract are expected to be very small. For example, if we conduct a t-test between two groups with a small effect size (Cohens d = 0.2), with  power = 0.8 and a significance level of P&lt; 0.05, we would need to have a total N of 788, nearly 400 per group, according to the G*Power3.1.2 programme. Hence, our concentration for this part of the study will be on effect sizes with confidence limits, and trends in the data. Future similar studies can combine the results of several studies in a meta-analysis to increase N. (ii) Biochemical data analysis. Statistical significance for the comparison between two groups will be assessed using a paired Student's t-test. Multiple comparisons will be assessed by a two-way ANOVA. Where appropriate, the original data will be transformed to achieve normality and constant variance in the residuals. Statistical significance for all indices will be set at P &lt; 0.05 with a confidence level of 95%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physically active individuals have a faster and more robust cognitive processing ability than those who are sedentary. Meta analysis of randomized controlled studies, involving individuals of different ages, showed that physical exercise (even after one session) can improve mental acuity. Exercise intensity is generically thought to affect cognitive performance in an upside down, U-shaped fashion; moderate intensity exercise facilitates cognitive functioning, whereas high intensity training (HIT) may delay or impair cognition. Whilst prolonged high intensity training sessions does appear to have detrimental action on mental acuity, a recent study showed that short bursts (60 secs) of HIT improved cognitive execution. These conflicting findings suggest that the duration of the physical fatiguing exercise and an individuals ability to recovery may impact upon their cognitive functioning. Although the underlying mechanisms involved in how exercise improves or preserves cognitive ability is unclear, cerebral blood flow is integral to mental acuity: A positive link between aerobic exercise, delivery of oxygenated haemoglobin to the cerebral frontal area and enhanced cognition has recently been shown. Since prolonged high intensity anaerobic exercise is shown to cause a transient decrease in the cerebral oxygenated: deoxygenated haemoglobin ratio and a delay in the removal of detrimental metabolites (e.g. lactate), changes in blood flow and oxidative stress may underlie the impaired cognitive function observed. We have shown that blackcurrant consumption alleviates oxidative stress and improves blood flow to a variety of tissues; increasing oxygen delivery to tissues and blood lactate clearance in various exercise training scenarios. It is therefore feasible that blackcurrant consumption may alleviate oxidative stress, facilitate oxygen delivery to and removal of waste by-products from, the brain during recovery from a physical fatiguing exercise, thereby preserving cognitive function. In this study we examine the inter-relationship between (i) cognitive performance (ii) an intensive fatiguing exercise and (iii) timed consumption of a single portion of a blackcurrant extract.</summary>
