The training was applied by physiotherapists. The groups of exercises were submitted the a program of muscular endurance of the inferior limbs applied for 6 weeks, two weekly sessions with 40 minutes of duration each session. The volunteers were re-evaluted after 6 weeks.</interventions>

Control Group didn't receive any type of physioterapy intervention during the six weeks of the research. To assure still more the maintenance of the condition of this group, weekly phone calls (6 connections) were done for each member seeking attendance of their routine activities.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study had as objective compares the impact of a endurance exercises structured program to the inferior limbs muscles fatigue inside and out of water in the static and dynamic balance in the elderly.  
Our hypothesis is that the training of muscular endurance accomplished in the therapeutic swimming pool and in the soil is capable to improve the static and dynamic balance in the elderly.</summary>
