  <interventions>
    <interventions>After screening for study eligibility, a baseline blood sample for analysis of lipids, glucose and insulin sensitivity will be obtained. Participants will then be asked to wear an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 24 hours and to keep an activity diary to enable blood pressure values to be related to activities. 

Participants will return the monitor and activity diary the following day (24 hours after screening) and will be randomly allocated to take one tablet of the active formulation (100mg of green coffee bean extract, 500mg of olive leaf extract, 150mg of beet powder) orally or a matching placebo in the morning and one table in the evening with main meals daily for 6 weeks. Participants will be required to write the time every time they consume a tablet in their supplement diary to serve as a reminder and to ensure compliance to study protocol.

At the end of 6 weeks, they will return to have their blood sample taken and the ambulatory blood pressure monitor fitted. Participants will return 24 hours later to return the monitor and activity diary and to receive their alternate treatment for a further 6 weeks, after which they will return for the final assessments. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, as measured using A&amp;D Medical, TM-2430 Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitor. An appropriately sized blood pressire cuff will be placed firmly around the upper non-dominant arm, centered over the brachial artery, with the monitor worn on a waist strap. Measurements will be recorded at 15 min intervals during the day (7am to 11 pm) and at 30 min intervals at night (11 pm  7am). The same monitor, cuff size and arm will be used for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring on each occasion in each participant. Monitoring will be conducted for 24 hr</outcome>

    <concealment>- Participants will receive and return a completed health and lifestyle questionnaire and consent form, 
- Participants will then attend the research clinic for their screening/baseline visit.
- Those who meet the study's blood pressure and body mass index criteria will enter the trial and will undergo a blood sample and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring assessment. 
- Participant will be allocated to either active or inactive supplement for the first 6-week phase of the trial. The supplement bottles will be labelled with their assigned participant ID. Both the study investigator and the participant will not know whether they are on the ‘active’ or the ‘inactive’ supplement.
- After 6 weeks, participants will return for reassessment of the outcome measurements before crossing over to the alternate treatment in the second phase of the 6-week study.  
</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated their initial treatment accordingly to the randomisation by minimisation process (Altman &amp; Bland BMJ 2005;330;843), where gender and body mass index will be the primary determinant. The initial allocation of the first participant will be determined by a coin toss. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is the mean within-subject difference in ABPM between the active and placebo treatments, assessed from averaged 24 hr, daytime and overnight measurements of SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the end of each 6 week treatment phase. Data will be tested for order effects. Assuming no order effect with the 2-way randomisation and no carry-over effect, the effect of treatment will be determined by paired t-test.  This study is powered to detect changes with the olive leaf formulation. A total of 34 completers will give 80% power to detect a significant (P-value less than 0.05) change in blood pressure of at least of 3/2 mmHg (SBP/DBP). We will recruit 40 participants to allow for drop-outs. 

Secondary outcomes (fasting plasma lipids, glucose, insulin sensitivity by HOMA) will be similarly tested but with a modified Bonferroni adjustment of significance levels for multiple comparisons. Effects of significant covariates, e.g. baseline BP, will be tested by ANCOVA.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lifestyle risk factors such as lack of regular exercise, poor diet, ageing, excess body weight, high blood fats and high blood sugar levels can lead to narrowing and hardening of arteries, thus increasing our blood pressure. Long term elevated blood pressure can eventually increase our risk for developing cardiovascular diseases.
Certain ingredients from food sources such as  extracts from olive leaf, green coffee bean and beet may help lower blood pressure by enhancing the ability of blood vessels to dilate. These ingredients have independently been shown to have blood pressure lowering effects; however, their combined effects on blood pressure are unknown. 
In this study, we are looking to see if a novel formulation consisting of extracts from olive leaf, green coffee bean and beet can lower blood pressure in adults. We will also look at its effects on blood fats, blood sugar and insulin levels.
