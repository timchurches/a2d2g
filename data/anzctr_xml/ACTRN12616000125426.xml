  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Stimulant medication - methylphenidate, 5mg, oral tablet, taken daily, dose and adherence supervised by registered psychiatrist from the Department of Medicine, University of Otago.  Overencapsulated in  size 0 opaque gelatin capsules. Control = placebo made from 4 grains of Orzo pasta encapsulated in size 0 opaque gelatin capsules. 
2. Walk in a natural environment - 30 minutes, once daily, adherence supervised by two research assistants. Control = Walk in a built environment.
3. Each participant will recieve a total of four combinations of the two interventions and their controls, described above. Namely, 1) methylphenidate + walk in natural environment; 2) methylphenidate + walk in built environment (Control) ; 3) placebo (Control) + walk in natural environment; 4) placebo (Control) + walk in built environment (Control)  
4. Wash out period: 7 days
- Duration for each of the four arms: 7 days per condition. </interventions>

Each participant will recieve a total of four combinations of the two interventions and their controls, described above. Namely, 1) methylphenidate + walk in natural environment; 2) methylphenidate + walk in built environment (Control) ; 3) placebo (Control) + walk in natural environment; 4) placebo (Control) + walk in built environment (Control). Thus, each participant acts as their own control. The order in which participants recieve the intervention combinations will be randomised by computer.  
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Differences (after walk minus before walk) will be analysed with a linear mixed model with fixed effects of medication-type, environment, session, order of environment, age, gender, and random effect of child. The treatment factor has a 2 x 2 structure (combination of environment and medication). The main effects of environment and medication as well as their interaction are of primary interest, whereas the other variables are included in order to reduce residual variability.
The proposed study is quite unique, however, power calculations were completed by a professor of applied statistics from the Department of Mathematics at the University of  Copenhagen for a related study investigating performance on the Attention Network Task after a walk in a natural environment. Previous studies suggest a decrease of 20 in RT scores for the Executive Attention component after exposure to a natural environment, with no change after exposure to a built environment. With these values, 40 children are required to get a power of 90% (when the test is carried out with significance level 5%). The current study will allow for more accurate measures for childrens performance in such conditions. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Past research has shown that performance on executive function tasks can be improved after a walk in a natural environment. This has been found across a number of participant groups, including children with ADHD. Taylor and Kuo (2009) reported improvements in working memory in children with ADHD with a statistical effect size that was comparable to those seen with two formulations of pharmacological treatment (methylphenidate). We aim to investigate whether natural environments can improve executive function performance in children with ADHD, and whether this is affected by medication status. Specifically, we ask whether performance after walking in a natural environment and taking a placebo is better than performance after walking in a built environment and taking a dose of psychostimulant medication. Further, we ask whether exposure to a natural environment can enhance the effect of psychostimulant medication to improve executive function performance. We aim to provide evidence for the suggestion that such an intervention may be pursued as a supplementary strategy for managing the disorder. We extend the current research by including medication status as a withinsubject
factor to answer the questions: 1) Do the treatment combinations of "natural
environment + placebo" and "built environment + psychostimulant medication" both improve cognitive performance in children with ADHD? and 2) Does the treatment combination of "natural environment + psychostimulant medication" improve cognitive performance to a higher degree than either treatment alone? Based on previous studies, we predict both treatment combinations ("natural environment + placebo" and "built
environment + medication") will improve cognitive performance (executive attention score) in children with ADHD. Further, we predict that the treatment combination of "natural environment + medication" will be associated with greater a cognitive improvement (executive attention score) than the other three treatment combinations (natural environment + placebo, built environment + medication, and built environment + placebo).</summary>
