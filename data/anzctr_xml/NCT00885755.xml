  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This single arm study will evaluate alterations in molecular marker expression in
      HER2-positive targeted therapy, and will evaluate the effect of continued treatment with
      Herceptin and Xeloda beyond progression following initial Herceptin-taxane chemotherapy.
      Patients who develop progressive disease will receive first-line Herceptin (8mg/kg iv loading
      dose and 6mg/kg iv every 3 weeks) + taxane therapy. patients who develop progressive disease
      within 9 weeks of treatment will continue treatment with Herceptin in combination with Xeloda
      (1000mg/m2 po bid on days 1-14 of each 3-week cycle).Biopsies of tumor tissue will be taken
      for biomarker and gene profiling evaluation. The anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression, intolerable side effects or patient choice, and the target sample size
      is 100 individuals.</summary>
