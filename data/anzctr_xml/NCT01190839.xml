  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Recurrence (CR) of Crohn's Disease (CD) Prior to or at Week 76 - CR criteria:1) A &gt;=70-point increase from baseline in CDAI score [in general, CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600; higher score indicates higher disease activities];2)A CDAI score &gt;=200;3)Evidence of endoscopic recurrence [ileal Rutgeerts score of &gt;=i2 at anastomotic site or its equivalent elsewhere in GI tract] and 4)A negative stool test for C. difficile toxin (if, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant's symptoms are predominantly diarrheal); or at least 1 of followings:1) developing a new draining external fistula;2)re-opening and draining of a previously existing external fistula;3)developing a new internal fistula;4)developing a new perianal abscess or 5)developing a new intra-abdominal abscess more than 3 months after date of index surgery. In addition, participants who had a treatment failure [initiated a prohibited CD medication, had prohibited use of CD medication, or had surgery for CD] before or at Week 76 were considered to have clinical recurrence.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 76</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Recurrence of CD Prior to or at Week 76 - Endoscopic recurrence is defined as an ileal Rutgeert's score of &gt;= i2 either at the anastomotic site or elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, participants who had a treatment failure (initiated a prohibited CD medication, had a prohibited use of a CD medication, or had a surgery for CD) prior to Week 76, and who developed a new draining external fistula or re-opening and draining of a previously existing external fistula or developed a new internal fistula, new perianal abscess or new intra-abdominal abscess more than 3 months after the date of the index surgery were considered to have had endoscopic recurrence prior to or at Week 76.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 76</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Recurrence (CR) of Crohn's Disease (CD) Prior to or at Week 104 - CR criteria:1) A &gt;=70-point increase from baseline in CDAI score [in general, CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600; higher score indicates higher disease activities];2)A CDAI score &gt;=200;3)Evidence of endoscopic recurrence [ileal Rutgeerts score of &gt;=i2 at anastomotic site or its equivalent elsewhere in GI tract] and 4)A negative stool test for C. difficile toxin (if, in the opinion of the investigator, the participant's symptoms are predominantly diarrheal); or at least 1 of followings:1) developing a new draining external fistula;2)re-opening and draining of a previously existing external fistula;3)developing a new internal fistula;4)developing a new perianal abscess or 5)developing a new intra-abdominal abscess more than 3 months after date of index surgery.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Have a documented diagnosis of CD confirmed by endoscopic, histologic and/or
             radiologic studies prior to resection or by tissue obtained at resection

          -  Have undergone an ileocolonic surgical resection

          -  Patients must also be at an increased risk of recurrence of active CD

          -  Patients must not have previously discontinued infliximab as a result of tolerability
             issues or they must be naive to treatment with infliximab. Provided patients meet the
             above criteria pertaining to infliximab, they are eligible to enroll if they received
             prior treatment with adalimumab and/or certolizumab

          -  Patients must undergo screening for HBV

          -  Baseline CDAI &lt; 200

          -  Have adequate blood and liver test values</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Have a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, including histoplasmosis
             or coccidioidomycosis, prior to screening

          -  Have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to the first infusion of study agent
             that shows a clinically significant abnormality, such as a malignancy or infection, or
             any abnormalities suggestive of TB

          -  Have macroscopically active CD which was not resected at the time of surgery

          -  Do not meet the criteria for being at an increased risk of postoperative recurrence of
             active CD as outlined in the inclusion criteria

          -  Have evidence of an active infection at the time of randomization or have had a
             serious infection not related to CD (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonia, or pyelonephritis),
             within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Have or have had an opportunistic infection (e.g., herpes zoster [shingles],
             cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, aspergillosis, histoplasmosis, or mycobacteria
             other than TB) within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Have any known malignancy or history of malignancy within the 5-year period prior to
             screening (with the exception of squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has
             been completely excised without evidence of recurrence)

          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would compromise the
             well-being of the patient or the study or prevent the patient from meeting or
             performing study requirements.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>REMICADE (infliximab) is a drug used to treat active Crohn's disease and is being tested in
      an experiment to see if it may be useful in preventing relapse of Crohn's disease after
      surgical resection. This study will compare the effects (both good and bad) of REMICADE
      (infliximab) to those of placebo. Placebo looks like the drug being studied but has no active
      ingredients.</summary>
