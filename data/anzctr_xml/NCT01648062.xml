    <interventions>Behaviour - Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery

Active Comparator: Arousal reduction using guided imagery - Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery: Participants in the arousal reduction condition were instructed to imagine wearing a backpack loaded with their worries, then putting the heavy backpack down, and then experiencing the relief and freedom from tension.

Active Comparator: Mental simulation of sleep behavior - Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery: Participants in this condition received instructions to visualize a specific behavioral plan designed to meet the goal of obtaining quality sleep each night through the practice of certain behaviors. To form the behavioral plan, participants visualised changing into comfortable clothes and taking time to relax prior to going to bed, the time they planned to go to sleep, where they planned to sleep, and the bedtime routine they follow to help them to get to sleep. At bedtime, they were instructed to mentally run through a checklist of these behaviors and then do any behaviors that they had not yet completed.

Active Comparator: Combination - Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery: Participants in this condition were asked to practice a combination of the guided imagery (for relaxation) and mental simulation imagery for sleep-related behaviour

Sham Comparator: Control - Sleep Self-Regulation Using Mental Imagery: Participants in this condition were asked to imagine a typical post work activity

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Quality - Assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al, 1989).The PSQI includes 19 items that assess sleep quality, hours of sleep, sleep onset length, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of medication and daytime. Item ratings are recoded and combined to form seven component scores. These scores are then summed into a global score ranging from 0(no difficulty) to 21(severe difficulties in all areas). Daily sleep quality was assessed with five PSQI items.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at 3 weeks. Data will also be presented for every day for the duration of the 3 week period so change can be reported.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Negative Sleep Habits - The Sleep Hygiene Index (Mastin et al, 2006). Respondents rate on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (all the time) how frequently they engaged in 13 behaviors (e.g. "I take naps lasting two or more hours"). Ratings were summed to provide a total negative sleep habit frequency score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Final follow-up (at 21-days)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Efficacy - Participants rated their sleep self-efficacy with the item, "how confident are you that you can take the actions necessary to get a good sleep tonight?" Sleep response efficacy was rated with the item "how confident are you that you will actually get a good sleep tonight?" ratings ranged from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (very confident), and they were summed; r=.69, p&lt;.01 at baseline and r=.20, p&lt;.05 at final follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and final follow-up (at 21 days)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-Sleep Arousal - The Pre-sleep Arousal Scale (Nicasso et al, 1985) includes an 8-item somatic subscale (e.g. "how often in the last week before bed have you had a tight, tense feeling in your muscles?") and an 8-item cognitive subscale (e.g. "how often in the last week before bed do you review or ponder events of the day?"). Ratings range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) and are summed to generate scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and final follow-up (Day 21)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Imagery Adherence - Measure adapted from the Vividness of Imagery Questionnaire (White et al, 1978). Participants rated the vividness of the following images: (1) putting things into a bag, (2) releasing a bag, (3) getting home from work, (4) relaxing at home, (5) their night-time routine, (6) the time that they visualised going to bed, (7) the environment of their bedroom, (8) the details of the bed they are sleeping in, (9) the image of themselves falling asleep. Response options were: 1 (no image at all) 2 (vague and dim), 3 (somewhat vivid), 4 (reasonably clear), and 5 (perfectly clear and vivid).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post-session, Daily, Final follow-up (21 days)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Action Planning - An adaptation of the action planning measure developed by Luszczynska and Schwarzer (2003) was used. The items included: "I have made a detailed plan for (1) how I am going to wind down before going to sleep (2) how I am going to prepare for bed (3) how I am going to prepare the place where I will sleep, and (4) the time when I go to sleep". Responses ranged from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much); ratings were summed to generate scores.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Final follow-up (Day 21)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial assessed the efficacy of four mental imagery techniques for
      improving sleep and its related behaviour: (1) imagery focused on reducing arousal levels;
      (2) imagery incorporating implementation intentions (a strategy designed to link specified
      behaviour with the anticipated context) for sleep-related behaviour; (3) a combination of
      imagery using arousal reduction and implementation intention strategies; or (4) a condition
      where participants were asked to imagine their typical post work activities.</summary>
