    <interventions>Intervention group will receive Optiflow Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) as their device for pre-oxygenation. Oxygen will be delivered through two nasal prongs. The procedure will be carried out by the treating anaesthetist.
Pre-oxygenation phase: After the patient is placed at a sniffing position with a pillow under the head, pre-oxygenation is commenced with appropriate monitoring, resuscitation equipment and assistance in accordance with the Australian and New Zealand College of the Anaesthetists guidelines. Bispectral index (BIS) monitor will also be put on the patient. Oxygen is delivered via THRIVE device, which will be turned on for at least 10 minutes before the start of the operation to ensure the air is humidified sufficiently. Patients will be put on a THRIVE device with oxygen (FiO2 of 1.0) delivering at 30 L/min for 30 seconds and then increased to 50 L/min. The humidity and temperature will follow its default setting which is at 37 degree celsius and 100% humidity. After 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation, anaesthetic induction will then begin. THRIVE device will continue to delivery high flow oxygen at 50L/min throughout pre-oxygenation until successful intubation. There will be no pause until we secure the airway.

Induction phase: Propofol will be administered using target controlled infusion (TCI) technique aiming to maintain BIS between 40-60. Opioids will be given at the discretion of the treating anaesthetist. Nerve stimulator will then be calibrated and train of four count (TOF) will commence every 20 seconds. Rocuronium will be given at 1.0mg/kg. Oxygenation via the THRIVE device is continued after patient loses consciousness. Upper airway patency needs to be maintained to ensure adequate apoeic ventilation. If there is any sign of desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 95%) during apoeic oxygenation, the treating anaesthetist is allowed to manage the airway at his/her own discretion, including conversion to bag and mask ventilation if necessary. Airway maneouvres, such as chin lift and jaw thrust; and airway adjuncts, such as oropharyngeal airway will be used at the discretion of the anaesthetist. Once the TOF = 0, the patient will be intubated. After successful intubation, THRIVE will be discontinued and mechanical ventilation will commence. If an unexpected intubation is encountered, the anaesthetist can convert to facemask ventilation if necessary. After this time, the anaesthetist may modify their anaesthetic technique at their discretion.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will receive oxygen delivered via a facemask connected to standard anaesthetic machine set on manual ventilation mode. The procedure will also be carried out by the treating anaesthetist.

Bispectral index (BIS) monitor will also be put on the patient. Oxygen is delivered via facemask connected to a standard anaesthetic machine set on manual ventilation mode. 100% oxygen will be delivered at 10 L/min with the adjustable pressure limiting (APL) valve fully open. After 5 minutes of pre-oxygenation, anaesthetic induction will then begin.

Rocuronium will be given at 1.0mg/kg. Bag-mask ventilation (BMV) will commence as soon as patient loses consciousness. Manual ventilation is maintained to keep ETCO2 between 35-40mmHg. Airway maneouvres, such as chin lift and jaw thrust; and airway adjuncts, such as oropharyngeal airway will be used  at the discretion of the anaesthetist. Once the TOF = 0, patient will be intubated. After successful intubation, mechanical ventilation is commenced.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous study, the standard deviation (SD) of PaO2 was 50 mmHg after pre-oxygenation with normal facemask breathing. We assume that PaO2 level will be at least 50 mmHg higher in patients receiving THRIVE than patients receiving mask oxygen for pre-oxygenation. With a SD of 50 mmHg, an alpha error of 0.02 and a power of 0.8, the sample size calculation shows that a minimum sample size of 16 patients is required in each group. We will recruit a total of 50 patients to account for potential drop-outs.

Data will be analysed using Fisher-exact test or chi2 test, depending on the size of data set, for categorical data. Unpaired two-tailed t-test or Mann Whitney U-test will be used to examine parametric data, depending on the normality of the data. A P value &lt; 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Repeated measures analysis of variance will also be used to analyse serial datasets, including the changes in PaO2, PaCO2 and SpO2 with time. Post-hoc testing will be performed with an appropriate correction for multiple comparisons</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we plan to compare two different techniques of supplying oxygen to patients before they go to sleep under general anaesthesia for neurosurgical operation. The usual way of doing this procedure involves breathing oxygen through a facemask. In this study, a computer program will randomly allocate them to receive either oxygen via the facemask, or to have humidified oxygen delivered at high flow via two prongs in the nose. The study aims to test if the nasal oxygen method keeps oxygen levels higher compared to the usual practice, which is oxygen via the facemask. The nasal oxygen method has been used extensively in other parts of the hospital for many years. It has now become increasingly popular to be used in the operating theatre. However, there are limited studies on the use of this device in anaesthetic setting.</summary>
