    <interventions>Arm 1.  Desiccated New Zealand beef liver (freeze dried cooked) from an 11g sachet to be added to mid-day day-care meals each weekday and to home-prepared meals once per day on holidays for 12 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We planned this trial to find out whether adding a small amount of powdered beef liver to day-care meals of Brazilian preschool children from Salvador for 12 months could prevent anemia and micronutrient deficiencies, improve their growth, health, and development in the same way or better than adding a small amount of micronutrients in powder form (Sprinkles). </summary>
