  <interventions>
    <interventions>(i) The individual Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (iCST) programme (delivered by trained volunteers)
The iCST facilitator has completed the one day master class iCST training delivered by members of the research team. 

iCST will be delivered at home twice a week for 45-minute per sessions  for 10 weeks. 

The iCST programme is:
15 minutes warming up, orientation, current affairs, refreshments and gentle stretches 
20 minutes of the iCST activity
10 minutes warm down, discuss topic for following session	
TOTAL 45 minutes 

The key principles of iCST are
1. Mental stimulation
2. Developing new idea, thoughts and associations
3. Using orientation in a sensitive manner
4. Focusing on opinions, rather than facts
5. Using reminiscence as an aid to the here and now
6. Providing triggers to support memory
7. Stimulate language and communication
8. Stimulate every day planning ability
9. Using a person-centred approach
10. Offering a choice of activities
11. Enjoyment and fun
12. Maximising potential
13. Strengthening the relationship by spending quality time together

Adherence will be measured by the total number of sessions over the 10 weeks period
</interventions>
    <comparator>(ii) Treatment as Usual (TAU)
People allocated to the treatment as usual arm will receive routine follow up by Dementia Auckland. For a new referral to Dementia Auckland, the keyworker usually completes 4-6 home visits within the first six months to provide practical strategies for the carer/family. The Keyworker will refer the carer to Carer Education if this is a carer preference. The keyworker can refer the person with dementia (PWD) to the Socialisation service for community based group activities. The keyworker will integrate the carer into monthly support groups. Following the initial six months, there are regular phone calls, home visits if required, support groups and Socialisation. Each person is re-assessed with a home visit annually.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will build on the work we have already completed on testing the feasibility of delivering iCST for people with dementia by trained volunteers. The aim is to recruit a larger sample that will allow power calculation for a future multi-centre trial comparing the efficacy of iCST delivered by trained volunteers with treatment as usual (TAU). The null hypothesis is that when compared to treatment as usual, iCST (delivered by trained volunteers) has no positive benefit on cognition or quality of life for people with mild to moderate dementia.</summary>
