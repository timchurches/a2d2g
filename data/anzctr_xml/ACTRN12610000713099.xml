  <interventions>
    <interventions>Normotensive and Hypertensive subjects will receive 4x1 g placebo capsules/day (Sunola oil) for 3 weeks.  Subjects will then be randomised to receive either 4x1g fish oil capsules/day (Blackmores Omega Heart, Blackmores Ltd, Australia) containing 2.52 g/day eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or 4x1g placebo capsules/day for 12 weeks.  A final 3 week washout phase will follow in which subjects cease taking the capsules.  Subjects will record daily blood pressure (BP) at home using an automated BP device for the 18 week trial.  Fasted blood samples will be taken every three weeks, commencing at week 0.  Subjects will undergo a cold pressor test, a hand grip test, and reactive hyperaemic response with measurements of BP, blood flow and heart rate variability at weeks 1, 3 and then at 3 weekly intervals.</interventions>
    <comparator>Data obtained from hypertensive subjects will be compared to data obtained from normotensive subjects.  Hypertensive and normotensive subjects randomised to receive omega-3 fatty acids will be compared to hypertensive and normotensive subjects randomised to receive placebo.  The trial will be double blinded.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Subjects are not eligible to participate if they are currently taking medication to lower their blood pressure, are on a special diet eg. Atkins diet, Lo-Carbo diet and Zone diet, or have a high level of daily exercise.

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are informed that this is a double-blinded, randomised, placebo controlled trial during the consent process.  Capsules are packaged into containers that have no identifiers for the capsule content.  Students working with the subjects are blinded to the treatment group.  Treatment is allocated using randomisation software.</concealment>
    <sequence>To generate the random samples, software called R will be used.
