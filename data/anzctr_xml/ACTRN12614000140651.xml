  <interventions>
    <interventions>D-cycloserine (DCS) augmented intensive exposure therapy versus pill placebo and intensive exposure therapy. Participants receive three individual intensive exposure therapy sessions. Each intensive session will be 3 hours in duration and spaced one week apart. The sessions involve assisting participants to systematically and gradually face their fears whilst resisting any ritualising. There will be three conditions examining the timing of dosing DCS. One third of participants will be given DCS immediately prior to starting their intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment sessions and a placebo pill immediately following the session.One third of participants will be given a placebo pill immediately prior to starting their intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment sessions and DCS immediately following the session and one third of participants will be given a placebo pill immediately prior to starting their intensive cognitive-behavioural therapy treatment sessions and a placebo pill immediately following the session.Participants will remain in the same dosing conditions across all treatment sessions.The DCS dosage will be 35mg or 70mg depending on the child's weight. Children weighing 25kg to 45kg will receive 35mg DCS which equals a range of 1.4mg/kg to 0.78 mg/kg and children 46kg to 90kg, will be given a dose of 70mg, which equates to a range of 1.5mg/kg to 0.78mg/kg. Each dose is given orally in a capsule. The exposure therapy is delivered via trained psychologists.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine whether D-Cycloserine can augment graded exposure therapy for children and adolescents with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. D-Cycloserine is an antibiotic drug traditionally used to treat tuberculosis. D-Cycloserine is a glutamatergic partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, which has recently been shown to facilitate fear extinction in humans and animals and has also demonstrated to improve treatment outcome when combined with exposure therapy in social phobia, acrophobia, or fear of heights and OCD in adult samples. The drug has recently been used to augment exposure therapy for children and adolescents with OCD. A secondary aim of the study is to systematically examine the timing of D-Cycloserine augmentation in a pediatric sample by comparing D-Cycloserine given immediately before or immediately after exposure therapy.</summary>
