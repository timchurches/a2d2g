  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ovarian reserve is an estimate of the number of oocytes in the ovary.  Anti-mullerian Hormone is thought to be one of the best measures of ovarian reserve.  Despite this the assay is not widely available and Adelaide is the only city in Australia that provides this test mainly in a research setting.  It is not routinely used to assess ovarian reserve after ovarian surgery.
A blood test for Anti-mullerian hormone will be taken immediately prior to surgery then at 6 weeks and 3 months after surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women who have laparoscopic surgery that does not involve ovarian surgery and a blood test will be taken immediately before surgery and again at 6 weeks and 3 months after.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1)women with regular natural menstrual cycles or on COC contraceptive
Women on the combined oral contraceptive can be included as recent data shows that AMH levels are not altered by the pill.
2)women undergoing an laparoscopic gynaecological procedure. 
 The inclusion criteria has been modified to include women more than 13 years of age who are having natural menstrual cycles and can give informed assent with parental consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1) women unable or unwilling to independently give informed consent to participate in this study.
2)Women on medications that interfere with AMH levels.
3)Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (AMH levels are high)
4)Women with malignant pathology.
5)Women who are deemed unsuitable to participate in this study as assessed by their lead clinician.</exclusivecriteria>
