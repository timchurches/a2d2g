  <interventions>
    <interventions>For patients who have Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Type 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer, which has metastasised to the brain, the main treatment options for these brain metastases are Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Neurosurgery (NS). Sometimes, if the metastases are small and are not causing any symptoms, they do not require any immediate treatment and will be observed.  
The purpose of the study is to determine 1) How likely the tumour/s are controlled after treatment with local therapies Neurosurgery (NS) and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and 2) How likely is it that other tumours develop at new sites in the brain when no Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) is given.

The local treatment offered will be determined by the patients doctor in consultation with the site multidisciplinary team and will be dependent on the size and location of the brain metastases. Each treatment will be performed by the specialist in that field, i.e. neurosurgeon and/or radiation oncologist.
Neurosurgery: The decision whether or not to recommend neurosurgery will be made independently of this research study. The surgery may be performed up to 6 weeks before participant being registered on the trial or up to 4 weeks after registration. The complexity and length of the surgery depends on the size and location of the tumour(s).
Sometimes stereotactic radiosurgery is required to be delivered to the cavity left after the metastasis has been removed (also known as a cavity boost). Timing of Cavity SRS is at the discretion of the treating team. SRS cavity boost must be given after registration and can be given up to 8 weeks after NS resection.
Stereotactic Radiosurgery: If the participant will be receiving stereotactic radiosurgery (either alone or in combination with neurosurgery), the Radiation Oncologist will organise for the participant to have a Radiotherapy planning. Treatment is to commence within 4 weeks of study registration. 
The size, number and location of the brain metastasis will determine the dose and fractionation schedule of radiotherapy. Single metastasis, smaller than or equal to 2cm, may require 1 fraction. Alternately, multiple metastasis, metastasis in the brain stem, or those bigger than 2cm will required multiple fractions to treat.  The dose range for the study is 20Gy/1 fraction to 24Gy/3 fractions. Each fraction is given on a separate day.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size consideration:
The sample size of 50 patients is pragmatic, based on the number of patients expected to be recruited within 2 years. It is expected that up to 2 patients (4%) could be lost to follow-up prior to 1-year follow-up assessment resulting in 48 whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) evaluable patients.  Registered patients later found to be ineligible will be replaced. No other form of replacement is allowed.
If a 12 month WBRT rate above 50% is considered unacceptable, the current sample size of 48 WBRT evaluable patients will have 84% power for rejecting the null hypothesis that the true rate is 50% assuming the true underlying rate is 30% using a one-sided test for proportion with 5% alpha.

Statistical Analysis Plan:
All endpoints will be assessed after the last patients 12-month follow-up.
A one-sided test for proportions will be used to test whether the rate of WBRT at 12 months is less than 50%. The rate of patients being treated with WBRT within 1 year of local treatment will be estimated together with its exact two-sided 95% confidence interval.
Freedom from local, distant brain and distant extra cranial failure will be described as cumulative incidence curves assuming death as a competing risksevent for each endpoint assessed separatelly. Estimates at 12 months will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. Patients who are still on follow-up without any failure by the closeout date will be censored at the study closeout date. Distant prain failure incidence will also be assessed according to number of treated metastasis.
Pattern of first failure will be described using cumulative incidence curves assuming competing risks. Two separate pattern of first failure analysis will be provided. The first analysis will group the failures as local, distant brain, distant extra-cranial and death. The second analysis will group the failures as in-brain, distant extra-cranial and death.
An event chart will also be created showing the sequence of failures for each patient.
Overall survival will be described using Kaplan-Meier methods. The number of neurological and non-neurological deaths will be provided.
The maximum grade of each adverse event for each patient will be described in tabular form as counts and percentages. Use of corticosteroids will be reported as count and percentage.
A Llinear mixed models (LMM) will be used to assess MMSE. Time (as a factor) will be included as fixed effect while patient ID will be included as a random effect. No within-group correlation will be assumed and the model will be fitted by maximizing the restricted log-likelihood (REML). No imputation for missing values is intended. Means and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated from the LMM contrasts and presented in table format and graphically.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is aiming to recruit 50 participants that have HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer with 1-5 synchronous brain metastases, with at least one met requiring treatment.

The purpose of the study is to determine; 
1.	How likely the tumour/s are controlled after treatment with local therapies Neurosurgery (NS) and/or Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS). 
2.	How likely is it that other tumours develop at new sites in the brain when no Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT) is given. 

Study Details: For patients who have HER2 positive breast cancer which has spread to the brain (metastasised), the main treatment options for these brain metastasis are Whole Brain Radiotherapy (WBRT), Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and Neurosurgery (NS)
Participants will be given either SRS or surgery or a combination of both depending on the particular features of each tumour. 
All participants will be followed up at regular 3 monthly intervals for 12 months after completing thier trial treatment (i.e. from the day of their last SRS treatment or of neurosurgery, the latter of the two). 
At each follow-up visit they will have a clinic visit with the study doctor who to assess any symptoms, record current medications and/or surgeries, monitor their brain metastasis, have a blood test and imaging (CT scan, a bone scan and MRI brain).
