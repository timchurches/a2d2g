  <interventions>
    <interventions>Application of silver fluoride on tooth surfaces affected by dental decay.
Silver fluoride (40% AgF and stannous fluoride 10%) in liquid form. 
A small amount of silver fluoride is painted onto tooth surfaces with a small brush.
Applications are performed once every 8 months, ie, at the baseline , 8 months and 16 months.
Maximum three applications per child during the study period.
The follow-up examination is at 24 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment:
Conventional atraumatic restorative technique with Glass-Iono-Cement (GIC) dental materials. 
GICs are common dental materials that attach to tooth surfaces by chemical bonding. It can release fluoride.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Failure of treatment: % with pain, abscess, extractions, mean number of tooth surfaces with failure of treatment.

Outcome will be assessed by clinical assessment and information collection from patients' case notes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of new carious lesions.

Estimated by comparing the information collected in clinical assessments at baseline and follow-up.
Net caries increment will be estimated using the standard method in longitudinal dental caries research (Slade et al, Community Dent Oral Epidemiol 1999; 27: 236-48).
New carious events are defined as change from perviously sound tooth surface to decayed, filled or missing because of decay tooth surfaces.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to address the lack of high level evidence to support the use of silver fluoride application as an accepted community treatment intervention for deciduous dental caries.
Hypotheses:
That silver fluoride and atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) are equally effectively in successfully managing untreated cavitated dental caries in the primary dentition.
That silver fluoride has an additional benefit of reducing future development of new dental caries relative to ART.
Aim:
1. To evaluate the effectiveness of silver fluoride applications in minimizing negative sequelae of dental caries in young children compared with ART.
2. To evaluate the preventive effect on the development of new carious lesions of silver fluoride compared with ART.</summary>
