  <interventions>
    <interventions>This double-blind, placebo-controlled study will examine the efficacy of modafinil to counteract possible daytime sleepiness after one night of CPAP withdrawal in long-term CPAP users.

Sleep-wake activity on CPAP use will be assessed for 5 days using actigraphy. On the 5th night subjects will withdrew from CPAP treatment and use a nasal airflow device as a substitute. The following morning, subjects will report to the laboratory and received modafinil (200 mg).  EEG will be assessed continuously and then a 30 min driving simulation task (STISIM TM) will be completed 2 hours post drug administration. After a washout period of 14 days, subjects will repeat the protocol, receiving the other study medication.</interventions>
