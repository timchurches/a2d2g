  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants assigned to the intervention arm will receive a two-day (approximately 8 hours per day), modularised psychological skills training (PST) package. The program will be delivered to members in groups of 20-40 individuals; it is anticipated that the intervention will be delivered to approximately 15 member groups or units. All sessions will be delivered face to face by a facilitation team that includes two experienced human performance specialists (with Masters/PhD level educational training in sport psychology) and at least 1 co-facilitator (member of the Canadian Armed Forces who has received specialist training in the content and delivery of the intervention package). All intervention sessions will be delivered at formal training facilities of the Canadian Armed Forces using a PowerPoint package displayed on a projector screen and hardcopy manual for participants. The same two human performance specialists will lead the delivery of the intervention, adhering to a single training protocol to ensure standardised delivery in terms of structure and content across member groups. The co-facilitators will vary depending on their availability throughout the intervention period. The PST package includes education delivered by human performance specialists, videos of current members who discuss their experiences with specific psychological skills, breakout sessions for participants to engage in discussion with peers, and practical skill exercises where participants test out strategies taught in the education component. In terms of content, the PST program incorporates modules on stress and activation; activation management; confidence; self-talk; imagery; goal setting; routines; attention control; recovery; mindfulness; and self-regulation. Participants will be provided with a hardcopy course pack including all PowerPoint slides and exercises used during the training package. 

As the training program is delivered by the same two human performance specialists, the intervention will be rolled out sequentially over a period of approximately 8 months. Units who have expressed an interest in this study will be provided with a schedule in which 2-day blocks are dispersed across the study period in approximately 20 cohorts. For each cohort, there will be two dates available, which will be represented as A (intervention) or B (waitlist control). Group A will receive the intervention at the start of the block, whereas Group B will receive the intervention after the post-assessments have been completed. Unit training coordinators will choose from these available options as to when they can complete the training by selecting their chosen date. Units will have no visibility as to whether the option they have chosen is the intervention or waitlist control (i.e., blinded); all they will see are the dates offered and the closing date for sign-up to each cohort, which is 2 weeks prior to the date allocated to Group A (i.e., receives the intervention as part of the study).

Co-facilitators will receive specialist training prior to the roll out of the intervention. This training will involve between 3-5 serials or iterations, depending on requirements and availability of personnel. The co-facilitator training will occur over a period of 5 days, and will include in-person training in which we cover the entire training content (with time for review/questions for each module); and 2 days of adult education content with practical public speaking practice and a pass/fail evaluation component where each participant delivers part of the course content to their peers, and is provided a score and feedback.
The training is delivered in person, using an interactive approach comprised of PowerPoint presentations, individual self-reflective exercises, group discussion, video, and practical teaching/public speaking exercises. The training will be delivered by a team of mental performance specialists (with masters or PhD level training) who developed the intervention program.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported psychological skill usage: the frequency with which participants employ psychological strategies (e.g., goal setting, self-talk, imagery, relaxation techniques) for the purpose of influencing performance positively in a training or operational context. For the purposes of this study, instructions and item-stems of the Test of Performance Strategies (Hardy et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 1999) will be revised to reflect the nature of military training and operations for operator constituents and specialists and in training and garrison context for supporters, as compared to sport competition and practice.

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 382 participants (n = 191 in each arm) is required to provide 90% power (a = .05) to detect the smallest effect size of interest (d = .30) in a non-clustered analysis. We adjusted the required sample size in order to take into account the clustered nature of the data. A conservative estimate of the ICC as .012 (doi: 10.1037/apl0000021) and approximate group size of 30 individuals results in a design effect of 1.35 (N = 516). Allowing an attrition rate of 10% between pre- and post-assessments, we would require a total sample of 568 members.

We will use latent growth modeling (LGM) in Mplus 8 (Muthén &amp; Muthén, 2015) with maximum likelihood estimation and accounting for clustering effects (TYPE = COMPLEX function) to determine the amount of individual change between the two time points (Voelkle, 2007). LGM encompasses participants starting point (intercept) and change between assessment points (slope) for each individual, thereby permitting an examination of intra-individual change over time as well as inter-individual differences in intra-individual change. Experimental group (intervention versus control) dummy coded and included in the analysis as a predictor of the intercept and slope factors. This analysis framework will be used individually for all primary and secondary outcomes variables.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mental skills training has been shown to influence positively various outcomes including performance, confidence, and emotional control among athletes of many sport types and competitive levels. Only recently has similar interest been dedicated to understanding the effectiveness of mental skills training among military populations. Military is comprised of well trained personnel equipped to conduct high-risk operations, often at a moments notice. The operational and training tempo required to sustain this high-risk, high-value activity inevitably imparts both physical and psychological demands on individual members. Yet to date, there have few efforts directed towards evaluating the effectiveness of mental skills training for military personnel. As such, the primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental skills training program in improving psychological factors that underpin performance and well-being, namely, resilience, mental toughness, self-efficacy and psychological skill usage (e.g., imagery, goal-setting, self-talk, attentional control, relaxation, emotional control, activation management) in a sample of active military members. It is hypothesised that the intervention will increase participants use of mental skills and associated psychological factors at 6 weeks post training when compared with a waitlist control group. </summary>
