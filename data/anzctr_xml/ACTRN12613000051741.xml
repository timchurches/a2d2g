  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be given a single (or pair depending if symptoms are bilateral) full-length shoe stiffening insert. The shoe insert will be fabricated from ~1 mm semi-rigid carbon graphite (Otto Bock Springlite Carbon Foot Plates [Registered Trademark]) and will have the following design characteristics: (i) full length, in that the insert extends from the heel to the tip of the toes, (ii) no arch build-up or contour at the heel. 

Participants will be advised to wear the shoe insert(s) in the shoe(s) they most frequently wear, and this will differ on a case by case basis.

The intervention will be used for the entire duration of the trial (3 months).

    <statisticalmethods>Multiple imputation will be used to replace missing data. Participants treated for bilateral first metatarsophalangeal joint osteoarthritis will be asked to describe symptoms without specific reference to an individual foot (i.e. bilateral pain will be evaluated as one independent sample).  Descriptive data will be determined.  One-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni-adjusted post-hoc tests will be used for comparisons of the outcome measurements of foot pain, foot-related disability (function), and level of physical disability between the initial (baseline) and the one month and three month (primary end-point) time-points (for normally distributed data). Differences in plantar pressures between the shoe only versus shoe plus shoe-stiffening insert at baseline and at 3 months will be assessed using paired samples t-tests (for normally distributed data). Non-normally distributed data will be analysed using non-parametric tests.  P-values &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Project aim:
The aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness and tolerability of full-length shoe-stiffening inserts for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the big-toe joint of the foot.  

Rationale:
Osteoarthritis of the big-toe joint is common and painful.  Although full-length shoe-stiffening inserts are a recommended treatment for this condition, the evidence supporting their use is lacking.
