  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants were randomized to receive either placebo or Acipimox (Aci) capsules each week (two 250 mg capsules of Aci or placebo; 500 mg total  5-methylpyrazine-2-carboxylic acid 4-oxide, molecular weight: 154.1, Olbetam capsules, Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) 1 hour before a single exercise bout, e.g. two capsules each week for a total of 2 weeks. A low- to moderate-intensity exercise bout on an electromagnetically braked bicycle ergometer (Cateye EC 1600, Japan) was performed for 45 min at power output 2W/kg of lean body mass (LBM), intended to be below the aerobic-anaerobic threshold. The exercise was performed individually but all participants during the exercise were connected personally with their nurses and attending physicians. Healthy women were also feature in this study. This is a second arm of the study consisting of matched, healthy controls. Healthy women also took the placebo or Aci capsules.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The exercise with Acipimox administration resulted in plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (p &lt; 0.001)increase higher in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients and a decrease in the plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels in both groups. The falling of plasma ACTH (p &lt; 0.01) levels in the post-exercise recovering phase (90-minute) with Acipimox administration is more expressed in BN patients. Baseline plasma ACTH and FFA levels were similar in BN patients and the controls. A blood sample was collected at the beginning (baseline values) and in the course (after 45-minute exercise with Acipimox administration) of the experiment to estimate plasma ACTH and FFA concentrations. Blood samples were collected into chilled polypropylene tubes containing Na2EDTA and antilysin. Plasma was separated immediately by centrifugation at 4 oC and stored at -80 oC until being assayed. Participants started their 45 min exercise alone or exercise after Acipimox administration, assigned randomly 60 minutes before exercise for two consecutive weeks. Plasma ACTH concentrations were measured by a commercial RIA kit (Immunotech, Inc., Prague, Czech Republic). Plasma FFA were estimated colorimetrically with a commercial kit (Randox Laboratories, FA 115, Montpellier, France). All assays were run twice in duplicate.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The initial aim of the study was  to examine either the effects of administration of anti-lipolytic drug Acipimox or placebo during short-term exercise on plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients and healthy women. The secondary aim was to find whether FFA are involved in exercise-induced ACTH release in BN and the controls. Healthy women were also feature in this study.</summary>
