  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing cardiac surgery for coronary artery bypass or valve repair/replacement are at risk of a number of complications. One of the most common complications is atrial fibrillation (AF), or abnormal contraction of the upper chamber of the heart, which occurs in about 30% to 55% of patients, depending on the type of surgery. While AF itself is not particularly dangerous, it does lead to increased length of stay in hospital, with associated costs, and also increases the risk of stroke. Patients suffering from post-surgical AF are generally prescribed additional medications, some of which can have unpleasant side effects. The purpose of this study is to determine whether fish oil given prior to surgery reduces the risk of developing AF after surgery. We also plan to investigate a number of mechanisms by which fish oil may exert its cardio-protective properties</summary>
