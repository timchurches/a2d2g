  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time interval from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. In absence of confirmation of death, survival time was censored at the earlier of the last date the participant was known to be alive or the study cut-off date. The cut-off date for the final analysis of OS was the date when the 988th death had been observed. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline up to death due to any cause or study cut-off date, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: 48 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was evaluated from date of randomization to date of first documentation of any of the events: 1) Radiological tumor progression: as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1: at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions (sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of =5 mm) taking as reference the smallest sum while on study, appearance of one or more new lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing non target lesions, 2) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) progression: =25% increase over baseline/nadir value if baseline PSA =10 ng/mL; or 25% increase above the baseline level if baseline PSA &gt;0 ng/mL &amp; &lt;10 ng/mL; or post-baseline value of &gt;=2 ng/mL, if baseline PSA=0 ng/mL, 3) Pain progression: increase of =1 point in median Present Pain Intensity (PPI) from nadir or =25% increase in mean analgesic score (AS) from baseline score or requirement of local palliative radiotherapy, 4) Death. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Tumor Progression - Time to Tumor progression was defined as the first occurrence of radiological tumor progression according to RECIST 1.1. Radiological tumor progression was defined at least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions (sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of =5 mm) taking as reference the smallest sum while on study, appearance of one or more new lesions, or unequivocal progression of existing non target-lesions. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline up to tumor progression or death due to any cause or study cut-off date, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: 48 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Overall Objective Tumor Response - Overall objective tumor response was defined as either a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria, as assessed by the investigator. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must had reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline up to DP or death due to any cause or study cut-off date, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: 48 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to PSA Progression - Time to PSA progression was time interval between randomization &amp; first occurrence of PSA progression. PSA progression defined as: 1) PSA responders (&gt;50% decline from baseline PSA =10 ng/mL): increase of =25% (=2 ng/mL) over nadir value, confirmed by second PSA =3 weeks later; 2) PSA non-responders (did not achieve &gt;50% decline from baseline PSA =10 ng/mL): increase of =25% (=2 ng/mL) over baseline value, confirmed by second PSA =3 weeks later; 3) In participants not eligible for PSA response (baseline PSA &lt;10 ng/mL): (a) participants with baseline PSA &gt;0 ng/mL &amp; &lt;10 ng/mL: increase in PSA by 25% (=2 ng/mL) above baseline level, confirmed by second PSA value =3 weeks apart; (b) participants with baseline value=0 ng/mL: post-baseline PSA value =2 ng/mL. Note (for 1-3): Rise in PSA in first 12 weeks was progression only if met definition above and was associated with other sign of DP or if it continued beyond 12 weeks. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

      <timepoint>From baseline up to PSA progression or death due to any cause or study cut-off date, whichever was earlier (maximum duration: 48 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Pain Progression - Pain Progression was defined as an increase of =1 point in the median PPI from its nadir confirmed by a second assessment at least 3 weeks later or =25 % increase in the mean AS compared with the baseline score confirmed by a second assessment at least 3 weeks later or requirement for local palliative radiotherapy. PPI was rated by participant in a diary using a scale of 0=no pain, 1=mild, 2=discomforting, 3=distressing, 4=horrible 5=excruciating. Analgesic use was recorded by the participant in a diary. AS was calculated from the analgesic use data based on a table of analgesic medications, with non-narcotic medications assigned a value of 1 point and narcotic medications assigned a value of 4 points. Analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      - To demonstrate the non inferiority in term of overall survival (OS) of Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m²
      (Arm A) versus Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² (Arm B) in combination with prednisone in participants
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) previously treated with a
      docetaxel-containing regimen.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms and to assess if Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² was
           better tolerated than Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m².

        -  To compare efficacy of Cabazitaxel at 20 mg/m² and 25 mg/m² for:

             -  Progression Free Survival (PFS) defined as the first occurrence of any of the
                following events: tumor progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
                Tumors (RECIST), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, pain progression or
                death due to any cause;

             -  PSA Progression;

             -  Pain progression;

             -  Tumor response in participants with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1);

             -  PSA response;

             -  Pain response in participants with stable pain at baseline.

        -  To compare Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL).

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenomics of Cabazitaxel.</summary>
