  <interventions>
    <interventions>Confocal endomicroscopy - an endoscopic procedure that incorporates a laser microscope on the tip of the endoscope - visualising the microscopic structure of the gut lining. The confocal laser microscope enlarges the mucosa image by 1,000-fold. The procedure is performed using standard sedation procedure. Procedure duration lasts for 15 - 30 minutes, similar to a standard colonoscopy. 

Inflammatory bowel disease patients requiring colonoscopy will be invited to participate. All patients will be assessed for clinical disease activity (CDAI or Mayo), biomarkers of inflammation (ESR, CRP), medical and surgical therapy. Controls will be non-IBD patients requiring colonoscopy eg for screening for family history, minor gastrointestinal symptoms where IBD is finally excluded, Fe deficiency where an alternative diagnosis is eventually made (eg menorrhagia). All subjects undergo confocal endomicroscopy. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-IBD controls are people requiring colonoscopy with final exclusion of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Group age- and sex- matched controls will be used. Examples include patients presenting for endoscopy for investigation of Fe studies. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine if confocal endomicroscopy identifies leaky gut in inflammatory bowel diseases compared with non-IBD controls. Confocal endomicroscopy incorporates a microscope on the tip of a conventional endoscope. The colonoscopy will be conducted as per normal practice. We will then use the laser microscope on consented patients to obtained further information on the bowel lining. Leaky gut is visualised using the high power magnification of the confocal scope but plays no part in the decision process of patient treatment, as so far we do not know what it contributes towards prediction of disease course. The amount of images demonstrating leaky gut is compared between Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and controls at baseline. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline - cross sectional. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reversibility of leaky gut with treatment will be assessed using the same confocal endomicroscopy technique. Patients requiring follow up confocal colonoscopy have have the leaky gut remeasured to determine if interval change has occurred - whether leaky gut has progressed, remained stable or worsened. This is correlated with whether treatment escalation was required. Only standard treatment for IBD as deemed clinically required will be administered. Confocal endomicroscopy will play no role in deciding whether treatment is to be changed. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Indefinite: patients are invited to return to have repeat confocal endomicroscopy to determine reversibility of leaky gut. Typically, chronic patients require yearly colonoscopy to exclude the development of cancers - hence this protocol may be incorporated into these patients for their return procedures. Others require less frequent colonoscopy - eg only if they flare or require a follow up to demonstrate healing after changing their treatments.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Leaky gut is a possible precipitant of inflammatory bowel diseases. We determine whether leaky gut can be identified in patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in comparison with non-IBD controls using confocal endomicroscopy, which can identify microscopic barrier function of the bowel mucosa. Patients are followed longitudinally to determine if they improve or flare requiring treatment escalation.</summary>
