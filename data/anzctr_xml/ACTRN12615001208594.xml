    <statisticalmethods>PK Analysis:
On the basis of the concentration-time data, the following pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated for acetaminophen and ibuprofen from the plasma concentration against time data, using a non-compartmental model:
AUC(0-t): The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method.
AUC(0-8): The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from zero to infinity.  AUC(0-8) is calculated as the sum of the AUC(0-t) plus the ratio of the last measurable concentration to the elimination rate constant (Ct/Kel).
Cmax:	Maximum measured plasma concentration directly obtained from the 			experimental data of plasma concentration versus time curves, without 			interpolation.
Tmax:	Time of maximum measured plasma concentration.  If the maximum 			value occurs at more than one point, Tmax is defined as the time of the 			first occurrence.
T1/2:	Time required for the plasma drug concentration to decrease by one half. 		This value is estimated from the elimination rate constant (Kel) calculated from the slope of the linear relationship between the loge concentration and time during the terminal elimination phase.
Plasma concentrations for each formulation at each time and the pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarised using standard descriptive statistics, including means, medians, geometric means, ranges, inter-quartile ranges, standard deviations and standard errors.
PK Interaction Criteria:
The ratios used to test bioequivalence will be calculated from loge transformed data for Cmax, AUC(0-t).   and AUC(0-8).  This data will be analysed using ANOVA, the model to include terms for participant, period and formulation.  The differences between the loge means and the 90% confidence interval of the difference derived from the residual variance from the ANOVA model, will be back-transformed to estimate the ratio of the two formulations with the 90% confidence interval of this ratio. 
Additional statistical comparisons between formulations/administration will be undertaken for t1/2 and Tmax, t1/2 will be compared using ANOVA with terms for participant, period and formulation. Tmax will be compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. These comparisons will be summarised as mean ratios and differences with appropriate confidence intervals. A two-tailed p-value &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance. 
Safety Endpoints:
AEs will be collected for all randomised participants and will be listed with type of AE, severity and relationship for each treatment group, using the safety population.  Safety data will be summarised for each formulation using frequencies and percentages (% of participants with each specific AE). Known NSAID specific AEs maybe compared between formulations using Fishers exact tests and chi-square tests as appropriate when frequencies are sufficient. 
The haematology and biochemistry data collected pre-study and after each period will be summarised descriptively using means, medians, standard deviations, ranges and frequencies and percentages as appropriate. Individual values outside normal ranges and considered clinically significant will be individually listed. Comparisons of the haematology and biochemistry measures associated with each formulation maybe compared between formulations using repeated measures ANOVA and McNemars chi-square tests.
Sample size calculation:
A similar previous study exploring the bioequivalence of acetaminophen solutions provided estimates of the within-subject CV% of 12% and 4% for Cmax and AUC(0-8), respectively. Assuming the CV% is no more than 15% in this study, then a sample size of 30 participants will provide 90% power to detect bioequivalence between intravenous acetaminophen and intravenous ibuprofen and the respective two component of the fixed dose combination of acetaminophen 1000mg + ibuprofen 300mg/ 100mL infusion</statisticalmethods>
