  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to develop a Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy, web-based intervention for depression for employed people, and then apply it to a group of employed participants to determine whether this assists with recovery from depression and increase work productivity. It is expected that participants will show improvement in depressive symptoms and increased work productivity from pre- to post-treatment intervention.</summary>
