    <interventions>Arm 1: Exercise
Arm 2: Manual therapy and exercise

Exercise: 36 x 30 minute exercise sessions over an 18 week period at an average rate of 2x/week. Administered by respiratory physiotherapists. Exercise consists of gentle aerobic exercise routines.
Manual Therapy: 15 x 20 minute manual therapy sessions over a 6 week period at an average rate of 2-3x/week. Administered by chiropractors and/or osteopaths. Manual therapy consists of massage and thoracic spinal manipulation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active Control: Standardised exercise regime for COPD.
This program is the exercise component of the existing pulmonary rehabilitation program at Sutherland Hospital. It consists of a mix of aerobic, resistance &amp; flexibility exercises performed at moderate intensity

    <concealment>Volunteers, who meet the inclusion criteria will be given an information sheet and asked to sign the consent form. They will then undergo a screening for contra-indications to
thoracic spinal manipulation. After a volunteer has passed the screening test they will be enrolled in the trial and given a trial specific ID number. Baseline measurements for each participant will then be taken. Participants will then be allocated to one of the two trial groups according to a computer generated random number sequence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to measure the medium to long term effects on lung function, exercise capacity and quality of life of a new combination of interventions for people with COPD. The interventions are manual therapy and exercise. The rationale behind the study is that manual therapy delivers short-term improvements in respiratory mechanics which delays the onset of exercise-induced breathlessness. This permits an increase in exercise performance and ultimately exercise capacity. As exercise capacity is an indicator of mortality in COPD, any increase represents an improvement in the long-term prognosis of the disease.</summary>
