  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blind, randomised, cross-over study in overweight/obese women (Body Mass Index (BMI) 25-32kg/m2). This study is in two parts and will investigate (i) the effect of dairy beverages compared with zero energy water beverages, using a dose-escalating 4 treatment design, and (ii) the effect of dairy beverages compared with carbohydrate (CHO) -containing beverages, using a dose-escalating 6 treatment design. Both studies will be carried out using identical protocols and participant groups. A single test beverage (500ml) will be given on each study day. The trial beverages will be administered after a standardised evening meal and a standardised breakfast meal. The evening meal to be consumed the night before each treatment day (between 6-9pm) and the breakfast meal provided on the morning of the treatment are given in an attempt to minimise any carry-over effects of foods consumed prior to the intervention. The evening meals are given to the participants at their screen visit or study visit with clear instructions on how to store the meal and also how to prepare it. The breakfast meal is provided at the Human Nutrition Unit on the morning of the intervention at 9am. Specifically, the trial will measure the participants thoughts of hunger and fullness throughout a single day, and measure food intake at an ad libitum buffet style lunch meal given 120 minutes after the test beverage. Study visits to be separated by a wash-out period of at least 3 days.

Test Beverages:

Study 1 Dairy Beverage Dose Escalation Study: 
Control zero energy water beverage (0g dairy whey protein).
Low dose (1%, 5g dairy whey protein)
Medium dose (2%, 10g dairy protein), and 
High dose (4%. 20g dairy whey protein)dairy beverages.
Participants will be ramdomized to recieve all 4 beverages detailed above over 4 study days. There must be at least 3 days between study visits. Participants are free to choose which days they come in to the unit so the study duration will be from 2 weeks to a couple of months if participants can only come in one day per week.

Study 2 Dairy Beverage vs CHO Study: Control zero energy water beverage (0g dairy whey protein; 0g CHO)
Medium (2%, 10g dairy protein), and
High dose (4%, 20g dairy protein) dairy beverages.
Low (2%, 10g CHO)
Medium (4%, 20g CHO), and
High dose (10%, 50g CHO) carbohydrate beverages.

Participants will be ramdomized to recieve all 6 beverages detailed above over 6 study days. There must be at least 3 days between study visits. Participants are free to choose which days they come in to the unit so the study duration will be from 3 weeks to a few months if participants can only come in one day per week.
The protein component will consist of a whey protein and the carbohydrate will be
sucrose (=table sugar).

Participants may take part in both study 1 and study 2. Participants may also just partcipate in either study 1 or study 2.

If participants do wish to take part in both studies the minimum washout period between the studys is 3 days.</interventions>

These time points are set assuming t=0 is the time beverage comsumption commences. Therefore any negative timepoints refer to a VAS measurement taken that many minutes beftore the beverage is consumed. Positive timepoints are for VAS measurements at that number of minutes after the beverage consumption commences.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is fast becoming an epidemic. A major initiative in the prevention of weight gain is to increase the satiating (=feelings of fullness) properties of food, whereby individuals naturally reduce their energy intake without having to consciously diet. Currently there is little information available as to the satiating effects of the different macronutrients within drinks. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of dairy beverages on subjective ratings of hunger and fullness, and energy intake at a subsequent meal in a group of overweight women.</summary>
