  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis is one of the most common forms of arthritis. Pain, the main symptom, is poorly controlled by current treatment strategies. Pain is thought initially to originate from structural changes in an affected joint. However, after a while, in some people, changes occur in the nervous system that perpetuate the pain. These changes are referred to as pain sensitisation. They are not addressed by current treatments.
Amitriptyline is commonly used to treat pain related to pain sensitisation, such as in shingles or diabetic neuropathy.
This study is a randomised controlled trial of the use of amitriptyline, in addition to usual care, to manage pain in people with painful knee osteoarthritis.
People with knee osteoarthritis will be randomised to receiving low dose amitriptyline or a placebo with many of the same side effects of the active drug, benztropine. They will be followed for 12 weeks to determine the effect of amitriptyline on pain, function and other symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.</summary>
