  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will ingest the disposable Given ESO oesophageal video capsule to asses their oesophagus. After a brief 3 hour fast the patient swallows the video capsule (26x11mm) with a small amount of liquid. Images are captured via sticky electrodes attached to the chest. The procedure will take approximately 20 mins and the patient may return to usual activities immediately after. The images are downloaded onto a computer and a report is created. The patient is to observe their stools and if the capsule is not sighted within 2 weeks an abdominal xray will be arranged to confirm passage. Although safe one of the risks is capsule retention in the bowels and if found the patient will be reviewed in clinic and likely have follow up xrays after a further period and if it remains insitu consideration to endoscopic or surgical removal.

It is a single diagnostic procedure however if the images are poor a repeat examination may be undertaken.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ability of ESO capsule to asses for GORD in the study population. This will be assesed by interpretation within clinical consultation, standardised reflux questionaire and further clinical investigations eg endoscopy, as clinically indicated as per current best practice.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After review of the images of the capsule study and clinical information this will be assesed.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability of the ESO capsule in the study population. This will be assesed by a post ingestion questionaire and whether the capsule passes by the 2 week mark without complication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks after ingestion.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gastroesophageal reflux is an important cause of lung transplant rejection and so it is important to diagnose and treat in patients who hvae undergone or are to undergo transplantation. The Given ESO oesophageal capsule is a non-invasive disposable capsule endoscopy system which allows examination of the oesophagus. It has been trialled in many populations but not yet in the proposed study population.</summary>
