  <interventions>
    <interventions>The below described intervention will occur over 12 months for each participating residential aged care facility, The first group of participating sites began in December 2015 and the second group of participating sites will be beginning in June 2016. The study intervention will therefore be completed by June 2017.

Intervention: Multifaceted interdisciplinary education to increase vitamin D supplementation and reduce falls for older people in residential aged care facilities.

Educational information will be provided to all stakeholder groups in various formats. GPs, pharmacists and allied health staff will receive 4-5 newsletters throughout the duration of the intervention to report audit outcomes, provide education and to provide links to online materials. Each participating site will also receive these newsletters in addition to printed educational materials. This will include brochures and posters suitable for residents and their families and more detailed written information for nursing staff. A short educational film will also be made available to all sites who will be encouraged to show this to their residents and their families. Site management, nursing and care staff will also be encouraged to attend a 1 hour face-to-face group seminar delivered by the study officer at each site focused on providing information on the role, sources and recommended use of vitamin D supplements. All of these resources will be made available to participating sites within the first 4 months of the intervention.

6 monthly feedback of vitamin D supplement use prevalence for each participating facility.

Identification of a local leader and use of an expert opinion leader to disseminate information to stakeholders of participating facilities.

Support for the identification and execution of quality improvement opportunities to increase best practice vitamin D supplement use by residents. This will occur through discussions with the nominated key contact/s of each site both face to face and over the phone. Initial discussions will take place over the first 6 months of the intervention, with a plan to decide on a course of action at the end of this period once prevalence data has been reviewed and potential barriers have been identified.  

Anonymous staff surveys and online questionnaires to measure knowledge, confidence and satisfaction. Anonymous resident and family questionnaires

Adherence to the above mentioned interventions will be measured by recording what was scheduled (E.g. face-to-face education), by taking attendance at sessions and via check in calls with key contacts to ascertain what has been achieved onsite (e.g. are educational posters and brochures on display, has the video been shown to residents and family members, have quality improvement plans been devised and has action been taken).
</interventions>
    <comparator>No intervention - standard care involving usual daily activities and care practices of each participating aged care facility without the influence of education, resources or facilitated quality improvement on vitamin D supplements..

This research encompasses a stepped wedge study design with the first half of participating facilities commencing the intervention at baseline and the second half of participating facilities commencing the intervention at six months. No intervention will be provided to the second half of facilities for the first six months and this will act as the comparator/control group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prevalence of adequate vitamin D supplement use, defined as equal to, or more than, 800IU/day. This will be assessed by collecting period prevalence data every six months from pharmacy databases that service participating sites. This will provide medication chart information for residents at participating sites throughout the duration of the intervention. All information collected will be de-identified.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Period prevalence points for data to be collected will be set for 1 week just before the start of the intervention, at the 6 month mark (baseline for the second wedge), 12 month mark (6 month mark for the second wedge) and the 18 month mark (to assess sustainability for the first wedge and prevalence at the end of the 12 month intervention for the second wedge sites). This equates to 4 separate collection points of the same information for all participating sites. This will assess rates prior to the intervention and allow for comparison between Wedge A and Wedge B participating facilities.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of falls. This will be assessed by collecting the total number of falls that have occurred over each 6 month period in each participating site and dividing it by the number of occupied bed days to report as number of falls per 1000 occupied bed days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Number of falls will be reported from pre-existing incident report databases routinely kept by each participating site. The number of falls will be collected for the previous 6 month period at baseline, 6 months (baseline for the second wedge), 12 months (6 months for the second wedge) and 18 months (12 months for the second wedge). This will total 4 collection points and data for 24 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of fallers, defined as the number of residents that have had at least 1 fall during each 6 month period. The number of new admissions during each period will be recorded to estimate the number of residents present in each facility during each 6 month period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Number of fallers will also be reported from incident report databases routinely kept by each participating site. The number of fallers will be collected for the previous 6 month period at baseline, 6 months (baseline for the second wedge), 12 months (6 months for the second wedge) and 18 months (12 months for the second wedge). This will total 4 collection points and data for 24 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The prevalence of other medication use potentially related to falls and fracture prevention. This will be assessed by collecting period prevalence data from a nominated week in time every six months from pharmacy databases that service participating sites. This will provide medication chart information for residents at participating sites throughout the duration of the intervention. All information collected will be de-identified and variables collected will include:

- Calcium Supplement (yes/no and dosage)
- Osteoporosis Medication (yes/no)
- Total number of oral medications
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Period prevalence points for data to be collected will be set for 1 week just before the start of the intervention, at the 6 months after intervention commencement (baseline for the second wedge), at 12 months (6 month mark for the second wedge) and at 18 months (to assess sustainability for the first wedge and prevalence at the end of the 12 month intervention for the second wedge sites). This equates to 4 separate collection points of the same information for all participating sites. This will assess rates prior to the intervention and allow for comparison between Wedge A and Wedge B participating facilities.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The feasibility of this multifaceted, interdisciplinary knowledge translation intervention will be determined by assessing the acceptability, fidelity and sustainability of the intervention. 
Acceptability by stakeholder groups will be assessed through collected questionnaires, specifically designed for this intervention. Fidelity will be measured by recruitment and retention, collecting attendance at face-to-face educational sessions, recording whether a key contact or working group was identified and participated throughout the duration of the intervention, recording whether quality improvement activities were identified and implemented and also whether resources were made available to various target groups. Sustainability will be assessed by the same measures beyond the 12 month intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaires will be provided to GPs, pharmacists, allied health and RACF staff at the beginning and again at the end of the 12 month intervention. Fidelity measures will be recorded throughout the duration of the intervention. Sustainability will be measured only for sites participating in the first wedge, at the 18 month mark (when the second wedge completes the 12 month intervention).

</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness and perceived appropriateness of education and information provided. This will measured in three ways:
- Via pre and post education questionnaires provided to RACF staff during face-to-face education. These questionnaires have been specifically designed for this intervention.
- Via questionnaires provided to GPs, pharmacists and allied health professionals as well as RACF staff. These questionnaires have been specifically designed for this intervention.
- Via a short feedback questionnaire made available to residents and their family members.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Face-to-face education will be provided to each site during the first 4 months of the intervention. Pre and post education questionnaires will be provided during this time. Two questionnaires will be provided to GPs, pharmacists and allied health, with one at the beginning of the intervention and another at the end of the intervention (after 12 months). The short feedback questionnaire will be available for residents, their family members and RACF staff throughout the duration of the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to promote widespread uptake of evidence based, best practice falls prevention in Australian residential aged care facilities. It is hypothesised that by employing implementation strategies such as education, conducting audits and facilitating system change to improve the timely identification of residents, we will see an increase in the use of vitamin D supplements by residents. It is anticipated that this will then assist with a reduction in falls over the long term in Australian residential aged care facilities.</summary>
