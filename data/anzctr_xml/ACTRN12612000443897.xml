    <interventions>Patients of T1b laryngeal cancer involving anterior vocal commissure(AVC) were treated with middle frontal horizontal partial laryngectomy(MFHPL) or anterior frontal vertical partial laryngectomy (AFVPL) . 
MFHPL: A window of cartilage was made by cuts from upper 1/3 (about 0.5 cm to the superior aspect of the cartilage) and lower 1/3 (about 0.5 cm to the inferior aspect of the cartilage) in the midline to the middle of the posterior aspects of the cartilage. Larynx was then entered by transecting the intralaryngeal mucosa/muscles through one of the cartilage incisions that was farther from the AVC, based on the anatomical relationship between the AVC and cartilage indicated by CT. The tumor was then resected under direct vision with tumor free margins of over 5 mm. Stitches entered at the upper cartilage lamina and came out at the lower vestibular mucosa, then entered at the lower aspect of thyroid cartilage lamina and came out at the subglottic mucosa. These four stitches were aligned and tied to close the larynx. 

AFVPL:The vertical outline was made along the anterior aspect of the thyroid lamina with 3-5 mm deviation towards the less involved side, and approximately 8-12 mm deviation towards the more severely involved side. A vertical incision was made with a saw on bilateral thyroid laminas. The laryngeal cavity was visualized and approached through the less involved side. The true and false cords interior to the frontolateral thyroid cartilage were resected along with subglottic soft tissues, with tumor margins of over 5 mm. Depending on the extent of the laryngeal defects, the laryngeal cavity was closed directly or reconstructed using sternohyoid myofascia (single or double pedicles), or sternohyoid perichondrium.

Both AFVPL and MFHPL are about 1 and a half hours procedure, performed once only.

The postoperative complications, voice quality and survival rates were evaluated and compared .</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum phonation time (MPT): MPT was evaluated in all patients 6 months post operation. Patients were asked to take one deep breath and then pronounce the vowel / a: / as long as possible at a comfortable pitch and loudness.

The maximum phonation time (MPT) after surgery were 12.42sec in the AFVPL-treated group; while in the MFHPL-treated patients they were 7.65  sec.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The patients were followed up for tumor recurrence and metastasis.This outcome was assessed  by enhance CT, MRI scan and biopsy.

In the MFHPL group, the follow-up time ranged from 15 to 120 months. A total of 20 patients were followed up for more than 3 years and 10 patients for more than 5 years with one patient lost. Tumor local recurrence occurred in four patients (13.3%) with one of them accompanied with neck lymph node metastasis. 

In the AFVPL group, all the patients were followed up for 20-130 months. A total of 28 patients were followed up for more than 3 years with 2 patients lost. Tumor local recurrence occurred in 4 patients (15%) with two of them accompanied with neck lymph node metastasis.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aspiration (This outcome was assessed  by  clinical symptoms of cough when drinking or eating and chest radiograph).


Four cases were found aspiration in the MFHPL group.
Five cases were found  aspiration in the AFVPL group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Laryngeal stenosis (This outcome was assessed  by clinical symptoms of dyspnea  and  electrolaryngendoscope )

No case were found laryngeal stenosis  in the MFHPL group.
Six cases were found laryngeal stenosis in the AFVPL group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months post surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pneumonia(This outcome was assessed  by clinical assessments and  chest radiograph).



Two cases were found pneumonia in the MFHPL group.
One case were found  pneumonia in the AFVPL group.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The clinical efficiency of current treatments for T1b laryngeal cancer involving AVC is not satisfactory. Clinical trial about MFHPL and AFVPL were carried out to improve the efficiency of these patients.  Both MFHPL and AFVPL could treat these patients effectively. however, MFHPL preserved an intact laryngeal framework, decreased the laryngeal wound, reduced the occurrence of laryngeal stenosis and improved the voice quality post surgery.The postoperative complications, glottic reconstruction, recurrence rate, voice quality and survival rates were evaluated and compared between two treatments.</summary>
