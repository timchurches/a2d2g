  <interventions>
    <interventions>A parallel group cross-sectional design will be used to compare the cognitive functioning of three independent groups.
1 Opiate-dependent subjects enrolled in MM treatment 
2 Currently opiate-dependent subjects not enrolled in MM treatment
3 Healthy controls without history of substance abuse.

Psychometric testing will be performed once with all participants and participants will have an Electroencephalography(EEG) on a single occasion to assess neurophysiological function. A computerized psychometric test and electroencephalographic (EEG) assessment takes about 2.5 hours total. 

Methadone has been used as a pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence since the mid-1960s. It is an opioid drug, taken orally and rapidly absorbed. It can active over 24 to 36 hours and effectively minimise the euphoric effect of opiate and aversive effects of opiate withdrawal.</interventions>
