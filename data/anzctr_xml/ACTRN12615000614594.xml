  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a single-center, two-period, open-label study to investigate the single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as a liquid formulation (at 300mg) compared to a capsule formulation under fasted conditions (also at a dosage of 300mg). 

Participants will be screened for participation in this study within 28 days before dosing. Participants will be admitted to the study unit the day before dosing (Day -1), then dosed in the mornings of Days 1 and 3, and will remain in the clinic up to Day 4, after collection of the final PK sample.

Participants will be randomized to one of the two possible orders in which the following treatments will be completed.  Doses will be approximately 48 hours apart:

*Treatment 1: 
Immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 liquid formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile.

*Treatment 2: 
Immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 capsule formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile.

Following discharge from the study unit, subjects will return for a follow-up assessment 7 plus or minus 2 days after final study drug administration.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluated the safety  and tolerability of PRN1008 (capsule and liquid formulations) tolerability, including the assessment of physical examinations, ECGs, vital signs, clinical laboratory results and adverse events. This a composite secondary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>*Physical examination: at screening, Day -1, Day 1, Day 2, Day  3, Day 4 and follow up visits.

    <concealment>Participants cannot commence enrolment procedures until all entry criteria have been fulfilled.Where the clinical significance of an abnormal screening test result (lab or any other tests) is considered uncertain, the test may be repeated.

Participants will be recruited from the study site's internal database. Eligible subjects will be allocated to a treatment by a treatment schedule randomly generated by a biostatistician. 

Whilst the treatment allocation is not concealed, participants will be randomly assigned to either treatment 1 or treatment 2 at day 1 and will then have the opposing treatment at Day 3.


</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be numbered sequentially in the following format: ARnn (where A is the study reference number, R is the replacement number should the participant be a replacement, nn being the sequential number into the study starting a 01).

Subjects will be randomised to a treatment via a simple a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation) which will be provided to the site by the biostatistician.

The Investigator or designee will enter data for each enrolled participant in the study CRF and enter the corresponding number for enrolment to the treatment groups in the appropriate place in each participantâ€™s CRF.  A participant Enrolment and Identification Code List must be maintained by the Investigator or Pharmacist, or designee.

Under no circumstances will participants who enrol in this study and complete treatment as specified be permitted to re-enrol in the study. 

Approximately 4 alternative participants may be included in the case that participants become ineligible or drop out of the study prior to Day 1 dosing.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Plasma concentrations and the computed PK parameters will be listed for PRN1008 by formulation.  Individual and mean concentration versus time data will be plotted on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.  Summary statistics of PK parameters (primary and secondary) will be presented for each treatment period including means, geometric means, standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), medians and ranges, as appropriate.

Geometric mean ratios and 90 percent confidence limits of AUC and Cmax by formulation will be computed.  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to the log-transformed primary PK parameters.  Additional summaries or analyses may be applied to the data as appropriate.

Participants will be allocated to one of two orders of completing Treatment 1 and Treatment 2, using a 1:1 randomized block approach.

No formal sample size calculations were performed. The sample size was determined by practical considerations, and is typical for a study of this type. Based on past experience with PRN1008, 12 subjects are sufficient to characterize the PK of a single dose administration considering observed PK variability.
