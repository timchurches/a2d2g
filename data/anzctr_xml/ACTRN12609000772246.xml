  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 Sessions per week in clinic and one home based session for 6 weeks for 45-60 minutes of Clinical Pilates exercise (ie 18 sessions in all).  Clinic sessions using a Pilates reformer and mat work work will be supervised by a qualified physiotherapist.  Four participants per session will allow individualisation of the exercise program, which will target leg strength and balance.  The home program will consist of similar exercises to the mat work. Four weeks of washout will be undertaken before these participants will embark upon the contorl arm of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>This first arm of this study included a control group that consisted of normal activity for six weeks, wash out for four weeks, and then participation in the exercise intervention for six weeks. The next stage of recruitment will be for a RCT.  It will run for ten weeks, during which the control group will be requested to maintain usual activity. Participants allocated to the control group will have the opportunity to participate in the treatment intervention after the study is completed if they request.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to assess the effect of a clinical Pilates intervention in community dwelling older adults on balance, strength, range of movement and blood glucose.  A variety of exercise programs have been found to be beneficial in addressing physiological parameters (blood glucose control, lipid profile control, cardiovascular health) and biomechanical parameters (balance, range of movement and strength) but this form form of exercise had been little studied.  Pilates is a popular form of exercise that proposes a range of health benefits, although the research into physiological and psychological benefits is limited.</summary>
