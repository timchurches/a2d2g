    <interventions>Intervention:
The ACE service model of care comprised
1.  An ED advanced practice nurse with aged care skills, (ACE Clinical Nurse Consultant) who led and coordinated the ACE service. 
2. More than twenty evidence based algorithms, developed in consultation with clinical experts, and RACF staff in the region, were standardized for the management of common problems for RACF residents: for example, falls, shortness of breath and indwelling urinary catheter issues. These are available at http://www.ecinsw.com.au/ace
3. The ACE Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC) who commenced in October 2010, 5 months prior to the intervention, worked with RACF and ED staff to develop, test and the refine the algorithms and provide education and training. The manual of algorithms guides and supports RACF staff to manage acutely unwell residents in situ and is used as a reference source by RNs, AINs, PCAs, GPs and ED staff. 
4. An education program for clinical staff in RACFs, prior to the introduction of the model supported using the manual of algorithms. The education service provided onsite by the ACE CNC, for the study RACF staff. The program constituted two hours of presentation with ongoing education provide as required or requested provided in groups.
5. An ED RN led telephone consultation service for RACF staff, 12 hours during the day, 7 days a week to provide clinical support, assist decision making in the RACF as well as receive clinical handover when the resident required transfer. The four ED RNs were all advanced care nurses with skills and experience in aged care nursing. Their role included identification of care needs, care planning and advocacy for the older person.
5. Establishment of the purpose of the ED transfer based on the older persons goals of care by the RACF staff, with support from the ED Registered Nurse (RN). 
6. Proactive case management, aligned to the goals of care in the ED by the ED RNs.
7. A collaborative respectful relationship with RACFs, ambulance, EDs, GPs and the primary care organisation, working together to achieve optimal patient outcomes.

The intervention occurred for 9 months. The program, including written material, presentations and phone support, was only available to the 4 intervention RACFs, maintaining fidelity of the study. It has since been rolled out to other sites. Staff worked only within the intervention RACFs.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care for control RACFs:
For acutely unwell residents in the control RACFs, residents are assessed by AINs and PCAs with support from RNs who may not be in the facility. Primary medical care is provided by General Medical Practitioners who visit the RACF as required and have competing demands of a busy practice. There is generally limited handover of clinical information or contact between the RACF and the ED prior to ED arrival. When residents require an ED visit, they are transported by ambulance to and from hospital.

    <inclusivecriteria>The intervention groups were four residential aged care facilities (RACFs) who frequently referred patients to the Emergency Department. All resident transfers were reviewed in the hospital information system. 

The 4 intervention RACFs were purposefully chosen as they frequently transferred patients to the ED, more commonly than other RACFs. They had previously participated in focus groups that identified barriers and facilitators to quality management of acutely unwell residents as RACFs that frequently transferred patients to the ED.</inclusivecriteria>

The 4 intervention and 8 control RACFs were monitored for 24 months prior to the intervention with standard care.

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>The study was a controlled pre-post design involving 12 RACFs. Four RACFs with a history of high ED presentations elected to be intervention sites, following their previous participation in a study that identified barriers and facilitators to quality management of acutely unwell residents. For each of the four intervention RACFs, two control RACFs were selected, matched for size (bed number) and RACF type (ratio of high care beds to low care beds and presence of dementia-specific beds). These identifiers were used as they are publically reported in the DPS Guide to Aged Care and represent features that are impacted by RACF policy and staffing, such as provision of Registered Nurses. None of the beds included respite short stay beds or specific specialist beds.

Intervention RACFs and control RACFs were reviewed over the same monthly periods from 2009 to 2011 to eliminate any seasonal variation. Data were analysed by comparing the control and intervention RACFs before and after the intervention, thereby allowing for changes related to time and not the intervention. 

Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to estimate differential changes between intervention and control RACFs in pre- and post-intervention means (for continuous outcomes) or log-odds (binary outcomes). Differential changes were assessed using a term reflecting the interaction between intervention group (intervention/control) and time (pre/post). This allowed assessment of whether the intervention specifically affected pre-post differences, after accounting for other, unrelated factors that may have also influenced pre-post differences (reflected in control group pre-post differences). Efficacy of the intervention was assessed by testing the two-sided null hypothesis that the interaction term coefficient = 0. The GEE was structured to account for potential correlation between repeated measures (ED presentations) by a single patient, and between patients from the individual RACFs. An exchangeable correlation structure was assumed. Models for outcomes were adjusted for the following covariates to account for the matched nature of the design:
1. RACF pair (as a fixed effect)
2. RACF bed number
3. RACF high care: low care bed ratio
For ED presentation, bed number was incorporated into the outcome variable, so was not indicated as a covariate. Further, RACF pair and high: low care ratio had non-significant (p&gt;0.1) parameter estimates and their removal produced a negligible change in the model. Thus, for parsimony (given fewer observations for this summary outcome measure), no covariates were included in the final model.

Results show estimated parameters, 95% confidence intervals and p-values for the main effects of group (intervention/control) and time (pre/post), and their interaction. Parameters for RACF matching factors are not shown. For continuous outcomes (outcomes 2 and 4), parameters represent the predicted change in the mean outcome for the specified level of group, time, or group×time, compared to the reference group mean. For binary outcomes (outcomes 1, 3, and 5) the parameters are expressed as odds ratios, reflecting the predicted ratio in mean odds of the outcome for specified level of group, time, or group×time, compared to the reference group odds. Associations reaching p&lt;0.05 were considered significant. All statistical analyses were programmed using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA)

Study Size: 
Four RACFs were selected for intervention as a practical and feasible number on which to intervene in the time available.  Based on the number of ED transfers in the baseline period, 1257, we estimated we had 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in transfers at a p-value of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: 
Older people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF) are a vulnerable, frail and complex population. They are more likely than people who reside in the community to become acutely unwell, present to the Emergency Department (ED) and require admission to hospital. For many, hospitalisation carries with it risks. Importantly, evidence suggests that some admissions are avoidable. A new collaborative model of care, the Aged Care Emergency Service (ACE), was developed to provide clinical support to nurses in the RACFs, allowing residents to be managed in place and avoid transfer to the ED. The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of the ACE service on RACF residents transfer to hospital using a controlled pre-post design.  

Methods: 
Four intervention RACFs were matched with eight control RACFs based on number of total beds, dementia specific beds, and ratio of high to low care beds in Newcastle, Australia, between March and November 2011. The intervention consisted of a clinical care manual to support care along with a nurse led telephone triage line, education, establishing goals of care prior to ED transfer, case management when in the ED, along with the development of collaborative relationships between stakeholders. Outcomes included ED presentations, length of stay, hospital admission and 28-day readmission pre- and post-intervention. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate mean differences in outcomes between intervention and controls RACFs, pre- and post-intervention means, and their interaction, accounting for repeated measures and adjusting for matching factors. 

Results: 
Residents of the aged care facilities were old with an average age of 86 years. ED presentations were common. With transfers ranging from between 16 and 211 visits for every 100 beds in the RACF beds/year across all RACFs. 

There was no overall reduction in ED presentations (OR=1.17, p=0.56) with the ACE intervention. However, when compared to the controls, the intervention group reduced their ED length of stay by 45 minutes (p=0.0575), and was 40% less likely to be admitted to hospital, .The latter was highly significant (p=0.0012).

Transfers to ED and admission to hospital are common for residents of RACFs.   A complex multi-strategy intervention led by nursing staff can successfully reduce hospital admissions for older people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities. By defining goals of care prior to transfer to the ED, clinicians have the opportunity to better deliver care that patients require. Integrated care requires accountability from multiple stakeholders.
