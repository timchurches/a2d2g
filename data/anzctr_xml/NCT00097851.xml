  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PI-88 is a new experimental drug that inhibits tumour growth by reducing the formation of new
      blood vessels into tumours. Docetaxel is a standard second-line treatment offered to patients
      with non-small-cell lung cancer who haven't responded to first-line therapies (platinum-based
      drugs or radiotherapy). Of this group of patients, only 20% remain progression-free 6 months
      after starting docetaxel treatment. The PR88202 study has been designed to compare two
      different cancer treatments (docetaxel only, and docetaxel plus PI-88) and to work out which
      is more effective against the cancer. It is hoped that the combination of PI-88 with
      docetaxel will allow patients to extend the time it takes for their disease to progress, and
      also to improve their quality of life.</summary>
