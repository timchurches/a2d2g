    <sequence>Randomisation will be undertaken using a randomisation schedule prepared in advance by the independent statistician and will be arranged in permuted blocks.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome the percentage change in total hip BMD from baseline to 12 months will be compared between randomised arms using one-way ANCOVA. The percentage change is defined as the change from baseline divided by the baseline level, times 100. The baseline level will be used as the covariate in this analysis. The primary analysis will utilise the intention to treat population which includes all participants who are randomised and receive a least one dose of study medication treatment. Any participants who do not have a 12 month assessment of BMD for any reason will have the baseline observation carried forward and this will be used as the 12 month level. There will be no imputation of missing data. This approach provides a conservative estimate of the change and the impact of this procedure and the robustness of the results will be tested by a sensitivity analysis which will only include those participants who have a 12 month assessment and have had all protocol defined procedures undertaken, i.e. the per-protocol population.
All secondary and exploratory outcomes will be analysed using the same process as the primary outcome analysis, with baseline levels as covariates and using, in the first instance the intention-to-treat population. Statistical significance is defined when the two-sided p-value is &lt;0.05.
As the sample size is small there will be no sub-group analysis. The power calculation requires 16 patients per group to be evaluated to provide at least 80% power at the two tailed 5% significance level to show a difference in the percent change in total hip BMD over 12 months of 2.5% or more. .Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up or withdrawal it is intended to recruit 20 patients per group.
A pooled standard deviation of 2.5% was used for this estimate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants in this study will have recently suffered a spinal cord injury. The study is using a medication to try to prevent the bone loss that occurs in people who have had this type of injury. This bone loss predisposes people to the risk of fracture. It is a twelve month study of blinded medication followed by 12 months of open label medication  24 months in total. Study visits occur at baseline, month 3 month 6 month 12 month 18 and month 24.The study is comparing the study medication (Denosumab) to placebo (dummy medicine)in the first year. In the second year of the study all participants will receive active study medication. The medication is given by an injection under the skin once every 6 months.  Participants in this study will have blood testing, measurement of bone density and renal ultrasound measurements.</summary>
