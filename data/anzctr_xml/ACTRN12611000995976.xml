  <interventions>
    <interventions>Test patients receive a medication review, based on application of a prescribing indicators tool, sent to their general medical practitioner. The prescribing indicators tool is a list of 48 best-practice recommendations for evidence-based medication management. The intervention may involve 1-3 patient consultations for a maximum total duration of 75 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control patients receive standard care. Standard care involves care that a patient normally receives for treatment of their medical conditions from their pharmacist or general medical practitioner. That is, care without an interview by the researcher regarding medication treatment of their medical conditions, and without the application of a prescribing indicators list and a medication review sent to their general medical practitioner.</comparator>
