  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention trialled in this study is telephone-administered cognitive behavioural therapy (TCBT).  Participants in this study will either be offered this treatment at 4-6 weeks post injury (early intervention condition) or usual care. The active intervention (TCBT) is delivered on a session basis (one per week) for 6-10 sessions.  Each session has a duration of 90 minutes.

Trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT) involves psychoeducation around psychological symptoms and trauma, anxiety management, exposure to feared thoughts and situations, cognitive therapy for identifying and challenging maladaptive thought processes around trauma, activity and positive event scheduling, and relapse prevention. The administration of these modules in the therapy are tailored to the particular presentation of symptoms. For example, if the presentation is primarily comprised of depressive symtpoms, emphasis on activity and positive events is made. Likewise if the presentation comprises primarily posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, an emphasis on prolonged exposure is made.</interventions>
    <comparator>The usual care condition will receive any care that they initiate. They will be offered the TCBT at 6 months if they require it.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are significant and persistent consequences of traumatic injury. Early interventions that address the secondary prevention of PTSD and depression after traumatic injury have the potential to be an essential component of public health efforts that target injury rehabilitation. The proposed study aims to investigate the effectiveness of a stepped care model of early intervention in the identification, prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression symptoms that develop following traumatic injury. We expect that early intervention will be more effective than usual care in the prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress and depression symptoms post injury.</summary>
