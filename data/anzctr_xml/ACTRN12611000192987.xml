  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study attempted to describe the epidemiological profile of frail elderly. The study was performed over a period of three months. The assessment was performed  in eleven visits to the Geriatric Clinic over this period, with a frequency of once a week aproximately. The evaluation was performed on one occasion only for each volunteer. The assessment duration for each volunteer was 10-15 minutes. Only the elderly included in the study were evaluated.  The frailty evaluated was based on the measure of  self-reported weight loss, weakness, measured by dynamometer, exhaustion, measured a questionnaire, slowness, measured by the time of walking 15 feet, and low physical activity level, measured by a questionnaire. Weight and height measurements were obtained at evaluation.  History of falls and hospitalization was obtained at the moment of the evaluation by asking the individual. Information about diseases diagnosed, medications in use and measures of weight in the last year was obtained from the medical records of the patients from the moment of the assessment until one year ago.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frailty by the presence of three or more positive results to the measures of wheight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slowness and low physical activity level. Weight loss was measured by a verbal questioning to the volunteer about weight loss in the past year, a afirmative answer was a positive result. Weakness was measured by a hand dynamometer, the lowest 20% (by gender, body mass index) measure was a positive result. Exhaustion was measured by two questions of the Center for Epidemiological Studies  Depression Scale, individuals who answer 2 or 3 for each questions represent a positive result. Slowness was measured by the time spent to the volunteer performed a walk 15 feet, the lowest 20% (by gender, height) measure was a positive result. Low physical activity level was measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire, individuals with low physical activity level were considered vulnerable to frail.</outcome>

    <summary>This study attempted to evaluate frailty in nonagenarians receiving care in Geraitric Clinic. The assessment was performed based on the measure of weigth loss, weakness, exhaustion, slowness and low physical activity level. Those with three or more positive results were considered frail, those with no positive results were considered not frail, and those with one or two positive results were intermediate.</summary>
