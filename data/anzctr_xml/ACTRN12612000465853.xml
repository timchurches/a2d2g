  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will receive a single intramuscular injection with 0.5 ml of one of the following vaccines:

Arm 1: Sabin-IPV (20:32:64 DU/dose)
Arm 2: Adjuvanted Sabin-IPV (10:16:32 DU/dose)</interventions>
    <comparator>Controls will receive a single intramuscular injection with 0.5 ml of the following vaccine:

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint for safety are the number and intensity of local and systemic adverse reactions.

1) Local reactions at injection site:
- Pain (Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Impaired movement of injected arm/leg (Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Redness/erythemia (Greatest diameter)
- Swelling (Greatest diameter)
- Solid disk underneath skin (Induration) (Greatest diameter) 

2) General/systemic adverse events:
- Fever (Absolute temperature measured)(Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Headache (Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Fatigue (Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Muscle pain (myalgia) (Intensity: Mild to severe)
- Other adverse events (Nature and Intensity: Mild to severe)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be observed during the first 30 minutes after vaccination in order to record the occurrence of acute reactions. A diary will be given to each subject for reporting of adverse events in the first four days after vaccination. The diary should be completed by the subject at 4-6 and 24 hours post-vaccination, and then every 24 hours during the first four days after vaccination or until adverse events have been resolved or further follow-up is not deemed necessary by the investigator. Serious adverse events will be reported until 6 months after vaccination.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The endpoint for immunogenicity is the level of neutralizing antibodies in serum (geometric mean titer (GMT)).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 28 days after vaccination.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Temporary exclusion criteria for vaccination:
- If body temperature &gt;=38C this will lead to postponement of participation and vaccination. Screening may continue when the temperature has normalized.

The exclusion criteria for vaccination are:
- IPV or OPV booster dose after the age of 12 years
- Known or suspected allergy against any of the vaccine components
- History of unusual or severe reactions to any previous vaccination
- Known or suspected disease or use of medication that may influence the immune system
- Known or suspected immune deficiency
- Systemic treatment with corticosteroids within one month before screening
- Administration of plasma (including immunoglobulins) or blood products three months prior to the study
- Blood donation within one month before screening
- Any vaccination within three months before screening and during the study until the last visit
- History of any neurological disorder including epilepsy or febrile seizures
- Evidence of excessive alcohol use or drug use
- Any infectious disease
- Participation in another clinical trial within three months before screening
- Abnormal pre-treatment laboratory parameters which are clinically relevant according to the investigator

The exclusion criteria for blood collections are:
- Bleeding disorders or the usage of anticoagulants</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A subject who fulfills all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be given a subject number. This number will correspond to a vaccination group in the randomization list produced by the statistician. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the vaccination groups (Salk-IPV, Sabin-IPV, or adjuvanted Sabin-IPV).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be performed using SAS version 9.1.3. SAS procedure plan will be used to randomly assign treatment to subject numbers with an appropriate block size. The output of this procedure will be used to prepare the randomization list. Subject numbers will be printed on the label of each vial with Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP). Each subject will receive a vial with his own subject number. If a vial is broken, the subject will be given the next number in the series and will get the corresponding vile.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rationale: To increase availability of inactivated poliovirus vaccines for developing countries for an acceptable price it is important that vaccines can be produced locally. Production of IPV based on wild poliovirus strains (Salk-IPV) has a high biosafety risk and is less suitable for local production in lower- and middle income countries. Netherlands Vaccine Institute is developing the production process of an inactivated poliovirus vaccine based on the attenuated Sabin-strains (Sabin-IPV) suitable for up scaling, training, and technology transfer to manufacturers in lower- and middle income countries. 
Objective: The main objective is safety evaluation of Sabin-IPV. The secondary objective is assessment of immunogenicity of Sabin-IPV in immunized adults.</summary>
