  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Group Exercise - Twelve, physiotherapy supervised, small group (3-4 participants) structured exercise sessions over 4 weeks, each 75-80 minutes duration. Each exercise session will include a short group warm up followed by a structured circuit of: 
- 30 minutes of treadmill walking conducted at an intensity of 60-80% of heart rate reserve 
- Lower limb progressive resistance training targeting hip flexors and extensors and abductors, knee extensors and ankle plantarflexors. Three sets of 8-10 repetitions of each exercise will be performed at 60-80% of the participants one repeat maximum (1RM), with resistance increased by five percent when participants are able to achieve 10 repetitions in their third set at 80% of their 1RM. After the first week of training, participants who demonstrate good technique of strength training exercises will incorporate power training sets 1-2 per session at 40-60% 1RM.
- Balance and gait retraining exercises will be prescribed as needed for each individual incorporating the principles of movement strategy training and highly challenging balance retraining including exercises such as walking with variable speed and focus on big steps with and without gait obstacles. 
Each exercise session will end with a group cool down session.Â 

2. Chronic Disease Self-Management (CDSM)  Will be delivered during the same 4-week period that participants are participating in the exercise groups. This will involve 5-10 minute sessions, delivered individually to the participants by the physiotherapists prior to or during the exercise sessions. Participants will be taught behaviour change techniques such as goal setting and action planning to encourage initiation and maintenance of physical activity. At the first exercise session, participants in the intervention group will receive information and a workbook to encourage self-monitoring of physical activity and guide participants through the process of setting short- and long-term goals as well as formulating action plans and coping strategies. During the 4 weeks of exercise sessions and the following 6 months, participants will also be provided with a Garmin Vivosmart armband that monitors and sets goals for physical activity (number of steps / day), and records heart rate, and distance travelled. Physiotherapists will contact participants monthly in the six months following the exercise intervention to discuss their physical activity goals and achievements. 
3. Usual care  Participants in the intervention group will continue with their usual Parkinson's disease management. Content, volume and intensity of usual care will be monitored weekly over the 4-weeks following baseline assessment using questionnaires and patient interview. 
Group exercise and CDSM will be prescribed and supervised by a registered and physiotherapist with experience in the management of Parkinsons disease within a physiotherapy rehabilitation gym of a local metropolitan hospital or University clinic.
Usual care will continue to be provided by the participants' chosen health professionals within their chosen environment. The content of usual care will be recorded by the research staff, but will not be influenced by the research staff.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be notified of the study commencement via neurologists and allied health rehabilitation units in the Brisbane metropolitan area and calls for participants circulated to past research participants and support group organisations. Interested volunteers will contact the researchers, and telephone screening will be undertaken to determine if they meet inclusion criteria. Suitable participants will attend the baseline assessment where suitability will be confirmed and baseline data collected. Following baseline assessment consecutively numbered, randomly ordered opaque envelopes containing group allocation will be opened by the therapist implementing the intervention, to reveal the group allocation. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample of 92 participants (46/group) will be recruited to show a change of 22% between the two groups in number of steps/day at the post intervention (4 weeks) time point. This calculation was based on previous studies of people with mild-mod PD who volunteered for exercise trials (3900 to 5000 steps SD 2000; Benka Wallen et al, 2015) that resulted in a sample size of 41 people/group, with an allowance for dropouts of 12% resulting in a planned sample size of 46 people/group.

All analyses will be performed on an intention to treat basis. To determine if there are differences between groups in physical activity outcomes post intervention, linear mixed models will be performed investigating group (intervention vs. control), time (baseline, post, follow-up) and group x time interactions for all variables. Baseline characteristics will be compared between groups and any differences included as covariates. Post hoc univariate testing will be undertaken if main effects and interactions are significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite best medical intervention, people with Parkinsons disease (PD) show a steady decline in physical functioning over time. Research shows that exercise is beneficial to improve and maintain physical function and physical activity in people with PD but a challenge is to maintain this over time. This project aims to assist people with PD to improve their physical activity levels and importantly maintain them, by trialling a new intervention of physiotherapy group sessions that combine exercise, self-monitoring with armbands and the self-management skills needed to improve their physical activity levels.</summary>
