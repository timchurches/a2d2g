  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the safety and tolerability of lenalidomide administration post alloSCT with particular reference to graft versus host disease and haematological toxicity. 

Assessment of outcome measured by blood tests (including B2 Microglobulin, LDH, albumin, immune studies of peripheral blood, chimerism), bone marrow aspirate and trephine, physical examination and DVT assessment, EORTC QLQ-MY20, EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-BMT quality of life questionnaire responses, disease progression assessment (including serum electrophoresis, serum free lite and heavy lite measurement) and incidence of adverse events.
Commonly reported adverse events related to Lenalidomide use include pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, cough, anemia, peripheral edema, nausea, edema, vomiting, muscle cramps, diarrhea, constipation, pruritus, hypokalemia, arthralgia, insomnia, dizziness, nasopharyngitis, dyspnea, headache, limb pain, pharyngitis, skin rash, weakness, abdominal pain, dyspnea on exertion, back pain, epistaxis, fatigue, anorexia, and xeroderma.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study proposes to explore the safety and efficacy of lenalidomide consolidation post allogeneic stem cell transplant in patients with high risk multiple myeloma who fail to achieve stringent complete response. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a diagnosis of multiple myeloma for which you plan to undergo stem cell transplantation. 

Study details 
All participants in this study will commence treatment with Lenalidomide 180 days after stem cell transplantation. Lenalidomide is a chemotherapy drug which is taken orally at an initial dose of 10mg daily for 21 of 28 days (1 cycle), increasing to 15mg for subsequent treatment cycles. This will be taken in combination with weekly oral dexamethasone for the first 2 cycles. Treatment will continue until any of the following occurs:
a.   Unacceptable toxicity/adverse event that may cause severe or permanent harm which rule out continuation of the study drug
b.   Relapse/progressive disease and alternative myeloma treatment is required
c.   Death
d.   The study may also be terminated early if safety concerns emerge with this treatment

Participants will be regularly monitored until relapse or end of treatment in order to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment, as well as disease response.</summary>
