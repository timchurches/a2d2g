  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) An algorithm/decision tool is used to facilitate GPs in identifying, assessing and managing patients at risk of falling who are presenting to GP practices. To facilitate integration of the iSOLVE algorithm, face-to-face, one-hour academic detailing will be offered to GPs involved. Further, an electronic clinical decision support tool will be offered to GP practices involved. This electronic tool is developed as part of the iSOLVE project to integrate the processes into general practice systems and software to facilitate workflow. 

The decision making tool is adapted from STEADi, a primary care resource for fall prevention developed by the Centres for Disease Control in the United States, using the  American Geriatrics Societys Clinical Practice Guidelines, and has been updated using the Cochrane Database on community fall prevention. 

2) Identifying older people: People aged 65 years and over who have had a fall will be identified through auditing GP practice database for patients over 65 years and presentation to GP practice for an appointment. 

3) Fall risk identification: The patients will be invited to complete the Stay Independent brochure in the GP practice waiting room prior to their GP appointment. This will provide an initial screening of risk factors to alert the GP.    

4) Fall risk assessment: Patients who have identified a risk factor as per the Stay Independent brochure will have the risk factor assessed by a GP. 

5) Fall risk management: The GP will tailor a management plan based on the patients risk factor by referring to the algorithm, clinical decision tool and referral pathway developed as part of the iSOLVE project. Depending on the algorithm this may trigger further assessment by the GP such as a medication review or hypotension or dizziness. The GP will initiate an appropriate referral, based on the algorithm, to local fall prevention services for example exercise professional for prescription of strength and balance exercise, occupational therapist for home safety intervention, pharmacy medication reviews, Stepping On fall prevention programs or cataract surgery.  GPs are encouraged to follow up on subsequent usual visits or addition visits if needed at the discretion of the GP.  The GPs will tailor the duration of each consultation as appropriate for the GP and the patient. 

 

At the end of 12 months, the patients will be asked what fall prevention activities (e.g. exercise, home safety adaptations, medication review, cataract extraction) have been recommended by their GP and have been undertaken by them. 

6) As part of the wider project, the iSOLVE team will engage with fall prevention service providers within the Northern Sydney Medicare Local (NSML) catchment area (study area) to facilitate referral pathways with GP practices. Education workshops will also be offered to fall prevention service providers in the study area.

    <concealment>Recruitment of GP practices:

GP practices servicing patients 65 years and older will be recruited in collaboration with the Northern Sydney Medicare Local (NSML). NSML will email or mail the study flyer to GPs inviting them to participate in the project. The study information will also be provided through NSML newsletters, practice networks and forums conducted within the NSML  catchment area. 
GP practices will be randomised to either the intervention or control arm once recruitment procedures are completed and informed consent is provided. This will be achieved using opaque concealed envelopes. The project manager will inform the GP practice if they are in the control or intervention group. The research assistant recruiting patients in the practice and collecting all follow up data for the study will be blinded to GP practice group allocation. 
GPs and GP practice staff will not be involved in patient recruitment. They will also be blinded to which of their patients are enrolled into the study. 

Recruitment of patients within participating GP practices:

Two recruitment methods will be employed:
1) Mailouts: Lists of patients aged 65 years and over from each participating GP practice will be generated using case record software if available at the participating GP practices. Letters will be sent out by the GP practice inviting participation until 20 patients per practice consent to participate. The same letter will be used for intervention and control arm to maintain blinded recruitment. 
2) Waiting room: Potential participants will also be identified when they attend the participating GP practices and provided with a flyer about the project. The blinded research assistant will approach and recruit potential patients in GP practice waiting room. 

The blinded research assistant will complete recruitment procedures with the patients (e.g. patient information, informed consent and explanation of trial procedure). Next, the project manager will be informed of patient recruitment and will contact the patient to inform the patient of group allocation according to randomisation at GP practice level. 

The project manager will request for patients not to reveal their participation in the study to their GPs or staff at the GP practice to ensure GP practices are blinded from patient allocation. This is intended to minimise bias in health care provision by the GPs and GP practice staff as the GPs will be asked to administer the intervention to all their older patients aged 65 years and over as appropriate (note, this trial is a translational project and the intent is that they will adopt the process as usual care). However, this does not blind the GP to being in the intervention arm.

    <statisticalmethods>Multilevel models will be used for all analyses to account for the cluster randomisation. The number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression models to estimate the difference in rates between the groups after one year (primary outcome). All analyses will be pre-planned, conducted while masked to group allocation and will use an intention-to-treat approach. Survey analysis will include frequency and descriptive statistics.

Sample size estimate to achieve primary outcome 1 (number of falls). This cluster randomised trial of 28 GP practices will have 80% power to detect as significant at the 2-sided 5% level a 15% between group difference in the proportion of subjects falling, from 50% in the control group to 35% in the intervention group (30% relative reduction). We have assumed 50% will fall in the control group, based on previous trials. A reduction to 35% is feasible, as a reduction of this size was found in previous meta-analysis.[1] Assuming a cluster size of 20 participants per GP practice, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC=0.01) and a 15% loss of participants we require 26 clusters with a total of 520 patients. In all, 28 GP practices (560 participants) will be recruited to allow for possible loss during the 12-month follow-up.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Researchers in allied health and primary care are partnering with Northern Sydney Medicare Local and the NSW State Falls Program (Clinical Excellence Commission) to establish a multi-disciplinary pathway model for fall prevention. The aim is to establish integrated processes and pathways at the levels of practitioner, practice, and program to identify older people at risk of falls and engage a whole of primary care approach to fall prevention.  

Few older people are asked by their general practitioner (GP) about falls or are offered interventions to prevent falls. For those that do, few base their falls prevention practice on recognised clinical guidelines. Primary care physicians report a number of barriers including time and educational materials. A major problem for evidence uptake is that studies which test fall interventions provided within a research context have much better outcomes than trials reflecting usual practice which rely on referral to usual health care providers. Studies have consistently shown that referral alone is not effective.  This is because in reality few community-based organisations regularly offer evidence-based falls prevention services.
We aim to form collaborative, information rich, working arrangements with GPs and allied health service providers. Our model aims to: improve access to appropriate fall prevention interventions for older people, ensure ongoing knowledge acquisition and sustainable action by healthcare professionals and organisations, using a multidisciplinary team approach to fall prevention that is integrated and translatable nationally.  

This cluster randomised trial is part of a hybrid translational project. The trial will evaluate if the intervention can change GP referral and management practices for falls prevention and if this will result in reducing falls for their older patients.
