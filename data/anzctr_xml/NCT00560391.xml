  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of the Combination (Dasatinib + Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone) - The RP2D was based on the MTD which was defined as the maximum combined dose producing dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in &lt; 33% of participants treated at the individual dose levels in the combination. The MTD is considered the last dose level combination tested just below the maximum administered dose (MAD) level combination and for which DLTs were observed in less than or equal to 33% of participants during the escalation and expansion phase. If MTD was not reached Please refer to Outcome Measure 2 for the complete definition of DLT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the date of first dose to end of treatment (median duration of dasatinib treatment=5.2 months [range 0 to 33 months]).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT) - DLTs: At least possibly drug-related AEs occurring during the first cycle of treatment and are:GR4 neutropenia &gt;5 days/neutropenic fever;platelet count &lt;10000mm^3 on &gt;1 occasion;GR4 fatigue,or 2-point decline in ECOG performance status;&gt;=GR3 nausea,diarrhea,and vomiting despite medical intervention;Any other clinically significant non-hematologic toxicity of &gt;=GR3 considered not related to underlying MM;Any GR3/4 laboratory abnormality requiring hospitalization;dose interruption of either dasatinib and/or lenalidomide for &gt;15 days due to any toxicity related to treatment with the combination.</outcome>

Please refer to outcome 2 for the complete definition of DLT. If the MTD was not reached at the highest dose administered as defined by protocol, the highest dose (dasatinib 140 mg QD + lenalidomide 25 mg QD) administered was selected for the dose expansion phase of the study.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Complete Response and Very Good Partial Response - Response criteria were based on The International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (with a slight modification). Complete response was achieved when there was negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and = 5% plasma cells in bone marrow. Very good partial response was achieved when serum and urine M-component was detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-component plus urine M-component &lt; 100 mg per 24 hour.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, At the end of the treatment period (median duration of dasatinib treatment=5.2 months [range 0 to 33 months]).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Partial Response - Partial response was achieved when there was =50% reduction of serum M-protein (Mpr)and reduction in 24 hour urinary Mpr by =90% or to &lt;200 mg/24 hr. If the serum and urine Mpr were unmeasurable, a =50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels was required in place of the Mpr criteria. If serum, urine Mpr, and serum FLC assay were unmeasurable, =50% reduction in plasma cells was required in place of Mpr, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was =30%; a =50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas was also required.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Minimal Response - Response criteria was based on The International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (with a slight modification). Minimal Response was achieved when there was 25% to 49% reduction of serum M-Protein, 50% to 89% reduction in 24 hour urinary M-protein which still exceeded 200 mg/24 hour. If the serum and urine M-protein were unmeasurable, 25% to 49% reduction in plasma cells was required. In addition, if present at baseline, a 25% to 49% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas was also required.</outcome>
