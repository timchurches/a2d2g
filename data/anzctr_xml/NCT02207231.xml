    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1) in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group at Week 16 - The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants' psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participants' psoriasis was assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 Response in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group at Week 16 - The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas were assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 to 6, and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 90 response represents participants who achieved at least a 90 percent improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at Week 16 in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group - The DLQI is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of skin disease on participant's quality of life. Each question was evaluated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); where higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 30 (very much): 0-1 = no effect at all on the participant's life; 2-6 = small effect on the participant's life; 7-12 = moderate effect on the participant's life; 13-18 = very large effect on the participant's life; 19-30 = extremely large effect on the participant's life. Higher scores indicate more impact on quality of life of participants. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</outcome>

The lesions were assessed in terms of the clinical signs of redness, thickness, and scaliness, which are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 = absence of disease, 1 = very mild disease, 2 = mild disease, 3 = moderate disease, and 4 = severe disease.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Psoriasis Symptom and Sign Diary (PSSD) Symptom Score at Week 16 in the Guselkumab Group Compared to the Placebo Group - The PSSD (24-hour version) is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire designed and validated to measure the severity of psoriasis symptoms and signs for the assessment of treatment benefit. It consisted of 11 items covering symptoms (itch, pain, stinging, burning, and skin tightness) and patient-observable signs (skin dryness, cracking, scaling, shedding or flaking, redness, and bleeding) using 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable) numerical rating scales for severity. Items were averaged on the daily symptom score and sign score when at least 3 items (&gt;=50 percentage of 5 items) on these scales are answered. The average value is converted into 0-100 scoring, such that Symptom [or Sign] score = average value*10, where, 0= least severe and 100= most severe and higher score indicates more severe disease. This secondary outcome measure was planned to include only the placebo and guselkumab arms.</outcome>
