  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this open trial participants will receive access to an 8 week internet-delivered education course, the Wellbeing Course, which teaches participants how to manage symptoms of anxiety and low mood. All participants will have at least mild symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 total score of &gt;4). 

The Wellbeing Course comprises 5 online lessons, which describe evidence-based cognitive behavioural and interpersonal therapy strategies for managing cognitive, behavioural, and physical symptoms of anxiety and low mood. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with anxiety, taking a further 20 minutes per week. All participants will also receive 10-20 automatic emails to promote adherence and engagement, and brief weekly (&lt;10minutes week) supportive telephone calls from a Registered Psychologist from the Mental Health Association.

Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 3-months post-intervention. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete.</interventions>
