    <interventions>Women at risk of developing ovarian and/or breast cancer who have undergone RRBSO.  Non-cancer outcomes including sexual function, menopause symptoms and quality of life issues, bone health, cardiovascular health, sleep quality, depression/anxiety symptoms and cognitive function will be assessed using the following:
Blood tests performed at baseline, 12 &amp; 24 months. Time required = 1/2 hour x 3 episodes. Total time =1 and 1/2 hours
Bone mineral density scanning x 3 occasions (baseline, 12 and 24 months) at 1 hour each.  Total time = 3 hours.
Completion of questionnaires (N=8) x 5 occasions (baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months) at 1/2 hour each. Total time =
2 hours. Short question and answer tests to measure cognitive function x 3 occasions (baseline, 12 and 24 months) at 45 mins each. Total time = 2 and 1/4 hours. </interventions>
    <comparator>Age matched control group participants who retain their ovaries and are not at increased risk of ovarian cancer will undergo the same processes as the identified high-risk group.
High risk group women who decide to delay RRBSO for at least 2 years will also be recruited to the comparison group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating the impact of risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRBSO) on sexual function, menopause symptoms and quality of life issues, bone health, cardiovascular health, sleep quality, depression/anxiety symptoms and cognitive function in high-risk, pre-menopausal women.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 years old (inclusive) and 50 years old (inclusive), at a high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer, have regular menstrual periods if your uterus is intact, no current vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes and night sweats), early follicular follicle-stimulation hormone (FSH) of equal to or less than 15 IU/L, Estradiol &gt; 100pmol/L, and are planning to have RRBSO.
Women who are not planning to have RRBSO or become pregnant in the next 2 years, and fit the same eligibility criteria are also asked to participate.  They will form an age matched control.
Trial design.
Participants in this study will be required to undergo blood tests and bone mineral density scanning at baseline and then repeated on an annual basis for 2 years.  Participants will also need to complete questionnaires relating to sexual function, menopause, depression/anxiety, and sleep quality at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.  Participants will also have tests to measure cognitive function at baseline, 3 months, 12 months and 24 months.</summary>
