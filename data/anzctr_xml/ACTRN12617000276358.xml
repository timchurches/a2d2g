  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine (given twice a day for 3 days) and dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine  (given daily for 3 days) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Doses of artemether-lumefantrine (20/120) will be administered according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg;3 tablets for 25 to34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. For dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine, 4 mg/kg DHA and 18 mg/kg piperaquine once a day for 3 days. The treatment will be given in tablets by oral under direct supervision. Eligible subjects will be treated for three days and followed up for 28 days for artemether+lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin+pipearquine for 42 days..</interventions>

Patients aged between 6 month and 60 years with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with artemether+lumefantrive of dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine and monitored for 28 and 42 days, respectively. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations.

    <statisticalmethods>Minimum sample size
As the treatment failure rate to artemether+lumefantrine and dihydroartemisin+piperaquine in the area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day (for artemether+lumefantrine) or 42 (for dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine) follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per SITE.

Analysis of data
The WHO Excel software programs last version will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28 (for artemether+lumefantrine) or 42 (for dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine), PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28 (for artemether+lumefantrine) or 42 (for dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine), with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in different sentinel sites in Sudan 
Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of the current second line treatment policy as well as a new antimalarial drug to support updating the national policy; 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine and dihydroartemisin+piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.
Study Sites: Geneina and Kerink, (West Dafur), Sinnar, Gadaref, and Kassala.
Study Period: December 2016 to April 2017.
Study Design: One arm prospective study.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged six months with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Female minors aged 12-17 years and unmarried females aged 18 years and above will be excluded as subjecting them to pregnancy testing is unacceptable according to the local customs and cultures.
Sample Size: A total of 88 patients will be enrolled in each site 
Treatment(s) and follow-up: artemether (20mg)/lumefantrine (120mg) of six-dose course over 3 days according to weight bands (1 tab: 5 to 14kg, 2 tabs: 15 to 24kg, 3 tabs: 25 to 34kg and 4 tabs: greater than or equal to 35kg) or Dihydroartemisin/pipepraquine (4mg/kg bw dihydroartemisin and 18mg/kg bw piperaquine once a day for three days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28 days (for artemether+lumefantrine) or 42 days (for dihydroartemisin+piperaquine) follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency and nature of adverse events
2. To determine the molecular markers for artemisinin (K13) resistance.
