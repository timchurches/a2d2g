    <interventions>This randomized, double blinded study will be comprised of Part A, a single ascending dose evaluation, and Part B, a multiple ascending dose evaluation, in healthy volunteers. In each cohort of Part A, 4 subjects will receive a single oral dose of NPI-001 (250, 750, 1500, 3000 or 4000 mg) and 2 subjects will receive the vehicle placebo in the fasting state. Subjects will be evaluated in the clinic overnight and will have a follow up visit at Day 7. One cohort in Part A, Cohort A3 (1500 mg NPI-001), will also receive the same dose after a high fat meal to evaluate the effect of food. Subjects in Cohort A3 (food-effect evaluation) will participate in 2 treatment periods separated by a 7-day (minimum) wash-out period, and will receive 2 single doses of NPI-001 or placebo. The wash-out period may be extended following review of the PK data to ensure that at least 7 half-lives have elapsed. 
The high fat meal will be given as a high fat breakfast: 2 eggs fried in butter, 2 strips bacon. 2 slices of toast with butter, 4 oz hash brown potatoes fried in butter 8 oz (240 mL) whole milk. This high fat meal contains the equivalent of approximately 150 protein calories, 250 carbohydrate calories, and 500 to 600 fat calories. The drug product will be administered approximately 30 minutes after starting the meal and at least 80% of the meal should be finished promptly. 
In Part B, 6 subjects will receive oral doses of NPI-001, and 2 subjects will receive the vehicle placebo, for 14 days while in the clinic. A postdose follow up visit will occur at Day 21. The doses and dose regimen will be determined based on the data obtained during Part A, but doses will not exceed a total daily dose of 4000 mg. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measurements will be collected at various time points in both parts of the study.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety:  Adverse events.  Adverse events are expected to be similar to those of the approved drug N acetylcysteine (NAC). These are: listed as:  stomatitis, nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness and bronchoconstriction. Rare hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, including urticaria, dyspnea, bronchospasm and anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, fever, headache, drowsiness, low blood pressure, and liver function changes. In a recent high dose study of NAC diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, upper abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dysgeusia, dizziness, headache, convulsion, and syncope were reported.

All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, will be recorded from the first dose of study drug until study completion. AE information will also be collected from the start of the wash-out period between fasting and fed dosing for Cohort A3 and will be recorded as interim medical history for the second period. The nature, time of onset, duration, and severity will be documented, together with an Investigators (or designees) opinion of the relationship to drug administration.
Adverse events will be assessed by a range of tools and tests.  These include: 
a) Vital signs:
Semi-supine blood pressure, pulse rate, and tympanic body temperature will be assessed regularly throughout the study period. Vital signs may also be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of vital signs is required. All measurements will be performed singly, and repeated once if outside the relevant clinical reference range.
b) Clinical Laboratory Evaluations: Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology) at regular intervals throughout the study. Subjects will also be asked to provide urine samples for a drugs of abuse screen and cotinine tests, and take an alcohol breath test at nominated study times. For all female subjects, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at nominated times. Additionally, for women considered to be postmenopausal, FSH will be analyzed at Screening. An Investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of all clinical laboratory data.
c) 12 Lead Electrocardiogram:  
Resting 12 lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been semi-supine and at rest for at least 5 minutes at nominated times. 
Single 12 lead ECGs will be repeated once if either of the following criteria apply:
	QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericias method (QTcF) &gt;450 msec
	QTcF change from the baseline (predose) is &gt;60 msec.
Additional 12 lead ECGs may be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate or if the ongoing review of the data suggests a more detailed assessment of ECGs is required. The Investigator (or designee) will perform a clinical assessment of each 12 lead ECG.
d) Physical Examination:  A full physical examination will be performed at Screening, Day -1 and at other time points where indicated by symptoms.
The date of the physical examination will be recorded and any clinically significant findings will be recorded as AEs.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is being undertaken to evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral doses of a new drug NPI-001 in healthy volunteer subjects. It will determine the effect of NPI-001 on their vital signs, and they will undergo physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests.	Blood samples will be taken to determine where the drug goes in the body and how long it stays in the body following single and multiple doses. 
The study is randomized, and double blinded. In each group of subjects some will receive the new drug in a sugar solution and 2 will receive just the sugar solution - a placebo. </summary>
