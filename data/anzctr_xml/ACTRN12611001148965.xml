  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants were given either multifocal or standard single vision soft contact lenses to wear on a daily wear basis for a minimum 10 hours a day over a 3 year period. Multifocal lenses have different powers across the lens surface whereas single vision lenses only have one power.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the rate of myopia progression, as assessed by cycloplegic auto refraction in children wearing multifocal soft contact lenses as compared to children wearing single vision soft contact lenses over a three year period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months for a total duration of 3 years.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the fitting characteristics of, and ocular response to, soft contact lenses worn on a DW basis by children aged 8 to 14 years. This will be done by clinical assessments such as Slit lamp biomicroscopy. This will be used to assess the following variables and rated using the IER Grading scales.
Lens assessment
Lens wetting
Lens surface deposition
Lens fitting
Ocular redness-bulbar and limbal
Palpebral ocular redness and roughness (in conjunction with lid eversion)
Corneal and conjunctival staining (in conjunction with fluorescein and a Wratten 12 filter)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 3 months for a total duration of 3 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Aged 8 to 14 years

Parents / guardians must sign the subject informed consent (Appendix 1)
Cycloplegic autorefraction - sphere -0.50 D to -4.00 D, cylinder 0 to -0.75 D
Best corrected visual acuity 6/9 or better;
On examination, eyes are required to have clinical findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent a subject from safely wearing contact lenses.  These include:
stable and distortion-free keratometric readings;
no active corneal infection, inflammation or infection of the anterior chamber of the eye or any eye disease, injury or abnormality of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would affect the wearing of contact lenses;
no previous ocular surgery;
no severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (dry eyes);
no evidence of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity);
no systemic disease or use of medications that may affect the eye or produce an adverse response by the wearing of contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <designfeatures>The study was initially known as protocol number VRRP2004-008. However due to a change of sponsor from Vision CRC to Institute of Eye Research the protcol number changed to IERP2007-009. The HREC committee was notified of this change. This study was directly followed by trial ACTRN12611001141932 - Assessment of effect of multifocal contact lenses on myopia progression rates in children and adolescents. Only participants who were in trial IERP2007-009 were offered trial ACTRN12611001141932.</designfeatures>
