  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the difference in carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) progression (measured as a change from baseline) between the rosuvastatin and placebo arms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 48 and 96 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of adverse events (symptomatic and biochemical). 
Rosuvastatin can cause muscle pain or in rare severe cases muscle breakdown, and may also lead to an elevation of liver enzymes or blood glucose levels.
Participants will have blood tests every three months to check creatinine kinase levels (the breakdown product of muscle), glucose and liver function tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 monthly throughout the trial period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of rosuvastatin on carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) and arterial pulse wave velocity (cPWV)</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 and 96 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of rosuvastatin on immunological and inflammatory biomarkers.
This will be assessed by blood tests assessing high sensitivity CRP, d-dimer and markers of monocyte activation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 and 96 weeks</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants:
110 HIV positive patients who are currently taking anti-HIV medications, have well controlled HIV and are at moderate risk for heart disease (and thus do not currently qualify for statin therapy) will be recruited from the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Alfred Hospital. 
Methods:
Participants will be randomised to receive either the active agent (Rosuvastatin) or a placebo once daily for 96 weeks. Rosuvastatin is a statin licensed for use in Australia to control high cholesterol levels and prevent heart disease in patients at high risk.
Participants will undergo blood tests and ultrasounds of the arteries of the neck prior to starting Rosuvastatin and then after 1 and 2 years on the drug to determine what effect it has on markers of inflammation, cholesterol levels and thickness of blood vessels (which relates to damage of blood vessels supplying the heart and thus the risk of heart attacks)
Analysis:
The main outcome will be to compare the rate at which blood vessels thicken in the participants receiving rosuvastatin compared with those receiving placebo. We will also compare the amount of inflammation (based on blood tests) in each group and the presence of any side effects.
Significance
By showing that there are advantages to starting statin therapy earlier then currently recommended in people with HIV infection it may be possible to reverse some of the increased risks of heart attacks and strokes seen in these patients.</summary>
