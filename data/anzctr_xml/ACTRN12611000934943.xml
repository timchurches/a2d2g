  <interventions>
    <interventions>Determine whether 4 fingerprick capillary blood glucose levels taken at routine sampling times of 0700, 1200, 1700 and 2100 hours over a 24 hour period during a hospital admission, as measured by standard hospital ward glucometers, accurately reflects glucose concentrations determined by continuous glucose monitoring. The duration of sampling will be up to 2 full consecutive days with a minimum of one full day (midnight to midnight). This will be in a population of known diabetic patients receiving the standard basal bolus insulin regimen, which is used for patients requiring temporary intensified blood glucose management during admission. Patient recruitment is planned until August 2012.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator/Control  = continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS).
CGMS involves a small subcutaneous sensor inserted generally in the abdominal region, which detects interstitual glucose concentration, which in turn closely mimicks blood glucose concentration. Readings are automatically performed and stored every 5 minutes, allowing a thorough insight into blood glucose patterns throughout the day. Patients will undergo CGMS monitoring for a minimum of one full 24 hour period (midnight to midnight) to a maximum of two full consecutive 24 hour periods.</comparator>

      <timepoint>Continous glucose monitoring will be performed to include up to two consecutive blocks of 24 hours from midnight to midnight. The device takes a reading every 5 minutes for this period. The continuous glucose monitor will be inserted as soon as practically possible after the patient admission. Routine fingerprick blood glucose will be performed four times daily (at 0700, 1200, 1700 and 2100 hours) while patient is undergoing the continuous glucose monitoring.</timepoint>

    <summary>The aim is to determine whether 4 fingerprick BGLs routinely performed at nominal times of 0700, 1200, 1700 (these three timeslots are just before meals) and 2100 hours accurately assess the efficacy and safety of basal bolus insulin in hospitalized patients.</summary>
