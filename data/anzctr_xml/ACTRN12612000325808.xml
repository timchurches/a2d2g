  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy overweight men aged between 20 and 70 years and overweight healthy post-menopausal women less than 70yrs will give a blood sample  from which DNA will be extracted. The DNA will be used to screen for two genetic polymorphisms called CYP4F2 G1347A and CYP4A11 T8590C, using  a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. These polymorphisms are known to affect 20-HETE levels. A group that are carriers of the A allele of the CYP4F2 G1347A polymophism but who do not have the CYP4A11 T8590C polymorphism and a control group that have neither polymorphism will be studied. Baseline salt intake will be assessed by 24 hr urine collections. A dietitian will counsel both groups to reduce their salt intake to ~ 50mmol/day for 6 weeks. After 3 weeks participants will be asked to take enteric coated sodium chloride tablets (Slow-Sodium)  providing 100mmol/day sodium  for 3 weeks.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy overweight men with waist circumference greater than or equal to 102cm and overweight healthy postmenopausal women with a waist circumference greater than or equal to 88cm who have a systolic BP greater or equal to 120mmHg. Volunteers who fit the criteria be screened for two genetic polymorphisms called CYP4F2 G1347A and CYP4A11 T8590C that affect 20-HETE levels. Two groups will be studied. A group that are carriers of the A allele of the CYP4F2 G1347A polymophism but who do not have the CYP4A11 T8590C polymorphism and a control group that have neither polymorphism will be studied</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The effectiveness of treatment to reduce heart disease risk can vary a great deal between individuals. this is partly due to an individuals genetic makeup. Fatty acid metabolites called CYP450metabolites of arachidonic acid can act on blood vessels and the kidney to regulate blood pressure. one of these metabolites known as 20-HETE is known to be affected by dietary salt intake. we will study volunteers with two different genetic make-ups that affect 20-HETE levels differently to see if they affect blood pressure and heart disease risk. We will asses whether having either genetic make up causes a blood pressure and plasma and urinary 20-HETE when participants have different intakes of dietary salt.</summary>
