  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants randomised to the intervention group will have fortnightly telephone based support for 12 weeks, by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.  

Telephone consults will range between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on the level of engagement and will be on a previously agreed upon date between the participant and exercise physiologist.  During the telephone calls adherence to their home exercise programs will be discussed.  

Home exercise programs will be individualised and tailored to participants' capacity but generally consist of an aerobic (walking) program as well as a progressive strengthening program to target goals set.  Baseline steps per day will be used to set target goals for their walking program.

Objective data will be collected from a Fitbit Charge HR(TM) which is worn on the non-dominant wrist for 24 hour periods and measures heart rate, step count and activity level i.e. number of active minutes per week which can be transferred to the particpants' smartphone and stored on their personal profile via an application.  Participants will also transfer their data into their activity log book daily, which will help remind them to charge their Fitbits.  Staff will have access to their profiles through the Fitbit app and be able to view data prior to the telephone consult.  Activity logs will be viewed at the end of the 12 week intervention only and compared to the staff-collected data.

All attempted phone calls will be logged in paper progress notes and duration of successful calls noted.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment will serve as the control.  

Participants randomised to this group will receive a two week follow up phone call from an Exercise Physiologist post baseline testing and delivery of the home exercise program.

Telephone consults will range between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on the level of engagement and will be on a previously agreed upon date between the participant and exercise physiologist.  During the telephone calls adherence to their home exercise programs will be discussed.

    <concealment>Patients wanting to enrol in the study will be given the information sheet and have an appointment with an exercise physiologist who will complete a familiarisation session with the participants.  
The following week, once baseline testing has been completed particpants will be randomised.  Group allocation will be concealed in a sealed opaque envelope and completed over the telephone by an external contact.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 23 participants are needed per group (46 in total) in order to detect 95% confidence interval, determined from a sample size calculator tool, based on expected outcomes using 6MWT distance as the primary outcome from a population of obese participants with knee osteoarthritis (on the assumption that these are similar).  To allow for drop out and attrition we are looking to recruit 80 participants in total.

For each outcome measure collected, brief descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, both overall by age and gender will be calculated.
Pre and post functional testing results will be analysed through T-test statistics and differences in mean test scores by age group by ANOVA.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to determine the benefit of phone coaching by an exercise physiologist to improve adherence to a prescribed home exercise program in the bariatric population.  Improved adherence should increase physical function and quality of life and provide evidence for the development of a standardized approach for weight management.</summary>
