      <outcome>Immunological Effects - Changes in immunological markers within tumor tissue, and immune subsets in peripheral blood over serial time-points, including at time of progression. - Blood samples will be collected (50ml) at baseline (prior to first SABR), prior to the first dose of MK-3475, prior to cycle 2 of MK-3475, at disease progression (if this occurs) and then every 3 months up to two years post end of SABR treatment. These will be analysed for the following (this is a non-exhaustive list):
i. Absolute lymphocyte counts using a blood analyser.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, observational pilot study that will describe the safety profile and
      biological effects of combining stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery (SABR) treatment
      (20Gy/1#) and a PD-1 antibody, MK-3475.

      15 patients with oligometastatic breast cancer with at least one lesion considered safe for
      SABR radiotherapy, will be treated with SABR for their oligometatastic disease in addition to
      6 months of MK-3475 treatment (1 cycle every 3 weeks, a total of 8 cycles).

      This investigator driven pilot study will examine the safety and biological effects of
      combining MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab) an antibody targeted against the anti-programmed cell death
      1 (PD-1) T cell checkpoint, with SABR therapy for oligometastatic disease. We hypothesise
      that the safety profile of this combination, will be clinically acceptable and well tolerated
      for patients, and that we will observe evidence of systemic immune activation.</summary>
