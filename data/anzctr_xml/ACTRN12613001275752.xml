  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three groups of patients with major depression (80 patients in each group) on chronic (over 6 months) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSIRs) will randomly receive daily oral 5-hydroxytriptophan (5-HTP) 50 or 300 mg  plus other elements including 500 mg (in cases on 50 mg 5-HTP) or 3000 mg (in cases on 300 mg 5-HTP) L-tyrosin, 500 mg cysteine, 1.5 mg pyrodoxine and 0.05 mg selenium (Dr Daniel capsule) in the intervention groups; or oral placebo (glucose) in the control group for 3 consecutive months. Exercise and diet profiles will be similar during the study period in all three groups. 
Adherence interventions will include monthly instruction in forms of oral and written material. Adherence to taking medication will be monitored by drug capsule return monthly. </interventions>
    <comparator>All the patients will continue their previous treatment including taking SSIRs. Patients in the control group will receive oral placebos (capsules identical to those with medication in the intervention groups, containing only glucose) once daily for 3 consecutive months.   </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some studies have proposed that using SSIRs (for example in patients with major depression) will gradually exhaust the reserve of serotonin in the body of receivers. So, supplementing these patients with serotonin (or its precursor, 5-HTP) along with essential cofactors in its metabolism may be helpful. This is the first clinical trial ever in this regard. </summary>
