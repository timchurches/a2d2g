    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were block-matched by the minimisation convention on blood pressure, gender, age and body mass index into four treatment groups. These groups were randomised to consume the various doses of cocoa flavanols. Group allocation was performed by a member of the research team who had no contact with participants and was not privy to treatment allocation. Random treatment allocation to groups was administered by another member of the research staff that did not have contact with the participants and the treatment coding was stored electronically secured from access by all other research team members.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Daily consumption of chocolate with high cocoa content for between 7 days and 18 weeks can significantly reduce blood pressure (BP). This anti-hypertensive effect of cocoa has been attributed to its high content of bioactive polyphenols, particularly the flavanol epicatechin. However, chronic (6-12 weeks) studies using flavanol rich cocoa beverages rather than the relatively higher calorie chocolate products have not yielded similar results.
With similar or considerably higher daily doses of flavanols (compared to those provided in the chocolate studies) consumption of flavanol-rich cocoa beverages have resulted in relatively small reductions in BP or no change at all. 
This study intended to determine the required daily dose of cocoa flavanols to lower 24 hour Ambulatory BP (ABP) in a borderline hypertensive population when delivered in a (relatively lower calorie) reconstituted cocoa beverage</summary>
