  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Educational workshop with pre- reading and reflection using the Royal Australian College of General Practitioner's (RACGP) learning module 'General Practitioners caring for people with dementia' based on RACGP dementia guidelines 'Care of patients with dementia in general practice'. Each geographic 'cluster' is offered the workshop at a time and date convenient to researcher and participants. The 2 hour workshop is delivered by the researcher, a GP Fellow of RACGP,  using a powerpoint presentation supplied by RACGP as part of their learning module. 
2. Audit feedback: An audit is conducted for each participating GP at 0 and 6 months using the built in search engine in their electronic medical records. The researcher (a GP), undertakes the audit or supports a member of staff to to do the task. GPs randomized to audit feedback can conduct their own audit if they wish. Each GP has their own chart in which data is recorded, consisting of the number of patients &gt;65 years consulting in 2x6month periods before and after the trial commences and the number of dementia diagnoses documented in each of these 2 patient samples. This data provides both an intervention and the outcome measure. The results are shared at the beginning of the trial with GPs randomized to audit intervention and at the workshop for GPs randomized to education plus audit.</interventions>

    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrollment: General practices were invited to participate, firstly through a phone call to the principal GP and/or practice manager and then through a visit supplying trial information.

Consent: GPs signed a consent form to participate and were aware that the trial would involve an educational workshop and audit feedback. The trial was approved as an active learning module by the RACGP, entitling them to 40 category 1 accreditation points for professional development. At the end of the trial all GPs received their audit data and the workshop was offered to those who  were not randomized to receive this at the beginning of the trial. 

The researcher, a GP, recruited participants, all of whom met the criteria for inclusion, ie: actively practicing GPs with patients &gt;65 years in their practice population. Following recruitment, the researcher randomized participants to one of 4 groups using Excel software. Allocation was not concealed for the researcher, and GPs were notified of their audit results and workshop times in relation to the intervention they had been randomized to. 

Interventions: arrangements were made with the practices for audit data collection and dates and venues set for  educational workshops relevant to the intervention allocated.  Audit data was supplied to relevant GPs at the beginning of the trail either through a practice visit or at the workshop for those with the combined intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Cluster randomization: Stratified randomization was achieved by listing the participating GPs in an Excel column in geographic clusters. A second column applied the Excel randomizing formula to assign each cluster to one of 4 groups. A third column recorded the randomized group number before it randomly changed again. One group was a control of usual practice and the remaining 3 were intervention groups. The interventions were: educational workshop, audit feedback, and both education and audit.  Cluster randomization was chosen to minimize leakage and facilitate delivery of interventions.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Audit data was to be collected by the researcher or a member of practice staff other than the GP to avoid leakage of this data to GPs who were allocated to non audit-feedback intervention groups. Ethics required trial information be supplied as part of informed consent to participate. Therefore all participants were aware of the interventions that they would receive by the end of the trial, but they were not formerly advised which group they had been randomized to during the trial.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project follows a pilot project conducted in 2007 measuring the effect of the interventions of education and audit feedback on GP detection of dementia in their at risk practice population.  The current trial tests the impact of an educational workshop on GP dementia guidelines and audit feedback of the number of documented dementia diagnoses in the patient population aged over 65 years seen in the two 6 month periods before and after commencement of the trial. The rationale is that documentation of this diagnosis in general practice is suboptimal but is necessary if dementia patients are to access appropriate support and treatments. GPs are recruited from practices in North Queensland and clustered according to practice location. Clusters are randomly assigned to one of four groups: interventions of educational workshop, audit feedback, educational workshop plus audit feedback, or control (usual practice).  At the end of the trial all GPs are offered audit and educational workshops which enables them to receive 40 category 1 professional development points.</summary>
