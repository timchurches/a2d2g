    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measure (rates of falls) will be expressed using an incident rate per 1000 days. The secondary outcome measure of rate of injurious falls will be expressed using an incident rate per 1000 days, while the number of fallers will be expressed as a percentage. Generalised linear mixed modelling will be used to examine the falls outcomes (falls and injurious falls rates and the proportion of patients who fell) in the 12 months after discharge in comparison to falls outcomes observed among a broad post discharge population. Generalized linear mixed modelling will also be conducted to examine patient and clinical characteristics predictive of falls in the 12 months after discharge. The health-related quality of life of patients over the first 12-months following discharge from hospital will be described using conventional descriptive statistics, then examined for fallers and non-fallers using adjusted and unadjusted generalized liner mixed modelling.

On the basis of a previous study conducted in a large and broad diagnostic post discharge population  the annual incidence rate for falls after hospital discharge in an elderly population was reported to be 4.5/1000 person days. The minimum sample size needed to test the hypothesis that the population incidence rate for falls (in patients who have undergone TKR or THR) is 4.5/1000 person days (+0.54/1000) at 5% level of significance (with 95% confidence to detect this) and power of 80% is 267 participants in the total hip replacement group and 267 participants in the total knee replacement groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people in Australia are increasingly undergoing hip and knee joint replacement , and with aging of the population this figure will increase. Although outcomes are positive after this surgery there are limited data that have investigated the incidence of falls after this surgery. Falls are associated with injury and loss of function as well as psychological consequences which could lead to reduced health related quality of life. This study will prospectively sample over 500 older people to measure the incidence of falls in the 12 months after discharge. The aim of the study is to identify the number of falls and risk factors for falling as well as patient health related quality of life among older people in the 12 months after they have hip or knee joint replacements.</summary>
