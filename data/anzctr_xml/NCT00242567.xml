  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Zoledronic Acid
Treatment: drugs - Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)

Experimental: Early Group - Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v. infusion every 4 weeks, commencing at Baseline.

Experimental: Delayed group - Zoledronic acid 4 mg i.v. infusion every 4 weeks, commencing no sooner than 12 months after their baseline visit, and not until they have had three rises in PSA level from Baseline, one of which must be a least 10 ng/mL greater than the baseline Serum Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) level.


Treatment: drugs: Zoledronic Acid
Zoledronic acid was provided by Novartis in vials containing 4 mg/5 mL liquid concentrate. Prior to administration, the liquid concentrate from one vial was to be further diluted with 100 mL of calcium-free infusion solution (0.9 % weight by volume sodium chloride solution or 5 % weight by volume glucose solution). If refrigerated, the solution had to be allowed to reach room temperature before administration.
After addition of the liquid concentrate to the infusion media, the infusion solution was to be used as soon as practicable to reduce the risk of microbiological hazard. If storage of the solution was necessary, it had to be refrigerated at temperatures between 2-8 degrees C and was to be used within 24 hours.
The infusion solution containing 4 mg zoledronic acid was to be administered every 4 weeks as an i.v. infusion over no less than 15 minutes.

Treatment: drugs: Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was to be administered according to institutional protocols, in accordance with relevant prescribing information. The type and duration of androgen deprivation was at the discretion of the treating specialist, and could include orchiectomy where this would normally have been performed. Androgen deprivation therapy was provided by the investigational center, or obtained by the patient from usual sources. Anti-androgen monotherapy and intermittent ADT were excluded in the first 12 months of the study.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skeletal-related Event-free Survival in Men With Bone Metastases From Prostate Cancer - Skeletal-related event free survival is the time from randomization until the first detected Skeletal Related Event (SRE). Patients who were still SRE-free at 18 months were censored.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
