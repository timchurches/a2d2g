  <interventions>
    <interventions>- Assess the utility in two commercially available smart watches (Apple watch-Apple Inc., California, United States; Fitbit Blaze-Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, United States) in heart rate assessment among patients with arrhythmias and comparing this to control patients in normal sinus rhythm, 
- We would assess the accuracy of smart watches in heart rate calculation among patients with bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias and assess if commercially available devices offer  a novel solution to long term monitoring of heart rate trends in patients
- All patients recruited would have two smart watches on either wrist and a pulse oximeter (with heart rate estimation) in addition to a ward telemetry 5 lead electrocardiogram fitted on simultaneously. 
- The devices will be assessed for a period of 30 minutes to assess the heart rate trends between devices and if the smart watches and oximeter compare in accuracy to the gold standard which is the 5 lead electrocardiogram. 
- Inpatients will be monitored while sitting up in bed on the ward for 1x30 minute session and outpatients undergoing stress testing will be on a treadmill (for the duration of the stress test)
- This intervention will be carried out by a cardiology specialist registrar with a minimum 5 year experience 
- All the patients will be recruited either in an inpatient ward setting (majority), outpatient stress testing within cardiology department. 
 - In addition we will also utilize a mobile smart phone based electrocardiogram in patients (AliveCor Inc. USA) in patients with arrhythmias to assess the accuracy of this technology. Mobile smart phone based heart rate monitoring is an alternative method of heart rate and rhythm estimation which we are aiming to validate in a variety of arrhythmias. 
- This will be utilized in all patients following the 30 minutes of smart watch monitoring for a period of 2 minutes to obtain 3x30 second electrocardiogram traces. 
- In addition to the smart watch cohort of patients, we aim to use AliveCor Technology in those patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter undergoing a cardioversion to assess the utility of this technology in rate and accurate rhythm estimation. 
- Although using this on a different cohort of patients, we aim to answer the same question, i.e. is wearable technology or mobile smart phone electrocardiograms accurate in arrhythmias. 
- We will also validate the use of the single lead ECG (AliveCor)  in comparison to a 12 lead ECG among cardiologists, general physicians and general practitioners
- The AliveCor ECG sensors attached to the back of a smart phone are held using both hands by the participant with the smart phone application remotely recording the heart rhythm trace on the screen. 
- A 12 lead ECG and a single lead ECGx 3 30 second traces (AliveCor) will be performed prior to and following the cardioversion </interventions>
    <comparator>- Control group for accuracy of these devices in patients with arrhythmias will be patients in normal sinus rhythm who will undergo the same evaluation as above for 30 minutes. 
- These participants will use the standard 5 lead electrocardiogram as the gold standard for comparison. </comparator>

    <interventioncode>Treatment: Devices</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- Determine accuracy of commercially available smart watches in heart rate assessment
- Heart rate values will be recorded every 15 seconds for the electrocardiogram, smart watches and the oximeter and a comparison will be performed using two techniques. 
- Firstly we would calculate the average heart rate over each minute for all devices and compare all values against the gold standard (12 lead electrocardiogram). 
- Secondly, we will look to perform statistical analysis to assess the heart rate using a scatter plot to assess the degree of variability between the wearable devices and the electrocardiogram</outcome>
      <timepoint>The heart rate values of all devices within the time intervals pre-specified will all be recorded and tabulated together immediately at the end of the 30 minutes of assessment. 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>- Assess the utility of mobile smart phone based electrocardiogram in patients with arrhythmias 
- This will be done using a 12 lead electrocardiogram as a gold standard and comparing the mobile smart phone based tracings to the above. 
- This will be interpreted by two cardiac electrophysiologists each with over 10 years of experience. 
- We will also in a blinded fashion get both a general physician and general practitioner to assess the same tracings from the smart phone based device to assess the quality and ability to derive a diagnosis from these tracings
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following conclusion of recruiting patients and collating all electrocardiograms- in 3 months approximately, the  tracings will be distributed for assessment by the electrophysiologists, physician and general practitioner. The assessments will be made for each of the 3x30 second traces in every participant. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess patient's attitudes to utilization of wearable technologies in assessment of heart rate and rhythm. This will be assessed using a questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after the 30 minute assessment. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Utilization of wearable technology in estimation of heart rate has wide reaching implications. Firstly, validation of heart rate measurement using this technology in healthy individuals at rest and exercise is vital for any future research going forward. Secondly, if smart watches prove to be accurate in monitoring heart rate trends among patients with arrhythmias, it could be a useful tool in guiding and monitoring response to pharmacological therapy.

Smart watches and wearable technologies also have the ability to provide longer term monitoring of heart rate compared to 24 hour  ECG holter monitoring also called ambulatory monitoring or telemetry - the current standard of care. It may be a cost effective and non-invasive method for patients to remotely assess their heart rate trends and communicate any abnormalities with their cardiologist or general practitioner. This would ensure timely assessment and an earlier change in management strategy that could lead to reduced presentations to the emergency department and improve overall patient satisfaction. Moreover, the ability for patients to accurately track their biometric indices may empower them to be more engaged in their health leading to improved clinical outcomes and quality of life.

In addition to heart rate analysis, a versatile and validated mobile platform for heart rhythm analysis through the use of a mobile single lead ECG device may lead to more widespread adoption of this technology by the clinician. 

Methodology 
Patients that consent for the study will be provided with two smart watches that use wrist PPG technology as well as a hospital grade pulse oximeter for heart rate assessment. The two smart watches intended for use in this study are the Apple Watch and the FitBit Blaze given their popularity and global market share. Heart rate readings in all patients will be documented using data from an ECG linked with the ward telemetry unit (in the case of inpatients) or an ECG ambulatory monitor (in the case of outpatients undergoing stress echo or ECG) as per standard ward or stress testing protocol. 

Each patient will be monitored for a period of approximately 30 minutes with heart rate data being recorded every fifteen seconds among each different modality. Additional parameters recorded include a blood pressure reading at the start and end of the period of monitoring. Baseline characteristics including cardiovascular risk factors, history of arrhythmias and medication use will be noted.  

For patients when using the mobile smart phone electrocardiogram, three heart rate recordings using a single lead mobile ECG device (each lasting approximately 30 seconds) will be taken. These readings will be compared to a 12 lead ECG which will be performed during this period as a comparator. For patients undergoing cardioversion, this will be repeated after the cardioversion procedure.
