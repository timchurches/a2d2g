Treatment: drugs: Ixabepilone, 32 mg/m^2 + Lapatinib, 1250 mg
Initiated a minimum of 14 days following Day 1 of previous cohort (ixabepilone, 32 mg/m^2 + lapatinib, 1000 mg). Lapatinib, 1250 mg, administered orally once a day, every day, for 7 to 14 consecutive days as a lead-in period prior to the first administration of ixabepilone. Following the lapatinib lead-in phase of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of subsequent cycles, ixabepilone, 32 mg/m^2, administered as a 3-hour IV infusion. Lapatinib administered, 1250 mg, orally, once a day, every day, for a 21-day cycle.

      <outcome>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) of Ixabepilone When Administered With Lapatinib - The MTD is defined as the maximum dose that can be administered to 6 participants such that no more than 1 (or fewer than one third if more than 6 participants receive treatment) experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), with at least 2 experiencing a DLT at the next higher dose level.
