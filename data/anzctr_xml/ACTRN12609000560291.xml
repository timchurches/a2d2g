    <interventions>Group 1: single session motivational interview, Group 2: single session motivational interview + self help workbook, Group 3: single session motivational interview + self help workbook + 4 'booster' telephone calls.

The single session motivational interview is the same in all three groups and consists of a 30-40 minute telephone interview administered by a trained counsellor.  The self-help workbook provided to groups 2 and 3 is the same and consists of a range of self-help exercises and strategies that participants can use to reduce their gambling involvement.  The 4 booster telephone calls provided in Group 3 are administered by trained counsellors, are based on motivational interviewing techniques, are 10-20 minutes in duration, and are designed to promote positive self change with respect to gambling involvement.  The 4 booster calls will be made at 1-,4-, 12- and 26- weeks post randomisation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study is a randomised controlled trial of four brief, telephone-based, problem gambling interventions.  All four interventions will be provided to consenting clients of the Gambling Helpline, New Zealand.  The four interventions include: 1) Treatment as Usual (TAU); 2) Motivational Interview (MI); 3) Motivational Interview + Workbook (MI+W); and 4) Motivational Interview + Workbook + Booster sessions (MI+W+B). The primary hypotheses include:
1.All four groups will evidence significant reduction in gambling
2.The Motivational Interview (MI) group will show similar improvement to Treatment as Usual (TAU)
3.The Motivational Interview/Workbook group (MI+W) and the Motivational Interview/Workbook/Booster (MI+W+B) group will show greater improvement than the MI and TAU groups
4.The MI+W+B group will show greater improvement than the other three groups at the 12-month follow-up.</summary>
