  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two different samples - a community and a schools sample. In the community sample, participants are instructed to use the site www.biteback.org.au for 1 hour per week for a period of 6 weeks. The website is built around 9 domains: gratitude, social relationships, flow, mindfulness, kindness, character strengths, hope, optimism, and healthy lifestyles. Website includes interviews, videos, interactive activities, meditation tracks, and information. In the community sample, participants are given the choice of two neutral websites, 'ABC3' and 'The Fix'. Reminders to use the website are sent weekly. In the schools sample, participating classes of students are given individual workbooks which students work through during their class time. The workbooks contain reflective questions, instructions, and links to follow which guide them through the Biteback website. In the schools sample, the control group are given workbooks that contains reflective questions, instructions, and links to a variety of neutral websites, ABC, AYCC, NRDC, WWF, Wikipedia, IMDB, and world youth news. Students will use the program for a total of 6 hours over a period of approximately 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the control intervention in the community sample, participants can chose between the 'ABC3' website and 'The Fix' website. They are instructed to use one of the websites for 1 hour per week for 6 weeks. Weekly reminders to continue using the control website are received by participants. In the schools sample, participants are given a workbook that is similar to the workbook for Biteback  - it contains reflective questions, instructions, and links to follow for a variety of neutral websites - ABC, AYCC, NRDC, WWF, Wikipedia, IMDB, and world youth news. They use the workbook for the same amount of time as the group using the Biteback workbook - equivalent to 6 hours over approximately 6 weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>Community study: potential participants are recruited through advertisements, flyers, and websites. The study is described as being an investigation into websites' effects on the way young people view the world. Expressions of interest are made by completing an online battery of questionnaires. Once parental permission is obtained for those under 16 years of age, a battery of baseline questionnaires are sent. Upon completion of baseline questionnaires, participants are allocated to either a control or an experimental condition. Participants are then emailed the relevant website to use. Randomisation is performed by a researcher who is independent of the study.
Schools study: a decision to enrol classes (usually the entire year) is made by the principles of the schools. Parental permission is obtained for students under 16 years of age. Randomisation is conducted by entire classrooms (each comprising up to 33 students). Classrooms are randomised by school blocks to ensure even numbers of control and experimental groups. If there are uneven numbers, the experimental group is given an additional class. Randomisation is performed by a researcher who is independent of the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a pilot study as part of the development of Bite Back, an online positive psychology intervention for young people. The Study seeks to understand the effectiveness and useability of Bite Back in a group of young people aged 12 to 18 years from both a community sample and a high school sample. In the community sample, participants are encouraged to use the program at their leisure, while in the schools sample, the website is used in a structured format with the aid of a workbook. Participants are randomly allocated to either the experimental condition (Bite Back) or the control condition (neutral websites). It is hypothesised that the experimental conditions will demonstrate increased wellbeing at the end of the trial period in comparison to the control condition.</summary>
