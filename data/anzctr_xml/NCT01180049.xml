  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Independently Assessed Progression-free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of disease progression by the independent assessor or to death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.
PFS = (earliest date of progression or death due to any cause- randomization date+1)/30.4.
PFS assessment was done using EMA guidelines for sensitivity analysis censoring.
Participants who were alive and progression-free at the time of analysis were censored on the date of last assessment; participants without adequate baseline assessment or without post-baseline assessments were censored on the randomization date; participants who died or progressed after 2 or more missed visits were censored on the date of last tumor assessment prior to the missing visit; and participants who started new anti-cancer therapy prior to death or progression were censored on the date of last tumor assessment prior to the start of anti-tumor treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization date to the date of first documentation of progression or death (average follow up done for 15 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization date until death (average follow up done for 18.6 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Independent Assessment - Objective Response Rate (ORR = CR + PR) - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR according to the Cheson Criteria relative to all randomized Participants. Tumor responses were determined using information from objective measurements from computed tomography information including B-symptom evaluation, physical examination, ECOG performance status, assessment of liver and spleen, laboratory assessments such as bone marrow biopsies and/or aspirates, biochemical markers of disease activity and hematology results.
Participants who did not have on-study radiographic tumor re-evaluation or who died, progressed or dropped out for any reason prior to reaching a CR or PR were counted as non-responders in the (CT) scans, as well as clinical assessment of ORR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization date until end of treatment (average follow up done for 15 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator's Assessment ORR (ORR = CR + PR) - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with confirmed CR or PR according to the Cheson Criteria relative to all randomized Participants. Tumor responses were determined using information from objective measurements from computed tomography information including B-symptom evaluation, physical examination, ECOG performance status, assessment of liver and spleen, laboratory assessments such as bone marrow biopsies and/or aspirates, biochemical markers of disease activity and hematology results.
Participants who did not have on-study radiographic tumor re-evaluation or who died, progressed or dropped out for any reason prior to reaching a CR or PR were counted as non-responders in the (CT) scans, as well as clinical assessment of ORR.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Infection- Related AEs - To assess the safety through percentages of participants with treatment-emergent infection- related AEs TEAE: Treatment start date = adverse event start date or adverse event worsened with respect to grade after treatment started</outcome>
      <timepoint>From screening (Day -28 to Day -1) until end of treatment (within 30 days of last TEMSR infusion)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-emergent Bleeding-related AEs - To assess the safety through percentage of participants with treatment-emergent bleeding-related AEs (Grade 2 or Higher).
TEAE: Treatment start date = adverse event start date or adverse event worsened with respect to grade after treatment started</outcome>
      <timepoint>From screening (Day -28 to Day -1) until end of treatment (within 30 days of last TEMSR infusion)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quantify the Potential Effect of TEMSR on AUC and Cmax - Potential TEMSR effects were investigated by calculating the ratio of AUCs with and without concomitant TEMSR from the model-estimated effect of TEMSR on apparent clearance (CL/F) values and using individual ratios of observed Cmax values with and without concomitant temsirolimus, for both parent and metabolite. The AUC mean ratio was calculated as 1 / mean shift on apparent clearance from TEMSR, and the 90% CI of the AUC ratios was calculated as 1 / 90% CI of the shift on apparent clearance from TEMSR.
AUC: Area under plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity Cmax: Characterization of maximum observed plasma concentration</outcome>
      <timepoint>From one week predose (Day -7, -4hr, -8hr, -48hr) upto 2 weeks post dose (4hr, 8hr, 48hr and Day 8)</timepoint>
