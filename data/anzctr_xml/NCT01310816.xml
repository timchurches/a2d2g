          -  Patients must have documented radiographic progression of disease within the 6-month
             period prior to screening. (MRI or CT Scan)

             skin cancer and localized cured prostate and cervical cancer.

          -  Systemic anti-cancer therapy within 21 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or

          -  Medically significant surgical procedures or significant traumatic injury within 28
             days before Day 1.

          -  Inadequate hematologic function defined by:

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;8.0 g/dL (80 g/L) (may be increased to this level with transfusion as long
             as there is no evidence of active bleeding).

          -  Inadequate hepatic function defined by:

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 x upper
             limit of normal (ULN).

             treatment.

          -  Significant co-morbid condition or disease, which in the judgment of the Investigator,
             would place the patient at undue risk or interfere with the study. Examples include,
             but are not limited to sepsis and recent significant traumatic injury.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to IPI-926, or any of the excipients in IPI-926 or placebo
