  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Genetic outcome - To investigate the associations between genetic factors and the development of persistent chronic LBP, in patients developing persistent chronic symptoms (defined as pain that persists 3 months or more), after an episode of acute LBP. The development of persistent chronic pain will be assessed at 3 months after the acute episode.
Existing and newly generated GWAs will be analyzed and their possible correlation with the risk of pain becoming persistent chronic will be detected in a wide, international population of caucasian ancestry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycomic and Activomic outcome - Recognize Glycomic and Activomic data associated with patients who develop CLBP compared to patients who do not develop CLBP after an episode of acute LBP. The sample size will better defined after the first interim analysis of first 400 patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Epigenetic outcome - Investigators will identify CpG methylation patterns that may be associated with the development and maintenance of persistent chronic LBP pain after an episode of acute LBP in the first 200 patients who develop CLBP and first 200 patients who will not develop it.
In the same cohort of 400 patients, investigators will analyze microRNAs (miRNAs) to investigate their role in predicting risk of persistent chronic pain after acute episode, opioid tolerance and response to therapy after the beginning of opioid therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Next-generation sequencing outcome - Investigators will detect rare variants with strong or modest effects on LBP symptoms and response to therapy using next generation sequencing of candidate genes in 200 incident cases with persistent chronic pain and 200 controls. In particular, investigators will analyze new genetic variants that may impact on intervertebral disc stability, new variants modifying inflammation, variants of pain signalling, new variants in genes encoding analgesic drug metabolism and other genes from literature search.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stratification based on pain characteristics - "Omics" data will be compared stratifying our population according to pain characteristics, pain intensity, response to treatment and duration of pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stratification based on pain pathophysiology - In a subgroup of patients, "omics" data will be compared stratifying our population according to pain pathophysiology: discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, facet joint pain, sacroiliac joint pain, low back pain with radicular pain (radicular pain not predominant) and widespread low back pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stratification based on 6 months follow-up - "Omics" data will be also compared stratifying our population according to the persistence of pain at 6 months despite receiving a treatment following current guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>54 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective observational cohort multinational clinical study. There are no
      biomarkers to help predict in which patients acute low back pain (LBP) will transform into
      chronic low back pain (CLBP). Human variability and different common comorbidities complicate
      the picture and make stratification of patients into correct subgroups difficult. However,
      drugs act by targeting specific molecular pathways and are therefore efficient only in a
      subgroup of patients sharing common molecular pathology and common genetics. Both CLBP and
      disc degeneration are known to be heritable. Little investigation has taken place for genetic
      variants in CLBP. The main aim of this trial is to identify "omics biomarkers" associated
      with the transition from acute (single episode of low back pain) to persistent/chronic LBP
      (pain lasting more than 12 weeks).</summary>
