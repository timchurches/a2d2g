  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cohort 1: Safety and Tolerability Based on Adverse Events (AEs) - AE: any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during study; irrespective of relationship with treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after informed consent. AE includes serious AEs (SAEs) as well as Non-SAEs. SAE (subset of AE): medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event. Number of participants with AEs and SAEs are reported. AE that started at/after initial dosing of study drug, or increased in severity after initial dosing of study drug is considered treatment-emergent. Results are reported separately for monotherapy period (Period 1: Day 1 to Day 14) and combination therapy period (Period 2: Day 15 to Day 21).</outcome>
