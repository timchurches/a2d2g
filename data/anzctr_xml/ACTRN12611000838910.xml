    <interventions>This will be a randomised, cross over intervention study, with two arms which looks at the effect of regularly eating 30 grams of whole, raw or lightly roasted and salted hazelnuts on cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood cholesterol (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoproteins) and consumers acceptability. The effects of hazelnut consumption on biomarkers (alpha-tocopherol, Hs-CRP, glucose, body composition and blood pressure) of heart disease will also be examined. This study will also compare the acceptability and health effects of regular nut consumption between Maori and European reflective of the general population. After a two-week run-in period, participants will be allocated to receive 30 grams of raw hazelnuts per day or 30 grams of lightly roasted and salted hazelnuts per day in random order. Each treatment will be of four weeks duration with a two-week washout between each treatment. Participants will be consuming the different forms of hazelnuts for a total of eight weeks. The study will be of 12-weeks duration.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation concealment will be used. This will be achieved through allocation being performed by the statistician who will have no involvement in the enrolment process and is located in another building. Once participants have been accepted into the study, sufficient details for allocation (study number, age, sex, BMI) will be sent to the statistician who will return group allocation codes once blocks are complete.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated using random sequences of the two groups generated using SAS 9.1.3. Due to the strong possibility of age, sex, and BMI effects, groups will be balanced using 7 strata constructed using sex (M/F), age (18-40, 41-65), and BMI (25-29.9, &gt;29.9), ethnicity (Maori/ European) categories. Allocation will be conducted by the "off-site" statistician.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite the public health recommendation to consume 30g of nuts per day, there is limited data investigating whether the recommended amount of nuts is considered acceptable to the consumer. One study reported that consuming the recommended 30 grams per day of nuts was found to be achievable and acceptable. The study population used in this research was largely European, therefore whether the results can be extrapolated to other ethics groups e.g. Maori, is unknown. 

In addition to measuring the acceptability of nuts, it is of equal importance to investigate the health properties of nuts. To date, there are five human intervention trials that have investigated the effect of hazelnut supplementation on plasma cholesterol levels. As the study population in the previous studies was largely European, it is of interest to compare the health effects of regular nut consumption in European and other ethnic group, i.e. Maori.

The main aim of The Nuts2 Study is to examine the effect of regularly eating 30 grams of raw or lightly roasted/salted hazelnuts on cardiovascular disease risk factors including blood cholesterol (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, apolipoproteins) and consumers acceptability. The effects of hazelnut consumption on biomarkers (alpha-tocopherol, Hs-CRP, glucose, body composition and blood pressure) of heart disease will also be examined. The secondary aim of this study is to compare the acceptability and health effects of regular nut consumption between Maori and European reflective of the general population.</summary>
