  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TAXUS ATLAS Small Vessel is a global, multi-center, single-arm, trial of patients with
      coronary arteries less than 2.5 mm in diameter who are treated with the TAXUS Liberté stent
      versus an historical TAXUS Express control derived from a subset of lesion-matched TAXUS V
      patients treated with a 2.25 mm stent. The objective of the study is to evaluate clinical and
      angiographic outcomes of TAXUS Liberté-SR 2.25 mm stent in de novo lesions. The hypothesis is
      that the TAXUS Liberté-SR stent has non-inferior safety and efficacy to the TAXUS Express-SR
      stent in the treatment of de novo lesions in small coronary vessels.</summary>
