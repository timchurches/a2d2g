Serum Periostin levels will be measured at 7 time points: Baseline (within 48 hours of fracture occuring), Week 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and 6 months post baseline, via a specific periostin laboratory assay.

    <statisticalmethods>34 participants are sufficient to detect a paired difference in periostin of 0.5 of a standard deviation with 80% power.  The conventional interpretation of an effect size of 0.5 of a standard deviation is of a medium effect size.  For a comparison between large and small bone fractures a sample size of 68 has 90% power to detect a 0.8 standard deviation difference, a large effect size difference.
For analysis purposes the periostin levels will be plotted against time and a non-parametric scatter plot smoother will be used to determine if there is a pattern of variation with time that might be usefully explored with parametric regression (e.g. linear, quadratic, cubic time terms).  Paired t-test and mixed linear models will be used to compare the six month periostin level with measurements at the other times to formally compare the change with time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Levels of POSTN (a protein-coding gene, also known as osteoblast specific factor) gene expression and periostin have been measured in a number of tissues and disease states and periostin has been shown to be present in the periosteum and periodontal ligament being critical for the formation and maintenance of bone and teeth. 
Levels of POSTN gene expression following fracture have been measured but as serum periostin levels have not been measured following bone fractures it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of increased POSTN gene expression. This study endeavours to measure the serum periostin levels in participants with small bone and large bone fractures and in participants undergoing hip or knee joint replacements to determine if there are clinically significant changes in periostin levels following a fracture.  </summary>
