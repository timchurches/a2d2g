  <interventions>
    <interventions>On arrival to the postnatal unit, participants (mothers of well, term newborns meeting eligibility criteria) will be randomised to one of three options: The First Days Pepi-Pod (inbed cosleeper and postnatal version of the Pepi-Pod), The MaBim Neonatal Cot (side-car cot) or a standard bedside cot. An allocation to a cot is intended for the duration of hospitalisation.
 
ARM 1: The First Days Pod is a plastic container equipped with appropriate bedding designed to provide a zone of physical protection around baby as they sleep in an adult bed with a parent/adult caregiver in the postnatal environment. Participants will be shown the Video Clip titled Safe, Sleep, Little One (CFOC Ltd, 2016) by the midwife once orientated to the postnatal ward. Participants allocated to the First Days Pepi-Pod will also be asked by the midwife to view the Picture Demonstration (CFOC Ltd, 2016) and the First Days Pod Safety Briefing and have their questions answered. Allocation to the First Days Pod is intended for the duration of hospitalisation.

ARM 2: The MaBim Neonatal Cot is a side car cot that converts to a three sided cot that is positioned adjacent to the adult postnatal bed to allow contact while on a separate sleep surface. All participants will be shown the Video Clip titled Safe, Sleep, Little One (CFOC Ltd, 2016) by the midwife once orientated to the postnatal ward. Participants allocated to the MaBim neonatal crib will be shown the MaBim Product Brochure and the MaBim Safety Briefing by the midwife and have their questions answered. Allocation to the MaBim cot is intended for the duration of hospitalisation.

CONTROL: a standard hospital cot. All participants will be shown the Video Clip titled Safe, Sleep, Little One (CFOC Ltd, 2016) by the midwife once orientated to the postnatal ward. Participants randomised to the control group (usual cot care) will receive standard care instructions including Hospital Cot Safety Briefing provided by the midwife and have their questions answered.

    <statisticalmethods>A target sample of 180 maternal participants and their babies will be recruited (approximately 60 in each group) in this Pilot Study to allow an attrition rate of 50% during the 4 month follow-up period in order to achieve a final sample of 90 participants (with 30 mother-infant  pairs in each group). The primary aim of this pilot is to gather observational data relating to the feasibility and acceptability of the Safe Sleep Enabler options and to test the non-blinded, randomised control trial protocol intended for a larger study. 
Based on an estimated 30-40 eligible births per week at this regional hospital, and taking into account conservative participation rates of 40% and attrition post enrolment (50%), in addition to average length of hospital stay (approx. 1-3 days for vaginal deliveries, 3-5 days for delivery by caesarean section), it is anticipated that a maximum recruitment period of 5-6 months will be required to achieve the target sample of 180 eligible mothers and their babies with complete datasets.
The estimated staff population is approximately 80 nurses and midwives; it is anticipated that a target sample size of approximately 65-70 staff (approx. 80% response rate) will be achieved based on previous study participation with this cohort. Power calculations have not been conducted as the population is fixed by the maternity unit setting, and the primary aim of the pilot was to determine feasibility of the protocol and staff acceptance and use of a novel safe sleep enabler in this environment.
Audits of maternal charts and infant sleep observations prior to pilot RCT have been included to provide important baseline relating to current safe sleep practices in this setting. The sample size of 90-100 infant sleep observations and matched maternal chart audits will be adequate to provide a snapshot of current practice; to compare with data collected in previous studies in similar settings (Young et al., 2010); is feasible to collect within a relatively short period of time using in-kind time and resources available to the investigating research team; and provides the SCUH with valuable data to meet state guideline recommendations relating to current monitoring of safe sleep practices (Queensland Health, 2013).
Data analysis 
Pilot Data collection and analyses will include maternal and infant demographics; breastfeeding outcomes (at discharge, 6-8 weeks and 4 months); length of stay; maternal-infant attachment; maternal satisfaction and perceptions relating to enabler use; staff time to recruit and educate families, perceptions relating to intervention impact and adverse events; and maternal and staff awareness of safe sleep recommendations (self reported and observed). 
Maternal Data: Analysis of maternal data will be conducted using the principles of intention to treat. All participants who were enrolled and randomly allocated to treatment will be included and analysed in the groups to which they were randomised. A further analysis will be based on actual use, consistent with a recent published study using Wahakura (Baddock et al., 2017) which performed analyses based on intention to treat and actual use.
Statistical analyses will be performed to report the prevalence and proportions of variables surveyed. Questionnaire results will be entered into a purpose-built Microsoft Excel database for data cleaning and preparation for statistical analysis. A 10% random selection (approximately 9-10 questionnaires from each of the maternal records, staff survey and audits) will be double entered to assess data-entry accuracy and intra-rater reliability. Consistency checks will be performed on all variables to ensure that only valid responses will form the basis of the ensuing analysis. 
Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive techniques such as frequency and percentage and measures of central tendency and distribution (for example, mean and standard deviation or median and IQR). Normality of data will be assessed. Group comparisons to comparing equivalency of control and interventions will be conducted with Chi-squared test for categorical measures and analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous measures as appropriate assessing for normality and equality of variances. 
Staff Survey Data: Should continuous data be distributed symmetrically, then means and standard deviation (SD) will be reported. Medians, inter-quartile ranges (IQR), frequencies and percentages will be used to report the central tendency, spread and empirical distributions of categorical and non-symmetric continuous variables elicited at each survey. All bivariate comparisons of categorical frequencies will be undertaken using Fisher's exact test, log-linear and logistic models, while McNemars test and Agresti's test of symmetry will be used to detect differences between participants' responses at any two survey points (pretest vs post-test). Continuous data will be analysed using Student's t-test, Student's paired t-test, ANOVA or using their nonparametric equivalents (should the data exhibit non-normality).
Audit data: All qualitative data will be coded prior to data entry. Frequency data will be reported and analysed using standard categorical techniques (accounting for the matched nature of the data between mother and baby). Univariate linear modelling will be conducted for dependent variables that will include infant sleep position, infant placement in the cot, placement and securement of bedding; and presence of particular objects in the cot, e.g. Infant quilts, toys, cot bumpers. 
All statistical comparisons will be analysed using the SAS or SPSS statistical software package (IBM Corp 2013). A value of p=0.05 will be used to define statistical significance for primary outcomes as they are independent of each other. We recognize that there are a large number of secondary outcomes and will report uncorrected p values with a nominal level of significance of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reducing infant mortality and morbidity,and promoting breastfeeding, remain public health priorities. Sharing a sleep surface with a baby is a common, often culturally valued infant care practice that promotes breastfeeding but under certain circumstances increases risk of infant death. Limited published research has evaluated portable sleep spaces that allow close parent-baby proximity on the same or immediately adjacent sleep surface, especially within hospital environments. 
This pilot aims to determine acceptability, feasibility, safety and impact on breastfeeding outcomes and maternal-infant attachment of two safe sleep enablers within the SCHHS maternity unit. Families will be recruited at the 36-weeks antenatal visit. Eligible, consenting postpartum women admitted to postnatal ward (target sample n=180) during a 4-month period will be allocated either a First Days Pepi-Pod, MaBim Side-Car Crib or a Standard Hospital Cot.
The priority of the pilot is to test the novel concept of safe sleep enablers for the first time in an Australian setting. Two primary hypotheses will focus on maternal acceptability of the safe sleep enablers as alternative infant sleep spaces and the feasibility of the proposed protocol in a busy maternity setting.
This pilot study aims to determine 
1.	Acceptability and maternal satisfaction with a safe sleep enabler.
2.	Acceptability of safe sleep enablers (intervention) by staff working within a busy postnatal maternity unit.
3.	Feasibility of a large randomised controlled trial using the proposed protocol
and
4.	Describe clinical outcomes of the safe sleep enabler group and control (including        
maternal satisfaction with care options, breastfeeding initiation and duration, maternal-infant attachment, awareness of safe sleeping recommendations, incidence of shared sleeping, length of stay) to inform protocol revisions for the larger randomised controlled trial.

The primary hypotheses are:
1.	Acceptability with infant safe sleep enablers will be demonstrated by mothers in the maternity unit setting.
2.	Feasibility of a pilot protocol to evaluate safe sleep enablers in the maternity unit setting will be demonstrated (as measured by staff support, appropriate application of the protocol: consent, randomisation, documentation processes).

This will be a pilot feasibility study in the first instance, intended to support the design of a non-blinded, randomised controlled trial in the future. The study will use a concurrent mixed methods design conducted in three phases.</summary>
