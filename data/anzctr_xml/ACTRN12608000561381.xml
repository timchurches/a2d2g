  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mental health first aid training. The training is given to teachers in two one-day parts. Part 1 was designed for all education staff and covered departmental policy on mental health issues, common mental health problems in adolescents, and practice helping a student with such a problem. Part 2 was for teachers who have a paticular responsibility for student welfare and covered crises that require an extended first aid response and first aid for less common mental health problems. The time between the two parts varied depending on the scheduling arranged by the individual school, but was within the same term.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mental health knowledge. This will be measured using a 21-item questionnaire, covering material taught in the course, in which statements are rated agree, disagree or don't know.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stigmatizing attitudes. This will be measured by a 14-item questionnaire covering personal and perceived stigma. The questionnaire is adapted from the following publication:
Griffiths, K.M., Nakane, Y., Christensen, H., Yoshioka, K., Jorm, A.F. &amp; Nakane, H. (2006). Stigma in response to mental disorders: A comparison of Australia and Japan. BMC Psychiatry, 6, 21.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Helping behaviours of teacher towards their students. This will be measured with a question asking: "Did you talk with a student about their mental health problem (never, once, occasionally, frequently).
If yes, did you do any of the following:
Spent time listening to their problem (never, once, occasionally, frequently)
Helped to calm them down (never, once, occasionally, frequently)
Talked to them about suicidal thoughts (never, once, occasionally, frequently)
Recommended they seek professional help(never, once, occasionally, frequently)
Anything else (specify)</outcome>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation is based on clusters (schools) rather than individuals, so that all teachers at a school receive the same intervention. The person enrolling the schools is unaware, when the enrollment is made, to which group the school would be allocated. Allocation is done by one of the investigators (Tony Jorm) after another investigator (Helen Scales) has enrolled the schools. The allocation decision is conveyed from Tony Jorm to Helen Scales by email.</concealment>
    <sequence>16 schools are matched in pairs with similar size and location (urban, rural). Tony Jorm from ORYGEN Research Centre randomly assigns the first or second school to be in the intervention or control condition using the Random.org website. Participating schools are enrolled by Helen Scales from the South Australian Department of Education and Childrens Services and she informs them of the allocation.</sequence>
