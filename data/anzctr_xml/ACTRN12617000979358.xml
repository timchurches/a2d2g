  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be a randomized cross-over trial. The study will involve the use of take home MP3 players and in-ear headphones, containing recorded broad-band noise (BBN) and environmental sounds for tinnitus relief, which the participant will listen to for a minimum of one hour per day for sixteen weeks (8 weeks BBN, 8 weeks environmental sounds). The long-term average loudness of BBN and environmental sounds will be equivalent. There will be a three week wash-out period in between the two conditions. 
A cross-over trial design will be used to enable repeated measures of both BBN and environmental sound therapies for participants (15 participants: predictable first and 15 participants: unpredictable first). All participants will be tested by the student investigator throughout the trial. 

BBN sound therapy
a) Broadband noise (BBN) set at desired listening level for comfort. Tinnitus will be audible alongside the BBN.
b) Frequency of stimulation: Minimum 1 hour per day for 8 continuous weeks
d) Mode of administration: MP3 file while participants will listen to using a Phillips ViBe 4GB MP3 player + Panasonic in-ear headphones (RP-HJE290) with Budloks Sport Grip

Environmental sound therapy
a)	Environmental nature sounds (beach surf, rain, cicadas) recorded by the PI and student investigator, which vary in a random manner based one or more of the following: centre frequency, frequency relative to tinnitus, amplitude and modulation rate. Tinnitus will be audible at random time intervals alongside the nature sounds.
b) Frequency of stimulation: Minimum 1 hour per day for 8 continuous weeks
d) Mode of administration: MP3 file which participants will listen to using a Phillips ViBe 4GB MP3 player + Panasonic in-ear headphones (RP-HJE290) with Budloks Sport Grip

Follow-ups appointments were scheduled at two, four and eight weeks post fitting to monitor adherence to the intervention and changes in outcome measures over time.

    <concealment>Existing volunteers from the University of Auckland Tinnitus Database will be approached via email – a participant information sheet (PIS) and consent form (CF) will be attached along with the study invite. These are individuals who have expressed interest in participating in tinnitus research. Interested individuals can contact the student investigator by email or phone. Allocation was concealed in that participants were first recruited into the study and when sufficient participants were recruited, the order of sound presentation for participants (Order 1 = BBN then Nature OR Order 2 = Nature then BBN) was decided using an online, free True Random Number Generator (https://www.random.org/). </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Participant numbers: Based on Wise et al. (2012, Unpublished thesis) data for tinnitus population variance, for a significant change of 13 on TFI, with mean 28.15 and standard deviation 17.1 (one-tailed), significance 0.05 and power 0.8, the sample size needed is 11 (Wise, 2012). 30 participants are therefore determined as being sufficient for this trial. 

Data will be analyzed using quantitative SPSS software tools. Primary and secondary outcome scores over time following administration of each intervention sound will be analyzed (e.g. repeated measures ANOVAs) to see if they are significantly different. 
Thematic analysis will be conducted on the responses provided by the participants during follow ups and during the end-of-trial interview.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mechanisms of tinnitus (phantom sound) perception and sound therapy (treating tinnitus using sounds) are still poorly understood. Understanding such mechanisms can enable for developing better interventions/treatments for tinnitus sufferers. It is of interest to administer a randomized control sound therapy trial comparing the effectiveness of predictable and unpredictable sounds for tinnitus relief. It is also of interest to see how the emotional component of sounds may influence its effectiveness as a tinnitus treatment sound. Aim: Understand how sound therapy of long-term duration using broadband noise (BBN) and environmental sounds affects tinnitus characteristics. Hypotheses: Administration of environmental sound therapy will result in lower tinnitus loudness and distress outcomes than BBN sound therapy. Tinnitus treatment sounds which evoke positive, relaxed emotions (high valence) will result in lower tinnitus loudness and distress outcomes than static, neutral sounds. </summary>
