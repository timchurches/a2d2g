  <interventions>
    <interventions>The focus of this study is to examine whether addressing social anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms, which are directly related to residential substance abuse treatment, improves engagement and retention in individuals with comorbid SAD and substance use. 

Participants randomly assigned to the intervention will receive 2 individual and 2 group sessions of SAD symptom-targeted psychological therapy  prior to inpatient treatment at Odyssey House, a residential drug and alcohol therapeutic community based in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria. The group sessions will generally consist of only of 3-4 participants, and will be facilitated by a registered and experienced psychologist.  An additional two therapeutic 'booster' telephone counselling sessions will be delivered within the first few weeks of the client's residency at the Therapeutic Community (TC).

The psychological intervention includes psychoeducation, cognitive challenging, reality testing, attention training and facing feared situations in a gradual way. Two randomised control trials support the effectiveness of the program in reducing social anxiety symptoms and other related psychological problems (Rapee, Abbott, Baillie, &amp; Gaston, 2007; Wilson &amp; Rapee, 2005).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard pre-residential preparatory treatment delivered by Odyssey House Victoria (which primarily targets substance use issues, readiness for change and preparedness for long term residence in TC). Participants assigned to the control group will also receive a written booklet including psychoeducation and information on basic anxiety management strategies.</comparator>

    <concealment>Approximately 90 individuals (45 in each group) who provide informed consent will be recruited for participation in this study from Odyssey House Victoria. Participation is voluntary, free of charge and clients are able to withdraw at any stage. In order to ensure comparability between groups, randomisation occurs after recruitment, selection criteria, and baseline assessments have been completed. At baseline all eligible participants will be assigned a numeric code. An independent researcher who is at a central administration site is the holder of a confidential allocation schedule.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The focus of this study is to examine whether addressing social anxiety disorder (SAD) symptoms which are directly related to residential substance use treatment improves engagement and retention in individuals with comorbid SAD and substance abuse. 

It is hypothesised that those individuals who receive psychological treatment for SAD symptoms are more likely to enter residential treatment, and more likely to stay in treatment for at least a 3 month period when compared to the control group.</summary>
