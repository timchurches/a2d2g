             desire disorder as a co-morbid disorder is allowed only if it began after the female
             orgasmic disorder diagnosis;

          -  Be on a reliable birth control method (ie, stable systemic hormonal contraception for
             the whole duration of the study and 30 days after study completion [for at least 3
             months prior to study], IUD, barrier method) or not engaging in heterosexual

             laboratory facility (no evidence of malignancy) within the 2 years prior to
             Randomization;

          -  Have a clinically acceptable mammogram;

          -  Be able to complete a web-based questionnaire within 24 hours of each sexual event;
