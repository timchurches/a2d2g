  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive a pair of Formthotics (Registered Trademark) prefabricated foot orthoses (Foot Science International, Christchurch, New Zealand). The insoles will be full-length insoles made from 140 kg/m3 single density, closed cell polyethylene foam. Each participant will have their foot orthoses fitted to their athletic shoes and Defence-issued boots (i.e. two pairs of insoles per participant). All participants will be asked to wear the foot orthoses as often as possible during the 11 week trial. Adherence to the insoles will be documented by participants in weekly self-report diaries and navy medical records. In addition, adherence to the insoles will be confirmed with a blinded assessor at weeks 2 and 11.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive 3 mm flat insoles. The flat insoles will be manufactured by the same company as the prefabricated foot orthoses (Foot Science International, Christchurch, New Zealand), will be full-length insoles and will be made from 140 kg/m3 single density, closed cell polyethylene foam. The flat insoles will be fitted to the participants athletic shoes and Defence-issued boots (i.e. two pairs of insoles per participant). All participants will be asked to wear the flat insoles as often as possible during the trial. </comparator>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>A prospective sample size calculation has estimated that 306 participants (i.e. approximately 153 participants per group) are required to provide 80% power to detect a clinically worthwhile difference (alpha set at 5%). The sample size for the study was calculated assuming: (i) a combined incidence of injury of 30% for medial tibial stress syndrome, patello-femoral joint pain, Achilles tendinopathy, and plantar fasciitis/plantar heel pain, (ii) a 50% reduction in injury in the intervention group, and (iii) a drop-out rate of 20%. 

Statistical analysis will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle for all randomised participants. The endpoint will be the completion of the 11 weeks of basic training for each participant. Multiple imputation will be used to replace any missing data using five iterations, with age, and group allocation as predictors. Participant characteristics and baseline data will be summarised by descriptive statistics. Distribution of continuous variables will be checked and transformation carried out if necessary. Differences in the primary and secondary outcome measures between the two groups will be compared. The proportion of participants developing lower limb injuries during the 11 week training period in each group will be compared using relative risks. Comfort and adherence of the shoe insole interventions will be analysed using independent t-tests, and chi-square analyses, respectively. Effect sizes will be determined using standardised mean differences for continuous scaled data and risk ratios for nominal scaled data. Hypothesis tests will be considered significant if p &lt; 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overuse lower limb injuries related to training are common in people who participate in regular physical activity. Foot orthoses are commonly used for the prevention of such injuries but evidence for their effectiveness is limited. In this study, participants will be randomised to using flat insoles or prefabricated foot orthosis while undertaking 11 weeks of basic training at the Royal Australian Navy Recruit School, Cerberus, Victoria, Australia. This randomised controlled trial will evaluate the effectiveness of foot orthoses for the prevention of lower limb injuries in naval recruits.</summary>
