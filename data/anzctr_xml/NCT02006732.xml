  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>FEV1 AUC0-3h Response - Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) Area under the curve (AUC) 0-3h was calculated as the area under the FEV1-time curve from 0 to 3h post-dose using the trapezoidal rule, divided by the duration (3h) to report in litres. FEV1 AUC0-3h response was defined as FEV1 AUC0-3h minus baseline FEV1. The adjusted mean and standard error (SE) are obtained from fitting a mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment, planned test day, treatment by test day interaction, baseline, and baseline by test day interaction; patient as a random effect; spatial power covariance structure for within-patient errors and Kenward-Roger approximation of denominator degrees of freedom.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough FEV1 Response (Change From Baseline) - Trough FEV1 was defined as the FEV1 value at the end of the dosing interval (24 hours). It was calculated as the mean of the 2 FEV1 measurements performed 23 h and at 23 h 50 min after inhalation of study medication at day 85. Trough FEV1 response was defines as trough FEV1 minus baseline FEV1. The adjusted mean (SE) are obtained from fitting a mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment, planned test day, treatment by test day interaction, baseline, and baseline by test day interaction; patient as a random effect; spatial power covariance structure for within-patient errors and Kenward-Roger approximation of denominator degrees of freedom.</outcome>

      <outcome>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score Based on Combined Dataset From This Study and the Replicate Study NCT01964352 - This endpoint was evaluated after combining the data from this and the replicate study NCT01964352 as specified in the analysis plan. The SGRQ ranges from 0 (no impairment of quality of life) to 100 (highest impairment of quality of life).

      <outcome>Trough Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Response (Change From Baseline) - Trough FVC was defined as the FVC value at the end of the dosing interval (24 hours). It was calculated as the mean of the 2 FVC measurements performed 23 h and at 23 h 50 min after inhalation of study medication at day 85. Trough FVC response was defined as trough FVC minus baseline FVC. The adjusted mean (SE) are obtained from fitting a mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) including fixed effects of treatment, planned test day, treatment by test day interaction, baseline, and baseline by test day interaction; patient as a random effect; spatial power covariance structure for within-patient errors and Kenward-Roger approximation of denominator degrees of freedom.</outcome>

      <outcome>TDI Focal Score Based on Data From This Individual Study - Mahler Transitional Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score was performed to measure the effect of the treatment on patients' dyspnoea.(Rating scale of 3 components - change in functional impairment, change in magnitude of tasks, change in magnitude of efforts. Worst score = -9, best score = +9).
