      <outcome>Efficacy: Freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety - Freedom from the composite endpoint of target vessel revascularization (TVR), major amputation and major reintervention (new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) of index limb and device- and procedure-related death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 Days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute Device Success - Device success is defined as, a per device basis, the achievement of successful delivery and deployment of the registry device(s) as intended at the intended target lesion, without balloon rupture or inflation/deflation abnormalities and a successful withdrawal of the registry system. If a device is inserted into the subject but not used due to user error (e.g. inappropriate balloon length or transit time too long) this device will not be included in the device success assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedural Success - Attainment of =30% residual stenosis by visual estimate in the treatment area above the knee and attainment of =50% residual stenosis by visual estimate in the treatment area below the knee without major adverse events during the index procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom separately from each of the following adverse events listed below: - All-cause death
Device- and procedure-related mortality
Unexpected device or drug-related AEs
Index limb amputation (major and minor reported separately)
Reintervention for treatment of thrombosis of the target vessel
Reintervention for embolization to its distal vasculature
TLR (at 6 months)
TVR
Composite of all-cause perioperative (=30 day) death and from the following: index limb amputation, index limb reintervention, and index-limb-related death
Major amputation and major reintervention (new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy/thrombolysis) of index limb.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <summary>The registry will enroll patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia and
      angiographically significant lesion(s) in arteries of the lower extremity. Subjects will be
      treated with the Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon Catheter for approved indications according to
      the current country-specific Instructions for Use (IFU) and followed clinically for 1 year.</summary>
