Ancillary-Correlative (genetic analysis) - DNA from peripheral blood or buccal sample of patients is analyzed for the presence of polymorphisms in candidate genes associated with an increased risk of late-occurring complications.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of adverse events (cardiac dysfunction, AVN, ischemic stroke, and SMN using a matched case-control) - Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory variables will be tested for their association with key adverse events. McNemar's test for paired data will be used to compare the unmatched general characteristics of cases and controls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of mutations or polymorphisms in specific candidate genes in cases and controls - Allele frequencies will be estimated by the gene counting method, and the chi-square test will be used to check for departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 1 year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Crude disease-exposure - The crude disease-exposure association will be determined by estimating the OR and its 95% confidence interval (CI). This will be done by univariate conditional logistic regression, to account for the matched design. The significance of the OR will be assessed by the Wald test. Backward stepwise regression procedures will be used to develop the final multivariate model and possible interactions will be examined. The fit of the model will be assessed by the logistic regression diagnostics procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 1 year</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>-  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA - CASES

          -  Diagnosis of primary cancer at age 21 or younger, irrespective of current age

          -  No prior history of allogeneic (non-autologous) hematopoietic cell transplant

          -  Development of one of the following key adverse events at any time following
             initiation of cancer therapy:

               -  Cardiac dysfunction; please note: case enrollment has been closed due to
                  achievement of target accrual

               -  Ischemic stroke (IS)

               -  Subsequent malignant neoplasm (SMN)

             Clinical Pharmacokinetics Laboratory at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as per

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial studies cancer survivors to identify those who are at increased risk of
      developing late-occurring complications after undergoing treatment for childhood cancer. A
      patient's genes may affect the risk of developing complications, such as congestive heart
      failure, heart attack, stroke, and second cancer, years after undergoing cancer treatment.
      Genetic studies may help doctors identify survivors of childhood cancer who are more likely
      to develop late complications.</summary>
