  <interventions>
    <interventions>Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics and safety of dihydroergotamine (DHE) delivered via 2 nasal spray devices:  the investigational device versus the Migranal nasal spray applicator.

Methods: Single-center, open-label, randomized, single-dose, 2-sequence, 2-treatment crossover study in healthy adults.  The 2 treatment periods will be separated by a washout period of at least 5 days. 
 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration: 
IPX234.  1 mg DHE solution (1 spray in each nostril; 0.5 mg DHE per spray) administered intranasally via the investigational device which is being developed to optimize the delivery of  drugs to the upper nasal cavity in order to improve the distribution profile of central nervous system (CNS) targeting drugs. 

 
Reference product, dosage and mode of administration: 
Migranal (dihydroergotamine mesylate, USP) Nasal Spray.  1 mg DHE solution (1 spray in each nostril; 0.5 mg DHE per spray) administered intranasally via the Migranal nasal spray applicator.  
Traditional nasal pumps, such as the Migranal Nasal Spray applicator,  typically only deliver a small fraction of drug to upper nasal cavity.</interventions>

      <timepoint>In each treatment period, blood samples will be collected predose and at the following times postdose: 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90 minutes; 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16, 24 h.  </timepoint>

      <outcome>Safety</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, and concomitant medications will be evaluated over the course of the study.  Physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests will be performed at Screening and at Study Exit.  A nasal mucosal exam will be performed at Screening; and at Check-in, at predose, and at approximately 1 hour postdose in each treatment period.  </timepoint>

An upper respiratory tract infection or any other acute illness, including active allergic rhinitis, at Screening or at Check-in for each treatment period that the investigator believes may interfere with the administration, nasal retention, or absorption of study drug; or any prior medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would interfere or modify the nasal administration, retention, or absorption of study drug </exclusivecriteria>
