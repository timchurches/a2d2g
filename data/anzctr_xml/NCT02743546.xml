    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Duvortuxizumab
Treatment: drugs - Ibrutinib

Experimental: Dose Optimization:Participant with Certain B-Cell Malignancies - Participants with certain B-cell malignancies (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL], mantle cell lymphoma [MCL], or follicular lymphoma [FL]) will receive rising doses of intravenous infusions of duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose in combination with oral ibrutinib until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified withdrawal criteria are met. Dose escalation will continue until the recommended phase 2 dose or maximum tolerated dose is reached.

Experimental: Dose Expansion: Participants with DLBCL - Participants with DLBCL will receive intravenous infusions of duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose in combination with oral ibrutinib at the recommended phase 2 dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified withdrawal criteria are met.

Experimental: Dose Expansion: Participants with FL - Participants with FL will receive intravenous infusions of duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose in combination with oral ibrutinib at the recommended phase 2 dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified withdrawal criteria are met.

Experimental: Dose Expansion: Participants with MCL - Participants with MCL will receive intravenous infusions of duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose in combination with oral ibrutinib at the recommended phase 2 dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified withdrawal criteria are met.

Experimental: Dose Expansion: Participants with CLL - Participants with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) will receive intravenous infusions of duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose in combination with oral ibrutinib at the recommended phase 2 dose until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other protocol-specified withdrawal criteria are met.


Treatment: drugs: Duvortuxizumab
Duvortuxizumab will be administered at starting dose of 15 nanogram per kilogram (ng/kg) as an intravenous (IV) infusion during Part 1 (Dose Optimization) and at RP2D level determined in Part 1 during Part 2 (Dose Expansion). Participants will receive duvortuxizumab either with or without a priming dose. Participants who receive a priming dose will have infusions on Days 1, 8, and 22 of an initial 35-day cycle and then on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles thereafter. Participants who do not receive a priming dose will have infusions on Days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycles.

Treatment: drugs: Ibrutinib
Ibrutinib will be administered at 560 milligram per day (mg/day) orally once daily during Part 1 (Dose Optimization) and at a dose of 420 mg/day (for participants with CLL) or 560 mg/day (for participants with DLBCL, FL, or MCL) during Part 2 (Dose Expansion). In Part 1, ibrutinib will be initiated on Day 1 of the initial treatment cycle. In Part 2, ibrutinib will be initiated on Day -7 prior to the initial treatment cycle.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether duvortuxizumab and ibrutinib can be
      combined safely and to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in Part 1 and the
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to further explore the safety of duvortuxizumab in
      combination with ibrutinib at the RP2D in participants with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
      (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) in Part 2.</summary>
