Experimental: NHF with Oxygen - Patients with an existing Oxygen prescription will receive NHF with Oxygen using myAIRVO 2.


Treatment: devices: NHF with Oxygen using myAIRVO 2
NHF will be set at 25L/min at 37째C. However, all participants are able to lower the delivered temperature to 34째C.

Treatment: devices: NHF without Oxygen using myAIRVO 2
NHF will be set at 25L/min at 37째C. However, all participants are able to lower the delivered temperature to 34째C. Participants can also increase/decrease the flow rate (up to 30L/min or down to 20L/min).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this feasibility study is to provide data for a subsequent randomized controlled
      trial to investigate if patient outcomes will be improved after an acute COPD exacerbation
      using domiciliary nasal high flow therapy (NHF) compared to standard care. This feasibility
      study will investigate the following: process, resources, management and scientific aspects
      of delivering NHF as an adjunct therapy in COPD patients.</summary>
