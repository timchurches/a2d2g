    <interventions>1.	Study Sites:
This multi-site randomised control trial will take place across 3 study sites: University of Sydney (Australia), University of Queensland (Australia), and University of British Columbia (Canada). 

2.	Intervention Arms and Training Location:
Eligible and consenting participants at each study site will be randomly allocated to one of three study arms; progressive-resistance training (PRT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or a balance, toning &amp; mobility (BTM) sham-control group. 
Participants will train supervised 3 days per week, for 52 weeks. Trainers will have a background in exercise and sports science, exercise physiology, kinesiology or physiotherapy. 

The location of the exercise sessions will vary according to the study site as follows: 
-	University of Sydney and University of British Columbia: PRT and HIIT training sessions will be performed in university-based gymnasiums; BAT sessions will be performed in separate rooms to the PRT and HIIT training groups.
-	University of Queensland: PRT training sessions will be performed in a gymnasium based in a retirement village; HIIT and BAT will be performed in separate rooms within the same retirement village. Resident of the retirement village and members of the community will have access to the training areas.

2.1.	 Intervention Arm 1: Progressive Resistance Training (PRT)
The PRT intervention will consist of 7 exercises performed using pneumatic resistance machines for 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 80% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM). Participants will be instructed to contract concentrically as fast as possible and then take 3-4 seconds through the eccentric phase. Rest between repetitions will be 10-15 seconds, and 1 to 2 minutes between sets.
Exercises will be performed in the following order: bilateral leg press, bilateral chest press, unilateral knee extension, bilateral seated row, bilateral knee flexion, bilateral triceps pushdown, unilateral hip abduction. Total session time will be approximately 60 minutes, with a ratio of 1 trainer to 4 participants. 

Week 1 and 2 of the intervention will include familiarisation (session 1), assessment of 1RM (session 2) and gradual increase in target intensity from 50% (session 3), 60% (session 4), 70% (session 5) until 80% of 1RM is reached in session 6. Thereafter training intensity will be set at 80% 1RM and progressed by a projected gain in strength of 3% 1RM each session, used in conjunction with daily ratings of perceived exertion (15-18/20 on the Borg Scale).  At the start of every 7th session, 1RM will be re-tested and target weight at 80% 1RM will be recalculated based on the new 1RM. 

Muscle visualization and mental imagery:
Prior to each set, and during the rest intervals, participants will be shown a poster depicting the exercise being performed and the muscles targeted. The instructor will show participants where these muscles are located and encourage participants to feel the area. During the contraction phase of each repetition, participants will be asked to visualise and focus on the contracting muscles as they perform the movement 'as fast as they can'.

2.2.	 Intervention Arm 2: High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
The heart rate (HR) target used during the intervention will be set based on the peak HR achieved on the stress test at baseline. 
The HIIT intervention will be performed on a treadmill, recumbent cross trainer or bike, depending on feasibility, preference, and co-morbidities such as osteoarthritis or balance impairment. 
Each session will consist of an 8-minute warm up at 60% peak HR; one 4-minute interval with a progressive increase in intensity so as to achieve 85% peak HR by the end of minute 2, and maintain 85% to 95% peak HR during minutes 3 and 4 of the interval; and a 3-minute cool down at 60% peak HR.

Heart rate will be monitored continuously during all sessions using a heart rate monitor to adjust the workload used (speed or slope of treadmill; resistance or revolutions per minute on cross trainer or bike) so as to keep the HR during the last 2 minutes of the interval at 85-95% of peak, and at 60% during warm-up and cool-down. 

Sessions 1 to 4 of the intervention will include familiarisation and gradual increase of the time spent at 85-95% peak HR during the interval from 30, 60, 90 to 120 seconds in each successive session.Â 

Individuals with atrial fibrillation or on beta-blockers will be included, but we will use the Borg Scale of Perceived Exertion (rating 16-17/20) to adjust the workload in addition to HR. Total session time will be 15 minutes, with a ratio of 1 trainer for 4 participants. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham Exercise Control Group: Balance, Toning &amp; Mobility (BTM)

This 30 minute session will include breathing exercises, stretching, calisthenics and simple balance exercises designed so as not to notably increase HR or aerobic capacity or enhance strength due to the emphasis on low intensity and minimally progressive exercises. Only very light elastic bands, cones and small implements will be used during the exercises. This regimen allows for maintenance of blinding to our hypothesis, as it is similar to what many older adults anticipate in group exercise classes. This group serves to control for confounding variables such as attention, social interaction, and changes in lifestyle secondary to study participation. Training will be performed with a ratio of 1 trainer to 8-10 participants.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>1.1.	The study is powered for our primary hypothesis that both PRT and HIIT will improve Executive Function Domain relative to the control group. Based on results in our isolated PRT group in the SMART trial at 6 months1, we conservatively estimate the same effect size (ES) of +0.4 for PRT, and +0.1 for controls over 12 months, resulting in a relative ES of +0.30. No data exist for HIIT specifically. However, the relative ES at 6 months in Bakers study of vigourous intensity (75-85% heart rate reserve) continuous aerobic exercise in MCI was +0.68 for a battery of executive function test2. Thus, powering for the effect of PRT (0.30) at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20, we require 176 participants per group, total n=528, rounded up to 530. These participants will be recruited equally across the 3 sites (176/site). Sample size has not been inflated for loss to follow-up, as we will utilise linear repeated measures mixed models in intention-to-treat analyses including all randomised participants irrespective of dropout or adherence. This sample size will also allow for testing of the proposed mediation effects for the brain and peripheral adaptations specified if the within-group correlation (r)= 0.24 or greater. We have shown that the relationship between strength change and executive domain improvement was much higher than that (r=0.41, p=0.01) after only 6 months of PRT in the SMART trial, where increases in lower-body strength mediated 48.3% of the effect of PRT on ADAS-Cog (AI Mavros, under review)

An intention-to-treat analytic strategy has been designed with statistician consultation, inclusive of all participants randomised, regardless of dropout. We will analyse all outcomes via repeated measures linear mixed models of baseline, 6- and 12-month time points, adjusted for baseline values and all covariates selected a priori (age, sex, education, study site, APOE genotype) as well as any additional potential confounders associated with the dependent variable of interest identified. Specifically, two separate mixed models will be constructed to determine the interaction of GROUP x TIME (i.e., PRT vs. Control and HIIT vs. Control). We will report estimated marginal means (95% CIs), mean differences between groups and Hedges bias corrected effect sizes (95% CIs) for all primary and secondary outcomes, and accept significance at the 5% level for the primary outcomes of cognitive function as well as the above pre-specified secondary outcomes. We hypothesise that cognition will improve in both PRT and HIIT relative to Control in these models, and have not powered this as a non-inferiority study. Unspecified secondary outcomes will undergo Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. Mediation analysis will be conducted to test the hypotheses that cardiovascular and muscular fitness and other central and systemic adaptations differentially mediate the cognitive benefits of PRT and HIIT. Clinical meaningfulness will be assessed in accord with available data on the expected annual rates of change and Minimal Clinically Important Differences (MCIDs) in this cohort for all outcomes where these differences have been defined.

Note: Aside from the variables described in Step 4: Outcomes, the following variables will be collected at baseline:
- Assessment of personality traits using the Core self-evaluation scale
- Past medical diagnosis and symptoms (physical, mental or emotional), past treatments, medications, past falls assessed via clinical interview.
- Outcome expectation to training assessed using the Outcome Expectancy Training Questionnaire

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects at least 10% of older adults globally, and in this cohort the risk of incident dementia is greatly increased from 1-2% per annum to 10-15%. Exercise has been shown to be beneficial for some cognitive outcomes in MCI, although results are heterogeneous, and the optimum exercise dose and modality for preservation or improvement of cognition is not fully defined. Progressive resistance training (PRT) has been shown to have larger effects on cognition than aerobic training in meta-analyses. The limited benefit of some aerobic training studies may be due to insufficient intensities of the intervention, which have produced suboptimal changes in aerobic capacity or other physiological adaptations potentially mechanistic for improved brain function.  High intensity interval training (HIIT) results in more beneficial cardiovascular adaptations compared to standard moderate intensity aerobic training. The wealth of data linking aerobic fitness to cognition suggests that HIIT, which approximately doubles the average improvement in aerobic fitness compared to standard training, is of potentially great interest in MCI therefore. However, HIIT has never been tested alone or directly compared to PRT for cognitive benefits in any cohort. We hypothesize that PRT and HIIT will be robust, alternative exercise interventions to improve cognition in MCI. We will conduct a multi-national, randomised controlled trial over 4 years in which we randomise 530 older adults with MCI in Australia and Canada to PRT, HIIT or a sham exercise control group for 12 months. Executive function is the primary cognitive outcome.

Secondary outcomes include other cognitive domains, biomarkers for cognitive decline and distinct mediators of benefit for PRT (e.g., anabolic hormones, lean mass) vs. HIIT (e.g., arterial stiffness, aerobic fitness), functional status, brain structure and connectivity, and psychological wellbeing.

The study is powered for our primary hypothesis that both PRT and HIIT will improve Executive Function Domain relative to the control group. Powering for the effect of PRT (0.30) at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20, we require 176 participants per group, total n=528, rounded up to 530. These participants will be recruited equally across the 3 sites (176-177/site).

BRAIN will be the first trial of HIIT for cognition in any cohort, and the largest and only multi-national study of exercise for Mild Cognitive Impairment ever conducted.
