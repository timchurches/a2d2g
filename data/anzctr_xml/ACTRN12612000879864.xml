    <healthcondition>Intestinal fructose malabsorption

The proposed investigation aims to identify the rates of fructose malabsorption in patients with gout. It is anticipated that this will then lead to further studies of dietary manipulation in patients with and without fructose malabsorption to determine whether dietary fructose restriction results in reduction in serum urate to a greater or lesser extent in each group.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>100 patients with gout will be recruited. Patients will be seen on one occasion to undertake a fructose breath test. Patients will be instructed to follow a low-fermentable diet for 24 hours prior to the test. Patients will give a fasting breath test in the morning and then be given a solution of fructose to drink. Repeat breath test will be taken every 15mins for up to 3 hours. The number of additional tests will be determined on case by case basis

Malabsorption of fructose will be defined as breath hydrogen greater than/equal to10ppm above baseline for at least two consecutive 15 minute readings or one reading of greater than 20 ppm above baseline. For those patients who do not produce hydrogen (typically 10-15% of the general population) methane will also be determined and similar cut offs concentrations will be used. 

Hydrogen and methane concentrations will be determined using a Quintron microlyser DP. This equipment is a purpose built hydrogen and methane analyser that uses solid state sensors to determine respective gas concentrations. This machine has been used for diagnostic purposes in Christchurch for over three years and is overseen by Scientific Officer Dr Bruce Dobbs. A/Prof Gearry has five years experience in overseeing, interpreting and reporting hydrogen and methane breath tests.</interventions>
    <comparator>100 controls without gout will be recruited. Cases and controls will be matched on age +/- 10years, gender, and ethnicity. Controls will have the same exclusion criteria as cases. Controls will also undergo the breath test</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether patients with gout have lower rates of fructose malabsorption compared to the general population.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gout is a major problem in New Zealand. High levels of uric acid in the blood are the cause of gout. Fructose is a sugar that is found in many fruits and honey. It has been shown that fructose can increase blood uric acid levels and thus contribute to gout. We currently recommend that people with gout reduce their intake of fructose to help improve their gout. 
About 20% of people do not absorb fructose in the gut. This can lead to abdominal symptoms. For people who do not absorb fructose, reducing fructose intake is not likely to be so important in controlling their gout. The aim of this study is to find out if people with gout are more likely to absorb fructose than people without gout.</summary>
