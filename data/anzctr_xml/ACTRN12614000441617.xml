    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>comparing the duration of spinal block after addition of dexamethasone versus the duration of caudal blockade

The extent of the sensory block is checked by pin- prick every minute till establishment of sensory block.

Motor block clinically checked by, lack of leg movement

successful block ( absence of any gross purposeful muscular movement),

duration of block (defined by return of forceful movement of the legs) measured by minutes. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>assess quality of analgesia and motor block postoperative

The quality of analgesia assessed by using an observational pain scale (OPS) assesses parameters (crying, movement, agitation, verbalization and BP change) each parameter was given a score of 0-2.

 Bromage scale for assessing motor block. (0 = Able to raise straight leg, full flexion of knee and feet. 1 = Inability to raise leg, able to flex knees. 2 = Inability to flex knees, able to flex ankles. 3 = Inability to flex ankles.) </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data are presented as mean +/- (SD) for normally distributed data. Baseline characteristics and outcomes across the groups were compared using the Student's t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for nominal data. All analysis has been calculated using SPSS V.16. A P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

The primary point was increase duration of spinal anesthesia in compare to caudal anesthesia duration. For each group for each group 26 patients were required for dexamethasone to increase the mean value of duration by 20% based on a previous pilot study in our institute a = 0.05 and a power of 0.8 with 95% confidence interval. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Addition of dexamethasone was found to prolong duration of spinal block in adults. The primary outcome of this study is comparing the duration of spinal block after addition of dexamethasone and the duration of caudal blockade, Secondary outcome is to assess quality of pain relief and muscle relaxation with hemodynamic stability and rapid recovery between the two groups.</summary>
