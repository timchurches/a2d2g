  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part A consists of sequential dose escalation with approximately 5 cohorts of subjects (8 subjects per cohort) given a single oral dose of AD-6626 or placebo.  The doses of AD-6626 are 100mg, 300mg, 600mg, 1200mg and 1200mg with food.
Part B is a two period crossover of single oral administration of AD-6626 or placebo following oral EtOH administration in NHVs or subjects with the ALDH2*1/*2 (HeZ) genotype. A total of 24 subjects will be dosed.  The dose of AD-6626 will be determined from Part A of the study. The oral EtOH dose will be 0.75 gm/kg for NHVs and 0.5 gm/kg for subjects with the ALDH2*1/*2 genotype. The AD-6626 will be given 30 minutes before the oral dose of EtOH.  There will be 7 days between the treatments in Part B</interventions>
