  <interventions>
    <interventions>The addition of dry needling to standard physiotherapy treatment (such as massage, stretches, manipulation/mobilisation and exercises).

Dry needling will be applied by a qualified physiotherapist. Single-use sterile needles (50mm long with 0.25-0.30mm gauge) will be inserted superficially only (5-10mm) into myofascial trigger points around the head, neck and back. Needles will remain in position for 10-15 minutes and needles may be manipulated within this time. Approximately 8-15 needles will be inserted at each appointment. 

The standard physiotherapy treatment type, dosage and duration will be applied as indicated at the discretion of the treating student physiotherapist, within evidence based guidelines. 

The total appointment time for each participant will be approximately half an hour. Participants will attend appointments 1-2 times per week at first, and appointments will become less frequent at the treating physiotherapist's discretion, until they decide treatment is no longer needed. Each participant will receive a minimum of 2 weeks treatment and a maximum of 8 weeks treatment.     </interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator will be used in this study as it will adopt a pre-post test design (single group trial), therefore there is only 1 study arm - i.e. all participants will receive the same intervention. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Headache pain severity as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The VAS is a 10cm line with 0 marked at one end and 10 at the other. The participant will be asked to indicate their current perceived level of headache pain on this line, 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. This will then be measured in millimetres. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to indicate their headache pain severity on the VAS before and after each treatment. They will also fill out a VAS every morning and evening as part of the Daily Headache Diary (see secondary outcome measures), as well as at 1 week and 1 month follow-up (after treatments have finished). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of running a clinical trail using this treatment modality (dry needling) for headaches. This will be measured by, for example; adherence rates to management, availability of eligible participants, willingness of participants to be recruited, participants' subjective experience. 

This will allow determination of a sample size estimate, the availability of eligible participants, the willingness for subjects to be recruited, and adherence rates to management, enabling evaluation of the feasibility of a future successful, cost-effective large-scale efficacy trial </outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout the trial</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Headache-related disability as measured by the Neck Disability Index (NDI). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to fill out a NDI prior to their first treatment, at approximately mid-intervention (approximately 3 weeks) and at 1 week and 1 month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Headache frequency as measured by a Daily Headache Diary, which will include whether headache was experienced that day, and if so, the time of onset, how long it lasted and the severity of that headache's pain on a VAS. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to begin filling out the Daily Headache Diary on the day of their first treatment, and this must be filled out each morning and evening of every day throughout that participant's intervention period. They will be asked to continue to fill it out for one month after their last treatment. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size will be based on the moderate effect size as calculated by a systematic review, 'Acupuncture and dry-needling for low back pain' (Furlan et al. 2005), using the primary outcome measure, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. The sample size estimate is 24 in order to detect a moderate effect size (f=0.3), with a power of 0.8 in a two-sided test, at significance level p&lt;0.05. Thirty adults will be recruited based on pragmatics of recruitment and the number necessary to examine feasibility, and to attenuate potential drop out. 

Part of this study's aim is to determine the feasibility of running an efficacy trial for dry needling and headaches, as well as the feasibility of running student oriented research in the University of South Australia's Student Physiotherapy Clinic. In-keeping with this statement, the feasibility of the recruitment process is part of the determination of feasibility of running a future efficacy RCT for this modality. Therefore, if 30 subjects are not recruited in this time, data will still be analysed and recruitment difficulties will be documented so that future trails can consider this prior to commencement. 

To evaluate the feasibility of this trial, descriptive statistics will be used to determine whether an RCT is a feasible means to investigate dry needling for headache. For example, we will look at the availability of eligible participants and adherence rates of subjects to the protocol. We will also include their comments, for example on how they found the process. Feasibility analysis for a future cost-effective large-scale RCT will include an analysis of sample group means for all 3 outcome measures at mid-intervention and one-week follow-up, using a repeated measure ANOVA. To analyse the effectiveness of dry needling for headaches, data collected will be analysed using a repeated measure ANOVA for sample group means at four time points.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study's purpose is to generate preliminary data on the efficacy of the addition of dry needling to standard physiotherapy management in the treatment of headaches, as well as to determine the feasibility of running an efficacy trial for this condition. 

This will involve the collection of a small set of data on the efficacy of dry needling for headaches, and to determine the feasibility of running a trial collecting this data. This will allow determination of a sample size estimate, the availability of eligible participants, the willingness for subjects to be recruited, and adherence rates to management, enabling evaluation of the feasibility of a future successful, cost-effective large-scale efficacy trial.

We hypothesise that:
1. An efficacy trial is a feasible means to study the impact of dry needling on cervicogenic and tension-type headache
2. Standard physiotherapy plus dry needling changes the severity, frequency and disability of cervicogenic and tension-type headache pain in adults
