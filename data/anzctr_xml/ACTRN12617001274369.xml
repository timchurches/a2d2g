  <interventions>
    <interventions>Burnaid® hydrogel dressing will be the chosen intervention that the child will receive based on randomisation on presentation to the Department of Emergency Medicine (DEM) or burns Outpatients Department (OPD). Burnaid® is a sterile open foamed polyester urethane foam that is impregnated with 90% purified water.  The dressing has gained widespread use by paramedics in recent years in the treatment of acute burn pain.
In this study the Burnaid® dressing will be applied post 20 minutes Cold Running Water (CRW) and will remain on the burn for a minimum of 20 minutes. Burnaid® will be applied as per the manufactures instructions followed by standard burn care. The 20 min time period of Burnaid® hydrogel dressing has been selected in the acute phase of the burn where pain is still present after the 20 min of CRW has been completed. D
After the Burnaid® has been removed, a standard, protocol informed, silver dressing will be applied. The silver dressing will remain intact until the patient is due to return to Burns OPD 3-7 days post injury. The silver dressing will be changed twice weekly, in the Burn OPD until the wound is 95% re-epithelialised as per the treating clinician. Any adverse events or concerns with patient activity (swimming with dressing, playing in a sandpit) will be documented. </interventions>
    <comparator>The current standard of care following burns first aid (20 mins of CRW) is laying plastic wrap over the burn, aiming to decrease exposure of skin to the air to decrease the acute burn pain.   This plastic wrap is left intact until the patient has had adequate pain relief to adequately debride residual blisters and clean the burn. After the cleaning process, a silver dressing is selected as per hospital protocol and applied to the burn.  This silver dressing stays in tact until the standard follow up appointment in Burns OPD.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Pain intensity will be assessed prior, during, and post application of the Burnaid or plastic wrap using three  age specific scales, allowing assessment of pain and distress;
 1) child self-report using the Faces Pain Scale  Revised (FPS-R) for children ages 3 years and older; 
2) Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability Scale (FLACC) for parents/guardians and nursing staff.
 3) Visual Analogue Scale for Pain (VAS-P) for children aged 8 years and older and observer VAS (VASobs) for parent/guardian reports. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain scores will be measured during the acute phase of the burn. FLACC, VAS and FPS-R will all be taken at three main time points
1. Post CRW /Pre Burnaid or plastic wrap application
2. During Burnaid or plastic wrap application
3. Post removal of the Burnaid or plastic wrap </timepoint>

      <outcome>Composite Itch Measure:
1.Toronto Paediatric Itch Scale (TPIS) will be used to assess pruritus in patients aged less than 5 years. 
2.Parents/caregivers of patients aged less than 5 years will complete the TPIS, which rates itch behaviours on a scale of  0 (indicating absence of itch) to 3 (which represents severe itch with significant disruption).
3. Participants aged 5 years and older will self-report their itch intensity using a 0  10 NRS. 4.All caregivers will also complete the itch component of the POSAS, which is a 0 -10 NRS</outcome>
      <timepoint>Itch will be assessed at the first Change of Dressing (COD) in burns clinic and each follow up Burns OPD appointment until the wound is deemed re-epithelised, and will also be assessed at the 3 and 6 month reviews.
Follow up appointments are determined and set by the treating clinical team. They are based on a clinical judgement of time critical point of predicted wound healing and dressing requirements.
The 3 and 6 month appointments will be set by the research team to determine the influence of itch as the wound / scar heals or matures. </timepoint>

Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all outcomes.

Regression models that account for randomly missing data and clustering of wound sites (where appropriate) within patients will be utilised to analyse differences in pain and wound healing between the groups and over time, as well as to analyse factors predicting the primary outcomes.  Intention to treat analysis will be used.  Significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05. Post-hoc adjustment for multiple comparisons will be conducted using the Sidak correction.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1. Background
Burns are a painful and traumatic experience. Literature has found that using pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aid in providing appropriate pain management and significantly improve paediatric burn outcomes. Overall, there seems to be some evidence that reduced pain and anxiety positively influences re-epithelialisation rates however current literature fails to fully explain the effects of pain and anxiety and their links with wound healing. This study will determine if Burnaid® is an effective treatment for reducing pain in the acute period of a burn injury. It is hypothesised that a reduction in pain, as well as stress/anxiety, will then improve re-epithelialisation time in comparison to plastic wrap which is standard practice at our institute, a large metropolitan paediatric hospital located in Brisbane, Australia.   
1.2	Methods/Design
A randomised controlled trial will be conducted assessing the effectiveness of Burnaid® hydrogel dressings as an analgesic adjunct to cold running water (CRW) first aid for the treatment of paediatric burns. Participants will include children aged between 0  16 years with an acute thermal burn injury with a total burn surface area (TBSA) of &lt; 20% admitted to our emergency within 24hours of the burn occurring. Participants will be stratified into one of two groups based on factors which increase pain intensity. The trial will then randomise patients into one of two groups: 1) Plastic wrap which will serve as the control arm or 2) Burnaid® which is the intervention arm. The trial requires a minimum of 29 participants per group, which will be assessed from day of injury to re-epithelialisation. The primary outcome of the trial is the effect of the intervention on reducing acute pain. Secondary outcomes include: days to re-epithelialisation, Physiological changes that indicate pain intensity (pulse rate, temperature and respiratory rate), analgesia and distraction techniques required, , cost effectiveness, staff perspectives on the treatmen, Health related Quality of Life (Child Health Utility 9D - CHU9D) and salivary cortisol and a-amylase ratio (informing influences of stress and anxiety)
1.3	Discussion
This study will provide comprehensive data on the analgesic properties of Burnaid® hydrogel dressings as an adjunct to CRW first aid for the treatment of acute paediatric thermal burns. If the intervention shows to be effective in reducing acute pain, Burnaid® dressings will be integrated as standard care practices at our institute. This study replicates a real-world scenario in order to identify clinically significant analgesic and would healing effects.
