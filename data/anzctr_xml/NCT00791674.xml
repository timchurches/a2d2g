    <summary>Lay title: A study of breathing pauses during sleep in patients on long term opiates.

      Sleep apnoea is a term which refers to frequent breathing pauses during sleep. Breathing can
      stop at night due to the upper airway collapsing (Obstructive sleep apnoea)or reduced signals
      from the brain driving breathing (central sleep apnoea). Clinical observation has noticed
      that patients on opiates have an increase in sleep apnoea.

      Hypothesis: This study looks at the relationship of opiates (when used for patients chronic
      pain) and the occurrence of sleep apnoea. It is expected that there will be an increase in
      sleep apnoea (particularly of the central variant) particularly in patients on long term
      opiates.</summary>
