  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be assigned to one of two Baby Steps interactive web-based interventions:
Arm 1) Babycare  modules that provide access to information and tips on early childcare in the areas of feeding, soothing, sleep and getting prepared. Links to additional relevant information on childcare are provided throughout. Automated text messages at 2, 4, 7 and 10 weeks post registration remind participants to visit and continue use of the site. 
Arm 2) Wellbeing - includes all content from Babycare plus additional modules specifically targeting parent wellbeing. The additional Wellbeing modules focus on self-care through promoting pleasurable physical and social activity, parents strengths, sleep tips, and stress reduction. Additionally, Wellbeing focuses on couples relationships, interacting with baby and changing roles. Planning tools assist parents to develop action plans based on tips from the program. Wellbeing also includes a Scrapbook section where parents are encouraged to upload photos that remind them of positive aspects of parenting and of achievements. The Wellbeing program is also supported by SMSs at 2, 4, 7 and 10 weeks to encourage continued program use.

The two online interventions are designed to be used at times and places that are convenient to the participant. Participants are able to use the program in sessions as brief or long as he or she desires and then can return to the modules whenever they want. The modules are not time-based and progression through the website is not linear. Rather, participants are able to pick and choose relevant topics to read and then develop plans based on these. Program completion time will depend on the number of topics that participants choose to work through. Participants can spend as much or as little time as they like using the website and there is no minimum or maximum program completion time. 
  
Program adherence to each intervention is automatically monitored through the Baby Steps program. The website collects program use data encompassing number of logins, pages viewed, Babycare pages viewed, Wellbeing pages viewed, plans made and photos uploaded as well as total time spent on program pages. 

There is no end date to either online intervention. Participants can continue to access the website for the life of the website (i.e. indefinitely). Their participation in the research and hence the monitoring of their use of the website will end after the six month follow-up point.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is the active control website providing information and tips on early childcare, Babycare (described previously).  Babycare supports new parents with childcare in the areas of feeding, soothing, sleep and getting prepared. The Babycare program is supported by SMSs at 2, 4, 7 and 10 weeks to encourage continued use of the program.

Babycare differs to standard treatment that is typically provided by health care professionals in a face-to-face context.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy in child rearing as measured by the mean score on three self-efficacy items. Three items that were created specifically for this study measure self-efficacy in a number of child rearing domains. Participants will be asked Thinking about the next 13 weeks, how confident are you with: 1. Feeding your baby, 2. Putting your baby to sleep, and 3. Settling your baby." Response options range from 0 (not at all confident) to 100 (extremely). </outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 3 months (13 weeks) and 6 months (26 weeks) after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction (with parenting role and skills, relationship, and social support) will be measured by the mean score on each of seven satisfaction items. Seven items created for this study ask "How satisfied are you with: 1. Your parenting role, 2. Your parenting skills, 3. Your relationship with your partner, 4. The support you receive from your partner, 5. The practical support you receive from others, 6. The emotional support you receive from others, and 7. The support you have been providing to your partner." Response options range from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 3 months (13 weeks) and 6 months (26 weeks) after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria are:
1) Co-parenting male-female couple
2) First child for both parents
3) Gestation between 26 and 38 weeks
4) Pregnancy is singleton with no complications
5) Literacy in English
6) Internet and mobile phone access
7) Aged 18 years or over


The project aims to enhance wellbeing in the transition to parenthood. It therefore focuses on first-time parents. 
Participants are recruited antenatally at a gestation of 26 to 38 weeks. This represents a range of strong fetal viability if premature labour were to occur and also allows time to engage with the program before the arrival of the baby.

    <exclusivecriteria>The current study specifically excludes:
Children and young people under the age of 18: Participants under 18 are excluded as young adolescent pregnancies require greater monitoring and support than this study can provide. Participants under 18 may still access the Babycare program (as per other participants who do not meet the inclusion criteria), but will be referred to other appropriate sources of support outside of the study.

Pregnancies that are multiple or have complications have greater support needs than this study can offer.

Individuals that do not have a high level of English literacy, and participants with an intellectual or cognitive impairment will also be excluded as they will be unable to give informed consent. Additionally, they will not be able to complete the assessments or understand the intervention, all of which is presented in written format. They may still access the Babycare program if they desire to as per other individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria.
Same-sex couples are excluded as this research is specifically studying the wellbeing of male-female couples in the transition to parenthood. Same-sex couples may still access the Babycare program if they desire to as per other individuals who do not meet the inclusion criteria.

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants are screened through an online survey after both parents have registered at the website. If eligible, participants are directed to the online baseline assessment survey. This must be completed by both parents before participants are randomly assigned to one of the two intervention groups. 
Allocations are generated by the Goji program, a research trials management software developed at QUT by the same programmers who developed the Baby Steps program. Goji automatically allocates participants to a research group once their baseline is completed, recording the allocation in the research database. Couples are randomised as a unit to ensure they are allocated to the same intervention. The program then automatically emails participants with login details to access the program. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>The Baby Steps program generates allocations in permuted blocks. Randomisations are stratified by depression at intake as measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (neither parent elevated on the EPDS vs either parent elevated according to cut-offs of &gt;5 for fathers and &gt;7 for mothers).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this project is to conduct the first randomised controlled trial of a combined Internet and SMS intervention for perinatal wellbeing in both mothers and fathers. Two hundred primiparous mother-father couples will be recruited.
The study aims to:
1.Compare the effectiveness on indices of wellbeing of two online programs for first-time parents:
a) Babycare - access to information and tips on early childcare in the areas of feeding, soothing, sleep and getting prepared. The Babycare program is supported by SMSs at 2, 4, 7 and 10 weeks to encourage continued use of the program;
b) Wellbeing - includes all content from Babycare plus additional modules specifically targeting wellbeing in the areas of self-care, relationships, interacting with baby and changing roles. Wellbeing also includes a Scrapbook section where parents are encouraged to upload photos that remind them of positive aspects of parenting and of achievements. The Wellbeing program is also supported by SMSs at 2, 4, 7 and 10 weeks.
2. Assess the cost-effectiveness of each intervention.

It is hypothesised that:
1. Participants receiving the Wellbeing program will show greater program use and improved confidence in childcare at 3 and 6 months than those in Babycare.
2. Levels of distress, quality of life, relationship satisfaction and cost-effectiveness will be greater for Wellbeing than Babycare.
