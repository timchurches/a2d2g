  <interventions>
    <interventions>Medications taken by residents in the intervention arm will be assessed once after study entry to identify opportunities to reduce medication regimen complexity, using a structured tool (the Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged Care (MRS GRACE)). MRS GRACE is an implicit, validated tool that directs the user to consider five questions when determining whether a residents medication regimen may be simplified.

The intervention will be provided at the residential aged care facility (RACF) by an experienced clinical pharmacist. The study pharmacist will review medication charts, medical diagnoses and other relevant details obtained from the medical record, and use MRS GRACE to identify opportunities to simplify the medication regimen for study participants in the intervention facilities. The study pharmacist will forward a structured one-page report outlining recommendations for medication regimen simplification to the residential services manager and clinical nurse consultant at the aged care facility, and to the residents GP.

Recommendations related to changes in medication administration times will require approval by the residential services manager, clinical nurse consultant or GP prior to implementation. All other recommendations (e.g. changes in medication strength, formulation or active ingredient) will require approval of the GP prior to implementation. Whether or not these recommendations are actioned will be at the discretion of the residential services manager/clinical nurse consultant and the residents GP, respectively. </interventions>
    <comparator>Residents in the comparison RACFs will continue to receive routine care.

All residents in the intervention and comparison RACFs will continue to be eligible to receive Australian Government-remunerated Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) Services and Residential Medication Management Reviews (RMMRs) during the study period. </comparator>

Due to the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to blind study nurses, residents, RACF staff, clinicians and study investigators to the intervention assignment throughout the study period.</concealment>
    <sequence>Aged care facilities will be paired by the study investigators based on location (i.e. metropolitan or rural) and number of beds. One RACF within each pair will be randomised to the intervention group and the other to the comparison (usual care) group. An independent pharmacoepidemiologist will perform the randomisation using the computerised random number generator within SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Block randomisation will be used to ensure an equal number of intervention and comparison groups. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
We anticipate the number of administration times could be reduced for 25% of SIMPLER participants receiving the intervention. Allowing for a reduction in administration times for 5% of residents in the comparison group, and assuming 80% power, 5% significance, and an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.1, 22 residents would be required from each facility (i.e. 176 residents). Allowing for a 10% attrition of participants over four months, as residents estimated to have less than 3 months to live are not eligible to participate, the SIMPLER study will need to recruit a minimum of 194 residents.

Quantitative analyses
Individual level analyses that account for clustering will be undertaken to determine the relationship between the intervention and study outcomes. Analyses will be undertaken using an intention-to-treat principles; however, sensitivity analyses will be undertaken on a per-protocol basis in which the intervention group will be restricted to residents for whom at least one medication simplification recommendation was implemented. Mixed models with RACF as a random effect will be utilised to analyse the association between intervention and outcomes. Models will be adjusted for relevant covariates and multiple imputation will be used to impute missing covariate values where necessary.

Economic analysis
A within trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted alongside the clinical trial to synthesis the costs and outcomes of SIMPLER. The primary outcome will be quality of life measured using the QoL-AD instrument. The total cost associated with medication administration for participants in the intervention and comparison groups will be estimated at baseline and follow-up (at 4 and 8 months after study entry). Medication incidents, falls and hospitalisations will be incorporated in the economic analysis. Appropriate adjustment for the cluster design of the trial will be undertaken by using multilevel models.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Complex medication regimens are prevalent in residential aged care facilities (RACFs), can be burdensome for residents and are costly in terms of nursing time.

The aim of this study is to investigate application of a structured process to simplify medication administration for residents of aged care facilities. We hypothesise this may reduce the total number of medication administration times and decrease time spent administering medications, and may improve clinical outcomes for residents.

SImplification of Medications Prescribed to Long tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) is a non-blinded, matched-pair, cluster randomised controlled trial of a single multidisciplinary intervention to simplify medication regimens in RACFs. Research nurses will recruit English-speaking, permanent residents from 8 South Australian RACFs. Medications taken by residents in the intervention arm will be assessed once using a structured tool to identify opportunities to reduce medication regimen complexity (e.g. by administering all medications at the same time, or through the use of longer-acting or combination formulations). Residents in the comparison group will receive routine care. Participants will be followed for up to 3 years after study entry. The primary outcome will be the total number of charted medication administration times at four months after study entry. Secondary outcomes will include time spent administering medications, medication incidents, resident satisfaction, quality of life, falls, hospitalisation and mortality. Individual-level analyses that account for clustering will be undertaken to determine the impact of the intervention on the study outcomes. Study results will be disseminated via conference presentations and manuscripts submitted to peer reviewed journals. </summary>
