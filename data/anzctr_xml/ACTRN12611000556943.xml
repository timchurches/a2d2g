    <interventions>Participants in the treatment group will receive four dietary education sessions (one hour for the first one, then 3x30 minutes for follow up) with the dietitian during the three month period.
The dietary session will be individual with the dietitian explaining the mechanism for a low FODMAPS diet, assessing the participants diets and giving guidance on adapting the participants diet</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be randomised to immediate treatment or to become a waiting list control patient.  The waiting list control group will be seen 3 months after filling out the initial questionnaires</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be identified through Gastroenterology clinics and if required GP practices. The initial approach will be made by the doctor. If participants are keen to participate the research dietitian will then contact them to explain the trial and provide them with the participant information sheet and consent form. Once written consent has been obtained then the patients will be screened using hydrogen breath tests. Baseline questionnaires will be collected and patients will be randomly assigned to treatment or waiting list control. The dietitian will be informed by the person holding the randomisation schedule of the treatment allocation (allocation concealment).</concealment>
    <sequence>An algorithm will be devised based on age, gender and initial symptom severity. Based on this algorithm a computer will randomly assign patients to either immediate treatment or a three month delay.  The randomisation schedule will be held by a person unrelated to the trial who will inform the dietitian which group participants have been assigned once all baseline measures have been completed.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking at a new style of dietary treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study is to see how effective the treatment is long-term and to identify reasons why patients may not follow the treatment even if it is beneficial.
It is known that people with IBS get increased wind, bloating and abdominal pain together with an altered bowel habit when they eat some foods which most people are able to digest without problems. Patients who are likely to respond to this treatment will be referred to the dietitian who will provide education on how to limit those foods in the diet.  Hydrogen breath tests can be used to identify people most likely to malabsorb these foods. 
Participants will be asked to fill out three different questionnaires on three separate occasions (baseline, 3 and 6 months) which provide information on how IBS affects their life and what they eat. Analysis will provide data about the long-term effect of the diet however, it is expected that patients might not comply long-term to this diet because the foods recommended in this treatment are more expensive than a usual diet open ended questions will be asked about barriers to making the recommended dietary changes and an estimation of the increased cost will be calculated.</summary>
