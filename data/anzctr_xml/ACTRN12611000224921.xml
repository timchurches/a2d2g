  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>venous leg ulcers -  Compression thereapy is the gold standard treatment for venous leg ulcers, however, the biological mechanisims underlying the healing process and differences between different types of treatment are poorly understood.  This study will identify relationships between two different types of compression systems to treat venous leg ulcers, biochemical markers (identified from samples of wound exudate) and progress in wound healing in patients with venous leg ulcers.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1:   Four layer compression bandage system - Profore,  applied once per week for the 24 weeks of the study (or until healed, whichever occurs sooner),   as per producer's instructions and patient's ankle circumference e.g. 
Less than 18cm: 2 or more Orthopaedic wool, 1 crepe, 1 Class 3a bandage, 1 Cohesive bandage;
18-25cm:	1 Orthopaedic wool, 1 Crepe, 1 Class 3a bandage, 1 Cohesive bandage; 
25-30cm:	1 Orthopaedic wool, 1 Class 3c, 1 Cohesive bandage;
Greater than 30cm:	1 Orthopaedic wool, 1 Class 3a, 1 Class 3c, 1 Cohesive.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 2:   Class 3 (In Australia, Class 3 compression hosiery provides 30-35mmHg pressure at the ankle level) compression hosiery system; applied and checked once per week at the wound clinic (patient has the option of removing hosiery at night and replacing first thing in the morning); padding is applied as necessary, a holding bandage or sleeve and then Class 3 compression hosiery applied.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of healed ulcers / group: Ulcer area will be calculated by using wound tracings, digital photography and using Visitrak to determine area reduction, percent reduction and total healing rates. A healed ulcer is defined as full epithelialisation maintained for at least two weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks from randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biochemical markers associated with healing: 
Wound fluid samples will be gathered for laboratory analysis on admission, then every two weeks until 24 weeks (or until ulcer has healed if this is earlier). This involves applying an occlusive wound dressing (Opsite) over the wound and after one hour the exudate under the dressing is recovered by flushing in 1 ml sterile, isotonic saline. The samples will then be centrifuged at 14000g for 10 minutes to remove particulate debris, filter sterilised (0.22 micrometres) and stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. Protein concentration of the filtered wound fluid sample will be determined using BCA Assay38, and 2 mg (for 2-D electrophoresis) or 4 mg (for ProteomeLab) of protein will be loaded on a Agilent Multi Affinity Removal System (MARS) column to remove 6 abundant proteins (albumin, haptoglobin, alpha-1-antitripsin, transferrin, IgA and IgG) in order to increase the sensitivity and resolution of the analysis. 2-D gel electrophoresis of the wound fluid will be performed using 11cm Zoom gels (Invitrogen), followed by silver-staining, imaging and analysis using BioRad image analysis software. Stained proteins of interest with a differential density of greater than 2 fold will be excised and identified using MALDI-TOF-TOF and LC-MS-MS. Select samples of wound fluid containing candidate proteins of interest will be further analysed using a ProteomeLab PF 2D Protein Fractionation System. Further characterisation of specific proteins will be carried out using either classical proteomic techniques (protein digestion and mass fingerprinting) or the ProteomeLab PA 800 system (capillary electrophoresis).  Having identified "candidate" proteins that are differentially expressed in wound fluid in response to the pressure therapy, further characterisation studies using techniques such as antibody-based immunological studies, biochemical studies and PCR will be pursued as a second approach to validate the changes in protein expression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 2 weeks for 24 weeks from randomisation</timepoint>

      <outcome>Time to ulcer healing: Ulcer area will be calculated by using wound tracings, digital photography and using Visitrak to determine area reduction, percent reduction and total healing rates.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients presenting with a venous leg ulcer and fitting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Once a patient has been identified by the clinician in charge as fitting the inclusion criteria, the Research Assistant will approach the patient to invite them to participate and give them an information and consent package. If the patient consents to participate in the study, the Research Assistant will collect baseline data from the patientâ€™s records and give the patient a questionnaire to fill in.  The Research Assistant will open a randomisation envelope and the patient will be allocated to either Treatment group A or Treatment group B. A staff member not working on this project will have previously filled sealed opaque envelopes with the allocation sequence.</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to commencement of the study a randomisation allocation sequence will be generated with a computerised randomisation program.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to identify the relationship between biochemical markers in wound fluid and wound healing in chronic venous leg ulcers being treated with compression therapy. A randomised controlled trial will determine the effect of high level compression on wound fluid composition and wound healing in comparison to low level compression therapy. Identification of biochemical markers directly associated with improved healing will provide important new information for health care professionals on the biological processes underlying wound healing during compression. The overall aim is to gain a better understanding of the wound healing process and to utilise this knowledge to develop improved techniques to increase healing rates of leg ulcers, a significant cause of chronic ill-health for older people.</summary>
