  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention being studied is electrical stimulation, as provided by a commercially available functional electrical stimulation (FES) device. The intervention group receives stimulation pre-botox (in theatre, applied directly to the gastrocnemius muscle via an insulated surgical needle, for 2 minutes) and then post-injection over the next 2 days (one 30 min session that evening, three 30 min sessions the following day, and three 30 min sessions on day two - seven 30 min stimulation sessions in total). Standard botox dosing is used (in the range of 3-6 units per kilogram) and every subject receives routine physiotherapy post-botox.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants are receiving botox A for dynamic equinus. The control group does not receive stimulation in any form.  Every subject receives routine physiotherapy post-botox.</comparator>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Minimisation randomisation is used to allocate subjects to one of 4 groups, based on age and condition. Ie: 
Group A - 4-8 yrs, hemi CP, 
Group B - 4-8 yrs, diplegic CP, 
Group C - 9-12 yrs, hemi CP, 
Group D - 9-12 yrs, diplegic CP. 
The blinded Allocatur has an envelope with 4 cards in it for each group - 2 purple (control) and 2 blue (intervention). When a subject is recruited, they are allocated to the appropriate group based on their age and condition and a card is randomly drawn from the appropriate envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>All children receiving botox A for dynamic equinus through the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia (SA), are screened for possible inclusion by the Study Coordinator (as per inclusion/exclusion criteria). Eligible potential subjects are identified and suitability is confirmed by consultation with the child's Rehabilitation Physician or Physiotherapist. The Study Coordinator then contacts the relevant family about the study and further written information is posted/emailed if requested. If families are happy to proceed, they consent to their child being enrolled in the study. The subject undergoes baseline measurement for the study (prior to their botox injection date) and a blinded Allocatur uses minimisation randomisation to allocate the subject to a group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have difficulty with mobility due to increased muscle tone (spasticity) and weakness in their legs. In recent years, botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A, or botox) has been used to treat muscle spasticity, providing an opportunity for physiotherapy to improve walking ability and endurance. Current research findings suggest that the effect of botox can be increased by making sure that injected muscles are actively contracting at the time of injection. If this theory is correct, strategies which activate the injected muscle may play a vital role in making the most of a given botox treatment. 

This project will test this theory by comparing 2 groups of children who receive botox; one group will also receive electrical stimulation to the affected calf muscle at the time of the botox injection, and the other group will only receive the injection. Both groups will then receive standard post-injection physiotherapy. The two groups will then have their walking ability assessed using specialised gait analysis. This project has the potential to improve the effects of botox treatment for all children who are injected.</summary>
