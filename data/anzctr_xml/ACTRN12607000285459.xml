  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is sublingual bupernorphine-naloxone dispensed weekly i.e. not administered daily under supervision, weekly case management and monthly medical review. The duration of the randomised intervention is 3 months. At 3 months participants randomised to daily supervised administration who are clinically assessed as stable are transferred to weekly dispensed medication for a further 3 months. Similarly, those randomised to  weekly dispensed medication who are clinically assessed as not being stable are transferred to weekly supervised administration for a further 3 months. Criteria for assessing stability is: 
1. No evidence of unstable drug use, as defined by:
a) Use of heroin, amphetamines and or cocaine on &gt;4 occasions per month
b) Daily average alcohol intake &gt;60g alcohol
c) Episodic or regular intoxication with benzodiazepines
These are assessed by self-report, clinical examination, record of presentations intoxicated, and urine drug screening. 
2. No risk factors for safety as evidenced by:
a) Unstable accommodation and living arrangements (for example, partners /flatmates who are actively injecting, unsatisfactory storage facilities)
b) Medical or psychiatric instability (assessed moderate risk of self-harm [depression with suicidal ideation], psychosis, decompensated liver disease, cognitive impairment which might make unsupervised medication unsafe)
c) Children &lt; 4 about whom there is DOCS involvement regarding parenting and in whom high levels of supervision and monitoring are thought to be in the childs interest
3.  Any evidence of diversion
Dose is individually determined i.e. in keeping with usual care dosage is titrated for each patient. 
Please note the study factor is unsupervised administration i.e. the mode of administration not the medication or dosage itself.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone) in the treatment of heroin dependence under two conditions  supervised and unsupervised administration. The defining characteristic of methadone and buprenorphine treatment in Australia is that patients attend a clinic or pharmacy daily for supervised administration of the prescribed opioid.   

The study hypotheses are: 
1. unsupervised administration will be associated with superior retention  compared to supervised administration

2.unsupervised administration will be more cost effective than supervised administration</summary>
