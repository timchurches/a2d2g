  <interventions>
    <interventions>This 6-month study comprised a 24-week individualised home-based physical activity intervention (= 150 minutes per week moderate intensity physical activity with a focus on walking). The participants were asked to complete the sessions as 3 x 50 minutes per week. They were offered a shorter session time of 30 minutes ( ie 5 x 30 minutes/week) if they indicated that they would have difficulty complying with longer session durations. Participants received a 1 hour workshop session one on one with an exercise physiologist at baseline. They received their own take-home resource manual containing their individualised exercise program information about exercise and safety and a behavioural education package. The material in the manual was explained to the participants during the workshop. The exercise program was carried out at home. They had the option of completing this with a carer or another person. The participants received scheduled 15-minute follow-up telephone calls (weeks 2, 4, 8, 14, 20) from the exercise physiologist. The program and scheduled worksheets in the intervention program were discussed. Five newsletters containing exercise information and material to enhance exercise compliance were also sent out to participants at regular intervals (weeks 3, 7, 11, 15) during the intervention phase. After 12 weeks the participants were sent a pedometer to wear during the exercise sessions to provide feedback and motivation for a 4 week period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care for 24 weeks. All participants and carers received educational material on AD and recommendations for a healthy lifestyle (other than physical activity). Participants were contacted by telephone at the same frequency as the intervention group. This was to ensure that the control and intervention group had similar treatment except for the actual intervention. Conversation for this group was limited to their general health and did not include discussion about physical activity.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A potential participant and his/her carer first underwent a telephone screening interview to initially determine eligibility. If both passed the phone screen, we obtained written permission to contact the participant's General Practitioner (GP) to request his/her medical history (including Alzheimer's disease diagnosis). If the participant's GP was happy for his/her patient to participate and, upon review of the records by the project's medical team, the participant had no medical conditions that excluded him/her from participating, the participant and his/her carer were invited to a baseline assessment. After the assessment was completed, the treatment was randomly allocated. Allocation was concealed using sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each of the three study sites was given 100 sealed opaque envelopes (numbered 1-100 and used in that order). After the participant completed his/her baseline assessment, a research assistant opened one envelope. Inside the envelope there was either the letter A (physical activity group) or B (control group). Ryan, P (1998). sxd1: Random allocation of treatments in blocks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this 3-site multicentre randomised controlled trial was to establish whether physical activity (PA) can decrease the rate of cognitive decline amongst patients with mild to moderate Alzheimers disease (AD). The main hypothesis was that participants with mild to moderate AD who were randomised to a program of PA will experience significantly less cognitive decline by the end of the intervention than participants with mild to moderate AD randomised to usual care. Previously, some of the researchers involved in this study successfully developed a PA program for participants with mild cognitive impairment (FABS) and tested this program in a pilot study with patients with mild to moderate AD.</summary>
