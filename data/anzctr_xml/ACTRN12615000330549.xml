    <interventions>Stereotactic hypofractionated body radiosurgery (SABR).
Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy and uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1-3 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages. The recommended dose fractionation for this study is site-specific, and ranges from 18Gy/1Fx to 45Gy/3Fx. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses. Generally, SABR treatment is given in a single 60 minute session, however, if more than one session of SABR treatment is required, this will be done on non-consecutive days within 14 days.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the side effects, safety, and effectiveness of stereotactic hypofractionated body radiosurgery for oligometastatic renal cell tumours. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma and 1 to 3 extracranial metastases (with no prior systemic targeted therapy) or 4 to 6 extracranial metastases in patients currently on systemic targeted therapy AND no more than 1 to 3 progressing metastases. Study details Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, spine, liver and kidney. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control cancers that have spread beyond the kidney to other organs or to the bones. This study will involve discussing your medical history and progress of your renal cell tumour with the doctor. A whole body bone scan and CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed to confirm the location and number of secondary deposits of the tumour prior to treatment and at follow up visits.  In addition to the bone and CT scans, an additional scan called a diffusion and perfusion MRI will be used before treatment and 3 months after treatment to investigate the changes in cancer blood flow before and after treatment. Up to three sessions of SABR treatment will be performed, depending on the location of your secondary cancer deposits. As part of the study, blood samples will be taken before and after treatment at 5 timepoints over a period of approximately 3-4 months. Questionnaires looking at quality of life and pain will be completed before treatment, and at each follow up visit. Follow up visits will be performed at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until 2 years after the radiotherapy treatment. This is the first step of the research, and is a pilot study. If the technique is shown to be both feasible and tolerable for this pilot study of 30 patients, we would then look at expanding this study.</summary>
