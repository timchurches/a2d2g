    <interventions>The aim of this project is to prospectively validate the European-based PICNICC clinical decision rule (CDR) that reliably stratifies children with cancer and febrile neutropenia into low and high risk for microbiologically documented infection (MDI), so as to optimise their management and quality of life and improve resource allocation. The CDR is based on six simple clinical variables including (i) tumour type (ii) maximum temperature, (iii) total white cell count, (iv) monocyte count, (v) haemoglobin and (vi) severity of illness. It provides the opportunity for a world first external validation of this globally derived rule and is a critical step before the rule can be safely implemented into practice. 

Patient demographic, FN episode and outcome data will be collected prospectively by the study-site research assistant (RA) and will follow international consensus definitions. Patients that develop FN outside of RA working hours will have relevant data collected retrospectively within 72 hours. Data will be entered into an electronic password protected study database (REDCap). Accuracy of data collection will be verified by project manager (first ten records for each site then periodically throughout recruitment) as well as chief investigator and site associate investigator.

To identify novel biomarkers that predict outcomes we will perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from participants at Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne at two time points. Blood will be collected in EDTA tubes (5ml if &lt;40kg and 12ml if &gt;40kg). Peripheral blood samples will be processed by the Childrens Cancer Centre Tissue Bank. Within two hours of sample collection, plasma will be harvested following centrifugation and stored at -80 degrees celsius. PBMCs will be isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. PBMC will be cryopreserved and stored in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen for in vitro assays and pelleted and resuspended in RNAlater for nucleic acid extraction. Samples will be batched and distributed by the CCC Tissue Bank.

RNAseq will be performed at MCRI (25-30 M coverage) on unstimulated and stimulated samples. Additionally PBMCs will be analysed by flow cytometry to determine the frequency of T cells, and monocytes. This latter data set will allow bioinformatic deconvolution to dissect the transcriptome of relevant cell types. When we have established which method (stimulated or unstimulated) provides that most robust data we will proceed to collect and analyses 100-200 samples . Flow cytometry and stimulation of PBMCs will be performed in the Pellegrini laboratory at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The cell samples sent to WEHI will be thawed and placed in culture medium. During the pilot study these samples will be unstimulated or stimulated with agents that are known to amplify immune responses for a few hours. The medium the cells were kept in will then be collected, to be analysed upon completion of transcriptome analysis for secreted immunogenic factors. The cells themselves will be labelled with specific antibodies which will distinguish the individual cells into subtypes of immune cells and their activation status. During this process all the cells will be run on a machine to analyse composition. Therefore no cells will remain after the analysis has taken place. However, the culture medium these cells were kept in will be stored indefinitely at -80 degrees celsius in the secure Pellegrini laboratory freezer. RNA sequencing is being carried out to identify biomarkers that can predict the outcome of FN episodes only. The transcriptome analysis performed as part of this study is purely exploratory. None of the tests being performed are validated or accredited as diagnostics. Therefore no information will be revealed about disease-predisposing germline traits, heritable disorders or parental identity. 

Each enrolled patient that experiences a febrile neutropenia episode will be followed at presentation (i.e. Day 1), Day 2, Day 7 and Day 30. Cost information will be obtained using hospital costs records for inpatient data and outpatient costs via the Medicare consent form, completed at patient recruitment by the RA. 

The optional quality of life surveys have been replicated into an electronic format for parents/guardians and patients older than three years, The age ranges for the CHU-9D assessment (7 to 18 years and a  proxy version for patients aged 3 to 6 years) have been stipulated by the University of Sheffield and will be adhered to when implementing the questionnaire. The RA will implement each tool electronically prior to discharge, providing education on how to complete the surveys. To provide a comprehensive overview of the true impact of FN and unplanned hospital admission on the child. For patients that have been discharged home, the surveys will be distributed electronically, via RedCAP, to valid email address.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>International data indicate that microbiologically documented infetcion occurs in between 18 and 25% of episodes of febrile neutropenia. This is supported by local pilot data at Monash Childrens Hospital and Royal Childrens Hospital. For validation of the PICNICC clinical decision rule (Objective 1), 650 episodes of febrile neutropenia, with an estimated event rate of 18%, are required for 80% power to show AUC-ROC of the PICNICC model is greater than or equal to 0.660. Accounting for a 30% dropout the target for recruitment is 845 across the 8 study sites. 

The sample size for the biomarker study (Objective 2) will be calculated from an exploratory study.. The bioinformatics department at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute (WEHI) will perform power calculations in the preliminary data to ascertain a sufficient sample size. Based on their experience 100-200 participants with 200-400 samples should provide adequate data for correlative analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to validate the PICNICC clinical decision rule and explore potential biomarkers that will assist in prediction of microbiologically documented infection in children undergoing treatment for cancer or leukaemia presenting with febrile neutropenia (FN).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged less than 18 years and have are undergoing active treatment for cancer or leukaemia with a diagnosis of fever and with absolute neutrophil count less than 1.0 cells/ microlitre. 

Study details
The study involves obtaining routinely documented information from medical records related to the FN episode. In addition requesting permission to access Medicare data over a 12 month period, to analyse costs that may have occurred due to the FN episode for the participant and their family. Participants (aged 3 to 18 years) and their parent/guardian will be asked to complete an electronic survey at presentation to hospital, seven days thereafter and a follow up survey at 30 days. At one site participants will be asked to provide two small blood samples at routine blood sampling times to assist in analysing markers in the blood that may be able to diagnose and predict the severity of an infection.

FN is the most frequent complication of the treatment of childhood cancer. Throughout Australia and the rest of the world, management usually involves hospital admission for intravenous antibiotics until resolution of fever and recovery of neutrophil count. International and local data indicate these unplanned FN admissions negatively impact quality of life (QOL), increase the risk of hospital-acquired infection and pose a significant economic burden on the healthcare system.

In collaboration with the European-based PICNICC group, this project will test an established clinical decision rule (CDR) that predicts severe infection in children with cancer presenting with FN. This rule will enable emergency department, oncology and other paediatric doctors to reliably identify patients at low-risk of severe infection who will benefit from reduced intensity antibiotic treatment and early hospital discharge. This study will also identify novel biomarkers in blood that may be used in the future to improve our prediction of exactly which children with FN have a severe infection. Finally, we will also explore the cost of treatment of FN in Australia as well as the impact of this common condition on patient and family quality of life. This information will be used to inform future research and identify areas for cost savings and improvements in quality of life.
