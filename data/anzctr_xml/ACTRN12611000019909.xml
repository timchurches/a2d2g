    <interventions>Pure EMU oil: Subjects will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive either emu oil (investigational product) or placebo in phase A (double blind phase). In phase B, subjects may voluntary decide to continue treatment with open label emu oil. For phase A, 1.25mL of oil (emu oil or placebo) will be applied topically to selected joints three times daily for 8 weeks, followed by 1.25mL of open-label emu oil applied topically to selected joints for 8 weeks in phase B. During Phase B, oil will be applied three times daily. Phase B will commence immediately from Phase A.</interventions>

    <concealment>This is a double blind palcebo controlled study. Following informed consent, patients will be assessed for joint pain and stiffness. Once patients are enrolled, they will be randomized (1:1) to a drug kit number. Each kit will contain 1 bottle named 'A' for phase A and 1 bottle name 'B' for phase B. 'A' bottles will be either emu oil or placebo oil and 'B' bottles will be open label emu oil. Each kit will be assigned a unique identification code and all bottles within the kit will have the same number. Sites will be notified of the kit number for a particular patient by return of enrollment/ randomization fax. At start of the treatment, patients will receive bottle 'A' only for 8 weeks of treatment. Following 8 weeks of treatment, if patient voluntarily decide to continue on unblinded phase, bottle 'B' will be provided.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of pure emu oil for treatment of joints pain in postmenopausal women receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitors due to early breast cancer. 

This is a 2 phase study, where phase 'A ' is blinded and phase 'B' is open labelled (not blinded). In first phase, participants will be randomized to receive either emu oil or placebo for 8 weeks and the arm to which they are randomized will not be known to them or their doctor. During this treatment period, all patients would be required to mainatain daily diary to record treatment compliance. Joint pain and stiffness severity will be assessed before and after treatment using pain questionnaires. 
In phase B, patients will be asked to continue treatment with open label emu oil for further 8 weeks, if they wish. All patients continuing in phase B, will be assessed for pain and stiffness severity at the end of this phase.
Following 16 weeks of treatment, patients will be able to continue with commercial stock of emu oil, and will be assessed for compliance and severity at 6 months. 

Improvement in joint pain and stiffness will be assessed at baseline and end of 8 weeks of treatment. Adverse events and compliance related to Emu oil will be monitored throughout the study. Overall pain will be assessed at baseline and end of 8 weeks of treatment.</summary>
