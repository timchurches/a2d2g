  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Group Problem Management Plus. Arm 2: Enhanced Treatment as Usual. Therapy is administered once weekly over 5 weeks in a group format over 3 hours per session. Problem Management Plus includes skills in identifying emotional and practical problems that can be managed and strategies to reduce and cope with these problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after 3 months follow-up assessment and resulting in participation duration of around 5 months. Therapy is provided by lay health counselors along with community health workers. Fidelity testing of 10-15% sessions will be done in the field.</interventions>
    <comparator>Enhanced Treatment as Usual comprises normal routine visits conducted by the local community health workers (LHWs). Care is enhanced in 2 ways: (a) LHWs in the EUC arm will receive training in making referrals to their primary care physicians for treatment; and (b) These primary care physicians will receive the standard training in treatment of common mental disorders routinely taught by our partner, the WHO Collaborating Center in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. If, during this treatment or during the studys assessments participants in EUC arm show severe psychiatric disorders (eg psychosis) or problems (e.g., suicidality) that require immediate specialist treatment and follow-up, they will be referred to specialist staff (e.g., psychiatrist) within the District Headquarter Hospital. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 5 months. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be women 18-60 years screened in the community by the research team indicating moderate distress &amp; impaired functioning. As a cluster randomized control trial the unit of randomization is LHWs, who each have one catchment area of approximately 150 homes or a population of 1,000 persons. All LHWs in Odigram and Ghalegay are eligible for randomization, which will be done by a researcher at the independent trial center at the Human Development Research Foundation who is not involved in intervention delivery, clinical supervision, independent assessment or other aspects of the day-to-day running of the study. Within the Odigram and Ghalegay Union Council an even number of LHWs will be randomized to the intervention and EUC arm, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. This design is necessary to reduce the chance of contamination that would be present in an individual RCT design as it is possible more than one woman from each household will meet the inclusion criteria.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be conducted by a computer generated system and will be conducted using 1:1 allocation ratio.  </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a low intensity intervention to reduce mental health problems in women in low-resources settings. This study compares the relative effectiveness of (a) Group Problem Management Plus, and (b) Enhanced Treatment as Usual. It is hypothesised that Group Problem Management Plus will lead to greater symptom reduction than Enhanced Treatment as Usual.  </summary>
