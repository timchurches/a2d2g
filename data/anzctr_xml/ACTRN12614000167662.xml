  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clinical experts who have agreed to provide advise to the NIHR HTA programme's vignette process (used to help prioritise questions for pragmatic clinical research) will be sent either a short (1 page- the intervention)) or long (up to 10 page - usual control) paper, and asked to provide advice on it using either a structured form (control)  or free text (intervention) to reply.

As a 2x2 factorial study the randomisations are short v long paper; and structured form v free text

It is anticipated that the control group options (long paper and structured form) will take less than an hour to complete, with the intervention options (short paper and free text) shortening the required time for the participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual practice - the long paper and a structured form. 

The papers sets out a research question in Population-Intervention-Control-Outcome format, and provides epidemiological and clinical information about the question - such as prevalence or incidence of a disease, costs of the interventions to be studied, and a summary of previous and current research. 

The structured form asks "How important do you think this research question is to the NHS", "2.	Does the proposed research address the uncertainty and need for research described? If not  What would be a better question/proposed type of research required to get an answer?", "Is this the right target group and setting?", "Is the study design appropriate?", "Are you aware of any relevant published research?", "Are you aware of any relevant research in progress", "Do you have any other comments that you think are important?"

It is anticipated that the control group options (long paper and structured form) will take less than an hour to complete.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Vignettes 
- those which ask a methodological, rather than clinical question
- vignettes where the responsible CA does not want external experts
- Vignettes which have been through previous external review, other than as a
panel topic

Experts
- Non-clinical experts, eg PPI advisors, methodologists. Clinical-Academics count as clinical experts. The final decision as to whether an advisor is 'clinical' rests with the Steering Group responsible for the vignette, who may take advice from the relevant CA
- People who have provided advice on the panel topic from which the vignette was derived
- Current and previous members of HTA prioritisation and TIDE panels

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants assessed for eligibility by a researcher, in order of their accepting work for the programme. The order is determined by the time stamp of receipt of their email indicating acceptance.

If the researcher can't decide on eligibility the decision is made by the chief investigator.

Once the eligibility decision is made, group allocation is made by an administrator, using a regenerated randomisation schedule. The researcher and chief investigator do not have access to the allocation schedule. </concealment>
