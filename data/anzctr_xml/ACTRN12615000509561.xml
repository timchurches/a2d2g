  <interventions>
    <interventions>The online program for carers of people with dementia is comprised of an educational fact sheet explaining (i) dementia, (ii) behaviour changes in people with dementia, and (iii) how to plan activities for people with dementia. It also includes 20 animations exploring behaviours common in dementia and 20 associated problem-solving worksheets that allow the participant to apply the videos to their own situation. Carers can access the program as many times as they would like by logging in online over 8 weeks. Adherence is monitored by collecting self-report and user-access data.

    <comparator>The educational website is an Alzheimers Australia webpage with help sheets that address the most commonly raised issues about dementia (https://fightdementia.org.au/about-dementia-and-memory-loss/help-sheets)

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A meta-analysis of 23 carer programs for managing symptoms of dementia yielded an effect size of 0.34 (Brodaty &amp; Arasaratnam, 2012). A power analysis was conducted to inform the sample size using a conservative expected effect size difference between the groups of 0.2. It is estimated that we would require 200 participants to reach a significance level of p=0.05, at 80% power (Cohen, 1988). 

Analyses will be carried out using SPSS. Descriptive statistics will be computed for demographic questions and the online questionnaires (including internal consistency). Relationships across measures (e.g., bivariate correlations and regression analyses) will be examined. Group by time interactions will be examined using linear mixed models to determine whether the program reduced carer distress and burden, in comparison to the educational website. Content analysis will be undertaken to determine qualitatively how acceptable and useful carers perceived the program to be.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dementia is the single greatest cause of disability in older Australians and the third leading cause of disability burden in Australia. Due to our aging population the number of Australians living with dementia is expected to increase rapidly over the next decade placing additional burden on the health system and on the unpaid/family carers of people with dementia. Behavioural changes occur in 90% of people with dementia. These changes are stressful and challenging for carers.  The purpose of this study is to examine an online educational training program that teaches carers of people with dementia ways to manage common behaviours. It is expected that the program will reduce carer burden and stress.</summary>
