  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will all receive a global risk factor assessment prior to intervention and at the end of the intervention phase (roughly 7 months later).  Participants recruited from a previous study that did not show change will be asked to enroll in the current study.  The previous study (A Novel Approach to Cardiovascular Health By Optimizing Risk Management: ANCHOR) recruited adults from two family practice offices in Nova Scotia.  Each individual received one-on-one behaviour change counselling by a health care provider aimed at reducing cardiac risk.  Cardiac risk was assessed utilizing a global risk factor assessment that computed a Framingham score and risk category.  The Framingham score was percent measure of 10 year risk of experiencing a cardiac event.  Thus, those that were not able to reduce their 10 year risk, will be approached to enrol in the current study.  
Additionally, new participants will be recruited from the same health centre.  Once an initial assessment is complete, previous participants will be matched to new participants based on several risk indicators and randomly assigned as a dyad.
Each participant will be randomized to one of four group based intervention conditions: 1) Motivation ONLY 2) Awareness building and coping strategy training 3)Combination of above 4) Neither.
New participants that are not matched will receive one-to-one behavioural counseling from a nurse trained in behaviour change counseling.  
The group interventions are described below:
Motivational Enhancement
The use of motivational enhancement as an intervention strategy will differ from the ANCHOR Study primarily in format and duration. In the current study, this intervention will be delivered in a small group setting.  Each group will be comprised of 5-8 members depending on participant availability.  Participants will attend a one hour session, every month, for 6 months.  In these small groups, participants will explore the components of motivation as it relates to engaging in and changing health behaviours.  Participants will be encouraged to evaluate the behaviours in need of change based on the individualized Heart Risk Assessment feedback given during the initial assessment.  Concepts such as stages of change, readiness for change, decisional balance, SMART goals, and relapse prevention will be presented and discussed.  Participants will be guided through creating a change plan and will be encouraged to find reinforcers for positive health behaviours.  The facilitator will present concepts, guide discussion, and encourage participation utilizing concepts of motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement.  The overall goal is to support participants in increasing motivation to engage in positive health behaviours.  

Awareness Building and Coping Strategy Training
Participants assigned to this intervention will be presented with material to increase awareness of risks and rewards of health behaviours.  The facilitator will guide discussion around increasing awareness of detrimental health behaviours.  A problem solving and stress management approach will be utilized to encourage the participants to explore new adaptive coping strategies while reducing the use of maladaptive strategies.  The overall goal is to increase distress regarding health behaviours while supporting the participants in problem solving and coping activities that can lead to increasing positive health behaviours.</interventions>

    <concealment>All previous participants of ANCHOR who demonstrated a Framingham score that stayed the same or increased from baseline to post-intervention will be identified and targeted for recruitment.  New participants will be identified via the Duffus Health Care Centre.  
The method of randomization for the current study begins with the evaluation of previous ANCHOR participants who have completed the initial assessment.  Each previous participant will be matched to a new participant based on several factors identified to be predictive of being resistant to change in the preliminary exploratory analysis of the ANCHOR Study.
The variables and ranges they are to be match on are as follows:
Age: matched within range as identified by Framingham risk calculation charts
Gender
BMI: matched within weight classification range as defined by NHLBI guidelines
Readiness: matched within 2 total points on eating healthy, physical activity, and weight
Psychosocial distress: matched within 1 point on total of social support, anger, happiness, and community support
Framingham risk points: matched within 2 points

Each matched dyad (one previous ANCHOR and one new participant) will then be randomly assigned to one of four conditions.  Randomization to conditions will continue until all previous ANCHOR participants recruited have been assigned.  That is, no unmatched new participant will be randomized to a condition.  Any new participant that is unmatched or is recruited in excess of the n recruited from the previous ANCHOR participant pool  will be assigned to the 5th condition.
Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The original ANCHOR study helped to identify the important characteristics of health teams (nurses, dieticians, etc.) that best support patients in making better lifestyle choices.  Many patients were helped in improving health and reducing risk of heart troubles.  Now, the question this study seeks to answer is: can we help people that did not benefit from the original study using a more intense intervention and can we find similar people to intervene upon to help patients change health behaviors that affect their cardiac risk.</summary>
