  <interventions>
    <interventions>Foot clearance data will be displayed in real-time on a screen and the particpants will be required to maintain their foot position within the target clearance band while walking on the treadmill at their preferred walking speed. The retraining program includes eight sessions spread over a 3-4 week period; each training session will include 5-10 minutes of treadmill walking. The intervention will be administered by a physiotherapist.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be adults over 18 years who have suffered a stroke at least 6 months previously. Participants must be able to walk independently 50 m (with or without a stick) and be able to give informed consent. They must not be receiving any physiotherapy during the 8 weeks of the study.  They must also be able to understand and follow instructions in English.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if they require an ankle foot orthosis, as this may limit their ability to modify toe clearance. Participants will be excluded if they have any other neurological, orthopaedic, cardiac, respiratory or other medical conditions that may impact on their walking or their ability to walk on a treadmill.  Participants who are pregnant will be excluded. Participants with visual problems or visual-spatial neglect will also be excluded.  Stoke patients who may be stabilising will be excluded from the study.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of using visual feedback to increase minimum toe clearance during walking in people with stroke. This intervention has the potential to improve walking safety and reduce falls. Ten participants will be required to attend 10 sessions. The training sessions will occur over a 3-4 week period, with at least one rest day between sessions. At all sessions, participants will be required to walk on a treadmill for 5-10 minutes. They will wear exercise shorts and also a safety harness which will prevent them from falling. Participants will also have markers placed on their lower limbs, and a special camera (Optotrak) will record the movement of these markers while participants walk. They will also wear insoles in their shoes (FScan), which will record pressure under their feet. Data will be recorded during assessment sessions, and additional clinical data will also be obtained. Participants will be asked some questions about their risk of falls. During the training sessions,  participants will be asked to modify their walking pattern to match a target minimum toe clearance. </summary>
