  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is examining the infectivity of a Plasmodium falciparum 7G8 malaria cell bank in humans.  Participants will receive a single inoculum of the malaria cell bank, which consists of human red blood cells containing P. falciparum 7G8 malaria parasites.  Followng administration of the inoculum, we will measure the growth of the malaria parasites in the blood-stream and then administer anti-malarial treatment (Riamet) according to specific criteria (based on the number of parasites in the blood as well as clinical signs/symptoms of malaria).  We will also be assessing the safety of the inoculum and also the way the immune system responds to it.  Determining the infectivity and safety of the malaria cell bank is important as it will form a critical part of future clinical trials investigating the effectiveness of a new malaria vaccine that is currently being developed.  </summary>
