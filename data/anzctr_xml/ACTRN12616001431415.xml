  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Critically ill patients with an acute circulatory failure under conventional mechanical ventilation for whom the attending clinician had decided to administer fluid. This decision is based on the presence of at least one clinical sign of inadequate tissue perfusion in the absence of contraindication for fluid infusion. 
Clinical signs of inadequate tissue perfusion are defined as 
1) systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg (or a decrease 50 mm Hg in previously hypertensive patients) or the need of vasopressive drugs (dopamine 5 mcg/kg/min or norepinephrine), 
2) urine output 0.5 mL/kg/hr for at least 2 hrs, 
3) tachycardia (heart rate HR 100/min)
4) presence of skin mottling</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Data distribution was evaluated by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variable are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, while categorical as percentage (95% confidence interval [CI]). The paired or unpaired Students t-test are used for head-to-head comparisons of parametric data, as indicated, while discrete variables were analyzed using the Chi-squared. 
The discriminative power of pulse pressure variation (PPV) and variability of S wave (DELTA_S) is assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (95%, CI). 
Comparison of two area  under the ROC curves is performed using the nonparametric
technique described by DeLong et al.
For all tests, the null hypothesis was rejected for p values &lt;0.05. 
Sample size not calculated because of the absence of clinical trials evaluating the same parameters of the present studies. The sample size of 40 patients has beed decided basing on previous results of similar studies in critically ill patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective pilot trial aims to investigate the reliability of a non invasive hemodynamic parameter obtained by means of tissue doppler in critically ill patients. 
In particular, the s wave is related to the systolic function of both right and left ventricles.
The purpose of the study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of s wave variability, compared to the gold standard of pulse pressure variation (PPV) - a non invasive parameter measured by many different hemodynamic monitors- in assessing the fluid responsiveness.
Fluid responsiveness is defined as the ability of increasing the cardiac index after a infusion of a standard amount of fluids (500 ml of crystalloids in 30 minutes, fluid challenge).
The study protocol consists in 4 steps:
1) enrollment of patients who need fluid resuscitation (see inclusion criteria) and already monitored with a tool measuring PPV
2) echocardiographic evaluation of s waves (both right and left)
3) fluid challenge administration
4) data analysis </summary>
