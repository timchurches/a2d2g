  <interventions>
    <interventions>MyTime is a national program of facilitated peer support groups for parents and carers of children with a disability, developmental delay or chronic medical condition. Parents or caregivers with a child up to age 16 may attend a MyTime group if they are eligible to apply for the Carer Allowance. Each MyTime group consists of 4-12 parents, a facilitator to manage group processes, and at least one play helper who keeps children up to school age engaged in appropriate activities to support parent participation in the groups. 

MyTime was established in 2007 and is funded by the Australian Department of Social Services (DSS) under the Families and Children program.  The Parenting Research Centre (PRC) manages the MyTime program across Australia, delivering implementation support to a network of 14 partner agencies at a regional level. Those agencies coordinate local providers to deliver the MyTime groups (currently 213 groups nationally). Approximately 3000 parents and carers attend at least one MyTime group each year.

The content and delivery of individual MyTime group sessions are determined at a local level and guided by parent/carer need though typically structured around one or more of the following types of activities:
1. Topic based discussion (facilitated and based on resources provided) 
2. Guest speakers including services information sessions
3. Pampering &amp; bonding activities or excursions
4. Appropriate play activities for children and siblings.

Topics frequently covered in groups include parent and carer self-care, available services or supports, parenting issues e.g., managing behaviour, eating, child development, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), schools/education. Evidence-based information on each of these topics is provided to facilitators to support these discussions by the Parenting Research Centre. Information regarding specific content areas and activities conducted in each session is currently collected by the Parenting Research Centre, with the proposed evaluation aiming to gather more detailed information about the fidelity of delivery to the program model across individual groups.

MyTime groups are typically delivered on a fortnightly basis for a period of at least two hours. Some groups offer weekly sessions. Parents participate in as many or as few sessions as they wish. Information regarding the frequency and duration of MyTime sessions for individual participants will be collected and included in analyses of outcomes. For the purposes of the current evaluation, the intervention period will be six months.  Six months was identified as being a reasonable timeframe for collecting follow-up or post-test data as most parents would have participated in a minimum of 12 sessions during this period which was considered adequate program dosage for parents to experience intended proximal outcomes (i.e., increased social support, increased knowledge of services and supports, increased parent knowledge and skills, reduced stress etc.).

Program facilitators have relevant qualifications in psychology, social work or welfare and receive training and ongoing professional development to facilitate the program. All facilitators receive support through a local MyTime co-ordinator and have access to evidence-based resources for facilitators provided by the Parenting Research Centre.

The MyTime practice model is based on research which suggests that peer support programs can provide a range of benefits to parents of children with a disability or chronic medical condition. These include increased parental sense of agency and control, increased social support, reduced stigma and reduced stress, depression and anxiety (e.g., Armstrong, Birnie-Lefcovitch, &amp; Ungar, 2005; Bottrell, 2009; Campbell, Phaneuf &amp; Deane, 2004; Shilling et al., 2013). These benefits align strongly with the needs expressed by parents and carers of children with a disability including accessing additional information, advice and links to appropriate resources and support, having an outlet to express thoughts and feelings without judgement, accessing increased social support and gaining a sense of control (e.g., Attride-Stirling et al., 2000; Hogan, 2002).

On the basis of this research, the main objectives of MyTime are to:
1. Increase parents and carers social support
2. Increase parental knowledge of caring for a child with special needs
3. Reduce parental stress.

    <statisticalmethods>It is anticipated that approximately 80% of new members (N=700) who join MyTime during the period 2017-2020 will choose to participate in the evaluation. The anticipated sample size is sufficient to detect small effects at a significance level set at 0.05 with a power value of 0.8 (minimum sample size required, N=199).

Data preparation: Data for the dynamic fidelity and outcomes questionnaires will be collated and screened for missing data and outliers. Prior to conducting any statistical tests, data will analysed to ensure compliance with test assumptions (e.g., normality, equality of variances).

Data analysis: Descriptive analyses of quantitative data will be conducted on a six-monthly basis to enable the continuous reporting of fidelity and outcome data for each partner agency. These analyses will summarise structural and dynamic fidelity data as well as outcome data (i.e., change scores) from the outcomes measure. Fidelity and outcome data will be reported on a six-monthly/annual basis in a brief data dashboard or infographic that summarises aggregated data. These may be made available to MyTime co-ordinators to enable the identification of elements of MyTimes implementation that may need to be adjusted or strengthened. Data dashboards or infographics summarising progress on selected aggregate fidelity data may also be made available to MyTime facilitators. Dependent on sample size, it may also be possible to perform enhanced analyses such as comparisons of fidelity and outcome data between partner agencies or correlations between implementation fidelity and outcome data. Pearson correlations will be calculated for continuous variables and chi-square will be used with categorical data. Parametric statistics (t-test, ANOVA and Pearson correlation) will be used in analyses for normal data. If numbers are adequate, co-variates will be used where they are found to impact on outcomes. Effect sizes will be calculated with Cohens d. Cohens classification of effect size is as follows: scores of d=0.20  0.49 indicates a small effect, d=0.50  0.79 a moderate effect and d =0.80 a large effect (Cohen, 1988).

Level of significance:  Level of significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05, with no Bonferroni adjustment in order not to increase type II error (Rothman, 1990). This follows the assumption that the data are not random numbers (and hence the universal null hypothesis holds true), but rather actual observations of coherent phenomena (Rothman, 1990). 

Reporting: Six-monthly reports summarising fidelity and outcome data collected across all groups will be prepared, with the specific goals of monitoring and strengthening the implementation of MyTime and in meeting DSS reporting requirements.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>MyTime is a national program of facilitated peer support groups for parents and carers of children (aged up to 16 years) with a disability, developmental delay or chronic medical condition. The program was established in 2007 by the Parenting Research Centre (PRC) and is funded by the Australian Department of Social Services (DSS). The PRC are planning to conduct an evaluation from July 2015 until 2020 to understand how well the program is meeting the needs of participants and to further develop and support the implementation of MyTime in collaboration with partner agencies, with the aim of improving the program for parents and carers.
Specifically, the evaluation aims to determine:

1. Whether MyTime is being implemented as intended; and

2. The effect of MyTime on the intended proximal outcomes of the program.

Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) is a systematic approach to continuously collecting and reviewing data or information about the implementation of an intervention in order to identify opportunities to improve this implementation, with the end result of delivering better services to clients. This process enables implementers to collect, interpret and use data in a continuous process to ensure that the core elements of the intervention are being adhered to and delivered as intended (fidelity), monitor outcomes for families receiving the intervention and evaluate the true effectiveness of the intervention by accounting for implementation variability.

To test the acceptability of the outcomes and dynamic fidelity measures and to test data collection systems, an initial pilot study will be conducted consisting of up to 30 participants (MyTime members and facilitators) drawn from 2-3 representative MyTime groups. As part of the ongoing CQI evaluation, data collected through routine practice and via a brief survey/telephone interview with MyTime coordinators will be utilised to assess agency adherence to basic program elements (structural fidelity). The quality and content of the relationship between interventionists (MyTime facilitators) and members (parents and carers) (dynamic fidelity) will be measured using a brief questionnaire that is administered to all current MyTime members and facilitators. Both fidelity measures will be completed on a six-monthly basis. Finally, new MyTime members will be invited to participate in an outcomes evaluation which involves the completion of a brief questionnaire within one month of commencing MyTime and a follow-up questionnaire six months later. The questionnaires include information on family demographics, parent knowledge of supports and level of perceived support, parenting confidence, parent well-being and respite needs. The second questionnaire will repeat all but the demographics questions.

Both existing and new MyTime members and facilitators will be provided with a plain language information sheet and consent form inviting them to participate in the dynamic fidelity and outcomes evaluation.
