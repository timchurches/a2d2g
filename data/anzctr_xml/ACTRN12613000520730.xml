  <interventions>
    <interventions>After 1 month of the curative resection, the adjuvant group received 100mg aspirin tablet one time per one day by oral until tumor recurrence confirmed by Liver contrast-enhanced CT or MRI tumor  with or without elevated AFP or 2 years after operation or the patient death during the study.
The monthly review after the blood, liver, kidney function, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver ultrasound. The three-monthly review of liver-enhanced CT or MRI. If bone pain, line ECT or check
The processing schedule of Adverse reactions:
a. Grade III adverse reactions: aspirin dose reduced by 50%;
b. Grade III adverse reactions are continued more than 2 weeks or Grade IV adverse reactions: stop taking aspirin
c. When WBC &lt;2.5 × 109 / L and/or PLT &lt;40 × 109 / L: aspirin dose reduced by 50% and get drugs which can enhance white blood cells and/or platelet count;
d. When the dose of aspirin reduced but WBC and/or platelet count continued to decline: stop taking aspirin

A standardized clinical data management procedure will be carried out to make sure all of the data including the data on the adherences satisfy good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. All of the data will be entered in a verified database while the original paper records will be kept for at least 5 years. To make sure that the data in the database is consistent with the original one, a data validation process will be carried out. Disagreements were adjudicated by answering the query forms after referring to the original records.</interventions>
    <comparator>After R0 resection, according to NCCN guideline 2012 of hepatobiliary cancers, there is no definite treatment for patients. So the control group will get best support treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major problem that hampers the efficacy of surgical resection. To date, adjuvant chemotherapy or other adjuvant modalities have not been proven effective for HCC. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether adjuvant therapy with aspirin after the operation could inhibit the recurrence of HCC after curative resection.</summary>
