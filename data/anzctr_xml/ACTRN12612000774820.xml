    <interventions>SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN
Study Design for Base Study:
In the base study, ~178 subjects will be randomized to treatment with MK-8457 100 mg twice a day (oral tablet) or placebo for a total of 24 weeks.  Subjects are required to be on background methotrexate (MTX) therapy at stable doses prior to and during the study.
Subjects will continue in a safety extension at the end of the base study.  After approximately ~50% of subjects have completed 12 weeks of treatment in the base study, an interim analysis (IA) will be conducted to evaluate for futility. While the IA is being conducted, enrollment will continue. A second IA will be performed to assess for efficacy after ~100% of subjects complete 12 weeks of treatment (or otherwise discontinue).  If efficacy is not demonstrated, the study may be discontinued.
Early Escape:
Subjects in the base study will be eligible for early escape at Week 12 or any point after, if they demonstrate a &lt;20% improvement in both tender and swollen joint counts.  Subjects may choose to either withdraw from the study or to continue into the safety extension portion of the study and receive MK-8457 100 mg twice a day (oral tablet) for up to a total of 100 weeks of treatment.
Study Design for Safety Extension
Subjects who complete 24 weeks of treatment in the base study will continue in a safety extension for up to a total of 100 weeks.  The safety extension will begin at Visit 9 (Extension). Subjects who meet the criteria for early escape may opt to continue onto the safety extension starting at Week 12.</interventions>

      <timepoint>12 weeks after randomisation.
There will be two planned interim analyses for this study.
The first interim analysis occurs when approx 50% subjects (45 per arm) have either completed 12 weeks of the study or dropped out. This interim analysis will check for futility based on ACR20 response rate at Week 12. The study will stop for futility if the observed treatment difference is less than or equal to 7.5%. The futility boundary corresponds to an alpha-spending of 0.1% and beta-spending of 10.1%, non-binding. The overall power of the primary analysis
accounting for the futility interim analysis is approximately 78%.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A subject must meet all the criteria listed below to participate in the trial:
1	Subject must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent.
RA diagnosis and disease activity:
2.	Subject has a diagnosis of RA (according to revised 1987 criteria of the ARA) for at least 6 months prior to screening 
3.	Subject has active RA as defined by the presence of greater than or equal to 6 swollen joints (of 66 joint count) AND greater than or equal to 6 tender joints (of 68 joint count) at screening (Visit 1) and baseline (Visit 2).
4.	Subject has a C-reactive protein (CRP) blood level &gt;0.9 mg/dL from the central reference laboratory at screening.
5.	Subject is anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) positive and/or rheumatoid factor positive at screening.
6.	Subject is ACR functional Class I, II, or III.
7.	Subject must have received MTX for a minimum of 3 months prior to screening with a regionally appropriate stable weekly dose for at least 4 weeks prior to screening (15-25 mg/wk for regions outside of Asia, and 6-25 mg/week for Asia).  The subject's dose of weekly MTX must remain stable through week 24 of the study.
8.	Subject must have either failed treatment with 1 or 2 anti-TNF-a therapies or was intolerant to anti-TNF-a therapy prior to screening.  For subjects who have failed therapy, the treatment with anti-TNF-a therapies must have been for at least 3 months.
Note: The inadequate response or intolerance to anti-TNF therapy will be defined by the Investigator's assessment and will be recorded. Typically, an inadequate response is based on clinical reasons (e.g., no improvement or worsening of RA).  Lack of access to the medication or financial reasons are not considered an inadequate response.
9.	If using NSAIDs or other analgesics, subject must be on stable doses (minimum of 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study medication).
10.	If using oral corticosteroids, must be on a stable dose of less than or equal to10 mg prednisone per day (or equivalent) for at least 2 weeks prior to first administration of study medications.
Tuberculosis:
11.	Subject is considered to be eligible according to the following tuberculosis (TB) screening criteria:
a.	Has no history of either untreated latent or active TB prior to Baseline.  Prophylactic treatment for latent TB (as per American Thoracic Society 1999 or local guidelines) must be initiated for at least 4 weeks prior to first administration of study medication.
b.	Has no signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB upon medical history and/or physical examination.
c.	Has had no recent close contact with a person with active TB or, if there has been such contact, will be referred to a physician specializing in TB to undergo additional evaluation and, if warranted, receive appropriate treatment for latent TB at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of study medication.
d.	Within 8 weeks prior to the first administration of study medication, either has a negative diagnostic TB test result (defined as either a negative tuberculin skin test or negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test).  In the US and Canada, an induration of 5 mm or greater in response to the intradermal tuberculin skin test is considered to be a positive result and evidence for either latent or active TB.  In countries outside the United States and Canada, country-specific guidelines for immunocompromised patients should be consulted for the interpretation of tuberculin skin test results. If no local guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be followed.
e.	Has a chest radiograph (both posterior-anterior and lateral views) within 2 months prior to Screening and read by a qualified radiologist, with no evidence of current active TB or old inactive TB.  If a negative chest radiograph is not available, then subject must have a chest radiograph performed during the screening phase showing no evidence of active TB or old inactive TB.
General:
12.	Subject understands the purpose and risks of the trial, is willing and able to comply with the protocol (able to adhere to dose and visit schedules) and voluntarily agrees to participate in the study by giving written informed consent.  The subject may also provide consent for Future Biomedical Research.  However, the subject may participate in the main trial without participating in Future Biomedical Research.
13.	Subject is able to read, understand, and complete study questionnaires.
14.	Subjects must be free of any clinically significant condition or situation, other than RA that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study.
15.	A subject (male or female) of reproductive potential agrees to remain abstinent or use 2 acceptable methods of birth control starting from Visit 1 until at least 3 months after last dose of methotrexate or at least 14 days after the last dose of study medication, whichever is later.  Longer periods of birth control may be required per local requirements.  Acceptable methods of birth control are: hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), diaphragm with spermicide, contraceptive sponge, condom, and vasectomy OR use appropriate double barrier contraception as per local regulations or guidelines. Abstinence is acceptable if this is the established and preferred contraception for the subject. Female subjects of reproductive potential must demonstrate a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening (Visit 1) and a negative urine pregnancy test 24 hours prior to the first dose of study medication and throughout the study.  Women who are postmenopausal or have had a hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from this requirement.  (Postmenopausal is defined as no menses for the previous 1 year.)
Note: Serum FSH sample will be obtained only from women with cessation of menses within 1 year prior to Visit 1.  If a subjects Visit 1 FSH result is not within the postmenopausal range (as defined by the central laboratory), serum beta-hCG level consistent with a non-gravid state at screening must be demonstrated to continue in the study. These women will be considered to be of childbearing potential during the course of the study (i.e., they should be administered the urine pregnancy tests).
16.	Subject must have results of a physical examination, including vital signs, within normal limits or clinically acceptable limits to the investigator and medical monitor (or appropriate designee) prior to the first dose of study medication.
