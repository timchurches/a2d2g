  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be under one of the two procedures according to the randomization. 
All patients will have the procedure once only by aqualified anesthetist specialized in pain management under fluoroscopic guidance with use of Cosman RF generator G4TM, 20 gauge curved sharp cannula, 10 cm shaft, 
10 mm tip and 10 cm electrodes (Cosman autoclavable CSK-TC10).
1. Group 1: Thirty patients....Two RF needles are inserted at transverse process(10 mm distance is kept between the two needles).  After sensory and motor stimulation for both sites, bipolar lesion RF at 80 degrees Celsius for 90 sec will be applied. 

2. Group 2:  Thirty patients.....One needle will be inserted at the transverse process.  After sensory and motor stimulation, monopolar lesion RF at 80 degrees Celsius  for 90 sec will be applied.
</interventions>
    <comparator>active control using monopolar lesion RF (a procedure incorporating heat at the active tip of a single electrode to interrupt pain signals travelling through spinal nerves)

a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius will be applied  for 90 sec once only. 

tools used: Cosman RF generator G4TM, 20 gauge curved sharp cannula with 10 cm shaft and 10 mm tip with 10 cm electrodes (Cosman autoclavable CSK-TC10).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients will be evaluated by a specialized pain nurse unaware of the method used intraooperatively. Evaluation will be done after 2 weeks, one month, 3 months for pain score using the visual analogue pain scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation will be done  2 weeks, one month and 3 months after the procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall patient satisfaction with pain relief will be evaluated by patient satisfaction questionnaire from 1 to 6 according to the following. 
1. Excellent 
2. Very good 
3. Good
4. Fair
5. Poor
6..very poor

    <concealment>Patients will be under one of the two procedures according to the randomization. All patients will do the procedure under fluoroscopic guidance with use of Cosman RF generator G4TM, 20 gauge curved sharp cannula, 10 cm shaft, 
10 mm tip and 10 cm electrodes (Cosman autoclavable CSK-TC10).
</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomly divided in two groups. There will be a box with 
60 closed envelopes divided randomly into two groups with 30 envelops in each group. On arrival to theatre, one of the envelopes will be opened and the assigned method will be applied.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will be performed using a standard statistical program (Sigma stat 3.5, Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Sample size is determined by using PASS softwarew for sample size and power calculations.  
A difference of 3 or more in the VAS score between the treatment and the control group was considered clinically relevant and a sample size (power=90% and a=0.05) of 25 patients per group was calculated (two sample t-test). To correct for failed blocks and patient drop out, 30 patients per group were included in the study. Demographic data will be analysed using Students t-test or Fishers exact test. The data will be tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test. Repeated measurements 
(pain scores, time consumed) will be analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance if normally distributedwith further paired comparisons at each time interval performed using the t-test.
