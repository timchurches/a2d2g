  <interventions>
    <interventions>The abdominal incisional hernias placed in the midline will be grouped into two. In the stidy group the components separation technique will be used. After surgical reduction of the hernia, the healthy fascial edges will be isolated. Then a wide skin flap will be raised on both sides of the midline incision. The lateral edge of the rectus muscle will be identified. An incision will be done to the external oblique fascia through the length of the original incision just lateral to the lateral border of the rectus bundle, protecting the Spigel line. The incision which will be deepened just under the external oblique muscle fibers sparing the underlying internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. The plane between the external and internal oblique muscles will be advanced through the whole length upto the level of the midaxillary line. This procedure will be repeated for the contralateral side. The healthy medial fascial edges of the rectus muscles will be approximated using polypropylene continuous sutures.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control. In the retromuscular mesh repair technique, after reduction of the hernial sac a plane will be formed under the rectus muscles upto the lateral edge of the muscle bundle. The same procedure will be applied to the other side. Then a large piece of polypropylene mesh sized at least 5 cm longer than the hernial defect on all sides will be placed under the rectus muscles. The edges of the mesh will be fixed to the overlying fascia by 8-10 all-layers polypropylene sutures (placed about 10 cm.s apart) which will be tied over the fascia and under the skin. The overlying midline fascia will be closed after isolating the healthy edges.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Freedom of movement during daily activities as coded in three grades; no restriction, somehow restricting and overt-full restriction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 6 month, 12 month, 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain as measured by the numeric rating scale. The scale consists of a horizontal line and numbers through 0 to 10 placed at equal intervals on top of the line. The patient is asked to point the level of pain experienced during rest and movement with the tip of a pen (0 no pain, 10 maximum imaginable pain).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 6 month, 12 month, 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life as measured by SF-36. The SF-36 form is a multipurpose health assessing form consisting of 6 domains. The participant will reply to the queries personally or with the help of the accompanying person when she/he is invited for examination at the specified timepoints.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 6 month, 12 month, 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hernia recurrence. This will be assessed by physical examination on the specified timepoints. If there is a doubt with the examination, computerized tomography will be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 6 month, 12 month, 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All postoperative complications including surgical site infection, wound dehiscence and mortality. These will be assessed on follow-up visits by examining the patient and the wound. Mortality is assessed by the hospital records or by interviewing the relatives.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 6 month, 12 month, 2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
