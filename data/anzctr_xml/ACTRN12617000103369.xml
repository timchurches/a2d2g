    <interventions>Brief name: Medibio Unwind Stress Reduction program

The Medibio Unwind Stress Reduction program is an internet based program delivered via web browser and has been optimised for smartphone viewing using a mobile first development process. This program will be accessible for participants once they have read the participant information statement, provided consent, and logged in to the program using their nominated email address and their study generated user identification number. Participants are asked to complete a program consisting of seven 20-30 minute modules in a 6 weeks period. This program provides strategies to users to manage stress and develop resilience to better cope with stressful circumstances. It achieves these broad aims by directly helping users to recognise and understand their own triggers for stress, and develop adaptive ways managing their stress levels. It provides evidence-supported tools for users to manage symptoms of arousal such as breathing techniques, progressive muscle relaxation and mindfulness. The program provides information on the important elements of attaining and keeping good health such as an appropriate exercise regime, getting enough sleep, cutting down on alcohol, smoking and caffeine, maintaining a balanced diet and taking time out to restore their energy levels. The interactive program includes animation, audio and video content developed internally and sourced from the internet. For example, the program provides links to external video content on the benefits of random acts of kindness as well as guided visualisation exercises for stress-reduction. The program also aims to have users reflect on challenging experiences to in order to build resilience, and provides the user with a range of positive coping options to reduce reliance on maladaptive coping. Throughout the modules, learning and understanding is reinforced through guided questionnaires and quizzes, homework tasks and pre-loaded feedback. The unique usefulness of the Medibio Unwind Stress Reduction program culminates in the development of a personalised Wellbeing Plan in module 7. This Wellbeing Plan is based upon users understanding of, and preference for the various tools exposed to the user to assist in stress reduction.</interventions>
