    <interventions>Ninety patients 18-45 yr old American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA) physical status I or II, scheduled for cesarean section  under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups of 30 each. The ketamine group (groupK) received bupivacaine 10 mg combined with 0.1mg/kg ketamine preservative free solution ,The midazolam group (groupM) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with0.02 mg/kg midazolam and The placebo group (group P) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water(intrathecally) for each three groups 5 minutes prior to surgery)</interventions>

Allocation will be managed by a Resident external to the project. The blinding will occur through use of equal amounts of pretreatment drugs (3mlâ€™s) Each syringe will be labeled A ,B,C according to its contents. . The drug syringes are handed over to anesthesiologists blinded to the patient allocation to carry out the spinal of anesthesia</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective :To compare the analgesic effect of intratechal  midazolam and ketamine as an additive to bupivacaine in patients  undergoing cesarean section . 
Methods:Following Ethics Committee approval and informed patients consent, Ninety patients 18-45 yr old ASA physical status I or II, scheduled for cesarean section under spinal anesthesia, were studied in a prospective, double-blinded, randomized way. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups of 30 each. The ketamine group (groupK) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 0.1 mg/kg ketamine preservative free ,the midazolam group (group M) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with0.02 mg/ kg midazolam and the placebo group (group P) received bupivacaine 10mg combined with 0.5ml distilled water intrathecally . Time to first requirement of analgesic supplement, Sensory block onset time, maximum sensory level , onset of motor block, duration of blockade, hemodynamics variables, the incidence of hypotension, ephedrine requirements, bradycardia ,hypoxemia [Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2)&lt;90], postoperative analgesic requirements and Adverse events, such as sedation, dizziness , Pruritus and postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded. Patients were instructed preoperatively in the use of the verbal rating scale (VRS) from 0 to 10 (0no pain, 10maximum imaginable pain) for pain assessment. If the VRS exceeded four and the patient requested a supplement analgesic, diclofenac Na supp 100 mg  was to be given for post-operative pain relief as needed . For breakthrough pain(VRS &gt;4) if time  of administration of diclofenac Na less than 8h,Pethidine 25 mg IV was given.</summary>
