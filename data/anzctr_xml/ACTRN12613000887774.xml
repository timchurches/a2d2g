  <interventions>
    <interventions>To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of different fixed dose combinations, under fasting conditions as follows:
- paracetamol 325 mg + ibuprofen 97.5 mg -
- paracetamol 650 mg + ibuprofen 195 mg
- paracetamol 975 mg + ibuprofen 292.5 mg

To describe the effect of food on the pharmacokinetic profile of paracetamol 975 mg + ibuprofen 292.5 mg

All drugs are administered orally, as single doses.

To evaluate safety and tolerability of the different doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen under fasting and fed conditions.
There will be a washout period of 7 days from the completion of dosing in one period to the start of the dosing in the next period.
Participants will be fasted for at least 10 hours overnight before dosing and for 4 hours post dosing. Participants will be provided with standard meals from 4 hours post dose.
Drug assays will be carried out using validated chromatographic methods developed specifically for the determination of paracetamol and ibuprofen.

Participants allocated to receive the treatment under fed conditions will receive 30 minutes before the administration of the study drug a standardised high-fat, high-calorie meal. No additional food will be allowed for at least 4 hours after dosing

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of Pharmacokinetic paramaters [Cmax, AUC, Tmax, T 1/2] of different doses of paracetamol and ibuprofen under fasting and fed conditions.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single dose study measuring plasma concentrations over 5, 15, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after study drug administration </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be evaluated during each study period, and for 7 days following study drug administration. 
An acute safety evaluation will be performed during each study period by recording spontaneously reported adverse events and by clinical assessments, including measurements of blood pressure and heart rate.
At screening and at the end of each study period an additional blood sample will be taken for haematology and biochemistry assessment.
Known NSAID adverse effects (i.e. GI ulceration, indigestion/stomach pain, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, water retention, renal failure, skin reactions and thromboembolic events), and known paracetamol adverse effects (i.e. clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity) will be compared between groups.
Adverse events will continue to be assessed up to 7 days after the last dose of the study medication by spontaneous reporting and at a final follow-up phone call.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be evaluated during each study period, and for 7 days following study drug administration. 
</timepoint>
