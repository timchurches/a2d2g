  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a 6 month translational style study with non-standard dietary advice given to the intervention group on only two occasions (baseline and 3 months) in the form of 2 x 30 min consultations with a nutritionist and take home information sheets.  The dietary advice will be to omit all salty snacks, sweets, cake and biscuits, pies and pasties and replace them with 2-3 pieces fruit/day or low fat dairy (e.g. yoghurts). Breakfast of cereal/toast will be replaced on 2 mornings per week with lean meat (e.g. steak or fish) and eggs. Lunch will be lean meat/fish/cheese/egg salad on 3 days per week with no bread/biscuits. Dinner will be lean meat- steaks or casserole/lean beef/chicken/fish with unlimited green vegetables and pumpkin.  Volunteers have the option of including small amounts of starchy carbohydrate in their main meal (rice/pasta/potato) for 1-2 meals per week.    

Weight loss may occur but is not a requirement or objective of the study. Results will be analysed taking into account any weight loss that occurs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Use of a control group who will receive standard care in the form of general healthy eating advice suitable for the general population.  This will be provided in the form of a pamphlet (Australian Guide to Healthy Eating) or as a book (Total Life Diet by Shamala Ratnesar), with volunteers randomised to receive either the pamphlet or book.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project aims to show by offering a relatively flexible and straightforward dietary regimen low in carbohydrate (replaced with protein and/or unsaturated fat) to poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients (HbA1c &gt;7.5%), HbA1c will be significantly reduced over a period of 6 months in the absence of weight loss.</summary>
