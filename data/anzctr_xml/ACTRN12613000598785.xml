  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non-invasive ventilation via a mask using the neural triggering available in the mode of NAVA. Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) is a recent highly innovative triggering design. NAVA uses an oesophageal probe which detects diaphragmatic electric activity. Diaphragmatic electric activity is the first physiological response in initiating a breath. By relying on diaphragmatic innervation the ventilator provides a timely response to patient effort that is not affected by air leaks around the face mask.  The child will remain on NIV+NAVA for as long as clinically indicated.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-invasive ventilation via a mask using standard flow/pressure triggers. NIV delivered through a standard positive pressure ventilator. These ventilators rely on the patient triggering a supported breath as measured by a drop in flow within the circuit or a decrease in pressure within the circuit. The child will remain on NIV for as long as clinically indicated.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>In 2010-11 we treated in total 177 patients with NIV, of which 77 received only NIV, 34 initially NIV and then failed and went on to be intubated and ventilated, and 66 were supported with NIV after extubation. The population identified for this study was 111 (77 NIV only-69%, and 34 NIV followed by intubation-31%). A reduction in intubation rate by 20% would results in an intubation rate of 8%, which equates to a confidence interval 95%. Enrollment should be feasible over a 3 year period with an anticipated 366 patients treated in our unit, hence being able to recruit for the study purpose 366 patients. Data will be expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and as median or mean and standard deviation for continuous variables. A Chi-squared test will be used with odds ratio and 95% confidence interval, For non-parametric data the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. The following subgroup comparisons are pre-planned as per the patient strata: different age groups (0-6mo, 7-24mo, &gt;24mo), cardiac versus respiratory group. All data will be managed using the SPSS (Version15) software. An ANOVA will also be conducted to compare the two groups and establish where statistically significant differences lie amongst the variables. In order to adjust for potential confounders, logistic multivariable regression will be performed with need for intubation as outcome, group allocation as a categorical variable, and potential confounders as covariables (age, sex, diagnostic group, PIM score etc). A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a mode of respiratory support is growing in poopularity and a number of studies have demonstrated it's benefit in both adults and children. Difficulties associated with NIV are largely attributed to leakage around the mask which adversely affects triggering and results in a time lag between patient effort and the ventilator's response. Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) uses an oesophageal probe which detects diaphragmatic innervation for every breath. This results in a much more timely co-ordination of ventilatory support.</summary>
