    <interventions>This is a prospective, doubled-masked, cross-over, randomised clinical trial where 55 participants will contralaterally wear contact lenses made from balafilcon A and senofilcon A material. The trial will be run in two sequential Parts of three randomised stages each, with each stage corresponding to one solution. All three stages in Part 1 of the trial will utilise plano contact lenses (i.e. contact lenses with no power) while all three stages in Part 2 will utilise power-matched lenses (i.e. contact lenses that have a participants power in them). Each stage will have two visits, both of which occur on the same day- dispensing of lenses and assessment after a period of lens wear. The period of wear is for stages in Part 1 will be 2 hours, and in Part 2 the period of wear will be 8 hours. New lenses will be used for each stage. Prior to use for any stage, lenses will be removed from packaging and stored in a standard, flat contact lens case (two wells, one well for each contact lens and capacity of each well approximately 5ml) and soaked overnight in either a PHMB-based new solution or PHMB-based commercially available solutions COMPLETE [Registered trade mark] Easy Rub [Registered trade mark] and renu [Registered trade mark] fresh [Trademark]. For any stage of any Part, solution will only be used to soak lenses overnight and no solution will be given to participants. There are six stages in total (two parts, three stages in each part) with participants to complete all stages. There is a minimum 24 hour wash-out period between stages.</interventions>
    <comparator>Commercially available solutions will be used as control in both Parts 1 and 2 (4 stages in total). Participants are to complete all six stages in this cross-over study (2 parts, three stages in each part)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare solution induced corneal staining rates of PHMB-based new solution after 2 and 8 hours of lens wear with COMPLETE [Registered trade mark] Easy Rub [Registered trade mark] and renu [Registered trade mark] fresh [Trademark], when used in conjunction with balafilcon A and senofilcon A contact lenses. Solution induced corneal staining is be defined as punctate staining in 4 out of 5 corneal areas.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>compare ocular comfort of PHMB-based new solution after 2 and 8 hours of lens wear with COMPLETE [Registered trade mark] Easy Rub [Registered trade mark] and renu [Registered trade mark] fresh [Trademark], when used in conjunction with balafilcon A and senofilcon A contact lenses. Ocular comfort will be determined by numeric rating scales.</outcome>

N.B.: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before study product is used;
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the study products;

-Pregnancy*; 

-The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.
*Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>
