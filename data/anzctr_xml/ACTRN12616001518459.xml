    <statisticalmethods>For the primary outcome we will use one-way ANCOVA to determine difference in activity levels between groups adjusting for covariates of age in all participants and stroke severity (NIHSS) in stroke patients only. We will determine the difference in activity levels for total activity and for the physical, social and cognitive activity domains. We will also determine total percentage time spent in different postural positions, location and people present with the participant. Consistent with previous research in this field, missing and unobserved data will be excluded from the statistical analysis for the primary outcome (Janssen, H., et al., An enriched environment increases activity in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation in a mixed rehabilitation unit: a pilot non-randomized controlled trial. Disabil Rehabil, 2014. 36(3): p. 255-62)

We will analyze percentage observed total, physical, social and cognitive activity shown in participants occupying single, two or multiple bedrooms while present in their hospital room pre and post transition. We will also determine percentage observed total, physical, social and cognitive activity shown in communal and outdoor areas pre and post transition.

Activity data from the accelerometer will be analyzed using the proprietary software or established algorithms for identifying outcome measures implemented in custom written software. This will consist of loading the raw data into the software and extracting the steps per day (Stepwatch) or arm movements (Actigraph), along with the duration of intervals per day in which no steps or arm movements are recorded. These data will then be averaged across the three days to obtain the average score per day for that patient.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rehabilitation is required for functional recovery from many acute illnesses such as stroke, orthopedic fractures and de-conditioning seen during extended hospitalization. Unfortunately, research into physical, social and cognitive activity of patients undergoing rehabilitation has shown that patients spend almost all of their time alone, inactive and disengaged. There is increasing interest in how changing the physical environment may improve activity levels, and therefore recovery, but it is currently unknown what impact changing design features such as single vs. multi- bedrooms and proximity to outdoor areas and communal spaces has on physical activity levels. The move to the new Kawana Hospital provides a unique opportuntity to examine this, and consequently this study will determine how changes in hospital design influences physical, social and cognitive activity levels of patients in Acute Stroke and Rehabilitation Units. 
This prospective observational study will examine the effects of the change in physical environment with transition to a new hospital by observing total activity levels using behavioral mapping and accelerometers in patients recovering in acute stroke and sub-acute rehabilitation units before and after transition. By embedding the use of advanced technologies such as Actigraph and Stepwatch accelerometers, and the building of collaborative networks with the University of the Sunshine Coast, our hospital and health service is set to lead the development of interventions that may guide national and international treatment guidelines.
