  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately twenty four adult subjects with HBeAg-negative, Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB) and who are currently receiving treatment with an Oral Antiviral (OAV) will be assigned to one of the 4 dosing groups below:
The first four subjects will be assigned to: 
Sentinel A: 2 subjects treated with single intravenous dose of nivolumab at 0.1 mg/kg on Day 1 of treatment and followed for 24 weeks after receiving nivolumab
Sentinel B: 2 subjects treated with single intravenous dose of nivolumab at 0.3 mg/kg on Day 1 of treatment and followed for 24 weeks after receiving nivolumab

Once safety is demonstrated in Sentinels A and B, a group of 10 subjects will be assigned to Cohort A and following completion of enrollment in this cohort, another group of 10 subjects will be assigned to Cohort B. 
Cohort A: 10 subjects treated with single dose of intravenous nivolumab at up to 0.3 mg/kg on Day 1 of treatment and followed for 24 weeks after receiving nivolumab

Cohort B: 10 subjects treated with subcutaneous injection of GS 4774 40 YU on Day 1 of treatment and subcutaneous injection of GS 4774 40 YU plus single intravenous dose of nivolumab at up to 0.3 mg/kg on Day 28 and followed for 24 weeks after receiving nivolumab

</interventions>
    <comparator>Active comparator: Biological Vaccine GS-4774. 
Depending on the treatment group you are assigned to, participants will receive subcutaneous injection of GS-4774 40 YU on Day 1 of treatment and Day 28

  <outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of nivolumab treatment with or without GS-4774 in adults with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B infection and currently on oral antivirals treatment.
As per the treatment group, participants will be assigned  to receive a single intravenous dose of nivolumab or a combination of dose of nivolumab and subcutaneous injections of GS-4774. All subjects will be followed for 24 weeks after receiving nivolumab
