  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 10 week group programme devised by mental health clinicians:
Taryn Lores - Psychologist - Course Facilitator - practicing Health psychologist
Kathryn Collins Psychologist - practicing clinical psychologist  Co-Director Psychology SA Health
Anne Burke Psychologist - practicing clinical psychologist - Co-Director Psychology SA Health
Dr Mike Musker - Senior Research Fellow and Registered Mental Health Nurse - Course Facilitator - 30 years experience in mental health nursing
Professor Julio Licinio - Psychiatrist - 30 years as a psychiatrist
The clinical team has developed a manual that will be facilitated by Dr Michael Musker and Taryn Lores, both experienced in providing group interventions.
The groups will be measured using standardised and validated clinical tools:  These assessments will occur prior, at the end of the groups i.e) after week 10 of the group; at 3 months, and 1 year after the interventions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Description of the study:
This project entitled Group psychological intervention for people with depression and overweight/obesity is a trial of a newly developed group intervention program for people with both depression and overweight concerns.
Purpose of the study:
The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new group protocol which has been developed specifically to target overweight concerns in people who are experiencing depression. The majority of current approaches for weight loss and weight management focus primarily on dieting and exercise, and while programs for depression often touch on these issues they are generally not the primary focus. Thus the newly developed program targets both problems simultaneously. The main aims are to find out if this will:
- Reduce depression
- Increase exercise and healthy eating habits
- Decrease unhealthy eating habits (such as emotional eating)
- Improve stress management
- Improve body image and self-confidence
- Result in healthy weight loss
To be clear, weight loss is not the sole or primary aim of this group program (but is likely to be a secondary outcome).
What will I be asked to do?
We invite you to participate in a trial of this new program. Participation involves attending ten weekly two-hour group sessions. Participation is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time. Groups will include between eight and twelve participants (ten being optimal), and will be facilitated by two mental health professionals. Sessions have been designed to be highly interactive  they will involve some teaching style presentations, but will mostly be made up of discussions, group exercises, and skills practice. In addition to work conducted in session, participants are expected to practice skills out of session also, to assist with learning and development (for example, monitoring thoughts and emotions, practising relaxation, setting and carrying out goals).
Participation in this trial also involves attending several appointments with one of the researchers outside of the program itself for the purpose of assessment and evaluation. The initial appointment held before starting the program will involve a brief face-to-face interview and completion of a number of questionnaires  this appointment is expected to take between 1 and 1.5 hours. The interview component focusses on your level of current depression; the written questionnaires assess other relevant information such as your current activity and eating habits, health beliefs, sleep, self-esteem and body image. This appointment will be repeated at the end of the program, as well as well as at three and twelve months post-program, to help us determine if the new protocol is helpful.
We understand that participation in this program involves considerable time commitment on your part.
What benefit will I gain from being involved in this study?
Our expectation is that by completing this program you are likely to learn new skills and strategies to improve</summary>
