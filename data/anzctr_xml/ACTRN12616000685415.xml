  <interventions>
    <interventions>We believe  that older  retirement village ('village') residents may  have multiple unmet need and high healthcare utilisation, and targeted intervention will decrease long term care  entry &amp; acute hospitalisation. We  will  evaluate an integrated care package to increase care coordination results for NZ. 
The trial will have three phases. Phase 1: Residents will complete a questionnaire about their health and functional items. The main purpose is to describe the health and functional needs of residents. Phase 2: All participants will be followed for three-six years from the survey date using Ministry of Health  routinely collected  data on healthcare usage. Survey interviews will be repeated at 12, 24 and 48 months. The main purpose of this phase is to describe trajectories of health-care service utilisation and identify resident clusters by baseline characteristics and trajectories. Phase 3 (randomised controlled trial) : Based on results from BRIGHT (ACTRN12609000648224) and ARCHIP (ACTRN12614000499684) study criteria we will select a sub-sample of residents (about 40%) at high risk of health and functional decline from phase 1s sample. A multidisciplinary team (MDT) led by gerontology nurse specialist (GNS) will (in the intervention group of residents) complete a comprehensive geriatric assessment develop/ implement an intervention plan  in collaboration with the older person &amp; their nominated support person(s), geriatrician, village staff, physiotherapist, occupational therapist &amp; clinical pharmacist (with standard clinical application of the STOPP/START criteria). This will necessitate an initial consultation with between the GNS and the older person and their nominated support person (if the older person desires) of approximately 1 hours' duration. Treatment goals will be developed, and the GNS &amp; MDT will record interventions in a computerized log and in the participant's hospital-based clinical record (with letters to the general practitioner). GNS will meet regularly with MDT: GPs will be invited to attend - if unable the GNS will liaise in writing and in-person. Intervention duration (not &lt;6 months - duration decided by GNS/MDT/GP by consensus and based on perception of clinical need -  this is likely to involve regular consultations between the GNS and the older person) approximately every 3 months (though this will vary from person to person) in order to monitor clinical progress - again with  record of consultation and recommended  interventions in a computerized log and in the participant's hospital-based clinical record (with letters to the general practitioner) will be person-specific  be  followed by open-ended clinical GNS support from the hospital based GNS service -  as dictated by standard clinical need. The General Practitioner will continue to have overall charge of the participant's care and will be free to accept/modify/reject MDT/GNS recommendations (as per ARCHIP). The intervention will be tested by cluster-RCT of usual care vs. intervention. The high risk intervention and control groups will have assessments repeated at the end of first and second years. </interventions>
    <comparator>Phase 1 and 2 (above) will have no control group (as these phases are observational only)

Phase 3 (randomised controlled trial): 'control' residents will receive best practice usual care. This comprises standard general practitioner care together with full access to secondary care referral and provision, including clinical appropriate Gerontology Nurse Practitioner assessment and support</comparator>

1o outcome (Phase 3) : acute hospitalisation assessed by time to event analysis (i.e. continuous time endpoints)   2o outcomes Phase 3): RAC admission or death, functional ability, QoL, assessed by time to event analysis. Power (Phase 3): Assuming 600 people are assessed high risk &amp; randomised: if the risk of &gt;1 acute hospitalisation is 26% p.a.   (guided by previous data from our own studies - Broad et al 2014; Broad et al, submitted March 2015; Boyd et al, in preparation) and risk of RAC entry or death is 15% p.a. (Heppenstall, et al 2015) and allowing for design effect of 1.5 (Connolly et al 2015b) this yields for example 93% power for 20% difference in hospitalisation (3yrs) &amp; for example 80% power for 30% difference in RAC admission or death (3yrs).  Further follow-up: 6 years - subject to separate grant application.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Retirement Villages (RVs) have, the the past 20 years or more become a very popular lifestyle choice for older people in New Zealand and elsewhere. On average RV residents are aged 75 years or more, but little is known about them as a group in terms of their medical and other needs and their functional abilities and disabilities, or about how these progress over time. This study aims to recruit 1500 older Auckland RV residents as volunteers, and by means of an interview and/or questionnaire, to gather such information about them. It also plans (with the volunteers;' permission) to 'follow' them over at least three years to see what happens to them in terms of their health, hospital admissions, moves to residential care (e.g rest homes) or mortality. The study will select approximately 600 of the 1500 residents for a research trial in which about half (i.e. about 300 people) will receive additional support (led buy a nurse specialist) to maintain their health and independence. The trial will examine whether this extra support helps reduce unfavorable 'events' such as hospital admissions.</summary>
