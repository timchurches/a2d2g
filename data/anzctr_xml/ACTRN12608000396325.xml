  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to compare the efficacy and safety of an oxytocin analogue and oxytocin in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage (massive bleeding after birth) in women undergoing vaginal delivery. Oxytocin and its analogue are drugs used to contract the uterus to prevent postpartum hemorrhage. We would like to compare the effect of the drugs to lower the need for additional intervention (additional massage or other uterotonic needed) in the prevention of PPH postpartum hemorrhage.</summary>
