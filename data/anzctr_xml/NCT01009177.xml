    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female patients 18 years of age or older

             (Therasse et al., J Natl Cancer Inst, 92(3): 205-16, 2000).

          3. Patients with prior radiation therapy (&gt; 30 days prior to study drug initiation) will

          5. Patients with cutaneous melanoma lesions must consent to having a biopsy obtained
             during the screening period and at the end of treatment for exploratory analysis of
             endothelin receptor expression. Biopsies obtained prior to the study that have been
             frozen in accordance with procedures specified for this protocol may be used.

          6. Any prior chemotherapy, biological therapy or immunotherapy for stage IV metastatic
             disease.

          7. Received immunotherapy &lt; 30 days before treatment start (completed adjuvant
