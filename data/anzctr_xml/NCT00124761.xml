  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Single presumed brain metastasis on contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan
             within two weeks before commencement of treatment.

          -  Systemic cancer diagnosed histologically or cytologically synchronous with, or within
             5 years of treatment of the presumed brain metastasis (other than non-melanoma skin
             cancer and cancer in-situ of the cervix, neither of which would be reasonably
             attributable as the primary site). Exception - melanoma diagnosed &gt; 5 years previously
             is allowable in view of the extremely variable natural history of melanoma.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 (no upper age limit).

          -  Considered suitable for both S and RS by the neurosurgeon and radiation oncologist
             (see exclusions).

          -  Patient must agree to adjuvant WBRT.

          -  RTOG RPA Class 1 or 2 (Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] &gt;= 70 after adequate trial
             of corticosteroids).

          -  RPA Class 3 patients (KPS &lt; 70) eligible if it is considered that the poor performance
             status is due primarily to the solitary metastasis, aggressive local treatment of
             which may be expected to restore good performance status. This would ordinarily be
             associated with minimal systemic disease burden.

          -  Accessible for treatment and follow-up.

          -  Patient is infertile or is aware of the risk of becoming pregnant or fathering
             children and will use adequate contraception.

          -  Written informed consent</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage />
    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Previous history of brain metastasis(es)

          -  Surgery indicated to relieve life-threatening raised intracranial pressure or excision
             required for tissue diagnosis (no extra-cranial site to biopsy ie unknown primary).
             However, prior diagnostic (non-excisional) biopsy is allowable - it is acknowledged
             that the 50% probability of a repeat surgical procedure on subsequent randomisation
             would not be acceptable to many patients and clinicians.

          -  Surgery contraindicated by site (e.g. thalamus, brain stem) or medical co-morbidities.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Primary is small cell lung cancer, germ cell tumour, lymphoma, leukaemia or myeloma.

          -  Prior cranial RT (including RS).

          -  Patient is pregnant.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines surgery versus radiosurgery (highly focussed radiation) for the treatment
      of cancer which has spread to one spot in the brain (solitary brain "metastasis"). For these
      two treatment options, it will compare patients' survival times, quality of life, control
      rate of the brain metastases and side effects. It uses the most rigorous scientific method
      available called "randomisation" which minimises biases that exist with other types of
      studies. It will involve 30 - 40 patients.</summary>
