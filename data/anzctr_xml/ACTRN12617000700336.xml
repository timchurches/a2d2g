    <interventions>Cohort 1 (CYP3A inhibitor): Voriconazole (VORI) 200 mg oral tablet (N = 25 for 23 evaluable) 
Cohort 2 (UGT inhibitor): Probenecid (PBC) 500 mg oral tablet (N = 25 for 23 evaluable)
Cohort 3 (CYP1A2/CYP3A inhibitor): Ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) 500 mg oral tablet (N = 25 for 23 evaluable)
Cohort 4 (CYP450/UGT Inducer): Rifampin (RIF) 600 mg oral tablet (N = 25 for 23 evaluable)

Following completion of screening and admission assessments (on Day -1), eligible subjects will be enrolled to a treatment in one of 4 cohorts. Cohorts may be run in parallel.
Within each cohort, study treatments will be administered starting on Day 1 as follows:
Treatment A: Single dose of GS-9688 1 mg oral tablet will be administered in the AM on Days 1 and 8.
Treatment B: VORI 200 mg twice daily (BID) will be administered for 2 days on Days 7 and 8. The single dose of GS-9688 1 mg oral tablet will be administered in the morning of Day 8 1 hour after VORI dose.
Treatment C: PBC 500 mg twice daily (BID) will be administered for 2 days on Days 7 and 8 with a single dose of GS-9688 1 mg oral tablet administered in the morning of Day 8 1 hour after PBC dose.
Treatment D: CIPRO 500 mg twice daily (BID) will be administered for 2 days on Days 7 and 8. The single dose of GS-9688 1 mg oral tablet will be administered in the morning of Day 8 1 hour after CIPRO dose.
Treatment E: Single dose of GS-9688 2 mg oral tablet will be administered in the AM on Day 1 and Day 8.
Treatment F: RIF 600 mg once a day (QD) administered in PM for 7 days (Days 2-8) with a single dose of GS-9688 2 mg oral tablet administered in AM of Days 2 to 8. The last dose of RIF will be administered in the PM on Day 8.

Cohort 1: Treatment A &amp; B
Cohort 2: Treatment A &amp; C
Cohort 3: Treatment A &amp; D
Cohort 4: Treatment E &amp; F

The investigator will maintain an accurate inventory of all study drug(s). Each dose of the study drug(s) administered at the study center will be administered by qualified study center staff. The dose of study drug(s) administered to subjects in the clinic under the supervision of staff will be accurately recorded, which indicates the date and quantity of each dosage formulation dispensed to individual subjects.
Used and unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, are to be returned to the shipping facility from which it came for destruction following drug accountability and drug inventory reconciliation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nonclinical data suggested GS-9688 human metabolism is mediated by a combination of glucuronidation by UGT2B7 and oxidation by multiple CYP enzymes including CYP1A2,
CYP3A, CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. GS-9688 was not found to be a substrate for P-gp, BCRP or OATP and is unlikely to be a clinically relevant inhibitor of these transporters in vivo. As such, the objective of this study is to increase understanding of in vivo disposition of GS-9688 in humans.

The probe inhibitors and inducers selected for the study are based on the recommendations of the FDA guidance entitled In Vivo Drug Metabolism/Drug Interaction Studies  Study Design, Data Analysis, and Recommendations for Dosing and Labeling (2011). Data from this study will inform the potential need for conducting additional drug interaction studies and/or on whether potential interactions are of the magnitude to be clinically meaningful and thus, necessitate a dosage adjustment and/or monitoring of GS-9688. 

Healthy volunteers are selected for this study to remove the confounding effects of background therapies and to avoid the need to make multiple, short-term changes in treatment regimens of HBV-infected patients for the purpose of examining pharmacokinetics.</summary>
