  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients for whom a CXR has been ordered to confirm or exclude pneumonia will be identified in the emergency department. The patient's doctor will be approached to determine exclusion criteria and then the parent/guardian will be approached for consent. The informed consent process will include provision of a plain language statement. Children &gt;12 years will be given the option to consent in addition to their parent/guardian.

A lung ultrasound will be performed within 12 hours of the CXR and these LUS findings will be recorded. The lung ultrasound will take approximately 10 minutes and will follow a protocol covering upper and lower zones of the anterior, lateral and posterior chest. Both sagittal/longitudinal and transverse/oblique views will be performed in all 6 lung zones of each hemithorax.

The treating doctor will complete a survey of the patient's clinical features as well as their interpretation of the CXR. From the patient's medical records the following information will be obtained: the radiologist's CXR report, the discharge diagnosis, whether the patient was admitted at their first visit and whether antibiotics were prescribed. A follow-up phone call will be performed 2-3 weeks after the lung ultrasound to determine patient outcomes: admission to hospital, the prescription of antibiotics and patient adherence, further CXRs performed, and further GP and ED attendances and the reasons for attendance. The follow up call will take less than 10 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound (index test) for the diagnosis of pneumonia will be measured in sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio. Chest X-ray will be the reference test against which lung ultrasound is compared. 

A lung ultrasound (LUS) scan will be positive for pneumonia if it has subpleural consolidation with air bronchograms in one or more lung views. This finding must be agreed upon by the sonographer and a blinded reviewer. Is there is disagreement, a final reading will be determined by an independent reviewer. 

A chest X-ray (CXR) reading will be provided by the treating clinician based on their standard practice. The CXR report will be positive for pneumonia if it is positive for any of consolidation, interstitial infiltrates or pleural effusion. A positive or negative reading of the CXR must be agreed upon by the treating emergency doctor and the radiologist's report. If there is disagreement, or if either reading is indeterminate, a final reading will be determined by an independent radiologist.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia will be measured in sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio, where a LUS is positive if it has subpleural consolidation &gt;1cm with air bronchograms in one or more lung views. This finding must be agreed upon by the sonographer and a blinded reviewer. If there is disagreement, a final reading will be determined by an independent reviewer.

      <outcome>The diagnostic accuracy of lung ultrasound for the diagnosis of pneumonia will be measured in sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio. 
LUS scans will be positive as defined in primary outcome [1] and will be included if &gt;75% complete and have a sagittal/longitudinal view for every lung zone.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The LUS and CXR features associated with CXR-positive/LUS-negative, CXR-positive/LUS-positive, CXR-negative/LUS-negative and CXR-negative/LUS-positive groups will be described.
LUS features will be described in terms of subpleural consolidation &gt;1cm, subpleural consolidation &lt;=1cm, air bronchograms, B lines, pleural line abnormalities and pleural effusion.
The CXR features will be described as consolidation, infiltrates and pleural effusion and whether any consolidation is perihilar.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The LUS features will be described for any patients who were not diagnosed with pneumonia by their treating doctor at the time of enrolment, but progress to pneumonia (diagnosed at re-attendance) or appear to progress to pneumonia. These patients will be identified by follow-up phone calls to parents/guardians. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 - 3 weeks after the LUS in the emergency department.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The inter-rater reliability of both LUS and CXR will be measured. For LUS, the kappa correlation statistic will measure the correlation between the LUS reading by the sonographer and the LUS reading provided by the reviewer, an emergency physician experienced in point-of-care ultrasound. 

A LUS will be considered positive for pneumonia if it has subpleural consolidation with air bronchograms in one or more lung views. For CXR, the kappa correlation statistic will measure the correlation between the CXR reading provided by the treating doctor and that of the attending radiologist's report. The treating doctor will provide their reading based on their standard practice. For the radiologist's report, a CXR will be positive for pneumonia if it is positive for any of consolidation, interstitial infiltrates or pleural effusion.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>All primary outcomes will be reported as sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios, each reported with a 95% confidence interval.
The secondary outcomes relating to LUS and CXR features will be descriptive in nature.
Kappa correlation statistics will be used to assess inter-rater reliability between novice sonographers and experienced reviewers for LUS; and between treating doctors' and radiologists' reports for CXR.
As this is a diagnostic accuracy study and not a randomised study comparing two study arms, a power calculation is not applicable. The sample size of 80-100 participants was determined by what was deemed feasible based on the number of CXRs performed over similar dates in 2015. In addition, the width of the 95% confidence interval found in similar studies with a similar sample size was considered. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are undertaking research into the use of ultrasound to diagnose pneumonia in children. Currently, doctors may order a chest X-ray if they are concerned a child has pneumonia. Studies that have looked into this in children and adults suggest that ultrasound of the lungs may be as good as chest X-ray at identifying pneumonia and it has the added advantage of being at the patients bedside and not exposing the child to radiation. 

We aim to perform a lung ultrasound on children in the emergency department who have had a chest X-ray ordered by their treating doctor. We will then compare the results of the X-ray and the ultrasound to see whether the ultrasound has similar findings. Lastly, we will perform a follow-up phone interview 2-3 weeks after each child has been discharged from the emergency department to document if they improved, whether or not they needed antibiotics, or subsequently needed to consult another doctor. 

We hope our study will provide support to the growing idea that lung ultrasound may is useful for diagnosing pneumonia. In addition, we hope that we may begin to understand when it would be a good idea for the child to still have a chest X-ray and when the findings of a lung ultrasound are sufficient. This information may guide future research into using lung ultrasound to diagnose pneumonia.
