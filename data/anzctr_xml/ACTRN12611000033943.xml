  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single arm study - Integrated preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy over 11 weeks. 

Treatment: drugs

Oxaliplatin (given intravenously): day 1 of each of weeks 1,  6 and 11 100mg/m2 given; day 1 of each of weeks weeks 3 and 8, 85 mg/m2 given.

Flurouracil: day 1 of each of weeks 1, 6 and 11 400mg/m2 bolus, given intravenously followed on day 1 by continuous infusion 2.4 g/m2,  over 46 hours; on days of radiotherapy during both weeks 3-5 and weeks 8-10  - continuous infusion 200mg/m2/day over 96 hours

Leucovorin (given intravenously): day 1 of each of weeks 1,  6 and 11 200mg/m2 given.

Bevacizumab (given intravenously): day 1 of each of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 - 5mg/kg 

Treatment: Other

Radiation Therapy: in both weeks 3-5 and weeks 8-10 25.2Gy in 14 fractions over 2 weeks and 4 days. A total of 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy per fraction is given. The first 45 Gy is given to the pelvic volume and the final 5.4 Gy is given to a boost volume.</interventions>
