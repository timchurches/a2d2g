    <concealment>Potential participants will be preliminarily screened via on-line form and then by telephone, then requested to attend an information and question session where they will be informed of the trial process and asked to provide their consent prior to further involvement in the trial. Consenting participants will have a case history taken and undergo a brief medical assessment. The blinded product is supplied to the clinic staff and they allocate participants with a labelled trial product in numerical order (between 1 and 150) as they are enrolled.

Randomisation will be performed by the sponsor using Random Allocation Software, version 1.0, May 2004. Randomisation will be based on a total of 150 subjects, randomly allocated into either Active 1, Active 2 or Placebo arm of equal numbers of subjects (n=50 for each group). </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preliminary scientific evidence suggests that Saffron (Crocus sativus) may have beneficial effects on the central nervous system (CNS), and have therapeutic applications for mood, anxiety, depression, insomnia, memory and as an anticonvulsant.

The aim of this study is to conduct a preliminary study of a Affron, a standardised extract of Crocus sativus (Saffron) for potential efficacy for mood and cognitive function in healthy adults.</summary>
