  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will participate in the acute crossover intervention. Once this is completed each participant will then be randomised to one of two intervention groups in a long-term parallel intervention trial, to be commenced immediately:

Acute crossover intervention: On day one participants will attend a clinic where they will be randomly assigned to consume either 600 ml of sugar-sweetened soft drink (600mL) or fruit (3 pieces) after an overnight fast. Between 2 and 5 days later (depending on the participant's availability) they will receive the other treatment.

Long-term parallel intervention: Each participant will be randomly allocated to consume an equivalent amount (isocaloric, equal fructose) of sugar-sweetened soft drink (1 L, provided by the trial investigators) or fruit (5 pieces, provided by the trial investigators) each day for 4 weeks</interventions>

    <concealment>Advertising material placed in local Dunedin newspapers, Facebook, University of Otago and Dunedin community notices, and Student Job Search will state that we seek approximately 40 volunteers who are interested in seeing what effects sugary drink and fruit consumption have on their health risks. Volunteers responding to advertisements will be invited to attend a screening appointment at the University of Otago Department of Human Nutrition clinic to establish eligibility to enter the study and collect baseline information. At the appointment the study protocol will be explained in detail and written consent will be obtained before proceeding further. Consenting volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of two treatment groups: 1) sugar-sweetened soft drink group, and 2) fruit group. Randomization will be undertaken by a third party away from the Human Nutrition department and will be stratified by sex. Neither participants nor investigators will be blinded to intervention groups as, given the nature of the intervention, it would be practically impossible to do so.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomized, parallel-designed, controlled trial to compare the long-term effects of consuming sugar-sweetened soft drink to the effects of consuming an equivalent amount (isocaloric, equal fructose) of fruit on serum uric acid and other risk factors for the metabolic syndrome in overweight individuals. Participants will be allocated to consume soft drink (1 L/d) or fruit (5 pieces/d) for 4 weeks. Metabolic risk factors will be measured at 0 and 4 weeks. Acute effects of soft drink (600 mL) and fruit intake (3 pieces) will also be measured using a crossover design</summary>
