  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised controlled trial will compare the effect of an 8-week well-being and performance enhancement program with a wait-list control group for Australian Para athletes with a physical impairments who are competing at a national level or above and aged 18 years and over. Athletes will be asked to complete pre and post intervention electronic questionnaires and semi-structured interviews in addition to completing the well-being program. The program will incorporate 8 x 1hr weekly face-to-face sessions with an investigator who holds a teacher-training certificate in Mindfulness, has been trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Motivational Interviewing, and has delivered Personal Excellence services to national and international athletes for over four years within a state institute of sport. 

The intervention will apply a Motivational Interviewing framework, a client-centred approach where the student investigator can use a number of strategies depending on the progress of the conversation with the athlete. Although the conversations with each athlete may be different, the underlying consistency with motivational interviewing will be maintained. Motivational interviewing is a collaborative conversation style for strengthening a persons own motivation and commitment to change. There are four key aspects underlying spirit of motivational interviewing, these are partnership, acceptance, compassion, and evocation. The key motivational interviewing strategies when addressing ambivalence about change are engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning. Motivational interviewing strategies will be incorporated during the assessment interview, and throughout the MAC program, to encourage change behaviour, and explore and resolve ambivalence about behaviour change, and discrepancies between belief and behaviour. Motivational interviewing employs the use of open questions, affirmations, reflections and summaries during the four key processes mentioned above.  As such, motivational interviewing will be used to provide participants with the choice to change, and the choice of what psycho-education tools provided within the MAC program to implement within their athletic careers. 

The MAC program is an integration and adaptation of Acceptance and Commitment therapy and Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for use with an athletic population. It promotes competitive (in the moment) self-regulation necessary for optimal competitive performance as well as the valued goal commitment necessary for quality practice, intense training, and long-term development of athletic skill. The MAC program also targets decision-making, problem-solving, and behavioural processes and flexibility. 

	The MAC program incorporates an assessment interview and seven modules -   

1.	Assessment interview
2.	Preparing the Client with Psychoeducation
3.	Introducing Mindfulness and Cognitive Defusion
4.	Introducing Values and Values-Driven Behaviour
5.	Introducing Acceptance
6.	Enhancing Commitment
7.	Skill Consolidation and PoiseCombining Mindfulness, Acceptance, and Commitment
8.	Maintaining and Enhancing Mindfulness, Acceptance, and Commitment.

Adherence to each of the 8 sessions will be monitored by the investigator, who will be meeting the participants face-to-face each week. If a participant cannot attend a session, the session will be rescheduled.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One primary outcome to be measured is perceived subjective well-being using the Scale of Positive and Negative Emotions (Diener et al., 2010) and The Satisfaction with Life Scale (Diener, Emmons, Larsen, &amp; Griffin, 1985).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (0 weeks) and directly after the intervention period (week 8). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A primary outcome to be measured is perceived psychological well-being using Ryffs Psychological Well-Being Scale (Ryff, 1989), and The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10; Campbell-Sills &amp; Steins, 2007).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (0 weeks) and directly after the intervention period (week 8). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will ask participants a small number of questions as part of the baseline assessment in order to assess social well-being within a sport context. For example, we would ask questions such as: 
1: Can you please tell me what social acceptance/actualization/contribution/coherence mean to you within your sport?
2: How do you feel you are travelling in each of these areas? 

Whereas the question at the conclusion of the RCT (directly after the intevention period; week 8) we would ask a small number of questions asking them to reflect on their well-being such as:

1: At the beginning of the program, you discussed how you perceived social well-being and the components of social acceptance/actualization/contribution/coherence and integration. Have any of these areas stayed the same, or changed for you, over the course of the well-being program?

    <statisticalmethods>The aim of this pilot study is to recruit 20 Para sport athletes (10 in the intervention group and 10 in the wait-list control group). As the study is a pilot study, participant numbers have been based off the number of Para sport athletes located in Melbourne competing at a National level and above as well as previous Mindfulness and Acceptance Commitment Therapy programs.

Data Analysis: SPSS statistical software will be used to analyse the data. The data will be checked for missing or out of range values and that the data is univariately normally distributed. Significant baseline demographic differences (sex, age, nature of impairment) will be determined using the independent t test and Fisher exact probability test, as appropriate. Basic descriptive statistics will be used to report the demographic data of the participants. 
Outcomes will be analysed using analysis of covariance on the change scores with the baseline measure of that variable used as the covariate. If the baseline variables are significantly different, they too will be entered as covariates. The mean difference within each group and the mean difference between the groups and the 95% CIs of the mean differences will also be calculated. Effect sizes and 95% CIs will also be calculated for the change scores. To avoid bias and to maximize the randomization process, intention to treat analysis will be used. 
Data from the post-intervention semi-structured interviews will be compared and analysed against the pre-intervention goals and interview using a thematic analysis and the software management tool NVivo (version 10).
