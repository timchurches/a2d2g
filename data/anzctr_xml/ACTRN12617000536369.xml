  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria: Patients will be screened by a clinical researcher at each site. Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they are: 
1) over 18 years of age, 
2) admitted to ICU/HDU for over 24 hours and expected to stay for another 24 hours,
3) alive on discharge from ICU,
4) assessed by the same physiotherapist within 24 hours of admission and discharge from ICU and there is at least 48 hours between the two assessments.

    <statisticalmethods>The median change in IMS associated with substantial, small and no change on the global rating of change will be compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. 
Distribution based methods used to calculated the MID will be the SEM and the effect size. The SEM is defined as s"1"v(1-r) , where s1 is the standard deviation at baseline (admission to ICU) and r is the test-retest reliability obtained from a previous study. One SEM closely approximates the MID. The effect size quantifies the amount of difference between two means on a unit less scale. A moderate effect size is considered clinically important and is calculated as 0.5 X standard deviation of the change scores from ICU admission to ICU discharge.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective multi-center study of adult patients admitted to intensive care (ICU) or high dependency unit's across Victoria. Ethical approval will be sort through The Alfred Hospital, Monash University and the individual ethics boards for each participating site. 
This study aims to use anchor and distribution based methods to establish the minimal important difference (MID) of the ICU mobility scale (IMS) in a critically ill population. 
Anchor based: Where patients are treated by the same clinician physiotherapist within 24 hours of admission and discharge to ICU they will be asked two questions on the final assessment. Has the patients mobility changed since admission to ICU? and If yes, how much have they changed?
The rate of change will be scored as: 1- almost the same, hardly better at all, 2- a little better, 3- somewhat better, 4- moderately better, 5- a good deal better, 6- a great deal better and 7- a very great deal better. Similar assessments will be made for deterioration, substituting worse for better11.  The IMS will also be independently collected at both time points by a clinical researcher. 
Distribution based: The patients IMS scores from ICU admission and discharge will be used to estimate the MID using two distribution based methods, the standard error of the mean and the effect size.
