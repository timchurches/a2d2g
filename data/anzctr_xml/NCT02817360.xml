  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker up-to maximal dosages
Other interventions - RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker none or at stable dose

Experimental: Intensive therapy - RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker up-to maximal dosages as permitted and tolerated and following national guidelines.

Other: Conventional therapy - No RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker or at stable dose as per study entrance. Changes in RAS-antagonist or beta-blocker therapy are not allowed in the control group during the study phase.


Treatment: drugs: RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker up-to maximal dosages
All patients have to be stable on their glucose lowering, lipid lowering and blood pressure lowering therapy at least for 3 months. RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker therapy at entrance is allowed. Patients receive a prescription and/or up-titration to maximum recommended or tolerated dose of RAS-antagonist and beta-blockers within three months of study entry. The Number of titration visits is up to the treating physician, but one visit should be performed at least at the end of titration.

Other interventions: RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker none or at stable dose
All patients have to be stable on their glucose lowering, lipid lowering and blood pressure lowering therapy at least for 3 months. RAS-antagonist and beta-blocker therapy at entrance is allowed. Changes in RAS-antagonist or beta-blocker therapy are not allowed in the control group during the study phase. If there is a vital indication for changes, this has to be argued and documented.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose and rationale The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of high dose
      Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)-antagonists and beta-blocker treatment for the primary
      prevention of cardiac events in a population of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      with no evidence of a preexisting cardiac disease. An additional aim is to demonstrate an
      interaction between concentrations of amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP as a surrogate of imminent cardiac risk) and treatment effects and the economic
      impact of the intervention overall and in the biomarker stratified subgroups.

      Primary objective Superiority of high dose treatment with RAS-antagonists and beta-blockers
      compared to conventional therapy regarding the reduction of unplanned hospitalization or
      death due to a cardiac event in T2DM patients with a NT-proBNP &gt; 125pg/ml.

      There is an additional eye-substudy for Viennese sites only. The purpose of this sub-study is
      to evaluate the effect of high dose RAS-antagonists and beta blocker treatment on early
      subclinical signs of diabetic micro-angiopathy and neuropathy. An additional aim will be the
      evaluation of the possible impact of the cardiovascular risk factor NT-proBNP on the onset
      and progression of diabetic retinopathy.</summary>
