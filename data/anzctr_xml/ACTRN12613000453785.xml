  <interventions>
    <interventions>1:1 supervised exercise intervention with pre- and post-testing. Minimum of 1 and maximum of 5, 60-minute exercise sessions per week.
1.	Participants in the 1:1 supervised exercise intervention will receive an exercise program incorporating aerobic, resistance, balance and flexibility training. The supervisors role is to provide guidance (e.g. exercise technique) and motivation for the participant.
2.	The total duration of the exercise intervention is 2 years, with follow-up testing at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. However after the first 8 weeks all participants have the choice of continuing in either the 1:1 supervised or unsupervised exercise group.
3.	Adherence to the exercise program will be encouraged through 1:1 supervision, with adherence being monitored with a log book detailing session attendance and exercises performed.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Exercise intervention with no direct supervision, and pre- and post-testing. Minimum of 1 and maximum of 5, 60-minute exercise sessions per week.
1.	Participants in the unsupervised group will perform the same exercise intervention as the 1:1 supervised participants, the only difference being they will not receive 1:1 guidance, only floor staff supervision.
2.	The total duration of the exercise intervention is 2 years, with follow-up testing at 8 weeks, 16 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months. However after the first 8 weeks all participants have the choice of continuing in either the 1:1 supervised or unsupervised exercise group.
3.	The unsupervised exercise group is the waitlist control group. This group will perform the initial 8 weeks without 1:1 supervision, after which they have the choice of changing into the 1:1 supervised exercise group or continuing in the unsupervised group.

    <statisticalmethods>The changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors and exercise adherence levels will be compared between interventions and over time using SPSS statistics version 18 computer software via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.
Power calculations were based on an expected small difference in change in fitness (effect size d=0.25) between the two groups. Similar effect sizes have been reported for quality of life outcomes following an exercise program. To achieve 80% power at an alpha level of 0.05 considering the repeated measures design with two groups, 98 participants are required. To account for potential attrition (up to 44% in workplace studies) a sample of 150 will be targeted for recruitment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of a workplace exercise intervention on cardiovascular disease risk, physical fitness and psychological health in adults aged 18-65 years working within an academic institution. It is hypothesised that adherence to a regular exercise program will result in decreased cardiovascular disease risk and increase physical fitness and psychological health.</summary>
