  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study consisted of 4 visits of approximately 1.5 hours and each visit was scheduled to take place at the same time of day.  There was a minimum of 2 days between study days 1 &amp; 2 and a minimum of 4 days with a maximum of 2 weeks between study days 2-4.  The minimum time in which a study was completed was 11 days, the maximum was 26 days, with an average of 16 days taken to complete a study.

Day 1: Subjects with a measured forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of at least 70% predicted received a challenge with inhaled mannitol.  The challenge ceased when a fall of 20% in FEV1 was achieved or 635 mg of mannitol was administered through a dry power inhaler (Osmohaler).  Subjects who recorded the 20% fall in FEV1 following the delivery of up to 315 mg were enrolled in the study.  They were given a randomisation number that determined the order of administration of either placebo sodium cromoglycate (SCG) &amp; placebo montelukast sodium (MS), SCG &amp; placebo MS, or SCG &amp; MS.  They were given a vial containing two tablets of either montelukast sodium (10 mg) or its placebo.  They were asked to take one tablet on the evening prior to their next study day, and a second tablet 3-5 hours prior to the study. 

On arrival at the laboratory on the subsequent study days FEV1 was measured in triplicate then SCG (2 x 20 mg) or a placebo administered by inhalation through a dry powder inhaler (Inhalator).  FEV1 was measured after 15 minutes then a challenge with mannitol followed, with the administration of the same dose that caused a 20% fall in FEV1 on the first day.  Subjects recovered from challenge spontaneously, and FEV1 was measured at 5 minutes and then every 10 minutes until 30 minutes.  If the FEV1 had not recovered to within 5% of baseline FEV1, 2 puffs (200 mcg) of salbutamol was administered and FEV1 monitored until it had recovered.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The protection provided by sodium cromoglycate, against airway narrowing provoked by mannitol, is incomplete. This is likely due to the failure of SCG to prevent release of leukotrienes from cells other than mast cells.  The protection against airway narrowing in response to mannitol will be more complete using a combination of SCG and a leukotriene antagonist.</summary>
