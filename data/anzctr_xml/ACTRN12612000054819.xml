      <timepoint>17 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the proportion of colonisations with respiratory pathogens that go on to symptomatic verified respiratory tract infections.  Colonisation detected by nasal swab sampled quantitiative RT-PCR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>17 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity (objective and subjective) of respiratory tract infections during the study.  Subjective severity of symptoms reported by Likert scale (0-5) for each symptom.  Objective severity by number and duration of symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>17 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean duration of respiratory tract infections during study. Duration defined as number of days from participant-reported symptom onset to sympton resolution, as reported in daily online questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>17 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of non-respiratory tract infections during study. Non-respiratory tract infections defined by non-respiratory symptoms reported by daily online survey lasting over a day and verified at exam by study nurse.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>-Persons who have used tobacco within the 6 months preceding study entry
-Persons who have used any vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) supplements or calcium supplements within the 3 months preceding study entry and/or persons who refuse to not start taking any such supplement during the study
-Persons using any immunomodulatory medication, diuretic medication, antiepileptic medication, or barbiturates.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible subjects will be scheduled for an initial session at which their allocation will be dispensed.  Neither the participant nor the investigator dispensing treatment allocation or the nurse evaluating participants for the presence of verified acute respiratory tract infections will be aware of the participant's treatment allocation until after the conclusion of the study.  Allocation concealment will be by numbering 32 containers and utilising a blocked randomisation computer program to distribute an equivalent number between intervention and placebo blocked on gender.  Only the external monitor will know which numbered containers contain intervention and which contain placebo.</concealment>
