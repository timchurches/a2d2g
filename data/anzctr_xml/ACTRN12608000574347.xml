  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be dosed once a week over a 4 week period and will receive each treatment regime.  Subjects will be randomised at their Period 1 Visit (Day 1) to receive either a single dose of 1.0g TPM/Diclofenac HS (high solvent), a single dose of 2.0g TPM/Diclofenac LS (low solvent) or the reference treatment, a single dose of 2.0g Voltaren Gel.  This single dose equates to an applied dose of 20mg of Diclofenace.  The single topical dose will be applied to the subjects back area at their Period 1 Visit (Day 1).  At the Period 2 Visit (Day 8) subjects will have been randomally allocated to receive either  a single dose of 1g TPM/Diclofenac HS (high solvent), a single dose of 2.0g TPM/Diclofenac LS (low solvent) or the reference treatment, a single dose of 2.0g Voltaren Gel.  This single dose equates to an applied dose of 20mg of Diclofenace.  This treatment will be an alternate treatment to the treatment they received at their Period 1 Visit. Subjects will receive a single topical dose to their back area at their Period 2 Visit (Day 8). At the Period 3 Visit (Day 15) subjects will have been randomally allocated to receive either a single dose of 1.0g TPM/Diclofenac HS (high solvent), a single dose of 2.0g TPM/Diclofenac LS (low solvent) or the reference treatment, a single dose of 2.0g Voltaren Gel.  This single dose equates to an applied dose of 20mg of Diclofenace.  This treatment will be an alternate treatment to the treatments they received at their Period 1 and 2 Visits.  Subjects will receive a single topical dose  to their back area at their Period 3 Visit (Day 15). Therefore over Periods 1, 2 and 3 Visits subjects will have received a single dose of all three treatments TPM/Diclofenac HS (high solvent), TPM/Diclofenac LS (low solvent) and the reference treatment Voltaren Gel in a randomised cross-over design. At the Period 4 Visit (Day 22) subjects will receive all three treatments TPM/Diclofenac HS (high solvent), TPM/Diclofenac LS (low solvent) and the reference treatment Voltaren Gel simultaneously to 3 different areas of their back on this Visit 22 study day. Approximately 31.25mg of TPM/Diclofenac HS Gel will be applied topically to the first area of the the subject's back, approximatley 62.5mg of TPM/Diclofenac LS Gel will be applied topically to the second area of the subject's back and 62.5mg of the reference treatment Voltaren Gel will be applied topically to the third area of the subject's back.  This equates to a total applied dose of 2.5mg of diclofenac for each formulation (7.5mg total).</interventions>
    <comparator>The Reference Treatment is Voltaren Gel.  Subject's will receive a single topical 2.0g dose of Voltaren Gel at either Period 1 (Day 1), Period 2 (Day 8) or Period 3 (Day 15) of the study.  This equates to an applied dose of 20mg of Diclofenac.  They will be randomised to receive a single dose of this reference treatment at one of the 3 visits over this 3 week period in a open label, randomised cross-over design.  At the Period 4 Visit (Day 22) subject's will receive a single topical application of 62.5mg Voltaren Gel applied to the third area of the subject's back.  This equates to a total applied dose of 2.5mg.</comparator>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tolerability of TPM/Diclofenac HS and TPM/Diclofenac LS compared with Voltaren Gel.  Clinical trial staff will monitor each participant for adverse events during the trial.  All adverse events reported between commencement of study treatment and follow-up will be recorded in the Adverse Event Source Document.  An adverse event is any untoward medical event experienced by a subject during the course of a clinical trial whether or not it is related to the investigational product.  Examples of an adverse event may be a headache or a rash.  The Principal Investigator or delegate will review each adverse event and will determine the 'relationship to treatment' classifying it as either not related, possible, probable or definite. For example a rash at the treatment site that developed after dosing would be determined to be definitely related to treatment.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the penetration of Diclofenac with the penetration enhancer Tocopheryl Phosphate Mix (TPM) across intact skin against a currently marketed treatment Voltaren Gel.
For the first visit you will be randomly allocated to receive a topical application of one of TPM/Diclofenac HS, TPM/Diclofenac LS or Voltaren Gel applied to your back.  At the second visit you will receive a topical application of another one of TPM/Diclofenac HS, TPM/Diclofenac LS or Voltaren Gel, different to the treatment you received at the first visit.  At the third visit you will receive a topical application of the other one of TPM/Diclofenac HS, TPM/Diclofenac LS or Voltaren Gel, different to the treatments you received at the first and second visits.  At the fourth visit, you will receive all three treatments and undergo a procedure called skin stripping to evaluate how well Diclofenac penetrates the skin.  For each of the visits you will stay at the study centre for approximately 6 hours after the gel has been applied.
You will then be required to return to the study centre for approximately 1 hour for a follow up visit.  Blood samples will be collected in visits 1, 2 and 3 (8 samples per visit) by either cannula or venipuncture.  A total of 192 mL of blood will be collected during the study, which includes the amount required for the clinical laboratory tests and for the measurement of Diclofenac in your blood.</summary>
