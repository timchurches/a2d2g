  <interventions>
    <interventions>PBT2 is supplied as 250mg immediate-release capsules. The dose for this study is 250mg / day ie. one capsule is to be taken orally, once a day for 52 weeks duration. 
Information on compliance will be collected via a Diary Card and accountability of drug returns. It is also the role of the Study Partner to over-see the daily taking of study drug. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase II Extension study to examine the safety, tolerability and effect of 52 weeks treatment with PBT2 in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). The primary objectives are to examine the safety and tolerability and the effect of PBT2 on the amount of amyloid in patients brains after 52 weeks of treatment when measured by a particular type of brain scan, PiB-Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The effects of PBT2 on brain volume, brain metabolic activity, blood biomarkers of AD and cognition plus functional abilities will also be investigated.</summary>
