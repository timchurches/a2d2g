          -  Body temperature &gt;38.1°C (100.6°F) or acute illness within 3 days prior to inoculation
             (subject may be rescheduled).

          -  Intention to travel out of the area prior to the study visit on Day 56.

          -  Seropositive to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV or positive for hepatitis B (HBV)
             (antigen).

          -  Lactation or intended pregnancy in female subjects.

          -  Excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse, significant psychiatric illness.

          -  A known or suspected physiological or structural condition that compromises the
             integrity of the blood-brain barrier (e.g., significant hypertensive cerebrovascular
             disease, trauma, ischemia, infection, inflammation of the brain).

        For long-term immunogenicity follow-up period:

          -  History of Yellow Fever or out of study JE vaccination or known flavivirus infection
             since receiving ChimeriVax-JE vaccination on Day 0 or Day 28 (during double-blind
             treatment period of the study). Yellow Fever/JE vaccination or flavivirus infection
             will be determined by history (interview of subject) and/or by reviewing the subject's
             medical records. Please note subjects who were flavivirus positive at Day 0 will be
             allowed to enrol on the study.

          -  Participation in another JE clinical study.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and duration
      of immunity of one or two doses of ChimeriVax-JE vaccine separated by 5 or 6 months in
      adults.

      Objectives:

      Safety:

        -  Obtain safety and tolerability data of a single, fixed dose of ChimeriVax-JE compared
           with a placebo in adult volunteers (= 18 to &lt;55 years) without prior Japanese
           encephalitis (JE) vaccination.

      Immunogenicity:

        -  Obtain data on the antibody response in adult volunteers following administration of
           ChimeriVax-JE

        -  Assess the durability of the immune response in adult volunteers over 60 months
           following one or two doses of ChimeriVax-JE.</summary>
