    <concealment>Potential participants will be recruited from advertisement at the the Murdoch University campus.  
	
Individuals interested in study participation will contact one of co-investigators and be scheduled for an appointment.  At that time, the potential participants will complete a screening questionnaire to identify their status on all selection criteria. Eligible individuals will be provided with a research ethics information letter and consent form and be provided with the opportunity to have any questions or concerns addressed by a study co-investigator.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>This study will use a pretest-posttest within subjects design involving repeated measures in the post-intervention period.  Measures of pulmonary function will be obtained at baseline and repeated at 1 minute, 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 30 minutes following the manual therapy intervention.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine for differences in pulmonary function before and after the application of manual therapy to the thoracic spine and thorax (i.e., chest wall).  We hypothesize that pulmonary function will improve following the application of manual therapy and that the improvement will be sustained throughout the post-intervention period.</summary>
