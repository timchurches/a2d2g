    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Isavuconazole
Treatment: drugs - Voriconazole

Experimental: Isavuconazole - Participants received a loading dose of isavuconazole, 200 mg three times a day by intravenous infusion (IV) for the first 2 days followed by a maintenance dose from Day 3 of 200 mg once daily either IV or orally until they reached a treatment endpoint or for a maximum of 84 days.

Active Comparator: Voriconazole - Participants received a loading dose of voriconazole, 6 mg/kg every 12 hours IV for the first 24 hours, followed by a maintenance dose of 4 mg/kg every 12 hours by IV on Day 2. Beginning on Day 3, participants received 4 mg/kg every 12 hours by IV or 200 mg every 12 hours orally, until they reached a treatment endpoint or for a maximum of 84 days.


Treatment: drugs: Isavuconazole
Loading doses were administered as IV infusion and maintenance doses were administered as IV infusion or oral (capsules).

Treatment: drugs: Voriconazole
Loading doses were administered as IV infusion and maintenance doses were administered as IV infusion or oral (capsules).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All-cause Mortality Through Day 42 - All-cause mortality is represented as the percentage of participants who died after first dose of study drug through Day 42 from any cause. Participants with unknown survival status through Day 42 were included as deaths in the calculation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Through Day 42</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Outcome of Success Evaluated by the Data Review Committee (DRC) - The DRC was an independent, blinded committee consisting of experts in the field of infectious disease who assessed patients' outcomes. The overall response was based on the DRC-assessed clinical, mycological and radiological responses.
Success was defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings, the eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline and a &gt; 50% improvement in radiological response from Baseline (or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or End of Treatment if it occurred prior to Day 42).
End of treatment (EOT) is the last day of study drug administration. For the Day 42 and Day 84 analyses, any visits that the DRC assessed as Not Done were considered a failure for that visit. A death before Day 42 was also considered a failure, even if the DRC assessed the participant to be a success prior to death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All-cause Mortality Through Day 84 - All-cause mortality is represented as the percentage of participants who died after first dose of study drug through Day 84 from any cause.

      <timepoint>Through Day 84</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Outcome of Success Evaluated by Investigator - Overall response based on investigators' assessments was not derived as it was not deemed necessary because participants overall response status was determined by the DRC. All investigators' assessments of clinical, mycological and radiological responses are analyzed separately (see Outcome Measures 8-10).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response Assessed by the DRC - Blinded assessments of clinical symptoms and physical findings of invasive fungal disease were performed by the independent DRC.
Clinical response is defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings. Failure is defined as no resolution of any attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings and/or worsening. Participants with no attributable signs and symptoms present at Baseline and no symptoms attributable to invasive fungal disease (IFD) developed post-baseline were classified as "Not Applicable." End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Mycological Response Assessed by the DRC - Blinded mycological assessments of the participant's invasive fungal disease status were performed by the independent DRC using the results from fungal culture and isolation and/or histology/cytology of biopsy or biological fluid samples from the infected site.
Mycological response is defined as eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline. Failure was defined as persistence or presumed persistence. Participants with no mycological evidence available at Baseline were classified as "Not Applicable".
End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Radiological Response Assessed by the DRC - Independent reviews of radiology assessments were completed by radiology experts which were provided to the independent, blinded DRC. Blinded radiological assessments were performed by the DRC.
Radiological response is defined as a = 50% improvement from Baseline, or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or if end of treatment occurred before Day 42. Participants without any radiology at Baseline were considered "Not Applicable." End of Treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response Assessed by the Investigator - Assessment of clinical symptoms and physical findings of invasive fungal disease were performed by the investigator.
Clinical response is defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings. Failure is defined as no resolution of any attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings and/or worsening, or if results were unavailable or the participant was unevaluable. Participants with no attributable signs and symptoms present at Baseline were classified as "Not Applicable." End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</timepoint>

Mycological response is defined as eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline. Failure was defined as persistence or presumed persistence. Participants with no mycological evidence available at Baseline, or no mycological follow-up results available or indeterminate results were classified as "Not Applicable".
End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Radiological Response Assessed by the Investigator - Radiological assessments were performed by the investigator. Radiological response is defined as a = 50% improvement from Baseline, or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or if end of treatment occurred before Day 42. Failure is defined as a &lt; 25% improvement at any time or results not available. Participants with no signs on radiological images at Baseline were considered "Not Applicable." End of Treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</outcome>
