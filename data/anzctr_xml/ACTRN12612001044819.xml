  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating whether a diagnostic technique, known as PET scanning, can provide early assessment of response to chemotherapy/targeted therapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged above 18 years who has been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, for which you plan to undergo palliative chemotherapy or tumour targeted therapy.

Trial details
All participants in this trial will undergo a positron emission tomography (PET) scan pre and post their first cycle of chemotherapy/targeted therapy. A PET scan involves injection of a small amount of radioactive tracer into the bloodstream followed by scanning of the whole body in a machine that looks similar to a CT scan machine for approximately 30 minutes.

In addition, participants will undergo standard care, which involves CT scanning after 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy.

This study will help us to determine whether PET scanning can accurately assess early response after 1 cycle of chemotherapy/tumour targeted therapy for advanced breast cancer rather than after 3 or 4 cycles required with conventional CT scanning.</summary>
