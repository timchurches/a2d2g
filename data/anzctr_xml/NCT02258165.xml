Advanced ovarian cancer - gated PET/CT imaging


Treatment: devices: PET/CT
PET/CT (without respiratory gating) is performed on an ad-hoc basis in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in the lead up to surgery. The sensitivity of PET/CT for detecting low volume pleural disease is likely reduced by respiratory motion during the ten minute acquisition time over the chest. By "freezing" this respiratory motion with respiratory gating, we hope that gated PET/CT detection of pleural metastases will improve over non-gated PET images.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be the first prospective study enrolling consecutive patients with advanced
      ovarian cancer to determine the prevalence of thoracic and extra-abdominal involvement in
      this patient group and the relative value of gated PET and CT for diagnosing extra-abdominal
      involvement. This study will also answer a number of other stil unanswered questions: the
      impact of gating and the impact of gated PET on clinical management of patients with advanced
      ovarian cancer. This study also individualises patients' treatment to allow patients who may
      benefit most form optimal surgical cytoreduction and those who are better treated by
      neoadjuvant</summary>
