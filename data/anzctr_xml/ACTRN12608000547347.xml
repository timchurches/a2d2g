  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a preliminary study to test methodology for a large intervention trial  to be conducted later. This study aims to determine whether participants can be adequately blinded in a study where decaffeinated coffee and caffeinated coffee are the intervention and control conditions. In this study, participants will be randomized to receive either caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee, and be provided with enough coffee for a week. Participants will be asked to replace their regular coffee with the study coffee for one week, and refrain from consuming any other forms of caffeine (tea, cola, chocolate etc). They will not be told which coffee they are drinking, and, at various times throughout the week, they will be asked to guess what coffee they are drinking.</summary>
