  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electrical acupuncture will be applied to the arms and legs.  During the treatment, electrical current delivered with a battery-operated eletrical stimulator is combined with acupuncture needle techniques to enhance stimulation of the acupuncture points. Each treatment session takes 25 to 30 minutes. The treatment will be given twice a week for four weeks followed by once a week for two weeks then once every two weeks for four weeks.  In total, 12 sessions are delivered within 10 weeks.

Participants in this group will also receive pain and medication management (i.e., standard care).</interventions>
    <comparator>Conotrol arm 1: Sham electroacupuncture control. 
This group will receive similar treatment to that delivered to the real electroacupuncture group. Each session takes 25 to 30 minutes. In total, 12 sessions of treatment are delivered within 10 weeks.
 
Participants in this group will also receive pain and medication management (i.e., standard care).

Control arm 2: Standard care control (pain and medication management)
This group will receive pain and medication management for 10 weeks without electroacupuncture treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our primary hypothesis is that electroacupuncture (EA), as a supplementary therapy to stardard care, that is pain medication management (PMM), can effectively reduce the use of opioid medications (OMs) in the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP).

About the problem: Seventeen (17%) to 20% of Australians suffer from chronic pain, with the majority of them having CMP. Moderate to severe CMP has been increasingly managed with OM. In Australia, in 1999, 13% of chronic pain patients were using some type of OMs. Since then, the consumption of some OMs has increased by 5 to 40 times.
About the use of OMs: Although short-term benefit of OMs for CMP has been demonstrated, its long-term use is a problem. Studies have shown that chronic pain patients who are on long-term OMs, experience more severe pain, poorer quality of life, and are more likely to have adopted passive pain coping strategies. Thus, effective measures that reduce the OM use and OM related adverse effects are urgently needed. 
About EA and its benefit: Animal and human studies have shown that EA not only increases the release of endogenous opioids, but also help our body to use opioid medications more efficiently. Our pilot study (Zheng et al, EJP, 2008) demonstrated that real EA, when combined with PMM, reduced the OM consumption more effectively than sham EA did. The proposed research will employ an adequate sample size with an additional no-EA group to determine the benefit and safety of EA for the reduction of OM consumption by subjects with CMP.</summary>
