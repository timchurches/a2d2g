  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention to be evaluated in this proposal will involve provision of access to improved water and sanitation and improving related hygiene practices, which will be supported by WaterAid, Australia (WA). The sanitation component is based on the Community Led Total Sanitation approach with WA giving technical support to the construction of latrines. Furthermore, WA staff will lead the construction of piped water from springs/streams to storage tanks/tapstands in villages; and local partner NGOs will promote hand washing with soap. The hygiene intervention will be based on 2-3 visits to each village shortly after the triggering takes place, to promote hand washing with soap using several methods including a hygiene promotion film, establishing a children group and developing a hygiene promotion drama, and a female group. Monitoring visits will happen monthly until the completion of the water intervention and every 6 months for 2 years after the water infrastructure is completed.
All communities (control and intervention arm) will receive mass chemotherapy with one oral tablet of albendazole 400mg every six months for 2 years, starting when 80% of the households have sanitation. Albendazole intake will be directly observed by the field workers delivering the pills who will be working under the supervision of a registered nurse.
Questionnaires including questions on access to water, sanitation and hygiene practices will be used to monitor the progression of the implementation of the integration; and will be part of field work at each 6 monthly visit. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were for the primary outcome  Using A. lumbricoides as an example, given an assumed baseline prevalence of 60% and a reduction in prevalence at the 6-month follow-up of 25% in the control group (albendazole chemotherapy only), we estimate a control-group prevalence of 45%. Using data from a recent national helminth survey in the Philippines (Leonardo et al., unpublished), we estimate an intracluster correlation coefficient for prevalence of A. lumbricoides of 0.19. We have assumed a fixed population size in each village; 150 people, of whom 120 participate with a subsequent 10% loss to follow-up. To determine whether the community-based hygiene and sanitation programme results in a 50% reduction of the follow-up prevalence compared to the control group (i.e., to 22.5%), with a power of 80% and a=0.05, we would need to include 12 villages in each of the intervention and control arms. Similar results were obtained for the other STH. Thus, we will enrol 2,880 people, located in 24 villages, randomised 1:1 between the intervention and control arms.
Primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated and compared across both arms of the trial using mixed effects multivariate regression models that account for clustering of participants in villages.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are most prevalent in communities lacking adequate clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Deworming programmes with anthelminthic drugs are highly effective in reducing morbidity but rapid reinfection occurs if there is no reduction in environmental contamination with infective stages, impeding the sustainability of STH control programmes based on deworming alone. 
WASH for WORMS is a cluster randomised controlled trial assessing the impact of a community-based WASH intervention, implemented by WaterAid Australia, on infection with intestinal parasites following mass albendazole chemotherapy in villages in Timor-Leste. 
This research will test the hypothesis that a community-based hygiene and sanitation programme will reduce infections of people in communities with gastro-intestinal parasites above that achieved through mass chemotherapy with the benzamidazole anthelminthic drug albendazole.
The aims of this study are:
1.	To determine the effectiveness of an established community-based hygiene and sanitation programme in reducing the prevalence of parasitic infection (with hookworm, roundworm, whipworm and gastro-intestinal protozoa) following mass albendazole chemotherapy in rural villages in Timor-Leste.
2.	To determine the reduction in parasitic disease-related morbidity in children, including anaemia, and stunting and wasting, achieved by implementation of the community-based hygiene and sanitation programme.
3.	To evaluate the acceptability and uptake of the community-based hygiene and sanitation programme.</summary>
