  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label three-arm phase 2 trial (including a Simon stage 2 design) consisting
      of 90 stage III melanoma patients randomized 1:1:1 to receive either 2 courses 3 mg/kg
      ipilimumab + 1 mg/kg nivolumab every 3 weeks (Arm A), 2 courses 1 mg/kg ipilimumab + 3 mg/kg
      nivolumab every 3 weeks (Arm B), or 2 courses ipilimumab 3 mg/kg, directly followed by 2
      courses nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Arm C). All three treatment arms are applied prior
      to surgery at week 6, 30 patients per arm. Patients will be stratified according to treatment
      center. An interim analysis will be performed after 13 patients have been included in each
      arm, thus in total 39 patients have been included.</summary>
