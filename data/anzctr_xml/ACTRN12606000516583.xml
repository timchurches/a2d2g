The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of daily use (twice a day at anytime) of a food product for a period of one year among HIV positive patients.  The study will be carried out in approximately 10 countries and approximately 800 patients will participate.  Half of the patients will receive the active food product and half will receive the control food product.                                                                                            The food product consists of a mix of ingredients, including special proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and fibres.                                                                                                                                                         Daily intake for the food products is as follows; Total fat 7.25g, Total protein 16.3g, Total carbohydrates 44.6g and oligosaccharides (soluble fibres) 15.0 g.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control product is comprised of standard protein, carbohydrate and fatty acid sources to match the caloric intake of the active product.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of the food product (NR100157 - product code number) on immunological status as measured by CD4+ T-cell count (a specific T-cell lymphocte count).</outcome>
      <timepoint>CD4+ T-cell count will be measured at baseline and at approximately every 13 weeks to see if the food product improves immunological status, as determined by a decrease in CD4+ T-cell count .</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effect of the food product (NR100157 - product code number) on: immune markers other than CD4+ T-cell count; viral load (HIV-1 RNA), weight, growth factors, study product compiance, study product appreciation, gastrointestinal tolerance, safety.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments will be made at baseline and at approximately every 13 weeks.  The primary study parameter will be a change from baseline.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Numico Research has developed a food product which is available as a food bar and as a food powder that can be dissolved in water.  The food product consists of a mix of ingredients, including special proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and fibres.  The special balance of these ingredients in the food product is expected to have a beneficial effect on the immune system.  The purpose of the study is to determine the effect of the daily use of this food product for a period of one year among HIV positive adults.  If the study results are favourable, the food product can be developed further to support the treatment of HIV positive patients.</summary>
