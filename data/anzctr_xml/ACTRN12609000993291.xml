    <healthcondition>Examination of effect of leg position on accessibility of femoral vein for femoral venous access</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>For each patient, the femoral vessels will be visualised using a vascular ultrasound probe with the leg in the neutral position and then with the leg externally rotated. Measurements will be made only once with the leg in each of these positions. This procedure will take approximately 10 minutes</interventions>

    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Diameter of femoral vein in each position.
Measurements will be made in real time. That is, the size and overlap over the vessels will be measured as soon as the leg has been placed in the selected position. The process of obtaining the ultrasound image takes 1-2 minutes but once the image is obtained, the measurements are made immediately on the frozen image.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately upon obtaining a clear image of the femoral vein and artery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of overlap by femoral artery in each leg position. Both a) the total diameter  of the vein and b) the diameter of the vein lying medial to the artery (ie not overlapped by the femoral artery) are measured in millimetres. The proportion of overlap is 1- (b/a).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate - as above, the measurement is taken as soon as a clear image is obtained.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
