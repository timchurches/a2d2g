  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ABBV-428
Treatment: drugs - Nivolumab

Experimental: Arm 1 - ABBV-428 will be administered at escalating dose levels in 28-day dosing cycles (2 doses per cycle).

Experimental: Arm 2 - ABBV-428 plus nivolumab.

Experimental: Arm A, B, and C - Additional participants (with ovarian cancer, NSCLC, etc.) will be enrolled in a dose expansion cohorts that will further evaluate ABBV-428.

Experimental: Arm D - Additional participants with NSCLC will be enrolled in an expansion cohort that will further evaluate ABBV-428 plus nivolumab.


Treatment: drugs: ABBV-428
ABBV-428 will be administered by intravenous infusion in 28-day dosing cycles on Day 1 and Day 15.

Treatment: drugs: Nivolumab
Nivolumab will be administered by intravenous infusion according to approved dose and dosing schedules.
