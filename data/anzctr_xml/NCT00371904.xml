          6. Subjects with a positive ABO crossmatch with donor

          7. Subjects with severe diarrhoea or other gastrointestinal disorders that might
             interfere with the ability to absorb oral medication and is unlikely to resolve prior
             to randomisation

          8. Subjects participating in another interventional clinical trial or requiring treatment
             with un-marketed investigational drugs or who would be expected to require other

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>About one third of prospective kidney transplant recipients have antibodies in their blood
      directed against the tissues of their only available kidney donor. Recently,
      "desensitisation" treatments when administered pre-transplant have allowed successful
      transplantation of these patients despite high rates of acute antibody mediated rejection
      (AAMR). The investigators propose to test in a randomised controlled trial whether rituximab,
      a monoclonal antibody that depletes B-lymphocytes, will safely lower antibody mediated
      rejection (AMR) rates when added to "standard" therapy. The investigators will also test
      whether rituximab enables more patients to achieve a negative crossmatch against their donor
      and thereby allow more transplants to proceed.</summary>
