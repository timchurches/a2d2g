  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients on Hemodialysis more than 3 months will be asked regarding any complaining of pruritus and if present then detail history and examination regarding the pruritus(like character, distribution, scar mark, itching mark, xerosis present or not, etc) and it's any relation with laboratory parameters (like haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes, iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, total protein, PTH, Alkaline Phosphatase and glucose.)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> The frequency of pruritus in hemodialysis patients and relationship with different clinical and laboratory parameters.
 
 The patients' symptoms will be recorded before a mid-week HD session and a blood sample will be collected. The following laboratory tests will be performed: haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, reticulocytes, iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, albumin, total protein, PTH, Alkaline Phosphatase and glucose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>- It's a cross sectional observational study.
- Including pstient who are on hemodialysis for more than 3 months. </timepoint>

-	 Patients who have had significant alteration in their dialysis regimen within the 2 weeks prior to Screening (or those for whom such changes are anticipated during the study) are excluded. A "significant alteration" is defined as:
	A change in the type of hemodialysis filter;
	An increase or decrease in total duration of dialysis prescribed of &gt; 1 hour/week;
	A change in the site or type of venous access for dialysis;
	An increase or decrease in prescribed blood flow of &gt;100 mL/min;
	Patients who are unwilling to comply with the study protocol. </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pruritus is one of the most bothersome symptoms in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD), however little progress is seen in our understanding of its pathogenesis. The percentage of HD patients suffering from pruritus reportedly is higher than 50%.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of pruritus in HD patients and to correlate its presence and intensity with relevant clinical and laboratory parameters.</summary>
