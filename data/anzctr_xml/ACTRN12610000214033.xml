  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of an online intervention for socially disadvantaged children and adolescents with a chronic respiratory illness, to improve health-related outcomes, including psychological and social well-being.  This is the first time an Australian sample has been used. Problem-solving paradigm was used, because children and adolescents with a chronic health condition often engage in risky behaviours due to poor problem-solving skills.  Our aim is to provide them with a better way to solve problems relating to their condition and further expanding to other areas of their lives.</summary>
