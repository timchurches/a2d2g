  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 2 and 3- Complete Metabolic Response - Complete metabolic response (CMR) as determined by central radiographic assessment of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans using the Lugano Classification</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 70 days after initiating blinatumomab.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 3- Complete Metabolic Response - Complete metabolic response (CMR) as determined by central radiographic assessment of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans using the Lugano Classification</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 84 days after initiating IC chemotherapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 3 - Overall Survival - Overall Survival (OS): calculated as the time from the date of randomization until death due to any cause. Subjects who are alive at the date that triggers the analysis will be censored at the date last known to be alive. If the date last known to be alive is after the date that triggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the analysis trigger date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 26 months</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 2 Objective Response Rate - Objective Response Rate ORR; Complete Metabolic Response Rate + Partial Metabolic Response Rate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 30 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 2 Progression-Free Survival - Progression-free survival (PFS): calculated as the time from start of blinatumomab until the date of diagnosis of progression of lymphoma, or date of death, whichever is earliest. Subjects who are alive and did not have progression will be censored at the last date of tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Approximately 30 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phase 2 Duration of Response - Duration of response (DOR): calculated only for subjects who achieve an objective response rate (ORR.) The duration will be calculated from the date a response, complete metabolic response (CMR) or partial metabolic response (PMR), is first achieved until the earliest date of a disease assessment indicating a relapse event or death, whichever occurs first. Subjects who do not 2 Years have a relapse event will be censored on their last disease assessment date. If the last disease assessment date is after the date that triggers the analysis, the subject will be censored at the analysis trigger date. A sensitivity analysis will censor subjects who receive a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at the time of HSCT unless there is no assessment after the HSCT, in which case the last assessment prior to the HSCT will be used as the censoring time.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a phase 2/3 open label, multicenter trial testing blinatumomab monotherapy for the
      treatment of subjects with Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after
      2 cycles of standard platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study
      incorporates multiple interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size
      re-estimation. In the phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to
      Investigator's Choice chemotherapy.</summary>
