  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will be given either zinc tablets -20mg/tablet or placebo tablets daily for 3 months. This supplement will be delivered orally in tablet form.
Subjects will have two separate visits to the CSIRO Clinic of 30 minutes duration each on day 0 and day 90, end of intervention. Following a baseline visit they will be randomised to consume a placebo or a 20 mg Zinc tablet for 3 months. The visits will 12 weeks apart. At each visit, volunteers will provide blood and buccal cell sample.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo tablets will be the control treatment and identical in appearance to the active tablets and only contain maltodextrin. Volunteers will be given either zinc tablets 20mg/tablet or placebo tablets daily for 3 months. This supplement will be delivered orally in tablet form.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood collected will be isolated for lymphocytes to provide a means of measurement for genetic damage. Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) damage in lymphocytes can be assessed using Cytokinesis Block Micronucleus Cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay which is a reliable and comprehensive method to evaluate DNA damage, cytostasis and cytotoxicity events in lymphocytes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 0 baseline and day 90,end of intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will utilize buccal cells as a non-invasive method to measure DNA damage by performing Buccal Micronucleus Cytome (BM-Cyt) assay. Buccal cells collected from consented participants will be used to prepare microscope slides to investigate genomic instability, cell proliferation and cell death parameters as previously described.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mild zinc deficiency has been reported in general aging populations due to numerous factors as previously reported by the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Steering Committee. Zinc deficiency may cause impaired immunity, increased DNA damage, delayed wound healing, depression, impaired cognitive function and increased oxidative stress. As zinc deficiency can affect the health of ageing individuals, it is important to maintain an adequate zinc status within this population. To date, there is no data available on the benefits of zinc supplementation in an ageing Australian population.The findings of this research may provide knowledge on the effect of zinc supplementation in an elderly population in relation to DNA health (i.e. prevention of DNA damage). We believe there is a strong likelihood that these outcomes will be achieved by this study. Study hypotheses is zinc supplementation increases zinc status, reduces DNA damage and improves cell growth in both lymphocytes and buccal cells in elderly individuals.</summary>
