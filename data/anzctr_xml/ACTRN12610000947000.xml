    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be contacted via phone or email to confirm availability as well as under a phone screening checklist which covers major inclusion/exclusion criteria. Following confirmation of their tentative eligibility, participants will be sent a participant information sheet and an appointment sheet detailing when their first screening appointment will take place via email or post. 
At the beginning of the screening appointment, the attending researcher will brief the participant on the details of the trial, run through the Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and ask if they have any questions. Following this informed consent will be obtained from the participant before continuing with the screening process. The screening procedure will involve a physical examination by a medically trained professional and if the participant is over 50 years of age they will be required to undergo a blood test. Blood samples will be taken and analysed at a Douglas Hanley Moir pathology laboratory. Any significant abnormality on any of the laboratory tests as judged by a medically trained professional will preclude participation in the trial. 
Once full eligilbility has been confirmed participants will be given an identification number. This number is not randomly assigned to participants however each number has already been randomly assigned to either the initial intervention or placebo group via a computer randomisation package conducted externally to the research team by a Research Program Coordinator within CompleMED.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aging population in Australia is growing and associated age-related cognitive impairment is also increasing. Cognitive impairment however is not limited to the domain of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and can affect otherwise healthy individuals. Current treatment interventions for healthy individuals with cognitive impairment are somewhat limited, however Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) typically uses various combinations of herbal products to treat illnesses and improve the quality of life in both healthy and pathological populations. The CHM formulation, Wei-Nao-Kang (WNK), consisting of extracts from Panax ginseng, Ginkgo biloba and Crocus sativus. These herbs are amongst some of the most widely used plant based medicinal products currently available on the market today. Each of these herbs has either shown, or been implicated in, cognitive and cardiovascular enhancing effects when administered individually in healthy and/or pathological populations. Although early evidence exists to demonstrate that the ginseng/ginkgo combination has synergistic effects on cognitive functions, very few studies have investigated the combined effects of these herbal products. 
This study aims to determine the possible cognitive and cardiovascular benefits of the WNK formulation in a cohort of healthy volunteers to further expand on the body of research surrounding this CHM formulation.
This study will employ a randomised, placebo controlled, double-blinded crossover design spanning a period of three weeks. Fifteen (22-75 years) healthy volunteers will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive treatments of WNK formulation or placebo over two weeks with a 10 day washout period between each week. Participants will be tested before and after each of the interventions to assess their cognitive and cardiovascular changes. The primary outcome measure is the Comppas test battery, which assesses various domains of cognitive function. Secondary outcome measures include an electroencephalography (EEG) recording while being exposed to a visual stimulus paradigm designed to elicit event related potentials (ERP), and cardiovascular measurements including pulse velocity waveforms and electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. 
Once the trial is completed, participants will be debriefed and asked to complete a short survey for confirmation of compliance and successful blinding. Following this, results from the Compass, EEG, pulse velocity waveforms and ECG will be analysed and prepared for publication.</summary>
