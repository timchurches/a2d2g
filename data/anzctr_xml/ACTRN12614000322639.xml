  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two fibre rich breads were baked. One bread contained 15 g/serve (two slices) of FibreMax (New Image International, Auckland, New Zealand). The other bread contained 15 g per serve of a prototype fiber extracted from a fruit product manufactured by Anagenix (Petone, New Zealand). Participants were randomized to one of the breads. The two slices of bread were consumed following a fasting period of at least 3 hours.
Participants were also randomized to order of consumption of their fibre-enriched bread or of a control bread without added fibre. The fibre bread and the control bread were consumed with a two week separation between clinic visits.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two control breads without added fibre were made. The two control breads had the same ingredients except that the control bread for the fruit product fiber bread was coloured with a food colouring to enable blinding of the investigators and participants.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postprandial blood glucose concentrations using capillary blood obtained by fingerprick. Blood glucose concentrations will be measured using a Hemocue instrument checked each morning of use with a manufacturers control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within the two hours following consumption at 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety assessed using paper-based visual analogue scales and food models</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within the three hours following consumption at thirty minute intervals</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake of a subsequent meal measured by providing an excess of pasta, weighing the leftovers and calculating the amount eaten by difference. The energy content of the pasta meal is known.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three hours after eating</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal discomfort assessed with a series of questions relating to discomfort using a previously published questionnaire (Bovenschen et al. Dig Dis Sci 2000;51:1509-15) with some modification to make it specific to symptoms that may be experienced with high intakes of fibre</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within twenty four hours following consumption at 1, 2, 3, 8 and 24 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Palatability assessed with a visual analogue scale questionnaire based on that published by Flint et al (Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord 2000;24(1):38-48) with some modification including additional questions on texture and aftertaste.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate response after eating</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were allocated to a fiber bread and to an order of consumption (treatment or control bread) using a computer generated random number list. The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation was concealed in that the breads had been colour coded such that the only the baker had knowledge of which bread corresponded to which colour code. The investigation team, including the person who allocated treatment, were unaware.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Two week washout between treatments. Testing of fiber and control bread was done on the same day of the week but two weeks apart.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Multivariate general least square regression for random effects for blood glucose area under the curve; and satiety under the curve; and cumulative energy intake. Wilcoxon rank tests for immediate satiety response and return to hunger response. Pearson's chi-square test or Fishers exact test for comparing palatability.
A total of 31 participants per treatment group would be required to detect a 20% difference in glucose IAUC, with 80% power and a two sided a of 0.05. A 20% difference in postprandial glycaemia has clinical relevance.
A total of 34 participants per treatment group would be required to detect a 10% difference in energy intake, with 80% power and a two sided a of 0.05. A 10% difference in energy intake may have long term benefits of clinical significance.
35 participants sufficiently powered to detect a 10% difference (10mm on the visual analogue scale) at a power level of 0.8. A 10mm difference on the scale is considered sufficient to indicate a lower level of hunger.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fibre intakes in developed countries are generally below those recommended by relevant authorities. Given that many people consume fibre-depleted refined-grain products, adding functional fibre will help to increase fibre intakes. The objective of the study was to determine metabolic and sensory effects of adding fibre to bread. </summary>
