  <interventions>
    <interventions>1)The patients were classified into two groups: 
one group, patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Clinical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) consensus conference criteria, 
other group, patients being treated with a non-sepsis disease in ICU.
2)Blood samples were taken at three time intervals: the time of origin (defined as the day of sepsis diagnosis), 24 hours after diagnosis, and 48 hours after diagnosis.
3)APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) and SOFA (Sepsis Related Organ Failure Score) scores were recorded at three time intervals: the time of origin (defined as the day of sepsis diagnosis), 24 hours after diagnosis, and 48 hours after diagnosis.</interventions>
    <comparator>During study, it was elected from patients who treated with a non-sepsis reason in ICU and ventilated mechanically.
blood samples were taken at the same periods and were recorded mortality scores.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose: Bilirubin has been shown to influence the mechanisms of both apoptosis and inflammation. We investigated the association of bilirubin with sepsis progression.
Materials and Methods: Twenty patients from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were recruited for this study. Patients were divided into two groups: patients diagnosed with sepsis according to the ACCP/SCCM consensus conference criteria (n=10) and patients treated for various other diagnoses (n=10). Blood samples were collected for both groups at the time of origin (defined as the time of diagnosis), and 24 and 48 hours after diagnosis. Serum IL-6, IL-10 and bilirubin levels were analyzed and compared. APACHE II and SOFA scores of the patients were also recorded.
Results: At all time intervals, serum IL-6, IL-10, and total, direct, and indirect bilirubin were significantly higher in the sepsis group (p&lt;0.05); APACHE II and SOFA scores were also significantly higher. Both SOFA scores and serum IL-10 levels were positively correlated with bilirubin levels 24 hours after diagnosis (p&lt;0.05, r=-0.76). 
Conclusion: Although levels of bilirubin and other associated parameters were higher for the sepsis group, only SOFA score and bilirubin levels were correlated. Because bilirubin is already a SOFA parameter, this correlation was not considered clinically significant.</summary>
