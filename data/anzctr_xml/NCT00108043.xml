  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective:

      The objective of this research is to undertake a safety and viability study of FES-evoked
      stepping in individuals with paraplegia. The rationale for this objective is based upon the
      need to clarify whether physiological limitations, especially orthostatic intolerance, limit
      functional mobility outcomes. The cardiovascular, autonomic, and muscle metabolic factors
      governing orthostatic tolerance during skin-surface FES stepping will be investigated, since
      this functional task forms the basis of upright mobility and engenders strong physiological
      challenges upon key regulatory processes in the SCI (spinal cord injury) patient.

      Specific Hypotheses:

      i. Reduction of blood pressure will be greater during FES-evoked stepping than during passive
      stepping; ii. Reduction of blood pressure will be greater during FES-evoked stepping with no
      upper body component versus FES-stepping with an upper body component; iii. Blood pressure
      will be reduced even further during FES-evoked stepping following a 6-week
      progressive-intensity gait training intervention.</summary>
