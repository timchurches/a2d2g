  <interventions>
    <interventions>Consented participants will be provided with a brochure prior to their donation which provides advice on how to replenish iron stores after a whole blood donation. The information is provided at each eligible visit during the study period. 
Adherence and acceptability will be monitored using a specifically designed questionnaire at 6 weeks after the recruitment visit and again 6 weeks after the 11-13 month visit if the donor attends at this time. 

Donors are provided with a study contact number to assist with any queries that may arise after they leave the donor centre.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 220-250 mg of iron is lost with each 470 mL whole blood donation. This may result in progressive iron deficiency, ultimately leading to iron deficiency anaemia and deferral at a subsequent attendance. This study will pilot an education program for high risk donors on how to replenish iron stores after donation.  The study will evaluate operational feasibility, donor acceptance and efficacy of this program. </summary>
