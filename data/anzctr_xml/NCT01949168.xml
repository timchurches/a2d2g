  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of Boceprevir-based therapy
      for the treatment of genotype 6 chronic hepatitis C infection.

      Boceprevir has recently been approved for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C
      infection. Recent in vitro studies suggest similar efficacy against genotype 6 chronic
      hepatitis C infection.

      The investigators therefore hypothesise that:

      i) Boceprevir is a potent inhibitor of genotype 6 hepatitis C replication in vivo.

      ii) Boceprevir in combination with pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin for 24 weeks will
      cure a high proportion of patients chronically infected with genotype 6 chronic hepatitis C
      infection.</summary>
