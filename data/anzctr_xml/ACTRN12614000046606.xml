  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves 4 sessions: a single screening session (lasting up to 1 hour) and 3 experimental sessions (1 x 4 hour, 2 x 3 hour). Each experimental session will be spaced one week apart.

During the initial screening session all participants will be screened for cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), screened for any contraindications to the medications, and will be assessed for parkinsonian symptoms using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS, section 3). A blood sample for dopaminergic genotyping will be obtained from all participants. 

Measures of impulsivity will be obtained using the Baratt Impulsiveness Scale (BSI-11), and depression using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). 

Each participant will complete three experimental sessions: one session will be conducted after oral administration of domperidone (20mg) and 1 hour later oral administration of 0.5 mg of ropinirole, another after administration of 20mg domperidone and an hour later oral administration of 1.0 mg of ropinirole, and the third after administration of 20mg domperidone and an hour later oral administration of a placebo (dextrin) in a counterbalanced placebo-controlled double-blind design. During the first experimental session researchers will administer both the domperidone and ropinirole/placebo, so an additional hour is required between domperidone and ropinirole/placebo administration for this session. If no adverse reactions are seen, the participant will take domperidone themselves 1 hour before the second and third sessions, so these sessions begin with ropinirole/placebo administration and take 1 hour less (3 hours).

During each experimental session, the participants will complete the Central Nervous System Vital Signs (CNSVS) cognitive test battery, as well as performing cognitive (BART) and motor (Response Inhibition) computer-based impulse control tasks. Data collection will begin 1 hour after dosing of ropinirole, as this is when ropinirole reaches maximum plasma concentration and produces prominent effects in the central nervous system.

Each individual's dopamine gene score will be calculated from recording polymorphisms within the genes coding for the dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptors, dopamine transporter and catechol-O-methyltransferase. Higher dopamine gene scores reflect greater levels of dopamine neurotransmission.</interventions>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation to group is not applicable - each participant will receive ropinirole and placebo. During each of the three experimental sessions, each participant will receive either 0.5 mg ropinirole, 1.0 mg ropinirole or placebo (dextrin). Allocation of drug or placebo will be done in a counterbalanced double-blind design. The researchers responsible for medication/placebo allocation will not be involved in data collection. The experimenter will choose from 3 pills labelled A, B or C for each session. </concealment>
    <sequence>There are 6 possible orders in which each participant can take the two doses of ropinirole and the single placebo. A random number generator will be used to select a discrete number from 1-6 for each participant when they are recruited, until there are a maximum of 10 participants for each order.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>60 participants will be recruited but it is assumed 50 will be included in the final analysis. Sample size accounts for drop out (about 8 people, 15 %) due to some participants being unable to adequately complete the response inhibition task or medication intolerance. We also require a sufficient sample size to capture the range of dopaminergic genotypes. E.g. For the COMT gene, in Caucasian populations, about 50% of the population are heterozygous (val/met), roughly 28% are homozygous for the met allele (met/met) and the remaining 22% are homozygous for the val allele (val/val). Furthermore, the frequency of the single nucleotide polymorphisms in the D2 (rs1800497) and D3 (rs6280) receptor genes in Caucasian populations is about 10 and 35 %, respectively. 

A mixed effects regression model will be used to explore associations between an individuals cognitive and motor measures of impulse control and dopamine gene score. We will model each impulse control measure (stop signal reaction time, number of balloon pumps) as a function of medication status (ropinirole vs placebo), weighted gene score and their interaction. Age, gender, weight and MoCA score will be controlled for by inclusion in the model as covariates. The effect on combined cognitive and motor measures of impulse control (reflected as an average z score) will also be modeled. an ANOVA will assess for a dose effect of ropinirole on cognitive and motor impulse control measures. Simple linear regression will be used to determine associations between impulse control measures and i) Baratt Impulsiveness and ii) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium of genotypes will be assessed using Chi squared tests. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dopamine agonist medications are commonly prescribed to alleviate Parkinsons disease symptoms and avoid some of the problems associated with levodopa medication. However, about one in five  patients (20 %) prescribed dopamine agonist medications for Parkinsons disease develop impulse control disorders. This project will evaluate tests to measure impulse control. We propose that when such measures are combined with information about a persons dopamine gene profile, this knowledge can be used to identify individuals at risk of an adverse response to dopamine agonist medication. This could lead to better individualised treatment of Parkinsons disease.</summary>

    <publicnotes>This mechanistic study is designed to investigate the effect of ropinirole and dopaminergic genotype on measures of impulse control with a large sample of healthy older adults. We plan to conduct a subsequent second, smaller study with Pd patients to determine the feasibility of using measures of impulse control and dopaminergic genotype to predict ICDs on dopamine agonist medication.</publicnotes>
