  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group completed the 8-week self-management education program that included specific exercises with instruction tailored for OA of the knee.  Self-management aims to motivate people to undertake the changes in behaviour necessary to improve their lives. For some people that may involve moving from a very sedentary lifestyle to one of mild activity (and hopefully progressing to more activity). Another person may already have a very active lifestyle involving a lot of aerobic activity, but little else. They may be motivated to include strengthening and/or balance exercises to their regimen. 

Within each group of participants there will be a wide spread and it is up to the individual to decide what they consider to be important enough to model (copy) from the program. The information that is given throughout the course is based on principles of exercise, with demonstrations given throughout so that participants clearly understand what type of exercise involves what type of activity- to clarify, they will understand the difference between balance, strengthening, aerobic and flexibility exercise and the implications of each. 

This program is NOT an exercise class. It does not go into a gym, or a hydrotherapy pool etc, however the principles of different types of exercise are certainly part of the program. Since it is not an exercise class, though exercise is a component of it (and participants may choose to try new exercises as part of their weekly goal setting), along with pain management, use of analgesia, medications, dealing with negative emotions- our outcome measures reflect quality of life, pain, and function.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Pre-made cards will be placed each in a sealed, opaque envelope. These will then be placed in an enclosed box. After a subject has signed informed consent, the box will be opened and an envelope containing a randomisation card will be chosen by a third party to determine which treatment the subject will receive.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated to groups using simple randomisation procedures such as coin tossing</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Those who volunteer for the study will be randomised to an immediate start (intervention group) or a delayed start 6 months later (control group). Group participants will be aware of which group they have been randomised to. The physiotherapists doing assessments for outcome measures will be unaware of group allocation of participants.  For ethical reasons those volunteers randomised to the control group will be offered the program at the conclusion of the 6 month study</designfeatures>
