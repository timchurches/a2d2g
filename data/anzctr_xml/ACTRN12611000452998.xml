  <interventions>
    <interventions>Home Medicine Review - a service provided by specifically trained pharmacists on request from a patient's GP. Following GP referral, the patient's community pharmacist selects an accredited pharmacist to complete the review and passes on the referral. The accredited pharmacist visits the patient, preferably in their home and discusses their current methods for managing their medication. From this visit, the accredited pharmacist compiles a report for the GP, detailing the patient's actual list of medications at their home and how they were taking them as well as any recommendations for improvement of the medication regimen. In this trial we will be using acute coronary syndrome as a referral trigger for this process. This process should occur at or near two months post-discharge. In this trial the accredited pharmacists completing the reviews will be given additional training and a brief assessment quiz on evidence-based management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and how to include this into an ACS-specific home medicine review.  If an accredited pharmacist is not available or not willing to undertake the education then a study pharmacist who has also undergone the training package will complete the review.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard/usual care that is given post-discharge to all patients admited for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes.  This often includes specialist cardiology appointments and cardiac rehabilitation.  Patient adherence to standard/usual care may vary significantly.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients taking all four classes of Australian National Heart Foundation guideline-recommended medications at six and twelve months post-discharge from an acute coronary syndrome hospital admission. The four medication classes include: antithrombotics (aspirin/clopidogrel/prasugrel); ACE inhibitors or ARB's; beta blockers; statins. The Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) assessed by collecting community pharmacy dispensing records will be the primary measure for this outcome with an MPR of 80 to 120% accepted as the adherence cut-offs. The Morisky Questionnaire will be the secondary measure if MPR recrods are incomplete.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six and twelve months post-discharge for an acute coronary syndrome hospital admission.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>median number of hospital admissions.  Assessed by scheduled checking of the hospital inpatient management system.  This is a statewide system and hence will allow the assessment of all patients from one site.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months post-discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>median length of hospital stay in days per readmission. Assessed by scheduled checking of the hospital inpatient management system.  This is a statewide system and hence will allow the assessment of all patients from one site.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seattle Angina Questionnaire as a cardiac-specific quality of life measure and the Euroqol EQ5D and as general health quality of life measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 and 12 months post-discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All-cause mortality</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months post-discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac Rehabilitation completion rates. Cardiac rehabilitation rates will be assessed by checking administrative records for the two cardiac rehabilitation programmes at the two trial sites.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months post-discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking cessation rates. Smoking cessation rates will be assessed by questionnaire (Do you smoke cigarettes? Yes/No) and nicotine dependence is assessed as a part of this using the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 and 12 months post-discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
