  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a study evaluating the agreement between point-of-care HbA1c analysis when compared to laboratory analysis. ICU patients with known diabetes will have a capillary and arterial blood sample tested on a point -of-care HbA1c analyzer (Siemens DCA Vantage Analyzer). The same arterial sample will be sent to a central labratory for HbA1c analysis. In the case where an arterial sample is not available, a venous sample will be used.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two tests of HbA1c analysis will be compared to determine agreement. Therefore, the control is the standard of care, which is the use of an arterial sample for laboratory analysis of HbA1c in ICU.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the agreement between point-of-care and laboratory HbA1c testing in critically ill patients with diabetes. Agreement between measures will be analysed by Lins concordance correlation coefficient with Bland-Altman plots including 95% confidence limits of agreement. References 1 and 2.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Point-of-care HbA1c testing in the intensive care setting may be advantageous for patients with diabetes who are admitted to ICU  because including rapid availability of the result may guide insulin therapy. This may be of particular benefit for patients with poor glycemic control that are at a greater risk of hypoglycemic complications. However the accuracy of the HbA1c point of care testing has not been validated in the critically ill.</summary>
