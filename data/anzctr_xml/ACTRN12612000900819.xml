  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional package:

At baseline:
a. One counselling session on the safe use of medications and lifestyle education.
(This will be an individual counselling session with a trained pharmacist which will take about 30 minutes)
b. Osteoporosis risk assessment using the tool Osteoporosis Screening Tool for Asians(OSTA). 
(The osteoporosis risk of the patients will be assessed only at baseline by the pharmacist using the OSTA which utilizes a simple calculation using the age and weight of the patients. This will take about 5 minutes.) 
c. Recommendation by pharmacist for Bone Mineral Density(BMD) scan as necessary.
d. Assessment of knowledge using the knowledge tool Osteoporosis Prevention Awareness Assessment Tool(OPAAT).
(OPAAT is a close ended questionaire that will be administered to the patients. This will take about 15 minutes.)
e. Recommendation by pharmacist for referral to the osteoporosis clinic as necessary.

First follow up  phone (one month later):
a. Assessment of knowledge (OPAAT)
b. Assessment of satisfaction using the Satisfaction Questionaire for Osteoporosis Prevention(SQOP)
(SQOP is a close ended questionaire that will be administered to patient. This will take about 10 minutes)

Second follow up via phone(three months later):
To assess if patients attended the osteoporosis clinic
To assess if patients were started on osteoporosis medication</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoporosis is a preventable disease that causes bone loss increasing the risk for fractures. The World Health Organization provides that the worldwide projection of hip fractures cases due to osteoporosis will raise from 1.7 million in 1990 to 6.3 million by 2050 with a steep increase to be observed in developing countries.The needs of patients with osteoporosis may not be addressed as this disease is usually asymptomatic in its early stages. Hence, women who may have osteoporosis remained unidentified leading to possible unwanted fractures. Fractures are complications of untreated osteoporosis incurring a considerable amount of cost, and an increase in probability of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, prevention measures and screening which aid in early detection are the most effective and cost-effective ways to reduce the number of hospital admittance due to osteoporotic fractures thereby ensuring patient safety.</summary>
