    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if there is an improvement in progression-free
      survival (length of time during and after treatment in which a patient is living with a
      disease that does not get worse) when siltuximab is added to VELCADE and dexamethasone in
      subjects with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.</summary>
