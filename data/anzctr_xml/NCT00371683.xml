      <outcome>Event Rate of the Composite of Adjudicated Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Events and All-Cause Death With Onset During the Intended Treatment Period - Primary Subjects - An Independent Central Adjudication Committee (ICAC) adjudicated all venograms, suspected symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), acute clinically overt bleeding events, suspected thrombocytopenia, suspected acute MI, suspected acute stroke, and cause of death. Event rate was number of participants with the composite endpoint divided by the number of participants analyzed and reported as percentage (%). Surgery=Day 1; Randomization/Treatment started on Day of Surgery or the next day (Day 1 or Day 2). A mandatory bilateral ascending contrast venogram was performed on all participants after 12 days (±2 days) of study treatment. Intended Treatment Period=starts on the day of randomization; for treated participants, the period ends at the latter of 2 days after last dose of study drug or 14 days after the first dose of study drug; for randomized participants who were not treated, the period ends 14 days after randomization.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to learn if apixaban can prevent blood clots in the leg (deep
      vein Thrombosis [DVT]) and lung (pulmonary embolism [PE]) that sometimes occur after knee
      replacement surgery and to learn how apixaban compares to enoxaparin (Lovenox®) for
      preventing these clots. The safety of apixaban will also be studied.</summary>
