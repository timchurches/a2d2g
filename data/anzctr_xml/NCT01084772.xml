      <outcome>KSS Knee Society Clinical rating system complete analysis at 2 years following surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation will be performed at preoperative, operative/discharge, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after TKA.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective is to compare the safety, quality of life, and economic outcomes of TKA when these two techniques are utilized. - Objective will be assessed by analysis of mechanical alignment preoperatively and postoperatively using a full leg x-ray; Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) preoperatively and postoperatively; and Serial radiographic evaluation postoperatively to assess any evidence of loosening as indicated primarily by radiolucencies &gt; 2mm; lack of evidence of surface wear or particulate debris generation as indicated by early osteolysis, implant migration, or other clinical or radiographic abnormalities; and analysis of Health Economic Criteria</outcome>

          5. Patient has a history of prior ipsilateral major knee surgery (e.g. arthroplasty, high
             tibial osteotomy, or tibial plateau fracture). Minor prior procedures such as ACL
             repair, meniscectomy, or arthroscopy are not excluded.

          6. Patient has active, localized or systemic infection.

          7. Patient is severely overweight (BMI &gt;40).

          8. Patient is a prisoner.

          9. Subject has a significant MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) exclusion or
             contraindication.

         10. Patient has had a total joint arthroplasty of the contralateral limb in the last 12
             months.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to assess outcomes following TKA, utilizing two surgical
      techniques. Patients will be randomized to one of two arms: TKA with standard instrumentation
      and TKA with VISIONAIRE patient-matched cutting blocks. Data will be collected at
      preoperative, operative/discharge, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years after TKA. The secondary
      objective of this study is to compare the safety, quality of life, and economic outcomes of
      TKA when these two techniques are utilized. This study does not involve treatment or
      investigational products, as all components are FDA cleared and are commercially available.</summary>
