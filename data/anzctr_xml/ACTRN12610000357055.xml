  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surface Electromyography (EMG) exam of facial muscles (upper and lower mouth orbicular muscles) during rest,  suction and swallowing functions and isommetry . The duration of the EMG was about an hour. Each signal was recorded during 10 seconds. The overall duration of this observational study was 8 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study was to verify the repercussion of the tonsil and adenoid obstruction on the oral muscles function, which act in the lip sealing. The function of these muscles also influences  the respiratory mode (nasal or mouth breathing).</summary>
