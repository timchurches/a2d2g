  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a significant lifelong impact on the person, their family and the community. It is estimated that 1:400 children are born with cerebral palsy (Stanley et al, 2000), with over 600 new cases diagnosed in Australia each year. At present there is no known cure for this condition (Stanley et al, 2000) however the methods for the treatment of its symptoms, such as muscle spasticity, are well documented. It is known that the combination of occupational therapy along with botulinum toxin (BOTOX) injections (Lowe, Novak &amp; Cusick, 2005; Wallen, OFlaherty &amp; Waugh 2004) and best-practice home programs (Novak, Cusick &amp; Lowe, 2005) can produce positive outcomes for improving function and manage the symptoms of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy (Corry &amp; Graham, 1994; Delago, 2002; Leach, 1997; Russman, Tilton &amp; Gromley, 1997). It is therefore worth investigating the nature and extent of parental input and determine whether or not intensive provider delivered therapy intervention following upper limb botulinum toxin injections will lead to greater desirable outcome in the daily functioning of a child with cerebral palsy. The results of this research project will provide valuable data for determining therapy intensity and the conditions and processes that affect the treatment process.  This will help inform decisions by health professionals and families regarding the type, amount, model and method of therapy to be used following BOTOX速 injections, thus guiding best practice, use of time, resources and funding in the treatment of spasticity in children with cerebral palsy.  There is thus a clear gap in research literature regarding provider-based intense therapy effectiveness that needs to be filled.</summary>
