  <interventions>
    <interventions>A modified version of a previous weight management program known as the Hunter Illawarra Kids Challenge Using Parental Support (HIKCUPS) contextualised for a low socio-economic target group combined with a cooking club. The program is now named the Back to Basics Cooking Club and Healthy Lifestyle Program. 

The intervention is based on Social Cognitive Theory that includes:
i) Five fortnightly, face-to-face group cooking sessions for children 90 minutes in duration over 3 months (one school term). The cooking sessions are facilitated by an experienced education professional.

ii) A group parent and child component facilitated by the investigator for the final 20minutes of each session. This component involves nutrition education and behavioural skills development for parents. Each parent will be encouraged to taste and discuss elements of the meal prepared by their child. Topics covered in this component include:

Benefits of healthy eating
Food label reading
Goal setting and monitoring</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control arm. The subjects in the control group undertake baseline asessment but recieve no intervention for the first school term of the intervention. They return for re-assessment of the same baseline variables at the commencment of the second school term three months later. The wait-list control arm then become the active intervention arm described above. ie a cooking club for children combined with a parental component.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our project objective is to evaluate a program that will engage children and their parents to adopt positive behaviours relating to healthy eating. The intervention is a family focussed approach to be implemented in an after-school setting. We will evaluate its effectiveness as a childhood obesity prevention program for children.</summary>
