  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an adaptive Phase I study to evaluate RO5024048 in the following groups:

        -  Healthy Volunteers (Part 1 - Single Ascending Dose Study) -Enrollment completed

        -  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infected patients who have failed interferon therapy
           (Part 2- Multiple Ascending Dose Study)-Enrollment Completed

        -  HCV genotype 1-infected patients who are treatment naive, to be dosed in combination
           with PEG-IFN and RBV (Part 3 - Combination Dose Study)-Currently Enrolling

        -  HCV genotype 2-3 infected patients who have previously been treated with interferon but
           who did not respond, to be dosed in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV (Part 3 -
           Combination Dose Study)- Currently enrolling

      The study aims to determine if RO5024048 is safe and well-tolerated in healthy people and in
      people infected with hepatitis C virus. The amount of RO5024048 in the blood will be measured
      during the study and the amount of hepatitis C virus in the blood after each dose will also
      be measured.

      During Part 3 of the study, RO5024048 will be given with PEG-IFN and RBV, two drugs currently
      used and approved for the treatment of HCV.</summary>
