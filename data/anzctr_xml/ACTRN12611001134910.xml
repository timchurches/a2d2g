  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dendritic cell immunotherapy to elicit HCV-specific cell mediated immunity in patients who have previously failed interferon-based therapy.  The dose will vary from 1 dose unit (DU) representing 10 million, HCV-specific peptide pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells, to 5 DU on 1, 2 or 3 occasions at weekly intervals.
As this trial was a first in man, the dose variation was decided after consultation with the Therapeutic Goods Administration and was based on previous dendritic cell therapy cancer trials as follows:

Patient #1-1 DU by the intravenous route and 1DU by the intradermal route.

Patient #2-1DU by the intravenous route on 2 occasions, two weeks apart, accompanied by 1DU by the intradermal route on both occasions.

Patient #3-1DU followed by 2DU and 5DU at 2 weekly intervals by the intravenous route, accompanied by 1DU by the intradermal route at each time point.

Patient #4-1DU followed by 5DU at 2 weekly intervals by the intravenous route, accompanied by 1DU by the intradermal route at each time point.

Patient #5-2DU on 3 occasions, 2 weeks apart by the intravenous route, accompanied by 1DU by the intradermal route at each time point.

Patient #6-2DU on 3 occasions, 2 weeks apart by the intradermal route.</interventions>
