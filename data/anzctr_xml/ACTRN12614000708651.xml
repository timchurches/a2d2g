    <interventions>In this observational study participants will be asked to complete the self-report questionnaires outlined below. They will be provided with an email link to access Survey Monkey questionnaires for online completion. If unable to access online, printed copies will be provided for manual completion.

Self Report Questionnaire;
1. Self-report percentage allocation sleep postures
2. General Questions; Age, Gender, Sleeping Arrangement: Partner/Solo, Height and Weight (BMI), Highest Education Level (High school, Registered Trade, Undergraduate, Post Graduate), Medications and Comorbidities.
3. 11 point numerical rating scales for bothersomeness, pain, stiffness and quality of sleep.
 
Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
Spine Functional Index (SFI-10)
Neck Disability Index
Rowland Morris Disability Questionnaire
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
Insomnia Severity Index
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

Infrared cameras will be temporarily installed on stands, in the participant's bedroom and activated automatically to record from 8PM to 8AM. Recording will occur for 3 consecutive nights.
The cameras will record posture and later during analysis, time spent in each primary (prone, supine) and intermediate (supported sidelying and 3/4 prone) posture will be calculated. In addition, the number of posture shifts per night and the number of long periods of immobility (no posture shift for 30 minutes) will be calculated.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Three groups will be recruited for this study. All persons will be required to be fluent and literate in English.

One group will be healthy volunteers with no spinal symptoms.

The second group will include volunteers who experience predominantly cervical pain or stiffness or bothersomeness, greater than or equal to 3/10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS), that is greatest lying in bed or on rising (within 30 minutes) and occurs 4 or more times per month.

The third group will include volunteers who experience predominantly lumbar pain or stiffness or bothersomeness, greater than or equal to 3/10 on a numerical rating scale (NRS), that is greatest lying in bed or on rising (within 30 minutes) and occurs 4 or more times per month.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Less than 18 years and greater than 45 years of age, medical conditions or devices that prevent person from sleeping in all postures e.g. severe OA, esophageal reflux, breathing apparatus, late stage pregnancy, coexisting medically diagnosed inflammatory conditions or unremitting pain e.g. RA, AS, radicular pain, taking medically prescribed hypnotic or relaxant
medications and previously treated by main researcher for spinal pain.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some sleep postures place rotation and extension loads on spinal tissues. If maintained for prolonged periods of time, they could potentially cause pain and stiffness.
The hypothesis of this study is that prone and 3/4 prone postures will increase spine symptoms and that people sleeping in these positions will have more frequent symptoms and a poorer quality of sleep.</summary>
