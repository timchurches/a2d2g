  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sunitinib is an anticancer drug, but like most drugs, the effect varies from person to
      person. This is partly due to a variation in how well each person eradicates the drug from
      the body. This can lead to toxicity if the drug is eliminated slowly. Just as important is
      inadvertent underdosing in people who eliminate the drug quickly which may lead to a reduced
      anti-cancer effect. The investigators group has developed a battery of tests that may measure
      how an individual clears a drug from their body. The investigators intend to apply these
      tests to a group of patients taking sunitinib to see whether any test will help predict the
      level of sunitinib in the body and also the side effects. If a test seems to be promising
      from this study it may be possible to do a simple test on patients before they receive
      sunitinib so the best dose is chosen. The tests involve identifying the genes that are
      involved with drug elimination (CYP3A, ABCB1, ABCG2, OCT1, OATP) as well as directly
      measuring elimination using marker drugs (midazolam clearance and sestamibi liver clearance).</summary>
