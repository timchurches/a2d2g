    <interventions>Material
The research material will constitute 80 persons at the age from 20 to 65  with rotator cuff injury of I and II stage. Patients will be divided into four 20-person group. To the group, I and II will be categorised persons with the injury  to the I stage, of which in the  I group (examined group) will be applied Kinesio Taping and 6-week rehabilitation programme, and in the  II group (control group) only 6-week rehabilitation programme. 
To group III and IV will be recruited patients with the II stage injury. In group III (examined group) will be applied Kinesio Taping together with a 6-week rehabilitation programme and in the  IV group (control group) only 6-week rehabilitation programme.  
The rehabilitation will take place on Academy of Physical Education in Cracow.
Method 
At all persons involved in the project  will be made twice ultrasound examination (before and after completion of the rehabilitation program, ie. after 6 weeks), functional examination according to Orthopaedic Cyriax Medicine and three-time measurement of muscle strength with Biodex System 4 dynamometer (before the first put  Kinesio Tape on, after its primary application and after the end of the 6 week rehabilitation). The examination will be performed in the dynamic conditions  isometric contraction and isokinetic contarction. Moreover, every examined person will complete DASH and UEFI questionnaires, determining the feelings for the size of disability of upper limb, NHP questionnaire assessing the QoL and with VAS scale (pain assessment), each person will assess your own pain troubles. These questionnaires and VAS scale will be completed by the examined persons twice  before beginning a rehabilitation program and after its completion.
Ultrasound examination will be aimed at establishing the kind and sizes of damage within the rotator cuff. Every examination will be performed by the same doctor and with the same device for ultrasonography.
For patients from examined groups, apart from the participation in a rehabilitation programme, will be applied Kinesio Tapes of Cure Tape  company on damaged muscles, and - in any case - on deltoid muscle. Then, after the tape application will be executed the measurement of muscle strength again. Tapes at each patient will be changed every 4 days within 6 weeks. The first application will be made immediately after performing the examination with Biodex System 4 dynamometer.
The tape application and supervision over rehabilitation program (running the program) will be performed by the same physical therapist (author of the project) at all examined persons.
Rehabilitation programme
The training will last for 6 weeks, patients will do exercises 3 times a week. During the day, they will be undergo one 40-minute session of rehabilitation. Patients, categorised to the group with the II stage of the damage, will undertake the exercises of internal rotation from 7th rehabilitation session. The patients categorised to the group with I stage of the demage will commence internal rotation from 1st rehabilitation session. A summary description of the session of rehabilitation: warming up exercises  duration 5 -10 minutes before the main exercises, the main exercises: stretching exercises and strengthening exercise.
A summary description of the session of rehabilitation:
Warming up exercises  duration 5 -10 minutes before the main exercises,
The main exercises:
a) stretching exercises: for muscles: deltoid muscle, infraspinatus muscle, supraspinatus muscle  and subscapularis muscle 
b) strengthening exercises: for ascending and central part of the trapezius muscle,
 for supraspinatus muscle and  teres minor, for pectoral muscles and  infraspinatus muscle - internal rotation, for deltoid muscle, supraspinatus muscle and teres minor - external rotation,for biceps and triceps, for central and rear part of the deltoid muscle, supraspinatus muscle and the central part of the trapezius muscle, for serratus anterior muscle and the central part of the trapezius muscle, for internal rotation: front part of the deltoid muscle, pectoral muscles, subscapularis muscle and latissimus dorsi muscle, for external rotation: rear part of the deltoid muscle, infraspinatus muscle, teres minor.

The patients will be register of attendance at sessions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project will be the evaluation of the impact of Kinesio Taping on the strength of the muscles of the rotator cuff, as well as its impact on the functionality of the upper limb. It is planned to examine of muscle strength of  80 persons with damage to the rotator cuff at 20 to 60 years of age. Patient qualification and assessment of progress will take placeon the basis of the ultrasound examination. It is planned to examine of muscle strength 3 times of each person from the examined group and double from the control group. For the examined group will be applied Kinesio Tapes, which will be changed every 4 days for a period of 6 weeks. The measurement of the muscle strength will be made by using the Biodex System 4 dynamometer. During the examination will be evaluated internal and external rotation, abduction of the shoulder complex. This measurement will be performed 3 times in the examined group (before application of the Kinesio Tape, after application and after the end of the 6-week rehabilitation programme), and 2 times in the control group (before the start of the rehabilitation programme and when it is finished). The functionality of the limb will be assessed on the basis of  DASH and UEFI questionnaires, by means of NHP questionnaire will be also assessed the quality of  life (well-being). Inquiry forms will be filled before start to examinations and after their completion. The intensity of the pain before start to examinations and after their completion will be determined for examined persons by using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Rehabilitation programme will last for 6 weeks, will be performed with a frequency of 3 days during the week, the single session will last for 40 minutes.</summary>
