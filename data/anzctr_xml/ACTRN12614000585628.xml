  <interventions>
    <interventions>Clients in a residential Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) treatment facility will attend 8 x 1 hour sessions of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy group work over 8 weeks. The treatment will be trialled on 3 separate groups of clients over 12 months.
Sessions will include psychoeducation on the causes and effects of trauma. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy will be utilised to teach clients appropriate techniques of symptom management. Efficacy will be determined by a reduction in trauma symptoms according to the PTSD Symptom Checklist, and an improvement in wellbeing based in the EUROHIS Quality of Life 8 Item Index. Improvements in psychological distress are also expected, as measured by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale. </interventions>
    <comparator>Clients will first undergo treatment as usual for 8 weeks in a residential AOD treatment facility. PTSD symptoms, wellbeing, and psychological distress will be measured in clients during this 8 week period. 

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy based groupwork will then be integrated into treatment. This groupwork will relate to PTSD and trauma. Outcomes following 8 weeks of ACT groupwork will be compared to outcomes following 8 weeks of treatment as usual. All clients will therefore receive treatment as usual, in addition to the ACT group-work. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A group-based positive mental health and PTSD symptom management program will be implemented into a residential Alcohol and Other Drug treatment facility. Clients will receive education on the causes and effects of trauma, and will be taught trauma symptom management strategies using an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy approach. The aim is to keep clients in treatment and support them with PTSD symptom management strategies until they can access specialist services post treatment.  The evaluation of the project will involve a number of formal assessments  as well as retention and self-report data. </summary>
