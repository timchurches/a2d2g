    <interventions>Behaviour - One-Session-Treatment

Experimental: Hormonal contraceptive - Women who receive one-session-treatment while they are on the hormonal contraceptive pill

Experimental: Naturally cycling- high estradiol - Naturally cycling women who receive one-session-treatment during a period of high estradiol

Experimental: Naturally cycling-low estradiol - Naturally cycling women who receive one-session-treatment during a period of low estradiol


Behaviour: One-Session-Treatment
There are a total of five steps, each to be repeated until the participant experiences a reduction of at least 50% in their anxiety. Step 1 is catching a spider with a glass and postcard. Step 2 is touching a spider from behind with the dominant index finger. Step 3 is letting a spider walk on the participant's hands. Step 4 is allowing a spider to walk on the participant's legs and body. Steps 1-4 are repeated with larger spiders, and then the two biggest spiders will walk on the participants' hands simultaneously. Step 5 is using a chopstick to guide a huntsman spider over their gloved hand. Treatment ends when all steps are completed, or if the maximum 3 hour time limit has been reached, or if the participant indicates that they do not want to continue.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether levels of sex hormones (including estrogen
      and progesterone) influence women's response to treatment for Specific Phobia of spiders. It
      is hypothesised that women will show less relapse of symptoms of spider phobia if they
      receive treatment during a period of high levels of sex hormones.</summary>
