    <statisticalmethods>Fatty acids: The most relevant study administered 1.3 g DHA and 450 mg EPA for 12 month to MCI  (effects sizes are estimated from partial etas): Delayed recall:?p2 = 0.121 (Approx. d = 0.74);  Digit span: partial eta=.254 (Approx. d = 1.17); Visual reproduction: partial eta=0.114 (Approx. d = 0.72). Computed d for the composite memory score (presented as z-score) was 1.17.
Flavonoids: Desideri et al (2012) administered 990 mg and 520 mg flavanols and reported an effect size (Cohens d of 1.64 for the lower dose). The outcome was a composite cognitive score.  Krikorian et al (2010; 2012) used concord grape juice in MCI. They reported effect sizes (in this case Cohen f) of 0.28 for verbal learning and 0.33 for delayed recall  i.e. medium effect sizes.
Based on the range of effect sizes above, we would err on the side of caution and base a Power calculation on a medium effect size  i.e. Cohens d of approximately 0.5, which generates a sample size of 108/group for a two-arm trial with 90 power to detect a significant change at the 5% probability level. The group sizes assume a 20% attrition rate as found in past studies. In exercise interventions, the volume of the hippocampus, changes in Fractional Anisotropy measures from DTI scans, and the concentration of N-acetyl-aspartate from MR spectroscopy scans, have been observed with 120, 70, 137 participants, respectively. Based on this work, we expect that a sample size of 120 per group will be sufficient to observe age-related declines in MRI measures, and to learn whether these are offset by the intervention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a dearth of research which takes a multi-compound approach to dietary interventions, in humans, aimed at improving outcome measures of cognition. Animal research in particular points towards fatty acids and flavonoids having a potentiating effect on each other, and possibly even being synergistic. Thus, study products will be administered in the present trial comprising both of these compounds, with a view to investigating their potential effects on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective memory impairment (SMI).</summary>
