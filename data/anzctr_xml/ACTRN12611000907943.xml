  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is some preliminary evidence that the endometrial administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) several days prior to embryo replacement leads to a substantial and rapid improvement in endometrial thickness . The rationale for its use is that it is has successfully been used in the treatement of recurrent miscarriages. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine which stimulates neutrophilic granulocyte proliferation and differentiation. It is expressed and produced by the decidual cells, and its receptor, c-fms, is expressed by the trophoblastic cells. In addition, in an animal model, G-CSF showed a marked anti-abortion activity. G-CSF is safely used in the treatment of neutropenia during cancer chemotherapy, and no embryotoxic effects of this substance have been reported  and its safety profile is reassuring. Since experimental findings showed a positive effect on the trophoblast and particularly thickening of the endometrium in previously very resistant patients we would like to prospectively observe the influence of G-CSF on endometrial development in patients with poor endometrial development.  It has a very short half life and is administered to the endometrial cavity 5 days prior to embryo replacment so it is not present in the endometrial cavity when the embryo is placed in the uterus.</summary>
