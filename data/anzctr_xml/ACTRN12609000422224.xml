    <interventions>We are observing the relationship between  the transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) obtained from 320 slice multidetector computed tomography, which is an measure of myocardial ischemia upon stress against the gold standard of fractional flow reserve during coronary angiography. The observations are performed within one month of each other.</interventions>
    <comparator>Myocardial stress ischemia detected on 320 slice multidetector computed tomography is compared against the gold standard of fractional flow reserve on coronary angiography. The latter is obtained from pressure readings taken from a specialised wire passed down the coronary artery. This reading is a one off reading, and will be taken within 1 month of the computed tomography scan.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the accuracy of 320 slice multidetector computed tomography (320 MDCT) in detecting functionally significant coronary artery stenosis as compared against fractional flow reserve (FFR) performed during invasive coronary angiography. 

Using images in the cardiac short axis with a 3mm slice thickness, the subendoardial and subepicardial borders are defined, and the transmural extent of perfusion abnormalities quantified using the transmural perfusion ratio (TPR). A ratio of &lt;0.99 is considered abnormal. This ratio will be compared to FFR using sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value calculation on a vessel territory basis, using the 17 segment myocardial model, and on a per patient basis. Interobserver variability will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One computed tomography scan and one fractional flow reserve is obtained, within a month of each other. Data will be obtained from each procedure, and outcomes used for comparison in bulk by blinded readers upon recruitment of a total of 20 cases.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of CT angiography (CTA) with invasive angiography will be performed. Independent observers will evaluate coronary artery stenoses (location, stenosis in percentage) on Computed tomographic coronary angiography images and on the invasive angiography.

For CTA, maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiplanar reformat (MPR) and curved planar reformat images and dedicated software analysis will be used for evaluation of the stenosis severity and extent by two independent readers. For invasive angiography, two independent experienced interventional cardiologists will grade the stenosis, quantitative coronary angiography software will also be employed.

Statistical analysis will compare CTA with invasive coronary angiography. The diagnostic accuracy of CTA to detect significant stenosis (more than or equal to 50% and 70%) will be expressed as sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value and positive predictive value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One computed tomography scan and one fractional flow reserve is obtained, within a month of each other. Data will be obtained from each procedure, and outcomes used for comparison in bulk by blinded readers upon recruitment of a total of 20 cases.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to assss the accuracy of the 320 slice multidetector computed tomography in detecting stress myocardial ischemia against the known gold standard of fractional flow reserve, which is performed during invasive coronary angiography. We hypothesise that if found comparable, this may be important in evaluating the functional signficance of coronary artery disease in the general public.</summary>
