    <studytitle>A randomised controlled trial of pregnant women being monitored during labour with ST analysis monitoring and cardiotocography, compared to being monitored with cardiotocography alone, in order to reduce caesarean section whilst still having comparable outcomes for the baby.  </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy at greater than 36 weeks gestation, having intrapartum monitoring, how does ST analysis (STan) intrapartum monitoring compare to conventional cardiotocography for selected neonatal and maternal outcomes</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1; Cardiotocographic monitoring only, using a external fetal doppler heart rate transducer strapped around the maternal waist or a metal scalp clip attached to the babies scalp, along with an external tocodynometer strapped to the mothers pregnant abdomen. These transducers and pressure monitors are attached to an electronic fetal monitor (CTG machine), which produces a graphic correlation of fetal heart rate to uterine activity. Trained medical and midwifery staff interpret these temporal correlations according to established guidelines.
Arm 2: ST analysis (STan) fetal monitoring and cardiotocographic monitoring, using a specialised machine (Neovena STan monitor) that combines cardiotocographic monitoring (as above) with an electrocardiographic (ECG)  recording of fetal cardiac activity, requiring a metal scalp clip attached to the unborn babies scalp. This monitoring is only commenced once the cervix is dilated enough and the membranes are ruptured, allowing the clip to be attached. A computerised analysis of the fetal ECG ST segment by the STan monitor provides additional information that is interpreted by guidelines developed by Neoventa by trained medical and midwifery staff. 
The randomisation is performed when the decision is made during labour by medical or midwifery staff that electronic fetal monitoring is necessary, and the monitoring is continued until delivery of the baby. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group has electronic fetal monitoring by cardiotocography (CTG) only. The intervention group has electronic fetal monitoring by ST analysis (STan ) fetal monitoring as well as CTG monitoring. The CTG monitoring is started during labour, and the STan monitoring is commenced in the intervention group only after application of a fetal scalp clip becomes possible (sufficient cervical dilatation and ruptured membranes).  Monitoring in both groups is continued until the baby is born.  </comparator>

      <outcome>Health costs
Data will be collected from various clinical feeder systems, conforming to National Hospital Cost Data Collection standards.  Direct cost comparisons will be made using Australian Related Diagnosis Groups classification. Out of pocket costs will also be collected in the 7-week postnatal questionnaire, using the Labour Experience Questionnaire.   </outcome>

This will be measured by a questionnaire posted to women 7-weeks after delivery, using the Early Labour Experience Questionnaire, the Tilburg Pregnancy Distress Scale and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Additionally we will conduct a qualitative study to attain an in-depth understanding of womens experiences with labour care and fetal monitoring.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Women are informed of the study by a written handout and discussion with a clinician at 32 to 36 weeks gestation, with an opportunity to discuss the trial with family or friends. Consent is sought after the information has been given, or upon admission to the labour ward. After admission to labour ward, and the decision is made for CTG monitoring, eligibility criteria is reviewed, and if eligible, telephone based randomisation is performed. </concealment>
    <sequence>A telephone based randomisation system (NH&amp;MRC clinical trials centre) will: request appropriate patient details and stratification factors; perform duplicate patient test for the current pregnancy based on collected patient details; perform randomisation using minimisation (incorporating stratifications); and send a confirmation of randomisation fax/email to the site.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcome for hypothesis  (Caesarean section) and categorical variables will be analysed with risk-difference and 95% CI and continuous variables with a t-test. Intergroup comparisons will be performed using intention to treat and per protocol analysis. 

Powering the primary hypothesis on a reduction of emergency caesarean section from 18% to 12%, with a power of 80% and a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, will require a total sample size of 1,176 women (588 women in the STan arm, 588 women in the CTG only arm).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomised controlled trial comparing a programme of  monitoring unborn babies during labour using ST analysis (STan) of fetal ECG to intrapartum cardiotography. We aim to reduce our emergency caesarean section rate from 18% to 12% with improvement or clinical equivalence of neonatal outcomes, whilst maintaining maternal wellbeing and both maternal and caregiver satisfaction. The WCH is the first Australian centre to introduce STan fetal monitoring, as a part of a comprehensive educational package on fetal monitoring. </summary>
