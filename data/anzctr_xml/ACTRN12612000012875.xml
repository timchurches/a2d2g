  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single dose of intranasal ketamine (0.7mg/kg) will be administered to children aged 3 to 13 years and less than 50kg in weight, presenting to the emergency department with a musculoskeletal injury and verbal pain score of 6 or greater out of 10. 

A second dose of 0.5 mg/kg will be administered 15 minutes later if the patient requests further analgesia or there has not been an appreciable drop in pain score (greater than or equal to 3 out of 10)

An analysis will be undertaken after 30 patients to assess response to analgesia and/or presence of sedation. The dose of ketamine will be adjusted up or down depending on response in these first 30 patients.

If patients do not attain a drop in pain score of 3/10 or greater at 30 minutes with the initial dosing regimen, the initial dose of ketamine will be increased to 1 mg/kg and admnistered to another 30 patients. Data will then be analysed for this dose.

OR

If the patients attain adequate analgesia (pain score fall greater than or equal to 3/10) but show signs of significant sedation, the initial dose of ketamine will be reduced to 0.5mg/kg for the second 30 patients followed by analysis of the data for this second cohort of patients.

The second dose of ketamine at t=15 minutes (if required) will remain at 0.5mg/kg</interventions>

    <concealment>In general, patients who are eligible for this study are triaged as Australasian Triage Scale (ATS) Category 2 because it is felt that they need analgesia within 10 minutes.

The ED triage nurse will notify the nominated Paediatric ED ‘Cat 2 doctor’ in the usual way. (Note: At the study ED, both the Cat 2 doctor and the ED Consultant In Charge (CIC) receive a pager notification of the arrival of a Category 2 patient (with whatever diagnosis), and so are usually aware of such patients prior to their reaching an ED cubicle.
 
The Cat 2 doctor will perform a rapid assessment of the patient in the usual way, which during the study period will include consideration of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Obtaining a verbal numerical rating of pain severity is standard in this setting. 

If the patient is eligible and the Cat 2 doctor or CIC believe that the time involved in patient recruitment will not have an adverse effect on either that patient’s management or the concurrent work of the ED, then either of these doctors or another delegate may broach study participation with the patient and their parent/guardian.  

Initially, verbal consent for the administration of ketamine as a pain reliever will be sought from the parent/guardian by reading a pre-prepared information sheet describing the study. This will be done to prevent delays to analgesia and the increased distress that are likely to occur in the recruitment of study subjects when a complete written PICF must be read and completed by the patient’s parent/guardian prior to the administration of analgesia. A similar approach to consent has been approved for a parallel adult dose-finding study by Southern Health HREC-A

Written consent will then be obtained once the printed PICF is given to the parent/guardian after analgesia has been ordered and administered, for the data collection, analysis and storage of pain scores, adverse events and other clinical data. 

When the patient parent/guardian’s initial verbal consent is obtained, the attending doctor will calculate the appropriate dosage of Ketamine from the chart attached to the data collection form and chart this for administration via the intranasal route.  

The drug will be prepared by the attending nurse(s) who will also refer to the Study Ketamine Dosing Table</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims ot assess the effectiveness of ketamine as an pain reliever when administered into the nasal passages in doses that do not produce sedation or anaesthesia in a group of paediatric emergency department patients coming to hospital with moderate to severe pain.

We hypothesise that ketamine will reduce pain effectively without significant sedation at the proposed dose.

The data from this study will be used to calculate sample size and design a study comparing the effective dose of ketamine to other pain relivers currently administered by the nasal route to children.</summary>
