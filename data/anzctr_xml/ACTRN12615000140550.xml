  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will attempt to elucidate the genetic basis for inheritable kidney disease using next generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS employed may be targeted to a panel of genes of interest, to the whole exome (i.e. canonical protein-coding genes), or the entire genome. The patient cohort will include those whose family history and/or phenotype strongly suggests a genetic aetiology and in whom routine genetic testing is:
   a) not clinically available
   b) not feasible given high genetic heterogeneity of the suspected disorder, or 
   c) has failed to arrive at a diagnosis for the likely disorder.

Patients will be seen and assessed by a nephrologist and/or clinical geneticist in a Renal Genetics Clinic.  Patients meeting minimum requirements for participation will be offered enrolment to the study and informed consent will be obtained. Once consent has been given, a DNA sample will be obtained via a blood test or buccal swab. The DNA will be analysed using NGS technologies.  Where possible, family members including parents, siblings and possibly offspring of the affected individual will be recruited and included in the NGS testing. Genomic testing on first-degree relatives is necessary in most cases for the accurate interpretation of genetic variants found in the affected patient.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Two groups of individuals will be recruited for this study:
-	Candidates for participation in the protocol will be affected individuals whose family history and/or phenotype strongly suggests a genetic aetiology and in whom routine genetic testing is:
a) not clinically available
b) not feasible given the suspected disorder has high genetic heterogeneity, or 
c) if specific testing for the likely disorder has already failed to arrive at a diagnosis. 

-	First-degree relatives of participating patients (father, mother, siblings, or sons and daughters of the patients).

-	An insufficient number of direct relatives willing/able to participate in the study. In most cases inclusion in this study will require the participation of the patient and both parents.  However, in some cases a combination of factors including the structure of the family pedigree, the suspected mode of inheritance, and information available regarding the specific disease may provide the required level of genetic information and therefore warrant inclusion in the study. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Principal Investigators.

    <designfeatures>Upon recruitment, all participants will be assigned a unique identifier for the purposes of this study by the clinical service. A confidential database, maintained on a Queensland Health server, will link participant identifying information and their project identifier code. Project team members from The University of Queensland will receive all samples and case details anonymously, with the exception of the unique identifier. Only the clinical service will know the identity of the patient samples.

The treating clinician of each affected participant will prepare a precis of the clinical features of the participant, the family structure and any relevant family history. This information is required to make informed evaluations of the genetic variant data derived from each family. This precis will not include any identifying information other than participant project codes. This document will be provided to The University of Queensland research team when DNA samples are provided. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>DNA Sequence data will be analysed from all participating members of a family in parallel.  Comprehensive quality control metrics are derived for each sample to ensure the quality of the sequence data. All sequence reads are compared to the human reference sequence and used to identify variant positions where the participant DNA is different from the reference genome. Each variant position within a family is then evaluated based on its likelihood to contribute to the disease of the affected individual/s. This assessment will be assisted by the Variant Assessment Tool, an internal software tool developed by the Simons laboratory that integrates family genetic variant segregation details with external information sources such the frequency of the allele in published control populations, the predicted impact of the variant on protein coding sequences and genes known to be associated with genetic disorders. 
The projected number of participants is based upon recruiting in trios (mother, father, offspring) or larger families. The expected success rate of this approach is 25-50% from past similar studies in other undiagnosed and rare genetic disorders. 
The number of participants is also limited by the capacity for genetic sequencing and cellular validation which can be achieved with present research funding. Targeting ~30 families gives an expected chance of discovering a novel genetic diagnosis in 10 of those families. Further, the selection of highly phenotyped families with an appropriate family structure further increases the chance of securing such a novel genetic diagnosis, even if this also results in selecting only a relatively small number of families (~30).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent advances in genetic sequencing technology have resulted in remarkable improvements in the speed, throughput and cost of sequencing all, or part, of an individual's genome. Our hypothesis is that emerging high throughput sequencing technologies will lead to the rapid identification of new disease genes in genetic renal disease.  

This project will attempt to elucidate the genetic basis for inheritable kidney disease using next generation sequencing (NGS). The NGS employed may be targeted to a panel of genes of interest, to the whole exome (i.e. canonical protein-coding genes), or the entire genome. The patient cohort will include those whose family history and/or phenotype strongly suggests a genetic aetiology and in whom routine genetic testing is:
   a) not clinically available
   b) not feasible given high genetic heterogeneity of the suspected disorder, or 
   c) has failed to arrive at a diagnosis for the likely disorder.

Patients will be seen and assessed by a nephrologist and/or clinical geneticist in a Renal Genetics Clinic.  Patients meeting minimum requirements for participation will be offered enrolment to the study and informed consent will be obtained. Once consent has been given, a DNA sample will be obtained via a blood test or buccal swab. The DNA will be analysed using NGS technologies.  Where possible, family members including parents, siblings and possibly offspring of the affected individual will be recruited and included in the NGS testing. Genomic testing on first-degree relatives is necessary in most cases for the accurate interpretation of genetic variants found in the affected patient.

Disease-causing mutations will be specifically sought in genes thought to be related to the patient's condition. If found, these variants will be confirmed with specific testing in a clinical laboratory, if available.  Validation studies may be performed in a research capacity on selected novel potentially disease-causing variants or where disease pathobiology is not known. This will include patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) validation after further patient consent for skin biopsy, urine sample, blood sample or buccal swab. iPSC technology enables ex vivo disease in a dish cellular and functional research of human disease owing to the ability to redifferentiate iPSC to many different cell types and thus model and validate how a genetic variant may mediate disease.

Mutations previously reported to be disease-causing may also be discovered in genes not related to the patient's condition. Participants will be informed of known or expected, disease-causing variants in primary genes of interest.  If chosen at the time of consent, participants will be informed of mutations in genes predicted to be associated with unrelated disease, and for which intervention is available.
