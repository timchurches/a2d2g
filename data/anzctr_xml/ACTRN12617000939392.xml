    <interventions>Intervention Groups:
There are two arms:
Arm 1: Arm 1 is the dry group, and will apply sunscreen once only at the beginning of the test session and UV SPOT indicating stickers on their lower legs, and be swabbed every 20 minutes for 7 cycles. The research assistant will apply the sunscreen on to the participant over the UV SPOT indicating stickers and lower leg to ensure adequate surface coverage.
Arm 2: Arm 2 will apply sunscreen once only at the beginning of the test session and UV SPOT indicating stickers on their lower legs, with the addition of having at least their lower legs in the pool for 20 minutes each cycle, with a rest break in between (i.e 20 minutes in the pool followed by 10 minutes rest out of the pool, repeated for 7 cycles). The research assistant will apply the sunscreen on to the participant over the UV SPOT indicating stickers and lower leg to ensure adequate surface coverage. Participants will be asked to wait 15 minutes for the sunscreen to soak in before entering the water. Participants can swim in the pool or sit on the edge of the pool with their lower legs submerged in the water.

Participants in both arms will receive 8 spots applied to their legs at the beginning of the test session. The data collection process (7 cycles) for both arms will take up to 4-5 hours to complete.
The sunscreen provided to both arms will be a high quality SPF 50+ water resistant 80min+ sunscreen that conforms to the Australian Standard. Participants will be required to use the sunscreen provided by the research team. Both groups will be indoors for the duration of the study at the Queensland University of Technology. Participants will not be testing the UV SPOT indicating stickers in direct sunlight. The UV SPOT indicating stickers will be removed from the participant by the research assistant, and placed in the sun for assessment between 11am-1pm when the UV index is above 3. All participants will be supervised by the research team during the intervention to ensure intervention adherence. Lifeguards are available at the indoor pool to ensure the swimmers safety at all times.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlate the amount of sunscreen on the participants skin to the amount of sunscreen on the UV SPOT indicating stickers .

The participants skin is swabbed using a 70%w/w 1sq" Rubbing Alcohol Swab, manufactured by BD. The technician wipes the swab over a 10cm^2 area five times, turns the swab around, and wipes 5 more times. The swab is analyzed outside of the testing environment using UV-Vis Spectroscopy to quantify the concentration of sunscreen on the skin. This swabbing procedure was based off of a similar procedure used by Bauer et al 2010 in the Journal Photochemistry and Photobiology.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>24hrs to 2 days post commencement of intervention the UV SPOT indicating stickers will be assessed in direct sunlight.

The amount of sunscreen on skin is measured at 8 time points (7 cycles total): 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 140 minutes after the sunscreen has been applied to the participant. At each of these time points, the skin will be swabbed using the Bauer procedure and the one SPOT sticker will be removed from the participant. At a later time point, all of the SPOT stickers will be brought into the sun by Dr. Hacker to have their colour analyzed using the NIX colour sensor and a photo taken of the SPOTs. Then, the SPOTs will be analyzed using UV-Vis Spectroscopy to quantify the amount of sunscreen on them. </timepoint>

      <outcome>Assess the colour UV SPOT indicating stickers changes when exposed to sunlight 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>24hrs to 2 days post commencement of intervention the UV SPOT indicating stickers will be assessed in direct sunlight. The stickers have NIX Color Sensor data captured and a photo taken in direct sunlight. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Our sample size was calculated in-line with the sunscreen standard testing sample size suggestion of 12 participants. We will have 12 participants for each (pool and dry) group giving a total of 24 participants. For a 95% CI (a=0.05) we would need 56 data points. Each participant ideally will return 8 data points, so this study design safely gathers enough data points to allow for meaningful conclusions to be drawn. 
The skin swabs used in this study will allow for a quantitative analysis of the sunscreen correlation between the SPOT stickers and real human skin. Qualitative data will be gathered by a NIX color sensor in order to quantify the colour change using CIELAB colour values. A QUT statistician will independently analyse the data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed clinical trial aims to investigate the performance of the SPOT UV Indicating Stickers in pool water and on dry land. SPOT stickers are applied to a users skin before they apply their sunscreen, and their intended function is to change colour to warn users when their sunscreen is no longer protecting them. 
Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two activity groups (pool or dry) and will be wearing both sunscreen and SPOT stickers. Periodically, participants will have their SPOT stickers and skin swabbed, and the colour of the SPOT stickers measured. The aim of the study is to see that the amount of the sunscreen protecting the skin and the amount of sunscreen on the SPOT stickers are correlated. The study also will note that if a sufficient amount of sunscreen has worn off of a users skin that the SPOTs are changing colour to warn the user of overexposure to UV light. The study will be run over 3 weekend days, for 5 hours per participant session. The intended outcome is that SPOT stickers are seen to change colour should the amount of sunscreen protecting the users skin goes below a concentration of 0.5mg/cm3.
