  <interventions>
    <interventions>The physical activity of patients undergoing lumbar spinal surgery will be monitored for the first post-operative week. To measure physical activity, all participants will be fitted with an activPAL3 accelerometer (PAL technologies). The accelerometer is a small device, to be attached to the thigh with a waterproof, transparent dressing. It can then remain in place for the full seven day monitoring period, with a daily review to check for discomfort or irritation. 

At six months following surgery participants will be sent follow-up outcome measures, to be returned to the researchers by mail.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The recommended sample size for logistic regression analysis is a minimum of 5 outcome events per predictor variable (EPV). The dependent variable in the regression analysis will be dichotomised, and for the purpose of sample size calculation we assume an equal 1:1 ratio of event:non-event. The number of independent (predictor) variables to be analysed in this study is 15. Using the calculation of 5 outcome events, with 10 independent variables, and a 1:1 ratio of events:non events, this study will require a minimum of 150 participants (5x10x2=150).
Based on expected admissions to the treating institution over the recruitment period, it is expected that this will provide an estimated recruitment pool of 300 eligible participants and sample size of approximately 250 participants. This proposed sample size allows for variation in EVP, missing data and participants lost to follow-up.
Baseline demographics of the study population will be analysed using descriptive statistics.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis will be used to investigate the relationship between post-operative activity and outcome at six months using SPSS software. The dependent variable in the logistic regression model will be the change in score on the ODQ, SF-36, NRPS and NRPS between baseline and six months.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is currently not known whether the amount of walking patients do following lumbar spinal surgery is associated with post-operative outcome, therefore there is considerable variation in the advice provided to patients regarding walking and physical activity in the period immediately following surgery. This research aims to establish whether the amount of physical activity patients do in the week following lumbar spinal surgery predicts recovery of function at six months.
All patients admitted to St Vincents Private Hospital Fitzroy (SVPHF) for lumbar spinal surgery aged 18 years and over will be invited to take part in this study. Recruitment will take place over a six-month period, with an estimated 250-300 participants. Participation will involve completing a series of short questionnaires pre-operatively and at six months post-operatively. To measure physical activity in the week following surgery each participant will be required to wear a small device, called an accelerometer, fixed to the thigh with a waterproof dressing. During this first post-operative week participants will also be asked about pain, whether they require assistance while walking, and post-operative complications. Where patients are discharged prior to the seven-day monitoring period finishing they will be provided with daily questionnaires to complete and a reply paid envelope to return the accelerometer to the research team. 
There will be no changes to standard post-operative care currently provided by any of the staff at SVPHF, including advice regarding walking and physical activity immediately following surgery.
The findings from this research will enable all health professionals involved in the post-operative rehabilitation process to provide consistent advice about activity levels following surgery, including information provided in educational resources. It will also build the foundation for further research into interventions designed to optimise post-operative activity.

    <publicnotes>Multivariable regression analysis will be used to analyse the data, therefore additional data will be collected as baseline for variables where there is either evidence to suggest they influence outcome following lumbar spinal surgery, or there is or strong theoretical rational for their inclusion. This will include age, gender, current smoking status, obesity, diabetes, depression, duration of pain/symptoms, neurological deficit, anxiety, pre-operative activity, pre-operative mobility, surgical procedure, multi-level surgery, and pre-operative function. 
Post-operatively, additional data will be collected over the seven day monitoring period regarding post-operative back, leg and wound pain intensity (NRPS), the need for supervision while walking, and surgical/medical complications.</publicnotes>
