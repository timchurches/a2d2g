  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapy treatment: education, manual therapy, and tendon gliding and neurodynamic exercises for the hand and upper limb. Participants will attend 9 sessions over 7 weeks (twice weekly for first 2 weeks and once a week for the following 5 weeks). The duration of each session will be approximately 30 minutes.

 
Half of the participants in this group will also receive a hand splint (random allocation). The hand splint is worn at night during sleep over the 7weeks treatment period.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Therapeutic ultrasound treatment (1MHz, pulsed mode, 1 watt/cm2, 15 mins) applied over the carpal tunnel. Participants will attend 20 sessions (10 sessions in the first 2 weeks and twice weekly for the following 5 weeks). The duration of each session will approximately be 20 minutes.
 
Half of the participants in this group will also receive a hand splint (random allocation). The hand splint is worn at night during sleep over the 7weeks treatment period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Reviews of the literature show limited evidence for the efficacy of conservative management of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and a lack of studies investigating the long term effects of the non-surgical management of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The aim of our study is to investigate the long-term efficacy of a multimodal approach comprising of manual mobilisation techniques, education and nerve and tendon gliding exercises (MEX) versus therapeutic ultrasound treatment in managing carpal tunnel syndrome. Hand splinting is included as an adjunct intervention to evaluate its influence on the 2 treatment approaches. We hypothesise that the MEX treatment approach would be superior to therapeutic ultrasound treatment in the long-term and the addition of hand splint in either treatment would improve its overall outcome. </summary>
