  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite an acknowledgement of the significance of carer support and consumer involvement in recovery, to date there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding their impact on the outcome of rehabilitation programs for stroke patients.  The aim of this study is to develop a consumer and carer centred model to assist with recovery and community reintegration in the first year after the onset of stroke.</summary>
