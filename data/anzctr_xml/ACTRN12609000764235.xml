  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early and sustained hypothermia. Hypothermia will initially be induced by infusion of up to 2L ice cold saline. Following a safety assessment the patient will be rapidly cooled to 33C using surface temperature control equipment. They will be maintained at 33C for 72hours. Slow rewarming will occur at a rate of 1C/4hrs and will be titrated to intracranial pressure (ICP) control and blood pressure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard management patients will be kept at normothermia (37C +/- 0.5C). If they develop a fever &gt;38C they will be treated with paracetamol and surface temperature control equipment will be applied to maintain normothermia for up to 96 hours post randomisation. After 96 hours post randomisation Standard care patients will be managed as per unit protocol.  Cooling to 35C is an option for refractory ICP.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long term disability, particularly in young adults.  Studies from Australia have shown that approximately half of those with severe traumatic brain injury will be severely disabled or dead 6 months post injury. Given the young age of many patients with severe TBI and the long term prevalence of major disability, the economic and more importantly the social cost to the community is very high.
Pre-hospital and hospital management of patients with severe brain injury focuses on prevention of additional injury due primarily to lack of oxygen and insufficient blood pressure. This includes optimising sedation &amp; ventilation, maintaining the fluid balance and draining Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) &amp; performing surgery where appropriate. In recent years there has been a research focus on specific pharmacologic interventions however to date there has been no treatment that has been associated with improvement of neurological outcomes.
One treatment that shows promise is the application of hypothermia (cooling).  This treatment is commonly used in Australia to decrease brain injury in patients with brain injury following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Cooling is thought to protect the brain using a number of mechanisms. There have been a number of animal studies that have looked at how cooling is protective and also some clinical research that suggests some benefit. However at the current time there is insufficient evidence to provide enough proof that cooling should be used routinely for patients with brain injury and like all treatments there can be some risks and side effects.
The POLAR trial has been developed to investigate whether early cooling of patients with severe traumatic brain injury is associated with better outcomes. It is a randomised controlled trial, which is a type of trial that provides the highest quality of evidence.</summary>
