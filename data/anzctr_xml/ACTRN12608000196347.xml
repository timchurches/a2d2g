The subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction &gt;30%,
The subject requires treatment of a single de novo lesion in a native coronary artery,
The subject understands the study requriements, is willing to comply with all study procedures and has provided written informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>The subject has undergone prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, prior coronary brachytherapy, prior coronary stent implant to the target vessel, prior coronary intervention within 30 days, or prior revascularization to the target vessel within the previous 6 months.
The subject has experienced recent myocardial infarction within 72 hours.
The subject has experienced a cerebrovascular accident within the last 6 months, active gastrointestinal bleeding within the last 3 months, has a known bleeding disorder, hypercoagulable disorder or thrombocytopenia.

    <concealment>All potential participants will be screened for general eligibility criteria following informed consent. Screening procedures will include baseline coronary angiography to assess if the target lesion and vessel meet eligibility criteria. Randomization will be handled either via phone call or web access to a central automated randomization service using which will provide treatment assignment. Investigators treating enrolled subjects will not be blinded to treatment assignment to ensure safe and proper use of both the control and investigational device. The subject will be blinded to treatment assignment unless for unforseen reasons, in the interest of the subject's safety, it is determined that unblinding is required to protect the individual.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be conducted using a centralized randomization service. Randomization will be done on a 1:1 basis within each site. The randomization schedule was constructed using a random permuted block scheme stratified by site and diabetic status within the site randomization block.</sequence>
