  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients scheduled for pancreatoduodenectomy for malignant or benign disease, respectively, will be investigated during and after surgery. At the day of surgery, baseline blood samples will be taken in the operating room as soon as the first intravascular line is inserted. Anesthesia and surgery will proceed according to unit routines including epidural block and general anesthesia. Intravenous fluids will comprise acetated Ringers solution and glucose, but no starch. Blood will be sampled repeatedly during surgery and up to the morning of the third postoperative day for assessment of albumin and hemoglobin balance at a maximum of 15 instances. Albumin and hemoglobin will also be measured in sponges, suction bottles, drains, administrated blood products etc. to keep track of losses and gains. Baseline plasma volume will be calculated by anthropometry.   
Plasma and serum will also be sampled repeatedly for assessment of glycocalyx shedding products and markers of inflammation until the morning of the third post-operative day. The sum of all study specific blood sampling will be limited to 75 ml, approximately 1.5% of the blood volume.</interventions>
    <comparator>The two patient groups (malignant and benign) will be compared regarding cumulative albumin shift from the blood, not explained by bleeding, and thus presumably into the interstitial space. There are two reasons to expect that there can be a difference: 1) capillary patency is impaired in cancer, possibly due to inflammation, causing more rapid transcapillary escape rate for albumin; 2) in the cancer patients surgical excision will be greater comprising lymph glands and vessels, possibly impairing lymphatic return and thus increasing albumin losses i.e. accumulation of albumin in the interstitium.</comparator>

      <outcome>cumulative perioperative albumin shift, i.e. loss of albumin from the blood not explained by bleeding or losses in drains. By repeated measurements of blood hemoglobin and plasma albumin, combined with meticulous assessment of gained albumin and hemoglobin in infused blood products and losses by bleeding or in drains, it is possible to compare losses of hemoglobin with losses of albumin. In a previous study albumin was lost to a higher amount i.e. the cumulative perioperative albumin shift, presumably to the extracellular space. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>we aim at studying at least 12 evaluable patients in each the two study groups, but up to 40 patients can be recruited to compensate for exclusion of outliers, thus achieving more homogenous patient groups than in our previous study (Norberg et al Criit Care 2016; 20:113) when 24 +/- 17 g albumin was lost at end of surgery in patients undergoing majour abdominal surgery. 
There are no published mesurements of albumin shift in the two groups of this study, but in german gynecological patients protein loss under surgery has been reported as 49 and 13 g, in malignant and benign patients, respectively (Rehm et al Acta Anaesthesiol Scand 1998; 42: 39-46).
Assuming a smaller variation, less albumin loss in the benign patient group 18 +/- 15 g and larger loss in the malignant Group 36 +/- 15 g we achieve 96% power to find a significant difference from baseline in the benign group (effect size 1.2 = difference/s.d., n=12) and 80% power to find a difference between groups as presented above (effect size 1.2). Groups will be compared at end of surgery and in the morning of postoperative day 3. If not different, groups will be treated as one group in the further statistical evaluation.
With 24 subjects there is a power of 80% to detect a correlation of 0.54 between two parameters by a 2-sided t-test and a significance level of 5%. The large number of mutual correlations between markers of endothelial injury, inflammation, fluid balance, changes in body weight and parameters of albumin mass balance calculations are exploratory. This part of the study is mainly hypothesis generating.
Normality of data will be assessed by Sharpio-Wilks test of normality and parametric or non-parametric analysis applied accordingly. The primary endpoint will be evaluated by t-test or Wilcoxon, as appropriate. Likewise correlations will be reported as Pearsons correlation coefficient r or Spearman's rank correlation rs.
Demographic preoperative data such as age, height, weight, BMI, gender, routine lab, history of weight loss, diagnoses, and current medications will be presented as numbers, averages and standard deviation, or as median range as applicable.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Intravenous fluids are regularly used during major abdominal surgery. A vivid debate on infusion rates, guidance, and choice of fluids is ongoing. Colloids are larger molecules that stay longer (hours) in plasma, but long term effects (weeks or more) are poorly investigated. After the recent recommendation against the use of the synthetic colloid hydroxyethyl starch by the European Medical Agency for safety reasons, albumin containing solutions remain the most used colloid in Sweden and at Karolinska University Hospital. However, evidence of any long term beneficial effects of albumin is missing.  
Albumin is the main constituent of plasma proteins, contributing to the colloid osmotic pressure in the capillaries. Normally, it leaves the blood stream through the capillary walls at a rate of 4-5% of the intravascular pool per hour, and returns to plasma by the lymph at the same rate. Being an endogenous substance, it carries low risk of adverse effects, but the dosing is controversial, and costs high.
We have previously demonstrated a cumulative perioperative albumin shift of 24 +/- 17 g at the end of major abdominal surgery not explained by bleeding when starch was used as intravenous fluid. We believe that this amount of albumin is displaced to the interstitium, possibly contributing to edema. If capillary leakage is induced by hypervolemia, inflammation or other mechanisms is unclear. 
Study purpose
In this observational study we are looking at two patient groups scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy because of malignant or benign disease, respectively. The primary purpose is to find if albumin is lost from the blood even when only crystalloids are used during surgery, our present routine. The malignant patients are likely to lose albumin quicker through the capillary walls because they suffer from chronic inflammation and also have a slower lymphatic return because surgery in that case comprises lymphadenectomies and a more extended dissection. We also want to investigate markers of injury to the capillary walls, markers of inflammation, and indices of volume status to generate new hypotheses.  
The primary hypothesis is that albumin is lost in both patient groups, but more so in the malignant group, at the end of surgery. 
The overall aim of our research program is to define the role of albumin in modern fluid therapy. This observational study is an important step in understanding effects of our present fluid routine in major abdominal surgery, to find when and to what degree albumin is lost from the blood stream, and to generate hypotheses on mechanisms. Future interventional studies will depend heavily on these results.</summary>
