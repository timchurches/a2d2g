    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through oncologists, breast specialists and the Breast Cancer Network of Australia. They will beinvited to contact the Womenâ€™s Health Research Program (WHRP).  If eligible to participate they will attend the WHRP for 4 visits.

Each participant will be given a unique two-digit participant screening number in sequential ascending order at the Screening visit.  Participants will receive these numbers in the order in which they enter the study and they will retain this number throughout their participation in the study. 

Participants who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a Randomization Number.   The randomization code will be generated independently by the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, Monash University and randomization and packaging will be undertaken by the compounding pharmacy in the Alfred Hospital, Melbourne.
The participant will receive study drug with their unique Randomization number. 

Treatment randomization will occur 4-6 weeks after screening.

All investigators and clinical staff will remain blinded to allocation of therapy until the statistical data base is cleaned and locked.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will determine the effectiveness of intravaginal testosterone cream therapy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction due to Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) in women with breast cancer being treated with an aromatase inhibitor (AI). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, currently being treated with an AI and experiencing at least one symptom of vaginal dryness, itch, or pain with sexual activity for which you are seeking treatment Study details -participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will apply the intravaginal testosterone cream, whilst participants in the other group will apply the intravaginal placebo cream. Both groups will apply the creams nightly for the first two weeks and then nightly 3 times a week for the remaining 24 weeks. Circulating levels of hormones will be checked before, during and at the end of the treatment period and participants will be asked to answer questionnaires related to sexual function.</summary>
