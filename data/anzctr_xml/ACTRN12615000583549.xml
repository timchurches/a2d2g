    <interventions>Comparison of safety, tolerability and performance of uncoated and placebo coated Nanopatches and the Nanopatch applicator device (Vaccine Delivery Device).
The uncoated Nanopatch is a terminally sterilised 1cm2 monocrystalline silicon wafer with 8200 micro-projections.  
The placebo-coated Nanopatch is a terminally sterilised 1 cm2 monocrystalline silicon wafer with 8200 micro-projections coated with hypromellose, trehalose dihydrate and phosphate buffered saline.  
The Nanopatch delivery device is a hand-held mechanical, spring loaded and reusable applicator (CAP02) calibrated at a specific speed of either 20 m/s (placebo coated patch) or 17.5 m/s (uncoated patch). 
There are 2 study cohorts; Patients in Cohort 1 on Day 0 will have one uncoated patch applied to the forearm and one uncoated patch applied to the deltoid. On Day 3 they will return to to the clinic and receive one placebo-coated patch to the forearm and one placebo-coated patch to the deltoid. 
Cohort 2 will only receive placebo-coated patches on one occasion (Day 0). Two patches  will be  applied to the forearm and 2 patches willbe applied to the deltoid region.  Therefore each subject will have a total of 4 patches applied, 2 to the forearm and 2 to the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm. 
Each patch will be held on the arm for 2 minutes before manual removal.
Observations (and photography) will be done at regular timepoints on the day of application for then daily for 6 days, then again at the end of study visit.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>Uncoated nanopatches will be compared to placebo-coated nanopatches. Placebo coating consists of hypromellose, trehalose dihydrate and phosphate buffered saline.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Primary Outcome: To examine the safety and tolerability of uncoated and placebo-coated Nanopatches in healthy volunteers. Safety is assessed by number of Adverse events; Tolerability assessed by observation and measurements of erythema, itching, induration and flaking of skin (Draize scoring system).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>For Cohort 1;  Observations will begin immediately after application for 2 hours then daily for  6 days after each application then on day 10, 14 and Day 35
For Cohort 2;  Observations will begin immediately after application then daily for  6 days after application then on day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite outcome To assess the pain and acceptability of the Nanopatch administration process in healthy volunteers. This will be assessed by optional Questionnaire administered after application. (Study Specific design); Pain assessed on 100mm VAS. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment will begin immediately after application and will continue for 2 hours.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare sites of application and uncoated versus placebo-coated patches within subjects. This will be assessed by examination and photography
</outcome>
      <timepoint>For Cohort 1: examination and photography will be done on Days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 35. 
For Cohort  2: examination and photography will be done on Days 0, 3, 7, and 28.   </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory Objective: To perform post-application analysis of the nanopatches to investigate skin penetration and performance using scanning electron microscopy and for the placebo-coated nanopatches, residual trehalose content</outcome>
      <timepoint>The patches will be analysed post removal from patient. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>No statistical testing is planned between the cohorts. Safety endpoints have been identified as being of main interest in this study. Study investigations will be exploratory and conclusions based on the complete set of subject evidence.
Mixed effects generalised linear models will be used to separately estimate variances between and within subjects and to make comparisons between sites of application and between uncoated and placebo coated patches for cohorts 1 and 2 separately.
Descriptive statistics of demographics (age, height and weight  at screening, race and ethnic origin) will be presented by cohort group and overall. Medical history information collected at screening will be listed. All adverse events will be listed by subject and will include details of the onset date and time, duration, severity, causality and treatment/medications administered. 
Laboratory parameters will be listed over the scheduled visits by subject number and treatment cohort. Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, aural temperature and respiratory rate) which are outside of the normal reference range and clinically significant will be tabulated .
Physical examination data will be tabulated.
Local reactions will be tabulated.

    <summary>This is a first in human study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and performance of a new vaccine delivery device.  

The sponsor is developing a novel approach for the administration of vaccines that does not require the use of needles. Small nanopatches patches designed to carry the vaccine are applied to the skin and kept in place for 2 minutes. This study will assess how safe and acceptable these nanopatches are. </summary>
