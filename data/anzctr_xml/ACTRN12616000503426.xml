  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fitting standard earmuffs (AS/NZS 1270:2002 Acoustics  Hearing protectors) Class 5 over the ears of a patient under general anaesthetic. The ear muffs will be fitted after the induction of general anaesthesia, prior to knife to skin or equivalent marker of initiation of the surgical procedure. The ear muffs will stay in place for the duration of the surgical procedure. The ear muffs will be removed after final surgical stitch/staple/dressing, prior to leaving the operating room, or prior to extubation if an endotrachial tube airway is used. 
A verbal check with the treating anaesthetist to ensure the ear muffs were not required to be removed at any point will be done. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post operative opiate use from PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) pump. This is done by reviewing the medical records as all PCA dosing information is transcribed to the PCA chart as routine care. </outcome>
      <timepoint>24 hours, starting at the induction of anaesthesia. This is to include the induction dose of opiate. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain scores, verbal scale either 0-5 or 1-10 depending on the ward and nursing habits. We will convert all scores to a 0-10 scale for uniformity and comparison. </outcome>
      <timepoint>First 24 hours. The frequency of routine observations which includes checking the pain score will vary considerably between patients and is not being standardised. Any recorded pain scores per 6 hour period will be used. If the pain scores are not recorded frequently enough then will have to reduce to every 8-10 hours. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Does reducing noise exposure in patients under general anaesthetic improve post operative pain control and reduce strong opiate pain killer usage after an operation. 
We will randomise patients to either wear earmuffs during their anaesthetic, or to the control group that has a 'business as usual' anaesthetic for their surgery. 
We will review how many times patients pressed their pain pump button, and what the total dose received of strong opiate pain killers was. We will also review the observation chart where pain scores are recorded. 
By looking at these records we can see if there is a difference in pain scores and opiate use between the two groups in the study. </summary>
