  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to treatment failure (time on sunitinib treatment) - This duration extends from the date the patient starts sunitinib until the date sunitinib is abandoned. The group with sunitinib concentration below the population median are expected to have a median Time to Treatment Failure (TTF) of approximately 8 months, compared with 14 months in those with sunitinib concentration above the population median.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sunitinib is an oral drug used for treatment of advanced kidney cancer. The standard dose is
      50mg, but many patients require a dose decrease due to side-effects. Drug levels of sunitinib
      vary approximately 10-fold between patients.

      This study will measure blood levels of sunitinib and its metabolite, and correlate these
      with side-effects and the response to the treatment. The study aims to establish whether
      blood levels change with time, and see how useful blood levels are for monitoring patients
      treated with sunitinib.</summary>
