Experimental: Three-way cross- over - Three regimens will be administered in this study: A: GSK1144814 Tablet (100mg) Fasted State; B: GSK1144814 Tablet (200mg) Fasted State and C: GSK 1144814 Tablet (100mg) Fed State (FDA high fat breakfast).


Treatment: drugs: GSK1144814
This study is an open label, randomised, three-way cross-over study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, effect of food, safety and tolerability of a new tablet formulation of GSK1144814 in healthy male and female (non-child bearing potential) subjects. Sixteen subjects will be enrolled to provide a minimum number of 12 evaluable subjects. The doses to be administered will be 100 mg and 200mg in the fasted state, and 100mg following a high fat breakfast.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation
             including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac
             monitoring. A subject with a clinically significant abnormality or laboratory
             parameters significantly outside the reference range for the population being studied
             may be included only if the Investigator and the and the GSK Medical Monitor agree
             that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non childbearing potential defined as pre menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea
        (in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone [FSH]
        greater than 40 mIU/mL and oestradiol less than 40 pg/mL [less than 140 pmol/L] is
        confirmatory).

        Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will
        be required to discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post menopausal status prior to
        study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods alloed by the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the first dosing day until 3 months
             after the last dose.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 to 29.9 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  History or presence of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias, or other clinically
             significant cardiac disease.

          -  QTcB or QTcF greater than 450 msec.

          -  Subjects, who in the investigator's judgement, pose a significant suicide risk.
             Evidence of serious suicide risk may include any history of suicidal behavior and/or
             any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS in the last 6 months.

          -  The subject has a positive pre study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre study hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or positive hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) antibody test result within 3 months of Screening.

             investigations). Additionally subjects with idiopathic haematuria or proteinuria or
             conditions such as benign orthostatic proteinuria and benign familial haematuria
             should be excluded from the study.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco or
             nicotine containing products within 6 months prior to Screening.

          -  Subjects, who in the investigator's judgement, pose a significant homicidal risk or
             have ever been homicidal.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as the
             following Australian guidelines:

        An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of greater
        than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than 14 units or an
        average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is equivalent to 270ml of
        full strength beer, 470ml of light beer, 30ml of spirits and 100ml of wine.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Consumption of Seville oranges (including marmalade) and/or grapefruit and/or Chinese

    <summary>GSK1144814 is a potent, insurmountable antagonist at human neurokinin-1 (NK1) and
      neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptors with the potential to treat multiple symptom domains of
      schizophrenia and be an efficacious antidepressant.

      This study will be an open label, randomised, three-way cross-over study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a new tablet formulation of GSK1144814 and to
      evaluate the effect of food on single oral doses of GSK1144814 in healthy male and female
      subjects.</summary>
