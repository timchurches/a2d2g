    <interventions>The primary objective in this study is to develop a 6 week comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention program (CLIP) targeted to achieve a cholesterol reduction comparable to a statin (S)  and to compare this approach to standard lifestyle advice with (S+L) and without (L) statin therapy on plasma lipids and cardiovascular risk factors.
Group 1 CLIP Program (low saturated fat + sterols + soluble fibre + weight reduction + exercise).</interventions>
