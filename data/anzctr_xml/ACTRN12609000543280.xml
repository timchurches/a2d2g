    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were recruited from the dialysis service.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either dialysis with a continuous insulin infusion or to a conventional dialysis session and then subsequently switched over to the opposite treatment, with at least one week between each study. Allocation was concealed with a third party off site advising the dialysis nurses which treatment option was allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization was achieved by use of a computerized randomization plan generator (www.randomization.com).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Individuals with Chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis treatment have a high risk of cardiovascular disease. It is thought that the process of dialysis may contribute to this risk by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, individuals with non-diabetic CKD have are insulin resistant, similar to individuals with pre-diabetes. Insulin has been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory properties. In very sick patients in Intensive Care, continuous insulin infusions have been associated with better outcomes. The impact of an insulin infusion during a haemodialysis session to reduce the inflammation generated by dialysis has not been studied. We propose a pilot study of an insulin infusion during dialysis to see if markers of inflammation measured in the blood are reduced. If there is evidence of improvement, we would then propose a longer time study to really see if there is benefit from insulin therapy.</summary>
