  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and docetaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. It is not yet known whether carboplatin is more effective than docetaxel in
      treating patients with metastatic genetic breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying carboplatin to see how well it works
      compared to docetaxel in treating women with metastatic genetic breast cancer.</summary>
