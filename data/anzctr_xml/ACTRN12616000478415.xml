  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing elective open colorectal surgery were randomised into the lidocaine group or control group.
The lidocaine group received 1.5 mg/kg i.v. bolus at induction of anaesthesia immediately followed by 1 mg/kg/hr i.v. infusion for a total of 48 hours duration.

On arrival at the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), all patients were connected to an i.v. fentanyl patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump (20 mcg bolus, 5 min lockout, maximum dose 240 mcg/hr). PCA fentanyl consumption and numerical pain rating scale (NRS, 0-10) at rest were recorded by a blinded non-study nurse at 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours post-surgery. A blinded non-study pain physician monitored the patient daily, and adjusted the PCA dose if pain was not controlled. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients undergoing elective open colorectal surgery were randomised into the lidocaine group or control group.
The control group was administered intravenous saline infusion of equal volume to the lidocaine group. Patients were given a fentanyl opioid PCA for pain management. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>To detect a difference in mean time to first bowel movement of 12 hours, a sample size of 28 patients in each group was calculated as sufficient, with 80% power at a two-tailed 5% significance level. This estimation was based on a meta-analysis (Sun et al. 2012) reporting a reduction in mean time to first bowel movement by 15.1 hours. Twenty-nine patients per group were enrolled to compensate for possible dropouts.
Statistical analysis was conducted with Stata 14 (Statacorp, College Station, TX, USA). The primary outcome measure was time to first bowel movement. Secondary outcome measures were time to first flatus, duration of hospital stay, pain scores, and cumulative opioid use up to 72 hours post-operatively. The Normality of study endpoint distributions were assessed graphically and with the ShapiroWilk test. Normally distributed variables were reported as mean (SD) and comparisons made by calculating the mean difference and 95%CI between the lidocaine and placebo arms. Non-normally distributed data were reported as the median and inter-quartile range (IQR) and analysed using the Wilcoxon test. Post-operative pain scores and cumulative opioid use were compared between treatment arms at 1, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-operatively. Categorical characteristics were summed as n (%), and analysed using a chi-square or Fishers exact test, as appropriate. A formal comparison of the post-operative pain scores over the total duration of follow-up was made with a generalised estimating equation (GEE).    </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Although i.v. lidocaine is used as a perioperative analgesic in abdominal surgery, evidence of efficacy in terms of surgical recovery, pain scores, and opioid use is limited. The infusion dose and duration remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of a longer low-dose 48-hour infusion regimen on these outcomes. 

Methods
Fifty-eight adult patients undergoing elective open colorectal surgery were randomised into the lidocaine group (1.5 mg kg-1 followed by 1 mg kg-1 h-1 infusion for 48 hours) and control group (administered equal volumes of normal saline). After surgery, patients were given a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) machine and time to first bowel movement (primary outcome) and flatus were recorded. Postoperative pain scores (numeric rating scale) and fentanyl PCA consumption were assessed for 72 post-operative hours.

Results 
There was no significant difference in time to first bowel movement [80.1 (42.2) vs 82.5 (40.4) hours; (P=0.83)], time to first flatus [64.7 (38.5) vs 70.0 (31.2) hours; P=0.57], length of hospital stay [9 (813) vs 11 (914) days; P=0.53], nor post-operative pain scores in the lidocaine vs control arms. Cumulative opioid consumption was significantly lower in the lidocaine vs the control group from 24 hours onwards. At 72 hours, cumulative opioid consumption (mcg fentanyl) in the lidocaine group [1570 (825-3587)] was over 40% lower than in the placebo group [2730 (1778-5327); P=0.039]. 

Conclusion 
A 48-hour low-dose i.v. lidocaine infusion reduces postoperative opioid consumption. This is not associated with faster return of bowel function, hospital discharge, or lower pain scores.
