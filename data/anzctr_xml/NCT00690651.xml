  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Early mobilization
Treatment: surgery - Standard mobilization

Active Comparator: 2 - this group will rest in bed with operated leg well elevated for 48 hour and then mobilize with physiotherapist with aim for discharge home when safe.

Experimental: 1 - mobilize with physiotherapist within 24 hours of surgical fixation of fractured ankle


Treatment: surgery: Early mobilization
pt to get out of bed and mobilize with physiotherapist within 24 hours of surgery. they will be allowed toilet privileges and will go home when safe (as per medical staff and allied health)

Treatment: surgery: Standard mobilization
this group will rest in bed with their leg elevated above their heart for 48 hours post surgery to ankle fracture and will then mobilize with physiotherapist with aim to discharge home.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After a patient has fractured an ankle that then requires surgery, the recommendation is to
      remain in bed, with the operated leg elevated on pillows for 48 hours. This is a
      precautionary measure, as yet unsubstantiated by research, which is thought to minimize ankle
      swelling that can inhibit the healing of the surgical wound. However, prolonged bed rest can
      lead to other complications such as blood clots in the lungs or leg veins, or chest
      infections such as pneumonia. Prolonged bed rest is also known to cause weakness and a loss
      of fitness such that recovery may be slower. In this research the investigators will be
      randomly allocating patients to mobilize within 24 hours post operatively or to rest in bed
      for 48 hours with their leg well elevated. The investigators will measure length of stay and
      wound healing and integrity at 14 days. This study aims to investigate whether getting
      patients out of bed within 24 hours of surgery can accelerate recovery and reduce acute
      hospital length of stay without affecting wound healing. If bed rest for 2 days is not
      necessary, there will be benefits for the patient in terms of general health and ability, and
      for the hospital in terms of cost savings through shorter lengths of stay and patient through
      put. The investigators already know that early mobilization is beneficial following other
      types of orthopedic surgery such as hip fractures. This study aims to investigate if early
      mobilization following surgical management of ankle fractures is safe with specific regard to
      wound integrity and wound outcomes. This study will also investigate the effect of earlier
      mobilization on the length of time spent in the acute hospital and for those discharged
      directly home, the amount and type of support required. If early mobilization is found to be
      safe for wound healing and results in shorter in-hospital stays, this research will provide
      the confidence to endorse a change to current clinical practice.</summary>
