  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recently, a finished product containing a proprietary blend of Phellodendron and Crape Myrtle has been developed. It is believed that this product may aid in the management of blood glucose and allow for increased glucose clearance following an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Such effects may be associated with a reduction in adverse outcomes associated with poor blood glucose management, as well as enhanced glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (to be stored as glycogenan objective of many athletes). In relation to the latter effect, this particular product is purported to act as a nutrient partitioning agent, working to theoretically improve body composition by preferentially shuttling glucose into skeletal muscle as opposed to adipose tissue. The present study sought to investigate the acute effects of this nutritional supplement on serum glucose and insulin in response to an OGTT.</summary>
