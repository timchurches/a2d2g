    <studytitle>Examination of a new needle used to deliver local anaesthetic solution onto peripheral nerves, thus enabling painless surgery to be performed. The visibility of these new needles under guided ultrasound will be assessed.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Examination of a newly developed needle which is more echo-genic than standard needles for use in peripheral nerve blockade. The outcome of this trial will be an assessment of the performance of these new needles when being used for a sciatic nerve block.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Compare two needles in sciatic nerve blockade. A standard 22g stimuplex needle (Standard needle for control) and a new modified 22g needle which has a textured tip (the new intervention being assessed). The needle will be inserted prior to surgery in the conscious patient. The trial is six months and the period of observation will be throughout the duration of surgery and at a 24 hour and 6 week follow up.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control needles are Stimulpex 22g needles. The new needles are modified 22g St Vincent Needle. Both needles will be inserted into the patient, one after the other, in a random order and their ultrasound visibility will be assessed. The local anaesthetic solution will be injected though the second needle onto the peripheral nerve. Nothing will be injected down the first needle.</comparator>

    <sequence>This is a one to one comparison. The comparative assessment of the echo-genicity will be made off line using recorded images. The image assessor will not know which of the needles each image comes from. The comparative needles’ performance will then be assessed by the clinical trial’s co-ordinator.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to perform peripheral nerve blockage a local anaesthetic has to be injected though a needle onto the selected nerve. Ultrasound guidance will help to accurately guide the needle to the selected site of the nerve.  Unfortunately the needle is difficult to see especially when it is introduced at acute angles to the ultrasound beam. Our new needle is hoped to be more echogenic, thus improving the efficacy and safety of peripheral nerve blockade.</summary>
