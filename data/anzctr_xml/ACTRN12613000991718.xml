During the 1a phase of the study, subjects will be enrolled in each of 3 cohorts sequentially: 
1) cohort 1: SUN-101, 1.0 mg/kg subcutaneous, 3 subjects 
2) cohort 2: SUN-101, 1.5 mg/kg subcutaneous, 3 subjects 
3) cohort 3: SUN-101, 2.0 mg/kg subcutaneous, 3 subjects 
All cohorts will receive subcutaneous injections of SUN-101 once daily Monday through Friday, for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off is equal to 1 cycle). A total of (up to) 30 injections, or 3 planned full cycles (total of 12 weeks) will be administered in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the event of a complete response according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), one additional cycle will be administered. In the event of a RECIST  stable disease or a partial response, subjects will continue to receive SUN-101 up to a total 5 cycles (up to 20 additional doses for a maximum total of 50 doses) of treatment until complete response, disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
An additional 24 evaluable subjects will be enrolled at the maximum tolerated dose identified in 1a to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SUN-101 at this recommended dose. Subjects in the phase 1b expansion study will receive SUN-101 subcutaneously on  Monday through Friday for 2 weeks (10 doses per cycle) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) confirmed in Part 1a of this trial, repeated every 4 weeks (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off) for 3 cycles, and up to 5 cycles with partial response  or stable disease, or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If a dose is missed during the two weeks of dosing, it should be made up during the third week. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the phase 1a First-in-Human study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of SUN-101 in subjects with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This will be done by monitoring each participant for study drug treatment-related toxicities at each dose level. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the phase 1b expansion study is to further establish the safety and tolerability of the SUN-101 at the MTD and to explore efficacy endpoints. This will be done by monitoring safety (number and severity of adverse events, laboratory results, vital signs, changes in bowel habits) and tumour assessment (CT scan) and tumour biomarker CA19-9.</outcome>

      <outcome>To describe the pharmacokinetics of SUN-101. 
This will be done by collecting a number of blood and urine samples from participants. 
Phase 1a- 11 blood samples taken at Cycle 1 Day 1 and Day 11 (before study drug dose and every 30 minutes up to 4 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours after study drug dose) and one blood sample taken before the first dose at Cycles 2, 3 and 4. One urine sample collected before study drug dose at Cycle 1 day 1 and a 24 hour urine collection collected at Cycle 1 day 12.
Phase 1b- One sample taken before study drug dose at Cycle 1 day 1 and day 12 and 1 hour after dose on Cycle 1 day 12.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analyses will be provided by dose groups and for all study subjects combined wherever appropriate. For continuous variables, summary statistics will include number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical endpoints will be summarized using number of subjects, frequency, and percentages. 

Safety analyses will be conducted for all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug, whether or not they complete all protocol requirements. Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics. Adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized by dose. Incidence of adverse events occurring during the study will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Adverse events will also be summarized by causality and grade. Serious adverse events will be listed separately. The rate of DLTs per dose level will be presented. All DLTs will be presented in data listings. Descriptive summary statistics will be used to summarize changes in laboratory values and vital signs by dose. Additional analyses will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main goal of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the drug, SUN-101, in patients with pancreatic cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic or locally advanced ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, which has been previously treated with first line chemotherapy. Study details: Participants in the first part of this study (Phase 1a) will be administered SUN-101 in a dose-escalation scheme with cohorts of three patients at each dose level (1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mg/kg). All cohorts will receive injections of SUN-101 once daily Monday through Friday, for 2 weeks, repeated every 4 weeks for up to 5 full cycles (up to 50 injections) depending on response. Participants in the second part of this study (Phase 1b) will be administered SUN-101 at the maximum tolerated dose identified in Phase 1a for up to 5 cycles. SUN-101 is a small molecule which is similar to a compound found naturally in human cells. Laboratory and animal studies suggest that SUN-101 targets and destroys the ductal cells in the pancreas where the tumour grows. Participants will be regularly assessed during treatment in order to assess safety and tolerability. Other goals of this study are to measure the levels of SUN-101 in the blood and urine over time and test whether SUN-101 can slow the growth of, or shrink tumours.</summary>
