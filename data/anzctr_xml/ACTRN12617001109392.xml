  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is an observational study. Thymine test results will not affect any treatment decisions. 

At a scheduled assessment clinic visit, &gt;24 hours prior to the commencement of treatment with 5-FU/capecitabine containing schedules:
A baseline blood sample will be obtained (one 10 ml sample) as well as a baseline spot urine sample. A cheek (buccal) cell sample will also be obtained. This will involve using a cytobrush to take a brushing of the inside of the cheek (like using a toothbrush on the inside of the mouth). This will be done twice (one on each side of the mouth) and will require a mouth wash with water prior to the first brushing. The participants will then be administered thymine (250 mg, oral gelatine capsule) with a drink of water. A cumulative (total) urine sample will be collected for the next 4 hours. 

All patients who have been given the thymine test will then continue on their planned chemotherapy treatment. All patients will be assessed for adverse events related to 5-FU/capecitabine treatment. Information will be collected at each scheduled clinic visit for 8  9 weeks while on normal chemotherapy treatment.

Analysis will involve urine sample for thymine and its metabolite (dihydrothymine or DHT). Cheek cells will be used to assess 5-FU uptake in vitro and genomic DNA (from blood) will be used to analysing variation in the DPYD gene and further analysis of genes associated with 5-FU side effects.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the severity of DMN toxicity, coded as very severe, severe or minimal. All diarrhoea (D), mucositis (M) and neutropenia (N) toxicities will be identified and coded according to CTCAE criteria. Patients with a maximum grade of D, M or N toxicity of 0, 1 or 2 will be coded as minimal DMN toxicity. For patients with a Grade 3 or higher D, M or N toxicity a review will be carried out by a clinical PI (blinded to thymine test results and genomic information). 

The urinary THY/DHT ratio in the severe and very severe DMN toxicity groups combined will be compared to that of the group with minimal DMN toxicity. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Information will be collected at each scheduled clinic visit for 8  9 weeks while on normal chemotherapy treatment.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of the thymine test to the predictive ability of a panel of known deleterious SNP in the DPYD gene: Genomic DNA will be prepared from the blood sample using a PAXgene blood DNA kit. 

The frequency of each SNP will be determined and compared to the published frequencies for Caucasian individuals in dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/). 
Each SNP will be assessed for any departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Each patient will be classified according to whether or not any of the deleterious variants of DPYD were detected in their sample. Agreement between the gene test and the thymine test results (THY/DHT ratio) will described using separate 2x2 tables for the toxicity groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A single blood sample will be collected from each patient at baseline prior to thymine administration. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transmembrane uptake of 5-FU into cells from buccal mucosa: Buccal (cheek) cells will be used to assess 5-FU uptake in vitro using radiolabelled drug.

The amount of transmembrane uptake of 5-FU into buccal mucosal cells from each individual will be reported as pmol.min.10-4 live cells. The range of inter-individual differences in 5-FU transmembrane uptake will be addressed by i) presenting the distribution, and the median and IQ range of the uptake values and ii) by comparing the values in the severe and very severe toxicity group to the minimal toxicity group. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Buccal (cheek) cell sample will be collected once on the day of the thymine test prior to thymine administration (i.e. baseline). The uptake of 5-FU into these cells will then be immediately assessed on the same day as the collection.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on literature and meta-analyses, it is expected that around 25% or 50 of the 200 patients will have Grade 3 diarrhoea, mucositis or neutropenia  (DMN) toxicity (and hence severe or very severe DMN toxicity) and around 8% will have very severe DMN toxicity. Very limited data are available on the variability THY/DHT ratio, however a large effect size (difference in means divided by sd) is essential to give sufficient separation for the test to be clinically useful. To give an indication, with group sizes of 50 and 150, the study would have 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.5 if the variances in groups 1 and 2 were equal. Since a minimum clinically important effect size would be substantially larger than 0.5 in this setting, the sample size should be sufficient to allow for decreases in power due to unequal variances. For analyses of very severe toxicity compared to minimal toxicity the power will be lower as we anticipate only 16 patients in this group (8%). With 16 patients (vs 150 with minimal toxicity) the study would have 80% power to detect effect sizes of around 0.9. We note that prospective pharmacogenomic testing for a single DPYD variant was determined to have clinical utility in a similar sample size, despite gene testing having low sensitivity.  Sample size calculations were carried out in Stata. 

Primary analysis:
The urinary THY/DHT ratio in the severe and very severe DMN toxicity groups combined will be compared to that of the group with minimal DMN toxicity using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. The non-parametric test was chosen because the distribution for the THY/DHT ratio is hypothesized to have much greater variability with positive skew in those with severe toxicity compared to those with minimal toxicity. The test will be one sided (an alternative hypothesis that the ratio is higher in those with more severe toxicity) with a significance level of 0.025.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the ratio of thymine to  dihydrothymine (THY/DHT) measured in a urine sample after a thymine test dose (250 mg, taken orally) can discriminate between patients who tolerate 5-FU treatment and those who experience severe 5-FU related toxicity.</summary>
