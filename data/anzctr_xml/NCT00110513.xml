Experimental: Recombinant Human Antithrombin (rhAT) Infusion - Intravenous infusion of rhAT.


Other interventions: Recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT)
Up to 24 hours prior to the scheduled elective surgical procedure, caesarean section, or delivery induction, each patient will receive an initial intravenous loading dose followed by a continuous intravenous infusion of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) that will target and maintain an AT activity that is &gt; 80% and &lt; 120% of normal. The dosing objective for all study patients is maintenance of the AT activity at &gt; 80% and &lt; 120% of normal during the high-risk period for thromboembolic events. Dosing and dose adjustments will be based on the results of AT activity determinations performed prior to and during treatment.

             disorder).

          2. Patients who have a baseline bilateral ultrasound positive for acute DVT or baseline
             diagnostic testing (if required) that is positive for a thromboembolic event other
             than acute DVT.

          3. Patients who have a known allergy to goats or goat products.

          4. Patients who have participated in a study employing a different investigational drug
             within 30 days of the start of their participation in the current trial.

          5. Patients using fondaparinux sodium or the oral thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, or
             are expected to be treated with fondaparinux sodium or ximelagatran during the study
             period (up to 7 days after stop of treatment).</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency are at increased risk of venous thrombosis
      and pulmonary embolism, particularly during certain high risk procedures. The trial focused
      on patients with confirmed hereditary antithrombin deficiency who were undergoing a surgical
      procedure or induced/spontaneous labor and delivery, and/or caesarean section. The study
      assessed the incidence of thromboembolic events following prophylactic intravenous
      administration of recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT) to patients with hereditary
      antithrombin (AT) deficiency in situations usually associated with a high risk for
      thromboembolic events.</summary>
