Placebo Comparator: Placebo MDPI - Placebo twice a day using a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) for 12 weeks in a double-blind manner.
During the run-in and the treatment periods, all subjects replaced their current rescue medication with albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered dose inhaler (MDI) (90 mcg/actuation) for use on an as needed basis for the relief of asthma symptoms.

Active Comparator: Flovent Diskus 250mcg - Fluticasone propionate (Fp) 250 mcg per dose twice a day (for a total daily dose of 500 mcg) using a multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) for 12 weeks in an open-label manner.
During the run-in and the treatment periods, all subjects replaced their current rescue medication with albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered dose inhaler (MDI) (90 mcg/actuation) for use on an as needed basis for the relief of asthma symptoms.


Treatment: drugs: Fp MDPI
Fp MDPI is an inhalation-driven multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) containing fluticasone propionate (Fp) dispersed in a lactose monohydrate excipient and contained within a reservoir. A metered dose of drug is delivered to a dose cup via an air pulse activated when the cap is opened.
During the treatment period, participants were randomized to 50, 100, 200 or 400 mcg of Fp one inhalation twice a day for a total daily dose of 100, 200, 400 or 800 mcg. Study drug was administered in the morning and in the evening.

Other interventions: Placebo MDPI
Placebo multidose dry powder inhaler (MDPI) in the morning and evening. Placebo MDPI was provided in devices identical in appearance to Fp MDPI.

Treatment: drugs: Flovent Diskus
Flovent Diskus contains the active ingredient fluticasone propionate (Fp). Flovent Diskus 250 mcg was used twice a day, once in the morning and evening, for a total daily dose of 500 mcg of Fp. This therapy was not blinded as the inhaler device was different than the MDPI used in the other treatment arms.

Treatment: drugs: albuterol/salbutamol
A short-acting ß2-adrenergic agonists (SABA), albuterol/salbutamol hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) metered dose inhaler (MDI), was provided to be used as needed for the relief of asthma symptoms during both the run-in and treatment periods (to replace the subject's current rescue medication).
