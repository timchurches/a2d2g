    <interventions>The present study evaluated the efficacy of a psychological intervention, Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) in reducing postoperative pain among Malaysian breast cancer women in Hospital Kuala Lumpur. The patients who fulfilled all the criteria (refer to eligibility criteria) were offered to participate in the study. Once informed consent forms were received, patients were individually randomized into two groups. The first group referred to CBT with Treatment as Usual (TAU) while the second was the wait-list control with TAU. 
The intervention applied the principles of CBT, which targeted to identify patients Automatic Thoughts (AT), emotional regulations and behavioural responses. This intervention followed the basics of psychological module which has been used in Cognitive Behaviour-Pain Management Program (CB-PMP) at Pain Clinic, in Selayang Hospital. In developing an intervention that tailored the needs of the target population in this study, a newer set of information was collated with more focus on psychological preparation towards mastectomy. The current intervention integrated a new of pertinent information which cover the biopsychosocial approach to facilitate main understanding about distress management and optimal recovery.  The focus of the intervention was developed based upon the psychological components which were deemed important by the subject matter experts, namely, clinical psychologists, breast surgeons as well as patients/survivors. Prior to executing the study, some self-report measures along with interviews were held between researcher and experienced survivors who underwent similar surgical procedure. As a result, some inputs and feedback were then finalized to tailor the relevant needs in relation to psychological preparation for mastectomy. Some psychological component in CB-PMP were omitted (for example goal settings) as it did not reflect the needs for women with breast cancer for this study, and novel information (i.e psychoeducation on surgery side-effects, hand exercise) was integrated to the newly developed module. Through this process, which known as the triangulation method, attempts to gain a more meaningful understanding to create an impactful module. It is our assumption that the efforts to ensure an intervention is of useful, feasible and bears important theoretical context, would likely to produce positive outcomes in the study. 
The intervention included simple homework for patients to bring home for several practices, for instance;1) usage of thought diary; 2) record down deep breathing activity in a schedule;3) practice hand exercise (as demonstrated in the sessions). The first and second sessions covered the introduction of breast cancer, biopsychosocial approach to facilitate understanding about the disease, psychoeducation on distress, postoperative pain, and fear over surgery, technique to combat AT using thought diary, and demonstration of relaxation strategy (deep breathing). The presentation was delivered using powerpoint file and hardcopy of notes and relevant leaflets were given in a file for each patient. The third session covered discussion on homework, and this slot attest the patients understanding and retention of knowledge in using the techniques. Also, the session was allocated for group discussion on any question on the skills or related matters. Finally, the last session was allocated for all important information about mastectomy, post-operative care, preparation for self-care during hospitalization and post-discharged, optimal recovery as well as exercise for hand care. In particular, the hand care included steps of hands, neck shoulder stretching and patients were able to practice together in a group for at least 20 minutes. 
The delivery of intervention is by face-to-face sessions with the psychologist. The CBT was decided in a group, rather than individual sessions because patients expressed the importance of an opportunity to share their thoughts with persons with similar experiences. There were four sessions, each lasted 1 hour 15 minutes. The patients attended all four sessions within the two weeks before the surgery was performed,as it was the most feasible choice for them. While that, the other arm/group of the study is known as the control group with TAU. It refers to patients who received three standard pamphlets (given for CBT group), relaxation training of deep breathing and standard treatment of hospital procedures. There was approximately fifteen minutes of brief session with patients to share relaxation training, within a week before surgery. This control or wait-list group refers to those patients, with opportunity of receiving similar sessions as in treatment after the completion of this study.
The researcher had to observe the feasibility of holding the sessions to allow sufficient time for the intervention as well as getting mutual agreement with surgeons on setting the date for surgeries. Utmost importance is to ensure there would be no undesirable whatsoever consequences on patients treatment or health. The intervention was conducted by a clinical psychologist who had five years of experience, who is under supervision of an expert clinical psychologist in the area of cognitive behavior-chronic pain management (who possesses thirteen years of delivering cognitive behavioural pain management programme), and a consultant breast surgeon. There was a supervision on a monthly basis between clinical psychologist and the two professionals to update on the adherence of intervention. Any other matters related to the study were also discussed during supervision. The privacy and confidentiality of information of intervention were protected as the discussions were only for academic purpose. In addition, a clear set of housekeeping rules were also laid out for the respondents as well as research enumerators, matron, nurses and doctors who were involved in the study. The adherence to the sessions for the patients were kept in a log book with details of dates of appointments and follow-up sessions. There was also additional file where patients clinical observations were recorded, and used for reference in discussions for all research team members. 
The sessions for intervention took place at the Health Education seminar room, the Specialist Complex and Ambulatory Care Centre, Level 6, Hospital Kuala Lumpur (SCACC, HKL) or the Anggerik room at the Surgical Ward 11, main building of HKL.

    <comparator>In meeting the ethics requirement set by the CRC Malaysia at the recruitment site, patients in control group were also given minimum information about relaxation strategy (deep breathing) and some pamphlets. These hardcopies were provided from CareUPM a Non-Government Organizations (NGO), under the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). The pamphlets encompass brief information about breast cancer, physical activities, and simple diet guideline for breast cancer. Apart from receiving these information, these patients belong to the wait-list group where they received similar group sessions, after the completion of this study.</comparator>

    <concealment>All patients’ clinical profiles and medical files were checked through to ensure they meet the eligibility criteria. Patients who met all the criteria and consented to join the study would then be randomized. The patient would either be allocated for Group CBT or treatment as usual (TAU). The surgeons encouraged all eligible patients to join the research without knowing the allocation. When the diagnosis was confirmed by the surgeons, the shortlisted patients were briefed with comprehensive information about the study by the principle researcher. An enumerator who is blinded from the research aims, facilitated in screening and interviewing patients who seek for assistance for the baseline measures. Otherwise, patients who understood the instructions filled in the self-report measures individually. </concealment>
    <sequence>Those patients eligible and consented to participate the study were randomly allocated based on a list of numbers which were generated by a computer program. This task was executed in a systematic procedure by a trained enumerator who was not involved in the intervention or trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cancer is the third common cause of death, and it is anticipated that one in twenty women may develop breast cancer or any cancer by the age of 75 (National Cancer Registry Malaysia, 2007). It is a salient illness in which the cancer diagnosis is not only closely associated with death-sentence, but it is an everlasting battle that women have to endure throughout their lives. Despite that pain may not be the most commonly reported symptoms among women with breast cancer, it is a number one feared physical sensation. Studies conducted in Malaysia have revealed that there is a close relationship between pain and functionality (Zubaidah et. al, 2013; Bhuvan et.al, 2013). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in reducing pain and relevant psychological parameters. In particular, this intervention is designed to tailor with the needs of women who would undergo mastectomy (total removal of breast). Having said that, the program acquires a more pragmatic format where patients only had to attend four CBT sessions during standard pre-surgical health management. During the disclosure of diagnosis, women who consented for mastectomy were screened from distress. Once consented to participate this research, they were randomized to either treatment (CBT) or wait-list control group. The former group underwent intensive psychological skills-based in which prepared women for surgical consequences, in addition to group support where discussions were also held with group members on how to self-manage more effectively following surgery. Meanwhile, the latter group had the opportunity to learn deep-breathing and obtained pamphlets which included educational information about breast cancer. It was expected that women attended the treatment group may benefit better than in control group in terms of reduction in post-surgical pain and psychological outcomes such as the level of anxiety and depressive symptoms, level of pain catastrophizing, fear of surgery and quality of sleep. This study ultimately aimed to evaluate psychological therapy as an adjunct treatment that promotes to the quality of life of patients, and serve as a basis for evidence to advocate for a more holistic approach for improved service at hospitals. </summary>
