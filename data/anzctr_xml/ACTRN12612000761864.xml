The leaflet shall be handed to the patient and discussed briefly (5 - 20 min) by the clinic nurse after baseline assessment (demographic and vital signs).</interventions>
    <comparator>A standard A4 trifold health education brochure on diabetes with all the 8 items from the Intervention leaflet as well as additional information on diabetes. This leaflet also includes photographs. The amount and density of information as well as reading difficulty is higher.
