    <interventions>Observational pilot study. 

Patients undergoing elective ophthalmic operations under regional anaesthesia were enrolled in this study after informed consent. 

Standard, waterproof ophthalmic drapes were used to cover the patients during the procedure and oxygen was administered via a modified plastic canister at a flow rate of 6L/min.  

In this study we characterise this elderly population and show patients are exposed to an increased FiO2, FiCO2 and EtCO2 as the operation progressed without adverse events.

The overall duration of the study was 3 months.</interventions>

    <summary>Thirty four patients undergoing elective ophthalmic operations under regional anaesthesia were enrolled in this study after informed consent.  Standard, waterproof ophthalmic drapes were used to cover the patients during the procedure and oxygen was administered via a modified plastic canister at a flow rate of 6L/min.  In this study we characterise this elderly population and show patients are exposed to an increased inspired oxygen (FiO2), inspired carbon dioxide (FiCO2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) level.  The operation progressed without adverse events.</summary>
