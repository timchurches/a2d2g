  <interventions>
    <interventions>The sample is divided in 2 groups: group 1 (G1) and group 2 (G2). Both perform eccentric exercise program for rotator cuff, exercises for scapular stabilizers (especially lower trapezius and anterior serratus) and upper trapezius stretch. The materials used are elastic bands and dumbbells. 

The main difference between the two groups is the intensity of the exercise accomplished: G1 overcomes the exercise without any pain and G2 performs exercise with pain (never exceeding 40mm according to the Visual Analogue Scale, where 0mm is absence of pain and 100mm is worst pain experienced).

Exercises:
-Eccentric shoulder abductors.
-Eccentric and concentric external and internal shoulder rotators.
-Inferior Glide: isometric exercise (lower trapezius).
-Dynamic Hug (anterior serratus).
-Upper trapezius stretch.

The exercise protocol is performed during 4 weeks, 5 times a week (one session per day from Monday to Friday, and Saturday and Sunday rest). Each patient is scheduled to have 20 sessions during the 4 week exercise period. The format of sessions is individual one-on-one sessions with a physiotherapist. All of them are supervised by physiotherapists of the research team to ensure adherence to treatment and proper performance. Also, the physiotherapists will take track of the patients that follow the treatment each day. 

Patients perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each abductor and rotator exercise and for the Dynamic Hug. Also, 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 5 seconds of contraction for the Inferior Glide. The rest between sets is twice as long of a set. Finally, the upper trapezius stretch is performed 30 seconds for a total of 3 times. 

The sessions take place at health centres of Hospital de Manises, Valencia (Spain). Each session will last approximately 40 minutes.
Physiotherapists of the research team perform 2 individual assessments (one-on-one consultation) with each patient: The first assessment before starting the first session, and the other at the end of the 20 sessions. 

The variables assessed are shoulder pain (with the Visual Analogue Scale), the shoulders active range of motion with the use of a goniometer and shoulder function using the Constant-Murley test.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1 is the control active group. The patient perform the same exercises than the other group, but with the maximum load that allows exercise with no pain (Visual Analogue Scale = 0/100mm). If pain appears during exercise the patient must stop immediately and decrease the load using less resistant elastic bands or dumbbells.</comparator>

    <concealment>A doctor determines if a subject is eligible for inclusion in the trial and refers patients to rehabilitation. The doctor must not know to which group they belong, since this process is done randomly and is completely in charge the team of physiotherapist. The process randomness is completely private and the patient distribution kept in sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>
    <sequence>A process of simple randomization is used to create the random order for the allocation of patients into different groups: There is a bag with 22 sealed opaque envelopes, 11 envelopes have “group 1” written inside, and 11 envelopes “group 2” and completely mixed inside the bag. When each subject reads and signs the informed consent, a physiotherapist randomly opens a sealed envelope and informs the other group members to which group does this patient belongs.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>It is a randomized controlled pilot study, so the sample size is established according to other available pilot trials on eccentric training in subacromial syndrome.
This trial is conducted with a final objective of treatment.
The analysed variables are: age, sex, height, weight, shoulder pain pre-intervention and post-intervention, shoulder range of motion pre and post-intervention (flexion, extension, abduction and adduction), shoulder function pre and post- intervention. 
The statistical analysis is performed in the SPSS computer:
1.	Checking normality of the quantitative variables with the Shapiro-Wilks test. 
2.	Descriptive statistics. The calculation of mean, standard deviation, median and quartiles. 
3.	Checking homogeneity of variance of the groups: Student T-test or T-Welch. Mann-Whitney U test. Fishers exact test. 
4.	Comparison of pre and post-intervention outcomes: Student T-test for independent samples and Wilcoxon test. 
5.	The Student T-test for independent samples and the Mann-Whitney U test are performed to analyse the differences and effectiveness of interventions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial compares two eccentric exercise protocols, scapular stability and flexibility by applying them in 2 groups of patients with subacromial syndrome.
The main objective is to determine whether there are differences in shoulder pain and range of motion, following an eccentric exercise program (with a load that produces pain during the exercise not exceed 40mm on a 0-100mm Visual Analogue Scale), scapular stability and flexibility exercises, compared to other eccentric exercise program (with a load that does not produce pain), scapular stability and flexibility exercises, in patients with subacromial syndrome.
The secondary objective is to determine whether there are differences in shoulder function between the two groups following the implementation of the exercise programs.
Besides it is evaluated the short-term effectiveness of a protocol based on eccentric exercise rotator cuff, scapular stability exercises and stretching, in order to guide clinical practice in patients with subacromial syndrome.
