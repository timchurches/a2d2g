      <outcome>Composite outcome measure of intra-cardiac shock frequency and frequency of anti-tachycardia pacing - Hypothesis Does video assisted minimal access approach for left cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with an ICD implanted and on amiodarone for secondary prevention at high risk of sudden death reduce shock frequency and anti-tachycardia pacing compared to optimal medical treatment - a prospective study.
Primary End Point Intra-cardiac shock frequency and frequency of anti-tachycardia pacing over a 12 month period commencing from time of randomisation to a minimum of 365 days post-study entry.
The ICD will be interrogated as per clinical practice prior to signing the Informed Consent form as well as at the 6 and 12 month study follow-up visits. The device will be interrogated within 24 hours of delivery of an intra-cardiac shock or if the patient feels there has been therapy delivery (e.g. ATP).</outcome>

             guidelines.

          -  Patients with single, dual chamber or biventricular defibrillators (CRT-D) will be
             included.

          -  Intra-cardiac shock or ATP for VT or VF:

               -  For study inclusion the patient must have had a recent intra-cardiac shock or ATP

               -  For study inclusion the patient must be on optimised amiodarone therapy (=3
                  months) or have documented evidence of amiodarone intolerance.

               -  For study inclusion the Intra-cardiac shock or ATP for VT or VF must not be
                  secondary to a reversible biochemical or drug induced arrhythmia.

          -  Ejection fraction of = 40% measured = 6 months prior to the Baseline Visit.

          -  Surgical review to ensure patient is suitable for surgery.
