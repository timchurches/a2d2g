  <interventions>
    <interventions>NP202 oral capsules

Part A: 5 sequential cohorts of healthy volunteers each receiving a single dose of 50, 200, 600, 1000 or 1600mg and followed up to Day 7.

Part B: 3 cohorts of healthy volunteers each receiving one dose per day for 14 days, and followed up to Day 21. Dose levels to be determined after Part A is complete, based on review of Part A safety and PK data.  Each cohort will have a single dose level.

All subjects (Parts A and B) will be resident in clinic for dosing. This will ensure dosing compliance.

In each cohort 75% of subjects will receive NP202 and 25% will receive placebo.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo capsules containing microcellulose.

As this is a blinded study dosing periods and times will be the same as for subjects receiving NP202.

In each cohort 25% of subjects will receive placebo and 75% will receive NP202</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of repeat doses of NP202 when administered to healthy volunteers (Part B) as assessed by vital signs, medical history, physical examination, laboratory evaluations, 12-lead ECG, evaluation of adverse events and concomitant medications.
