    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006) + TACE - Sorafenib was to be orally administered as 2 x 200 mg tablets bid (twice daily). Patients were then also treated with Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) performed with DC Bead (300 to 500 microns) and doxorubicin (150 mg) between 3 to 7 days after the first dose of sorafenib, TACE was also performed on Days 1 (+ 4 days) of cycle 1, 3, 7, 13 and then every 6 cycles thereafter (an optional TACE procedure could be performed between Day 1 of Cycle 7 and Cycle 13 and between Day 1 of Cycles 13 and 19, if deemed necessary by the Investigator.)

Placebo Comparator: Placebo + TACE - Placebo was to be orally administered as 2 tablets bid (twice daily). Patients were then also treated with TACE performed with DC Bead (300 to 500 microns) and doxorubicin (150 mg) between 3 to 7 days after the first dose of placebo, TACE was also performed on Days 1 (+ 4 days) of cycle 1, 3, 7, 13 and then every 6 cycles thereafter (an optional TACE procedure could be performed between Day 1 of Cycle 7 and Cycle 13 and between Day 1 of Cycles 13 and 19, if deemed necessary by the Investigator.)


Treatment: drugs: Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006)
800 mg sorafenib (4 tablets) will be taken daily (400mg b.i.d. [twice daily], 2 tablets). Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) using DC Bead

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
4 tablets of placebo will be taken daily (2 tablets b.i.d). TACE using DC Bead

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Progression (TTP) - Independent Radiological Review (Primary Analysis) - TTP is defined as the time (days) from randomization to radiological confirmed disease progression. Participants without progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants still alive at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of last contact.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Untreatable Progression (TTUP) - Time to untreatable progression (TTUP) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to untreatable progression. Participants without untreatable progression at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization of the first participant until 28 months later (cut-off date)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Vascular Invasion/Extrahepatic Spread (TTVI/ES) - Time to vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread (TTVI/ES) was defined as the time (days) from randomization to vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread. Participants without vascular invasion/extrahepatic spread at the time of analysis were censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tumor Response - Independent Radiological Review - Tumor Response was defined as the number of participants with a confirmed Complete Response (CR)=disappearance of all clinical and radiological tumor lesions, Partial Response (PR)= at least 30% decrease in sum of the longest diameters (LD) of tumor lesions, Stable Disease (SD)= neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase for progressive disease, or Progressive Disease (PD)=at least 20% increase in the sum of LD of measured lesions, observed during trial period assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.</outcome>

    <summary>This study will look at whether our drug (sorafenib) in combination with chemotherapy
      delivered directly into your tumor using beads (DC Bead) will slow the progression of the

      the adverse effects that normally occur with chemotherapy.</summary>
