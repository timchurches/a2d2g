    <studytitle>A randomized controlled trial of a modified neurolinguistic programming technique to improve emotional control in patients with depression in primary care.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For patients with depression in primary care with a PHQ-9 score between 10 and 20 will be given a modified neurolinguistic programming technique and advised to exercise regularly and given sleep hygiene advice versus advised to exercise regularly and given sleep hygiene advice with the outcome at 6 weeks of a PHQ-9 score &lt;7 and the dichotomous outcome of do you feel in control of your emotions yes/no</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Interventions
1.Coached in a drug free process coaching the client (one on one basis) on how to take themselves out of a state of depression with a process from Neuro-linguistic Counselling underlied with Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP). The clients will be shown a video coaching them through what depression is and a strategy for transitioning from depression to being happy. Clients will get to observe themselves internally as they transition through these states.
a.	Observing a state that is symptomatic                     of                  depression.
b.	Observe a state that is symptomatic of being happy.
c.	Coached on how to get out of the state of                  being depressed.
d.	Coached on staying in a state of being happy.
e.	Follow up by text reminding of the skills they have learned with a short statement.
f.	One week follow up to check client progress and reinforce their new awareness.
g.	A final interview at the end of the 6 week clinical trial.
h.	The intervention group will also get the sleep and exercise programme

2.	Ask the participant what message they would like to give the world eg I am an interesting person; I am capable and competent. The ask them to put that message on their forehead eg figuratively tatooed on their forehead.
The intervention will take about 45 minutes (including coaching and consenting and gathering of baseline information) to administer along with the questionnaires for the study. At the later visits the duration will be about 30 minutes. The training will be  done by a linguistic Programming (NLP) therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sleep and Exercise Programme-for intervention and control group
1.Sleep hygiene instructions and rationale
Instruction Rationale
Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that can delay sleep onset and impair sleep quality; people vary in their ability to metabolise these substances from their system; some people use alcohol to help them get to sleep because it relaxes them, but it may cause awakenings and reduce sleep quality later in the sleep
Period.Limit  of caffeine to 1 cup of coffee in the morning (if at all), avoid alcohol and cigarettes at night, and limit other substances that can affect sleep
People do not fall asleep if their brain is wide awake, so going to bed before they are sleepy leads to frustration at not being able to sleep, which can further delay sleep onset; peoples sleep patterns and needs may not match those of their bed partners 

Avoid going to bed until you are drowsy and ready to sleep

Napping reduces the sleep pressure that builds up during the day to the point where a threshold is reached  and we are ready to sleep; napping may delay the time of readiness for sleep and lead to erratic bedtimes, especially if the person can sleep in to compensate for a later bedtime (leading to a domino effect for the
day after); if naps have been taken during the day, and the usual bedtime is kept, sleep onset may be delayed, leading to frustration and anxiety, which further prolongs sleep onset.

Avoid napping during the day

Regular daily exercise can help improve sleep, but avoid Exercise too close to a sleep period can serve as an arousal stimulus, delaying sleep onsetexercise late in the evening

The bed should be comfortable, the temperature not too hot or cold, the room dark, and noise minimised;
discomfort, being too hot or cold, noise, and light can disrupt sleep

Ensure that the bedtime environment is comfortable and
conducive to sleep

Looking at a computer screen in the hours before bed may delay sleep onset (the light waves emitted are thought to reduce the production of melatonin, a hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland to promote sleep); looking at a clock during awakenings can delay sleep onset by contributing to frustration at being awake (lit clocks may also contribute arousal stimuli to the brain); if co-sleepers are disturbing sleep (by excessive movements or snoring) they probably warrant their own assessment for sleep disorders 

Think about computer screens, clocks, and co-sleepers
The thought behind this idea is that bed needs to be associated with being asleep not with being awake and having difficulty getting to sleep
If not asleep within 15-20 minutes, get out of bed and return only when drowsy.

3.	Exercise 
a.	Participants will be asked to do regular exercise that involves an activity such as brisk walking for 30 minutes at least 3 times per week.

4. The time taken to give the control intervention at the first visit will be about 15 minutes and at visits at 1 week 13 weeks they will take 5 to 10 minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be conducted using a 2-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial. Randomisation will be at the level of the individual patient. Depresssed participants will be offered one of two interventions to make them blind to their actual intervention. Intervention: One group will get the modified NLP technique, and the control group will be usual care. (Participants will be encouraged not to change their medication during the study and if they choose to do so to discuss that with their GP).</summary>
