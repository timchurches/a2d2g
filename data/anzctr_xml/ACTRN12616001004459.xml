  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). Arm 2: Modified Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (MCBT). CBT is administered by Clinical Psychologists once-weekly over 12 weeks on an individual 60 minute basis. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy includes psychoeducation, exposure to trauma memories, and cognitive restructuring of themes related to traumatic experiences. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.

    <comparator>MCBT is administered by Clinical Psychologists once-weekly over 12 weeks on an individual 60 minute basis. MCBT includes psychoeducation, exposure to trauma memories, cognitive restructuring of themes related to traumatic experiences, and strategies in emotion management. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after a 6-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9 months.

    <statisticalmethods>We calculate needing 50 patients per cell with power of 70%, to obtain an effect-size at .7 to detect a difference of 8 points on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. The primary focus of analyses will be on intent-to-treat analyses. Using SPSS version 23, hierarchical linear models (HLM) will be used to study differential effects of each treatment condition because to allow the number of observations to vary between participants, which effectively handles missing data. Linear and quadratic time effects, treatment condition, and their interaction are in the autoregressive models. Fixed effects parameters will be tested with the Wald test (t-test) and 95% confidence intervals. Effect sizes will be calculated using recommendations for multilevel models, with the formula: d=B*time _ /raw score of pretreatment standard deviation. Analyses focus on the primary (PTSD Scale) and secondary (BDI, PTCI) outcomes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Police are exposed to major stressors in the line of their work. They are at elevated risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with approximately 10% of police suffering the condition. The nature and pattern of trauma exposure amongst police is different to those experienced by other populations.  They suffer repeated exposure to trauma, may witness individuals who have been badly hurt, directly threatened themselves or be required to seriously wound others.  Hence, their response to trauma is often anger and guilt, rather than the fear often described by members of the general population exposed to one off, trauma.  There is currently limited evidence of optimal treatment of PTSD in police. In the absence of evidence, there is a critical need for controlled trials of optimal interventions to assist police with PTSD. This study conducts a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavior therapy for (CBT) police to determine the optimal means to enhance treatment response.. This study will provide the much-needed evidence to shape policy and practice.
Police with PTSD will be randomized to receive either 12 sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy delivered by clinical psychologists Treatment is based on 12 weekly 1-hour sessions.  Police will be randomised to either CBT, which involves focusing on reliving trauma memories, as well as teaching  strategies to reframe common maladaptive appraisals.  Alternately, police will be randomised to a modified version of CBT that will also include depression treatment strategies. Police will be assessed prior to treatment, immediately following treatment, and again 6 months later. These data will provide much-needed evidence for treating police officers and provide police, fire-fighting, and ambulance services direction on how to limit PTSD in their organisations.
