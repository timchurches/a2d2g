  <interventions>
    <interventions>High (25-50% incorporation rate) and Low (&lt;1%) lupin kernel flour fortified foods provided and consumed for a period of 12 months. In the high lupin group we are aiming for 60g per day of lupin kernel flour from the foods, contributing approximately an additional 25 grams of protein and 15 grams of fibre per day. In the low lupin (placebo) group we are aiming for  &lt;1g per day of lupin kernel flour from the foods, contributing negligible protein and fibre from lupin. This should result in a difference of  &gt;20g protein and &gt;10g of fibre per day between the low lupin and 
high lupin groups attributed to the difference in incorporation of lupin kernel flour. 

Dietetic weight management advice for the first 4 months of the study for both groups.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim
To investigate the effects of regular consumption of foods enriched in LKF during and following energy restriction on body composition and heart disease risk factors in overweight individuals.

Hypotheses

Regular consumption of foods enriched in protein and fibre derived from LKF during energy restriction will enhance the loss of body weight and body fat mass and result in greater improvements in heart disease risk factors in overweight individuals

Regular consumption of foods enriched in protein and fibre derived from LKF will improve the long-term maintenance of weight loss and cardiovascular health benefits in overweight individuals</summary>
