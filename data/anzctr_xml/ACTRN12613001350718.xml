  <interventions>
    <interventions>A research assistant will initiate Skype contact via an iPad between the aged care facility resident and their relative or carer twice per week for 2 weeks. The relatives or carers are asked that the call duration be no longer than 20 minutes however it is at the discretion of the resident and their relative or carer if the call is of a shorter duration.  For consistency, the same relative or carer is required to particpate for the duration of the interventions.  There is a wash-out period of at least one week between treatments.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One physical or verbally agitated behaviour will be recorded as being present or absent during 30 second intervals over a 60 minute period. The Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) is used the establish the target behaviour to be observed. The measure is conducted with nursing staff familiar with the resident's behaviours and assesses the frequency and type of agitated behaviours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations commence 20 minutes prior to intervention and depending on the length of the intervention period, observations continue for at least 20 minutes post intervention.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Affect.  A modified version of Positive and Negative Affect Schedule is used to assess affect.  The types of affect cover various emotions (Including: Pleasure, Contentment, Anger, Fear or Anxiety, Sadness) and Neutral affect.  The observer records the predominant affect within each 30 second interval. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations commence 20 minutes prior to intervention and depending on the length of the intervention period, observations continue for at lest 20 minutes post intervention.  For each 30 second interval the predominant type of affect is recorded.  The overall duration is 60 minutes.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Type of Engagement.  The study distinguishes between 4 types of defined engagement based on the Menorah Park Engagement Scale: non-engagement, self-engagement, passive engagement and active engagement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Observations commence 20 minutes prior to intervention and and depending on the length of the intervention period, observations continue for at lest 20 minutes post intervention.  For each 30 second interval the predominant type of engagement is recorded (i.e. Active, Passive, Non Engagement and/or Self Engagement). The overall duration of the observations is 60 minutes.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A participant needs to be in the aged care facility for at least 3 months, have a history of dementia and be stable re: medical, psychological and medication regime.  Also the agitated behaviours should occur several times an hour on a daily basis and are not associated with nursing activities (i.e. ADLs).  The behaviours are also not due to pain, physical illness, depression or psychosis</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will compare the effects of Skype (Trademark) and regular telephone conversations with a family member on the levels of agitation, mood and engagement shown by aged care residents with dementia and an agitated behaviour. Conversations with a family member will be held in random order via Skype (Trademark) computer software and regular audio-only telephones on four occasions each. Conversations will last for a maximum of 20 minutes. A researcher will conduct observations before, during and after the conversations to record the presence or absence of the target behaviour and residents engagement  and affect.</summary>
