  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a quasi-experimental interventional study will be conducted over a five year period (2016-2021). We will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial in ten communities in the Great South Coast Region of Victoria.. Five communities will be randomised into the study in year one and all communities will be included in year 3. An additional group of 13 external communities from other regions of Victoria with no specific interventions will provide an external comparison and will help assess the potential diffusion of the intervention between regions within this trial. We will assess whether the adoption of systems change interventions rapidly increases community capacity to apply evidence-informed action across community systems. The primary outcome is childhood obesity prevalence and this  will be collected by the community-led monitoring system already established with partners, AIs and CIs to this grant. In 2015, baseline data were collected from 3,000 children (90% participation rate (PR)) across the 10 study communities in the Great South Coast Region of Victoria, Australia. The intervention is intensive training and support within each intervention community oriented around strengthening the WHO systems building blocks (leadership, workforce development, resources, partners and networks,intelligence). This includes mapping existing systems and using these maps to develop whole of system change with community members (using the Group Model Building Process described below) and implementation support to optimize interventions. In each community the system intervention will be implemented with community members (parents and leaders from local government, education, clubs, agencies and business) with the jurisdiction or who can influence on environments in which children experience the key risk factors for obesity. Partners will convene new and existing coalitions of community leaders who have the authority, capacity, and networks to lead systems change across the community. These leaders have prioritized changing community systems to healthier food choices, physical activity and childhood obesity prevention. The workshops and evaluation sessions will be facilitated by a systems science specialist from Deakin University plus a number of other researchers from the Global Obesity Centre at Deakin University. Participants will be involved in the following activities over a 6-week period with follow up sessions every six months. 3hr Workshop 1: Background, evidence, plan presentation; fill in community capacity index; develop system logic model for causes of childhood obesity in their community (outcomes evidence translation, baseline measurements, base systems model).3hr Workshop 2: Further evidence presentation; fill in social network analysis questionnaires; validation of system logic model on contextualised causes of childhood obesity constructed from the previous workshop (outcomes - further baseline data and knowledge translation and first validation of model). Half-day workshop: Steering Group recruits 100 champions from across the community who validate the systems logic model and identify priority actions for each sub-systems related to them (outcomes; wider community validation of model and action plans). 2-hour workshop: review the consolidated priority actions (outcomes; translate actions to institutional action plans). 1-2hr evaluation sessions: 6-monthly sessions to identify subsystem changes and modifications to the systems map (outcomes; follow up systems measures). Actions are developed and implemented by community working groups. Examples of community-led interventions include removing sugar sweetened beverages from health services, schools and local council workplaces; introducing healthy procurement processes for local governments; making drinking water freely accessible in public places; setting up no drive zones 800m from schools to encourage active transport. The community working groups are formed from the 100 community champions. These champions volunteer to any working group to which they have the time, remit and capacity to contribute.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods> The effect of the intervention on the main outcome (BMI-z) will be assessed using a linear mixed model with cluster as a random effect (community) and time (step), intervention and interaction of time*intervention as fixed effects. Because enrolment in intervention is staggered data will be analysed following two different approaches: 1) an intention to treat principle irrespective of when the enrolment effectively occurred; and 2) considering actual time enrolled. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by fitting a generalized linear mixed model with link and distribution selected according to the variable. Missing outcomes (we anticipate will be sparse due to the selection criteria child present at school on the day of data collection) will be managed using an inverse probability weighting approach.

Based on school enrolment data, we estimate that there are 4,757 children in the GSCRV in Grades 2, 4 or 6. Using an opt-out consent process, which delivers a 90% response rate, we expect to measure more than 3,000 children at each study wave in the 10 communities involved in the study. Taking a conservative approach, we expect at least 3,000 observations at each step and 9,000 across the three study data points. BMI-z standard deviation (1.2) and intra-cluster correlation (0.027) were estimated from our baseline external control study of &gt;2,500 Victorian school children (2014-2015). Under the stepped wedge design (10 clusters, three data collection points, 5 clusters randomized to intervention at step one) and an average of 300 children in each cluster) the minimum detectable difference in BMI-z between groups with 80% power will be 0.13. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Whole of Systems Trial Of Prevention Strategies for childhood obesity: WHO STOPS
childhood obesity
The goals of this grant are to: 1) strengthen community action for childhood obesity prevention, and 2) measure the impacts of increased action on risk factors for childhood obesity. This proposal addresses the lesson that the impact of previous successful interventions would be optimally sustained by increasing community ownership (community-built interventions), using existing community funding (avoiding the state and federal feast/famine of prevention funding), and building on existing community assets (systems and networks). We propose that permanent reductions in childhood obesity are possible if the complex and dynamic causes of obesity are well understood and addressed through increased community ownership and responsibility. Working with local partners this research tests whether new ways of embedding best practice for obesity prevention into existing community systems (e.g. health, workplaces, local council, schools) will
achieve efficient and effective implementation and sustainability. In our development work  we have evolved a facilitated, community engagement process which; creates an agreed systems map of childhood obesity causes for a community; identifies intervention opportunities through leveraging the dynamic aspects of the system; and, converts these understandings into community-built, systems-oriented action plans. Throughout this
process systems data are collected for measuring systems changes over time. Our  experience to date has been that this process rapidly increases capacity of community leaders to use systems thinking for community-wide obesity prevention. Consequently we have seen changes at multiple levels of systems (e.g. a council policies banning sugar sweetened beverages and improving water quality and application of systems thinking for health across ACT primary schools and among 30,000 members of a state emergency service). We will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial in ten communities in the GSCRV. Five communities will be randomised into the study in year one and all communities will be included in year 3. An additional group of 13 external communities from other regions of Victoria with no specific interventions will provide an external comparison and will help assess the potential diffusion of the intervention between regions within this trial. We will assess whether the adoption of systems change interventions rapidly increases community capacity to apply evidence-informed action across community systems. The primary outcome is childhood obesity prevalence and this
will be collected by the community-led monitoring system. It is hypothesised that a systems intervention for childhood obesity will be effective in its impact, efficient in its implementation, scalable in its delivery, and sustainable in its longevity. </summary>
