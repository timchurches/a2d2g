    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Late Asthmatic Response (LAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum FEV1 Between 4-10 Hours (Hrs) Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period - Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen (administered by inhalation) 1 hr after dosing on Day 21. Minimum FEV1 over 4-10 hours post-allergen challenge (minimum LAR) is the minimum value of all of the post-saline time points between 4 and 10 hrs post-allergen challenge, inclusive of the 4 hr and 10 hr timepoints (i.e., minimum over 4 hrs, 4.5 hrs, 5 hrs, 5.5 hrs, 6 hrs, 6.5 hrs, 7 hrs, 7.5 hrs, 8 hrs, 8.5 hrs, 9 hrs, 9.5 hrs, and 10 hrs). Absolute change from saline in minimum FEV1 was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value. After inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline value. Least squares means were obtained by adjusting for period and participant and period Baselines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 21 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 197)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>LAR: Absolute Change From Saline in Weighted Mean (WM) FEV1 Between 4-10 Hrs Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 1 hour after dosing on Day 21. LAR FEV1 was measured 4 hrs, 4.5 hrs, 5 hrs, 5.5 hrs, 6 hrs, 6.5 hrs, 7 hrs, 7.5 hrs, 8 hrs, 8.5 hrs, 9 hrs, 9.5 hrs, and 10 hrs post-allergen challenge on Day 21. Absolute change from saline in WM FEV1 was calculated as the area under the curve divided by the relevant time interval and subtracting the saline FEV1 value. After inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline value. Least squares means were obtained by adjusting for period and participant and period Baselines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 21 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 197)</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Early Asthmatic Response (EAR): Absolute Change From Saline in Minimum FEV1 Between 0-2 Hrs Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 1 hr after dosing on Day 21. Minimum FEV1 over 0-2 hrs post-allergen challenge (Minimum EAR) is the minimum value of all of the post-allergen challenge timepoints up to and including 2 hours post-allergen challenge (i.e., minimum over 5 minutes (min), 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 45 min and 1 hr, 1.5 hrs, and 2 hrs. Absolute change from saline in minimum FEV1 was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value. After inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline value. Least squares means were obtained by adjusting for period and participant and period Baselines.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EAR: Absolute Change From Saline in Weighted Mean FEV1 Between 0-2 Hrs Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 1 hr after dosing on Day 21. The EAR FEV1 was measured 0 minutes (min), 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hr, 1.5 hrs, and 2 hrs post-allergen challenge on Day 21. Least squares means were obtained by adjusting for period and participant and period Baselines. Absolute change from saline in WM FEV1 was calculated as the area under the curve divided by the relevant time interval and subtracting the saline FEV1 value. After inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline value.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum Percent Change From Saline in FEV1 Between 0-2 Hrs, Following the 1-hr Post-treatment Allergen Challenge on Day 21 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants were exposed to an allergen 1 hr after dosing on Day 21. FEV1 was measured 0 minutes (min), 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 20 min, 30 min, 45 min, 1 hr, 1.5 hrs, and 2 hrs post-allergen challenge on Day 21. Maximum percent change was calculated as the minimum FEV1 minus the saline FEV1 value divided by the saline FEV1 multiplied by 100. After inhalation of saline, 3 single measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline FEV1 value.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 21 of each treatment period (up to Study Day 197)</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Provocative Concentration of Methacholine Estimated to Result in a 20% Reduction in FEV1 (PC20) on Day 22 of Each Treatment Period - FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Participants inhaled doubling increments of methacholine until a &gt;=20% fall in FEV1 from the saline value was achieved. After inhalation of saline, 3 measurements of FEV1 were recorded; the maximum FEV1 value was taken as the saline value.</outcome>
