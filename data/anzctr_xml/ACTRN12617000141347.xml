  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a mobile-phone application called "Sleep Ninja" which is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for Insomnia, and has been designed to help young people with sleep disturbances. The intervention has been gamified such that user completes six training sessions, which teach them strategies to assist with healthy sleep patterns. The material that is covered includes:  psychoeducation, stimulus control, emphasis on regularity in sleep-wake cycles, sleep hygiene, behavioural activation to encourage night-time sleepiness and sleep-focused cognitive therapy. Each training session goes for 5-10 minutes and needs to be completed once in every 3-7 days in order for the user to progress to more challenging levels. This core learning component is supplemented by homework exercise that involve tracking sleep via use of an electronic sleep diary. The app also sends reminders to the user about when they should commence their wind-down routine before bed, provides a weekly update on their progress, includes a wide range of helpful sleep tips as well as a bedtime meditation recording. Sleep Ninja is fully-automated and is used independently by young people for 3-6 weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to evaluate a recently developed mobile phone application (app) designed to reduce adolescent sleep problems, which are a common precursor to the onset of mental health problems. This project will investigate whether the sleep app is a feasible and acceptable tool to improve adolescent sleep, and whether there are any secondary effects on depression and anxiety. 

The app was developed by the research team, in collaboration with young people, who were consulted in a series of focus groups. We have used the information provided by adolescents to inform the concept and features of the app, which delivers evidence-based psychological strategies to address sleep problems, based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia. The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the app, Sleep Ninja, effectively reduces sleep problems experienced by young people with possible capacity to prevent common mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.
