  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Ventilated Patients in the intensive care unit are often difficult to wean and liberate from the ventilator.
A new mode of ventilation called PAV+ has advantages over Pressure Support ventilation and may facilitate patients weaning.The study will be a randomised trial comparing the above two modes of ventilation in patients suitable for weaning.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have been ventilated for &gt; 48hrs and are suitable for spontaneous breathing will be randomised into either; 
Arm 1.Proportional Assist Ventilation  ( PAV+) ventilation or 
Arm 2. Pressure Support ( PS) ventilation arm.
Once assigned to either the PAV+arm or PS arm the patients will remain on their assigned mode of ventilation throughout the duration of their mechanical weaning. The duration of each participants' mechanical weaning will differ on a case by case basis.

The PAV+ intervention differs from the standard PS treatment in that the software in the ventilator delivering PAV+ mode of  ventilation measures resistance and elastance of the airway.Studies suggest this software may improve patient ventilator synchrony.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Control treatment will be pressure support ventilation and this is what has been historically used as a ventilation weaning strategy in our Intensive Care Unit (ICU)</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate if PAV+ leads to less ventilator time when compared to pressure support ventilation</outcome>
      <timepoint>This timepoint will be assessed from randomisation to completion of mechanical ventilation after  the patient is extubated</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.ICU length of stay.
This will be assessed from  the medical records</outcome>
      <timepoint>This timepoint is from randomisation until time of ICU discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2: Hospital length of stay
This will be assessed from  the medical records</outcome>
      <timepoint>This timepoint is from randomisation until time of hospital discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU mortality
Medical records and patient charts</outcome>
      <timepoint>mortality during ICU stay</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>re intubation rate
Medical records will be reviewed</outcome>
      <timepoint>re intubation within 48 hours extubation
Once patients are removed from the ventilator and the endotracheal tube is removed  it will be recorded through chart review as to how many patients required to be placed on the ventilator again,having failed extubation and liberation from the ventilator</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
