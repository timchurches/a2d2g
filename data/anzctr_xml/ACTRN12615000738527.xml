  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a peripheral intravenous catheter admitted to medical, surgical and maternity services, within the preceding 24 hour period will be identified prospectively. Consenting patients will have demographic data collected: e.g. admitting diagnosis, co-morbidities, skin and vein condition,  cannula insertion details. Participants will be reviewed by a research nurse second daily and other risk factors collected: e.g. antibiotic type and dosage, flushing regime, continuous or intermittent intravenous fluid administration, dressing and other securement types of both catheter and tubing, presence of extension tubing or 3-way taps, catheter type and size, patient factors such as mobility status, presence of delirium. Participants will be monitored until discharge from hospital or until they have a central venous access device inserted.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) failure will be considered to have occurred if the catheter was an unplanned removal from any cause (includes infiltration, blockage, phlebitis, accidental removal or suspected infection). This information will be collected by the research nurse on second daily review from either direct observation, consultation with the clinical staff or review of medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored on a second daily basis during hospital admission or until insertion of a CVL.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of catheter replacement</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected at the completion of study from information in our existing data set</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Length of hospital stay</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of discharge will coincide with date of discharge from study and be collected prospectively by research nurse, unless the patient has a CVL inserted, in which case this data will be collected retrospectively from medical records at study completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Type of bacteria colonising peripheral catheters or on the skin will be collected from hospital records as per current clinical practice. A sub-study of a random 10% of PIVC and skin swabs will be collected at catheter removal.  The skin swabs will be streaked onto blood agar, and IVD segments roll-plated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Type of bacteria colonising peripheral catheters will be collected by research nurse from medical records or the sub-study data set at the time of discharge or insertion of CVL. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rate of peripheral intravenous catheter failure at the RBWH is high (around 40%). When a catheter fails, before treatment has been completed, a new catheter is generally required, causing discomfort to the patient and considerable cost to the organisation. There are a number of reasons for catheter failure, some of which may be preventable with appropriate intervention. At present we do not have a clear idea of the causes of catheter failure at the RBWH. The proposed study will follow a cohort of patients from admission to discharge and closely monitor any IV access events associated with their stay. Patients with catheter failure will be compared to a group who do not have catheter failure, to identify opportunities for intervention.
