  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sleep disturbances and disorders, particularly Sleep Apnoea will be assessed. The population survey using validated questionairres and the follow-up home monitoring with full polysomnography will be performed once each. The population survey takes 30-45 minutes and the home monitoring takes 12-18 hours to complete. The time interval between the questionairre completion and the full polysomnography performed in the home will typically be between 2 and 10 months. The entire study will take 18 months to complete.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most catastrophic disabilities to afflict man. The paralysis is permanent and the disability severe. There is emerging, compelling evidence that tetraplegia, the loss of function in both arms and legs, results in greater secondary disability due to disturbed sleep and breathing overnight. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate sleep health in tetraplegia by documenting sleep disturbances and determining the prevalence and nature of any sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in the Victorian population with tetraplegia. Over 18 months we propose to gain questionnaire responses from people with tetraplegia in Victoria regarding the frequency, nature and severity of any sleep disturbances they may experience. Additionally, we will perform full sleep studies at home on those with more severe injuries. The project will produce a comprehensive description of the tetraplegic population in Victoria, it will identify the nature and prevalence of sleep disturbances in this population, it will characterise sleep quality and will establish the prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and other forms of SDB in this group. It is known that OSA and sleep disturbances are significantly under diagnosed in people with SCI and this project is likely have an immediate, positive impact for the participants as problems are diagnosed and treatments offered. Any reduction in disability will have immediate benefits for the individuals involved and will reduce the cost to the community for these profoundly disabled people.</summary>
