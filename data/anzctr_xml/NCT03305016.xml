  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A 26 week trial of TransCon hGH, a long-acting growth hormone product, administered
      once-a-week. Approximately 150 children (males and females) with growth hormone deficiency
      (GHD) will be included. All study participants will receive TransCon hGH. This is a global
      trial that will be conducted in, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Australia,
      and New Zealand.</summary>
