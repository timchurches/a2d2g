  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention arm will receive Dendritic Cell Vaccine + alpha-galactosylceramide (DCV+alpha-GalCer) - a 50:50 mixture of autologous dendritic cells loaded with NY-ESO1 peptides and alpha-galactosylceramide, and autologous dendritic cells loaded with influenza peptides and alpha-galactosylceramide.
Vaccines are administered intravenously on Day One of cycles one and two.  Participants are then randomised to either recieve two further vaccines or for observation.  If randomised to the vaccine arm, vaccines are given on day one of cycles three and four.  
Vaccines have a dose of 10 x 10^6 cells (2ml volume).  Each cycle is 28 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator arm will receive Dendritic Cell Vaccine (DCV) - a 50:50 mixture of autologous dendritic cells loaded with NY-ESO1 peptides, and autologous dendritic cells loaded with influenza peptides.  This will be given on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2.  This group will go on to receive 2 further vaccinations with DCV+ alpha-GalCer on day 1 of cycles 3 and 4.
Vaccines are given intravenously with a dose of 10 x 10^6 cells (2ml volume).  Each cycle is 28 days.</comparator>

    <concealment>Each patient who signs the consent form and enters into screening will be assigned a unique 5-digit identification number. The Registration Number will be automatically assigned online by the Clinical Trials Centre at Cancer Trials New Zealand (CTNZ). 

Once randomised, the Registration Number will be used to identify the patient through-out the trial. 

The CTNZ database will automatically randomise the patient by selecting the next treatment allocation from a pre-determined randomisation sequence and assign a blinded 3-digit Allocation Code; this blinded Allocation Code will be provided to the site online.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be carried out centrally by the Clinical Trials Centre at Cancer Trials New Zealand (CTNZ). 

Random block sizes will be used to provide maximum concealment of allocation.  The CTNZ database will automatically randomise the patient by selecting the next treatment allocation from a pre-determined randomisation sequence and assign a blinded 3-digit Allocation Code; this blinded Allocation Code will be provided to the site online.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>This study involves a two-step randomisation process: 
- At the first randomisation, patients will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 ratio to DCV (Arm 1) or DCV+ alpha-GalCer (Arm 2) for two cycles of blinded treatment. 
- At the second randomisation, patients in Arm 2 will be further randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive two further cycles of open-label DCV+alpha-GalCer or control arm (observation). 

The study also involves a crossover step: 
- Having received two cycles of DCV, patients in Arm 1 will go on to receive two cycles of DCV+alpha-GalCer.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dendritic cells are cells that stimulate strong immune responses in the body. This study is looking at using dendritic cells to stimulate an immune response to a protein called NY-ESO-1 which is found in melanoma, and also to proteins found in influenza.  The main purpose of the study is to see if adding an agent called alpha-galactosylceramide will improve the immune responses generated.

This is a randomised study (allocation to a treatment is random), where by chance the study participant is allocated to one of two treatment groups. Neither the participant or the treating health professionals will know which treatment arm the person is on.

Group 1 will receive a dendritic cell vaccine which contains fragments of NY-ESO-1 and influenza proteins.  Two doses will be given 28 days apart. 

Group 2 will receive a dendritic cell vaccine which contains fragments from NY-ESO-1, influenza proteins and alpha-Galactosylceramide.  Two doses will be given 28 days apart. 

Following this: 
Group1 will then receive 2 further vaccine treatments.  This time they will receive the dendritic cell vaccine which contains the fragments of NY-ESO-1, influenza proteins and  alpha-galactosylceramide. 

Group 2 will be randomised again.  They will either complete 2 further courses of their vaccine schedule or they will be observed only.

Blood samples wil be taken from participants regularly to measure the size of the immune responses generated.</summary>
