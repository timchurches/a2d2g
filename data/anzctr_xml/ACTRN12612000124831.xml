  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cogmed is an adaptive and intensive training of working memory.  It is a computer-based intervention involving 25 sessions of approximately 35 minutes to be undertaken over a 5-7 week period.  It comprises a series of interactive games with a reward system to motivate children and assist with compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo group who will receive a computer program identical to the intervention program except that it is not adaptive.  in other words, it is set to a low level of difficulty which does not increase with improved mastery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is academic performance 2 years post intervention.
Academic outcome will be assessed using the Wide Range Achievement Test -4th edition (WRAT-4). The WRAT-4 includes subtests that assess reading (single word decoding), sentence comprehension, spelling and math computation.  Additional information regarding literacy and numeracy, academic performance, grade repetition and integration assistance will be sought from parents and teachers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years post intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Working memory will be assessed subtests from the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C): 
- Verbal short-term memory will be assessed with Digit Recall and Word List Recall which requires the child to immediately recall verbal information. 
- Visual-spatial short-term memory will be assessed with Block Recall and Mazes Memory which involves the child to immediately recall visual-spatial information. A subtest from the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA) known as Mister X will also be used to assess visuo-spatial working memory. 
- Verbal working memory will be assessed with Backward Digit Recall which involves the child to recall sequences of digits in the reverse order to that presented. 
- Visual-spatial working memory will be assessed with Backward Block Recall which involves the child to recall sequences of tapped blocks in the reverse order to that presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks, 12 months and 24 months post-intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Academic outcomes will be assessed using the Wide Range Achievement Test -4th edition (WRAT-4); as previously discussed in primary outcome</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks and 12 months post intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attention will be assessed using subtests from the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACh): 
- Sky Search (selective attention)
- Score! (sustained attention)
- Creature Counting (Shifting attention)</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks, 12 months and 24 months post-intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neuroimaging (functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging) will be performed on a Siemens 3 Tesla Trio MRI scanner:
- Functional MRI: will administer a widely used working memory fMRI paradigm, the N-back task, utilising a visuo-spatial variant of this task with two levels of working memory load (low and high). The visuo-spatial N-back task was selected as it is independent of language ability and is not dependent on native language processing. 
- Diffusion tensor imaging: Diffusion images will be analysed using the multi-tensor model, and probabilistic tractography. White matter fibre tracts previously shown to relate to working memory will be identified, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum bundle. Tract volume and measures of axonal density (fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD)) will be recorded within these tracts of interest.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible families who are willing to participate and have consented will be randomised to either the adaptive working memory training (intervention) group or the placebo group. 
Randomisation will be via opaque envelopes managed by the project co-ordinator. The project co-ordinator will open the envelope to obtain the treatment allocation, which will remain blinded to the participant, their family and all other members of the trial team. 
The project coordinator is responsible for administering and setting up the intervention therefore cannot be blinded to treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A bio-statistician who is independent of study management will oversee the generation of study numbers and treatment allocations. 
Block randomisation using variable block sizes will be used to generate treatment allocations. At the time of randomisation, participants will be allocated the next available sequential study number in the required strata. This corresponds to an envelope which will contain the allocation to intervention or placebo group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 50% of preterm children born very early have problems at school.  Difficulty remembering things, using something technically known as working memory, contributes to these school problems. Working memory is the ability to temporarily store information for everyday activities.  It is critical for learning information and developing basic academic skills. This study aims to investigate if an adaptive working memory training program, known as Cogmed, can improve school performance in very preterm children at 7 years of age.  
It will also be the first study to incorporate advanced neuroimaging techniques in a randomised controlled trial of Cogmed, and will be essential for determining and monitoring the neural changes that occur as a result of adaptive working memory training.</summary>
