  <interventions>
    <interventions>The pilot program intervention is an individually tailored program delivered by Jobsupports (collaborating organisation) Vocational Training Officers and based on interests and needs of each participant. The program called Keeping Active has 3 elements: 
A.	Providing information in appropriate formats to older workers and their advocates on the range of mainstream recreation options/ retirement activities available (Getting informed). 
B.	Creating social opportunities for people to connect with people who they see as their peers (Keeping Connected).
C.	Provide support to participate in an ongoing mainstream recreation or volunteering opportunity matched to the individuals interests and capacity, utilising systematic training and support strategies of the DES to maximise independence and inclusion (Keeping Busy).

Skills training based on individual need including training on public transport and the use of technology to connect with the community is inherent in each of the 3 elements. The Getting Informed and Keeping Connected elements of the program will be delivered in a combination of individual and small group activities. The Keeping Busy component will be delivered individually.

The program has a 13-week initial intervention phase with weekly program sessions of individually determined duration (depending on need) and then an ongoing support phase that continues until the participant chooses to leave the program or the program funding ends (pilot program currently funded until June 2017). Vocational Training Officers will deliver both the intervention phase and the ongoing support phase.  The participants advocate/support person is not required to attend intervention program sessions.

Participation in the program will be monitored through participants weekly logs and program staff timesheets.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be a wait-list control group. Participants in the control group will receive the same pre and post measures as those in the intervention group but will be placed on a 13-week waiting list while the intervention group receive their program. While on the wait-list the control group will receive their usual program with the employment support service. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Social contacts including face-to-face, over the phone or through the use of technology over the period of a week as recorded on activity calendars.  Social contacts will exclude family, people the person lives with and contact related to service delivery i.e. paid support workers. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, weekly during initial intervention phase (weeks 1 -13), during follow up maintenance program at 26 weeks, 52 weeks, 6 months after program end.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time spent in mainstream community activities (other than work) without being accompanied by family member or paid staff member as recorded on activity calendars. . Mainstream community activities include activities (e.g., social groups, sporting activities, volunteering) undertaken away from home by members of the general community.  Activities primarily intended primarily or solely for groups of people with disability are excluded from this definition of mainstream community activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, weekly during initial intervention phase (weeks 1 -13), during follow up maintenance program at 26 weeks, 52 weeks, 6 months after program end.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge of recreation options measured through asking participants to list the activities organisations they know of that adults can go to when not at work.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, post initial intervention phase (13 weeks), 26 weeks, 52 weeks after intervention commencement, 6 months after program end.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Costs of delivering program per participant compared to available government funding for comparable programs.
Staff wages costs are based on time allocated to specific program activity and to participant specific activity.  Hours multiplied by the staff members wage can be used in analysing individual and average program costs. Wages costs that are not client specific (e.g. administration activities, staff training, staff meeting and non-wage costs such as those relating to maintaining the office premises) are apportioned across programs.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The Keeping Active program is being delivered by Jobsupports (collaborating organisation) Vocational Training Officers.  All people enrolled  in the Keeping Active program who are willing to give written informed consent are eligible to participate in the study.

Eligibility for the program has been established by the Jobsupport Disability Employment Service (DES) operating the program and include 
* Intellectual Disability (IQ&lt;70)
* Aged 40 years or over
* Currently employed with support of the DES or have retired from a job supported by the DES service 
* Assessed through the DES-ESS system as requiring ongoing support (high, moderate or flexible support) to maintain employment.
* Have a home advocate/support person such as a family member or accommodation support worker willing and able to assist in planning the participants individual program and in providing practical support at home where needed for the person with ID to participate in their program activities e.g. budgeting for activities.</inclusivecriteria>

    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Sealed opaque envelopes. 
Envelopes contain slips showing either intervention or waitlist. All the envelopes are kept in a box and allocation occurs when the participant selects an envelope from the box at their enrolment meeting. This tangible method of randomisation has been chosen deliberately to help participants with intellectual disability understand the process of random allocation to groups.

    <statisticalmethods>There is expected to be 50 participants enrolled in the Keeping Active pilot program from a total eligible population of 100. The sample size of 40 has been chosen in recognition that it is likely that some people will choose not to participate in the study despite there being minimal difference in program procedures for those in the study and those who are not. 
ANOVA will be used to compare the differences in outcomes between the 2 groups using a significance level of 0.05. If needed, individual participant characteristics related to outcomes will be used as covariates.</statisticalmethods>
