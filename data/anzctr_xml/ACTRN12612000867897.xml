    <studytitle>Obtaining thrombelastography (TEG) measurements for healthy pregnant mothers and applying the results to help manage major bleeding following birth.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In healthy women at term (gestation &gt; 37 weeks), how do reference values for activated (kaolin and RapidTEG(Registered Trademark)) thromboelastogram parameters compare with reference values using a non-activated (native) assay and how these reference values can determine reference intervals.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants provided a single venous specimen which underwent simultaneous analyses using three different assays; Native, Kaolin-activated and RapidTEG-activated. 
A specimen was obtained immediately prior to caesarean. Specimens were analysed using a dedicated TEG(registered Trademark) device. Processing is undertaken at the point-of-collection on 3 available channels.</interventions>

      <outcome>Reference VALUES for four thromboelastography parameters (r-time, k-time, alpha-angle and maximum amplitude)
The collection and processing of blood occurred in the following order. Following intravenous access, an initial 2ml of blood was drawn into a plain syringe that was discarded to ensure any potential contamination during drawing was removed.  A second sample of 4ml of blood was drawn into a second plain syringe which was used for TEG(Registered Trademark) testing.  A stopwatch was used to ensure samples were processed as per the manufacturers recommended time of 4 minutes.  One ml of whole blood was placed into a Kaolin vial and gently
inverted five times with the remainder of the whole blood sample from the plain syringe being placed in a plain plastic test tube.  For the Kaolin test, 360 microlitres of blood was pipetted from the mixed Kaolin vial, into a plain TEG(Registered Trademark) cup and testing commenced.  For the RapidTEG(Registered Trademark)test, 10 microlitres of RapidTEG(Registered Trademark) reagent comprising of lyophilized Kaolin &amp; Tissue Factor (which had been reconstituted with 20 microlitres of sterile water, 5 minutes prior to the testing) was placed in a plain TEG(Registered Trademark) cup, followed by 360 microlitres of blood pipetted from the plastic test tube and testing commenced.  For the Native test, 360 microlitres of blood from the plastic test tube was transferred into a plain TEG(Registered Trademark) cup, and testing commenced 4 minutes after the initial drawing of blood Real-time results are presented on a networked monitor using TEG(Registered Trademark)AnalyticalSoftwareV4.2.97.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This observational study measures thrombelastography (TEG) values for healthy, non-labouring, pregnant women at term. These values are analysed to provide pregnancy-specific normal range for the TEG. These normal ranges can be applied to assist with making treatment decisions during a major bleed following birth.</summary>
