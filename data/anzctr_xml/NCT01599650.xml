    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change in Visual Acuity: BCVA Change at Month 6 Compared to Baseline in Patients With Visual Impairment Due to Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. For the mean change of best corrected visual acuity at Month 6 compare to Baseline, the 95% confidence interval and P value (related to the null hypothesis that this mean change is equal to zero) based on a t distribution/t test were calculated and assessed by an ANOVA model.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Mean Average Change in Visual Acuity From Month 1 Through Month 24 Compared to Baseline - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. (A positive average change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement): Mean Average Change: for each patient, first average change is calculated as the average of the changes from baseline to Month 1 over Month 24.

      <outcome>The Mean Change in Visual Acuity BCVA (Letters) From Baseline at Month 12 and Month 24 - Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) -like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of ETDRS is 0 to 100 letters. For the mean change of best corrected visual acuity at Month 12 and Month 24 compare to Baseline, the 95% confidence interval and P value (related to the null hypothesis that this mean change is equal to zero) based on a t distribution/t test were calculated and were assessed by an ANOVA model.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Percent of Patients With a Visual Acuity Gain of =1, =5, =10, =15, and =30 Letters From Baseline up to Month 6 and Month 24, by Visit - BCVA score was based on the number of letters read correctly on the Early Treatment Diabetic retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart assessed at a starting distance of 4 meters. An increased score indicates improvement in acuity. This outcome assessed the number of participants who had improvement of =1, =5, =10, =15, and =30 letters of visual acuity at Month 6 &amp; Month 24 as compared with baseline, was assessed by an ANOVA model. Endpoints related to the proportion of patients with BCVA letter gain or loss from Baseline was analyzed via stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with stratification based on baseline BCVA (baseline BCVA less than or equal to 39, 40 to 59, greater than or equal to 60 letters, treatment groups).</outcome>

The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. BCVA above 73 letters at Month 6 indicates a positive outcome.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Mean Change in Patient Reported Outcomes in NEI-VFQ-25 Score (Composite Score and Subscales) at Month 6 and Month 24 Compared to Baseline - The survey consists of 25 items representing 11 vision related constructs (general vision, ocular pain, near activities, distance activities, social functioning, mental health, role difficulties, dependency, driving, color vision, peripheral vision) plus a single-item general health rating question. All items are scored so that a high score represents better functioning. Each item is then converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. In this format scores represent the achieved percentage of the total possible score, e.g. a score of 50 represents 50% of the highest possible score.</outcome>

    <summary>This study will generate comparative data for 0.5-mg ranibizumab using PRN dosing
      administered with or without adjunctive laser treatment versus laser photocoagulation (the
      current standard of care) up to Month 6 in patients with visual impairment due to ME
      secondary to BRVO. Additionally the results of this study will provide long-term (24-month)
      safety and efficacy data for ranibizumab, administered with or without adjunctive laser
      treatment in this indication.</summary>
