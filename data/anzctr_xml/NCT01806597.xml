Experimental: secukinumab 150mg - 201 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Subjects assigned to secukinumab 150 mg will be dosed weekly for the first five weeks, then every four weeks up to and including Week 128. To maintain blinding, subjects will receive additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.

Experimental: secukinumab 300 mg - 201 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Subjects assigned to secukinumab 300 mg will be dosed weekly for the first five weeks and then every four weeks up to and including Week 128. In order to maintain the blinding, subjects will receive additional placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 201 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg, or placebo. Subjects on placebo will dose weekly for 5 weeks then once every 4 weeks. At Week 16, ppIGA responders will continue to receive placebo weekly for 5 weeks starting at Week 16, then every 4 weeks up to and including Week 76 while ppIGA non-responders will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to secukinumab either 150 mg or 300mg weekly for 5 weeks, starting at Week 16, then every 4 weeks up to and including Week 128. At Week 80, subjects on placebo will either terminate their participation, if ppIGA responders, or be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to secukinumab either 150 mg or 300 mg once every 4 weeks until Week 128 inclusive. All doses of study treatment are administered by sub-cutaneous injections.


Other interventions: secukinumab 150 mg
Study treatment will be provided in pre-filled syringes of secukinumab 150 mg in 1 mL. Each dosing consists of one secukinumab 150 mg s.c. injection plus one placebo secukinumab s.c. injection and will take place once weekly during five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then once every four weeks starting at Week 8 until Week 128 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, patients will also receive two placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. Patients will self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

Other interventions: secukinumab 300 mg
Study treatment will be provided in pre-filled syringes of secukinumab 150 mg in 1 mL. Each dosing consists of two secukinumab 150 mg s.c. injections and will take place once weekly during five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then once every four weeks starting at Week 8 until Week 128 inclusive. In order to maintain the blinding, patients will also receive two placebo injections at Weeks 17, 18 and 19. Patients will self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

Other interventions: Placebo
Placebo will be provided in 1 mL pre-filled syringes. Each dosing consists of two s.c. injections and will take place once weekly during five weeks (at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4), then at Week 8 and at Week 12. At Week 16, ppIGA responders will continue on placebo with dosing at Weeks 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, then once every four weeks from Week 24 until Week 76 inclusive. At Week 80, ppIGA responders will end their participation in the study while ppIGA non-responders will be re-randomized, to receive 150 mg or 300 mg secukinumab once every four weeks starting at Week 80 until Week 128 inclusive. Patients will self-administer study treatment under the supervision of site personnel when injections occur during study visits, or at home otherwise.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy:palmoplantar Investigator Global Assessmnet (ppIGA) response after 16 weeks of treatment. Each of the treatment groups will be compared to placebo. - Primary endpoint is the palmoplantar Investigator's Global Assessment (ppIGA) response after 16 weeks of treatment. To be considered a ppIGA responder at Week 16, a subject must have ppIGA of 0 or 1 at Week 16 and a reduction of at least 2 points on the ppIGA scale from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 16 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: palmoplantar Investigator Global Assessment (ppIGA) response over time up to Week 16, and over time up to Week 80 or Week 132 - The ppIGA scores signs of plaque psoriasis on the palms and soles. A subject is considered ppIGA responder at specific points in time if the ppIGA score at the time of assessment is 0 or 1 AND if at that time, there is a reduction from baseline of at least 2 points on the ppIGA scale. Response to treatment will be assessed in each secukinumab group over time up to Week 16 in comparison with placebo, and over time until Week 132.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks, 132 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: palmoplantar Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (ppPASI) over time up to Week 16 compared to placebo, and over time up to Week 132 - The ppPASI score evaluates erythema, induration and desquamation, as well as the affected area of palms and soles. Percentage change in ppPASI score from baseline will be assessed in each secukinumab group over time up to Week 16 in comparison with placebo, and over time up to Week 132.</outcome>
      <timepoint>16 weeks, 132 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects in treatment groups 150mg and 300mg with adverse events, safety labs, ECG, and vital signs as a measure of safety and tolerability - Adverse events, safety labs, ECG and vital signs will be used to assess safety and tolerability of the study treatment in patients who took at least one dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, up to 140 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number and percentage of subjects who develop immunogenicity against secukinumab - Overall statistics will be used to assess the immunogenicity of secukinumab.
