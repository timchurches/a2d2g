  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to develop and evaluate three short corporate falls risk
      awareness videos of approximately 1-2 minutes (each) by using the feedback from
      community-dwelling people aged 50 years and above. The three videos aim to make a broad
      audience aware of the risk of falling as one gets older.</summary>
