  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation of the relationship between Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) and acute pain as rated on a 0-10 numeric rating scale during the stay in the postoperative recovery unit. The rating will be repeated every 5 minutes until recovery room discharge (= completion of the observation period).
ANI is a 0-100 index which is based on the analysis of heart rate variability. By this means, ANI claims to be able to assess the strength of parasympathetic activity. As the latter is likely to decrease with acute pain, a low ANI may indicate pain whereas a high ANI may reflect a more comfortable state.
The electrocardiogram (ECG) signal for ANI is derived from 2 sticky single use electrodes which are place in V1 and V5 ECG position on the chest.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Monitoring pain in patients who are semi-conscious after an operation under general anaesthesia can be difficult. The Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) is a monitor that claims to enable anaesthetists to monitor pain even when patients cannot communicate their pain directly. ANI is based on an analysis of the ECG signal which finally allows an estimate of the stress reaction a patient experiences during an episode of pain. The ANI score is a 0-100 score with high numbers indicating wellbeing and low numbers potentially pain. Aim of our study was to test this monitor in patients after surgery by asking the patients to rate their pain on an established pain scale and noting ANI scores at the same time. We hypothetized that ANI scores would reflect different states of pain with different ANI score results.</summary>
