    <studytitle>Predictive Low Glucose Management (PLGM) Trial : Comparing insulin pump therapy with predictive low glucose suspend feature versus standard sensor augmented pump therapy in patients  with type 1 diabetes. </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>The prediction and prevention of hypoglycaemia using insulin suspension in a randomised controlled trial with the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with real-time continuous glucose monitoring system and predictive low glucose suspend feature (CSII + RT-CGMS + PLGM) versus sensor augmented pump therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion only (CSII+ RT-CGMS) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with real-time continuous glucose monitoring system and predictive low glucose suspend feature (Medtronic Minimed 640G) for six months duration. Continuous glucose monitoring will involve insertion of a sensor just under the skin that sends continuous glucose readings back to the insulin pump. This pump has the added feature of Predictive Low Glucose Suspend function. If a low glucose level is predicted to be reached in 30 minutes  and the patient does not respond to the alarm, the pump will suspend insulin infusion for 2 hours. Both the pump and glucose sensor system will be worn for the entire 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard sensor augmented pump therapy - continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with  real-time continuous glucose monitoring for the duration of six months. The predictive function will be off on the pump.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the events of hypoglycaemia, defined as 20 minutes or more with sensor glucose &lt; 3.5mmol/l, during 6 months of therapy with the CSII + RT-CGMS + predictive low glucose insulin suspend and resume vs. CSII + RT-CGMS alone</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine patient satisfaction and acceptability assessed by a Pump Satisfaction Questionnaire and to measure the impact of the intervention on patients quality of life and fear of hypoglycaemia as assessed by Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5Dy), the Fear of Hypoglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia Awareness questionaire </outcome>
