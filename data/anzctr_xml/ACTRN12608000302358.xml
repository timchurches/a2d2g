  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In New Zealand, the infant immunisation programme is delivered in the general practice setting. There is wide variance in practice immunisation coverage. Recent research has identified key characteristics of general practice that are associated with higher immunisation coverage. One of these is the early formation of a close relationship with the childs family/whanau. Delay in receipt of the first vaccine dose in the primary series is one of the strongest predictors of subsequent incomplete immunisation. It is hypothesised that an intervention which enables early enrolment of newborns into general practice registers and effective practice systems will improve the completion and timeliness of the primary immunisation series. This randomised trial will implement an improved practice system consisting of early enrolment, a timely parental resource and decision-making tool, early recall and extra practice nurse support to improve immunisation coverage and timeliness. Outcome measures will be coverage and timeliness at age 8 weeks, 14 weeks and 6 months of the primary immunisation series. Potential health gains are increased immunisation coverage and timeliness with an associated reduced incidence of vaccine preventable disease in New Zealand.</summary>
