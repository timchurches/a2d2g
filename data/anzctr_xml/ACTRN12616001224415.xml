  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were randomly assigned to a 10-day course of one of the following treatment:

Group A, placebo - one capsule  two times a day.
Group B, Aspirin 500 mg dissolved in 100 ml water and has to be taken three times a day.
Group C, Probiotic ( vivomixx ) - Sprinkle the content of sachet on Apple puree and patients have to eat whole apple puree with vivomixx over it immediately. Patients have to take one sachet at a time and it has to be taken two times a day.

Vivomixx is a food supplement containing a combination of 8 different strains of live lactic acid bacteria and bifid bacteria. Vivomixx has 450 billion freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, maltose, anti-caking agent: silicon dioxide. matlose, anti-caking agent: silicon dioxide (nano) (Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacteries (B. breve, B. longum, B. infantis), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus). Without gluten, lactose and soy 

Vivomixx is a new highly concentrated probiotic food supplement that contains 450 billion live lyophilized bacteria with 8 carefully selected strains. 

Recommended dose for vivomixx is 1-2 sachets per day. (Dissolve the content of one sachet in water, yogurt, apple juice or other cold carbonated free drinks and drink immediately.) 

Aspirin - Aspirin tablet  500 mg  dissolved in 100 ml water and patients have to take three times a day  

Placebo - Its a capsule which has to take two times a day by patients..

All patients have been informed to keep all empty sachets and empty envelopes of IP and return it back to study site on follow up visit..

Don't require weight based dose as recommended dose for Vivomixx is  1-2 sachets per day and in this study patients also have to take one sachet at a time with apple puree two times a day.

      <outcome>To investigate the microbiome through bacterial culture.  These bacterial isolates will be subject to identification (utilising sequencing methods as per microbiome assessment above), and further characterisation e.g. nutrient utilisation, pro-inflammatory properties, ability to stimulate cytokine production from patient peripheral blood immune cells.  
This will allow confirmation of the presence of live bacteria in the biopsy samples.  

In addition, it will allow us to assess bacterial load/overgrowth in the duodenum and this can be correlated to both symptoms, immune and permeability assessments.  

Therefore we can assess the contribution of particular bacteria to the pathophysiology of FD.

    <statisticalmethods>To assess the modification of the effect of aspirin and probiotic treatment vs placebo on a number of physiologic parameters in FD compared with normal subjects. The analysis of this 2x3 Parallel design will employ parallel analysis of variance in which the interaction between treatment and FD status will be the only hypothesis test of interest. If statistically significance (p&lt;0.01) is achieved planned comparisons will be conducted via interaction contrasts.

 We will also assess two effect modifications, one in which microbiome diversity status modifies response to aspirin and the second in which microbiome status modifies the response to probiotic, both are regardless of FD status. ;

Sample size / statistical power A sample of n=30 subjects randomized to each treatment with FD and controls will provide statistical power 0.9 at the 0.01 level of statistical significance (two-tailed) if the effect size for aspirin is 1SD larger in FD than normals but the effect size for probiotic is 1SD smaller in FD than normal. The same sample size applies to hypothesis two assuming the ratio of normal to reduced microbiome diversity is approximately 1:1. The sample recruited for hypothesis 1 will provide statistical power close 0.9 at the 0.01 level of statistical significance (two-tailed) for Cohen d effect size of 0.75</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional dyspepsia (FD) affects a considerable proportion of Australians and results in significant personal and economic cost. There is as yet no cure for this condition and current treatments are only satisfactory in a subset of patients. New insights into the pathophysiology of FD have found that activation of both mucosal and systemic
immune responses are important and have been shown to be linked to symptoms in patients with FD. Specifically, increased mucosal permeability has been linked with mucosal inflammation and our pilot work has shown increased mucosal permeability occurs in FD. In this study we aim to define the effects of pharmacologically
induced changes of intestinal permeability on immune activation, upper gut function (sensory &amp; motor function) and symptoms in healthy controls and patients with FD. FD patients and controls will be randomised to receive a nonsteroidal antiinflammtory
drug (aspirin) which is known to increase FD symptoms and mucosal permeability or
a probiotic (Vivomixx), which is known to reduce the severity of dyspeptic symptoms, and intestinal permeability. In addition recent evidence suggests that that the intestinal microbiome plays a critical role in mucosal inflammation but to date this has not been properly investigated in FD. We aim to define the role of the intestinal microbiome in
response to treatment with aspirin and the probiotic Vivomixx using a novel device we have developed and patented that allows targeted aseptic biopsies to be obtained from defined areas of the gastrointestinal mucosa utilising routine endoscopic tests. We will also compare the microbiome in intestinal biopsies from patients with FD and
healthy controls to study the link between the diversity of the microbiome and mucosal inflammation. To do this study we will recruit 90 patients with functional dyspepsia and 90 age and sex matched controls without GI symptoms undergoing endoscopy for assessment of iron deficiency with a normal upper endoscopy. They will be
randomised to receive either aspirin, Vivomaxx or placebo. They will undergo pre and post treatment testing including fill in questionnaires, donate a blood sample, donate a tissue sample (at baseline only), breath test and a standard nutrient drink challenge. This study will significantly advance the pathophysiology of FD and has the potential to pave
the way for future cure of the disease.
