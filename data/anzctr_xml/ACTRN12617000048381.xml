  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be inoculated on Day 0 with an estimated ~1000 viable parasites in 1.5 x 10^9 erythrocytes administered intravenously. On an outpatient basis, the participants will be monitored initially by phone then daily from Day 6 until the detection of parasites by qPCR. During this time, participants will also be monitored for the unexpected early onset of malaria symptoms, signs or parasitological evidence of malaria. On the day of commencement of treatment, participants will attend the outpatient unit for a visit encompassing first two doses of the anti-malarial treatment with the anti-malarial drug Riamet(Registered Trademark) (Artemether20mg / Lumefantrine 120 mg), transmission experiments and safety monitoring. The anti-malarial treatment will be administered as an oral tablet; 6 doses of 4 tablets (total course 24 tablets) given over a period of 60 hours following food. It is expected some of the doses to be taken by the participants at home. Participants will have a phone call from a study staff member to check on symptoms and ensure compliance/completion with treatment following the dose taken at home. A maximum of two mosquito transmission studies by each of direct (DFA) and membrane feeding assays (MFA) may be performed approximately two days prior to treatment and on the day of treatment (four feeding assays in total). A further MFA may be performed following treatment if there is evidence of gametocytemia or at the Investigators discretion. Further follow up visits for safety assessments will be performed on Day 28+/-3, Day 56+/-7 (as required) and Day 84+/-7 (End of Study). Each follow up visit beyond Day 28 should take place as scheduled+/-7 days. The overall period of participation will therefore be around 14 weeks from the time malaria infection. A further follow up period roughly 6 months post completion Riamet(Registered Trademark) treatment may also be requested at the Investigators discretion.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 1: safety assessed by adverse events (AE) (unexpected toxicities, adverse events encountered during or after study drug administration), safety laboratory parameters, and vital signs. Clinical safety will be also be assessed by soliciting symptoms and signs of malaria (such as fever fatigue, vomiting and Diarrhea) and of adverse effects of the inoculum. 
Although considered an extremely low risk, it is possible that participants may experience transfusion reactions after receiving the inoculum, or develop antibodies to the donor red blood cells that may make blood transfusion more difficult in the future. The risk of malaria infection is managed by closely monitoring the number of parasites in participants blood samples and administering registered anti-malarial agents at a threshold that is below the point at which advanced clinical symptoms of malaria infection are likely to occur. Safety of the IBSM is assessed by close monitoring of clinical status, including physical examination, vital signs assessment, electrocardiograms (ECG), adverse event reporting and by laboratory pathology testing, including testing for red cell alloantibodies, haematology and biochemistry. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored throughout the study to 6 months post treatment.
Physical examination and vital signs:  Screening, day 0, day on commencement of treatment and outpatient phases if clinically indicated, and day 84 (EOS). 
ECG: Screening, day 0, and day 28 and day 84 (EOS).
Adverse Events: Screening to day 84 (EOS) and 6 months follow up. 
Haematology and biochemistry: At Screening, InD-3 to InD-1 safety visit, pre-inoculation InD0, on the day of commencement of treatment, one week following completion of treatment, and for Day 28 and Day 84 or EOS. Any significant deviations from results obtained during screening will be followed until resolution or investigated fully. Red cell alloantibody testing: Screening and EOS.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 2: infectivity assessed by parasitaemia measured by qPCR
Assessed by close monitoring of the number of parasites in the blood and clinical symptoms of malaria   
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre inoculation and then daily from Day 6 until PCR positive for malaria, and until Riamet(Registered Trademark) dosing. Blood sampling will occur for parasitaemia (PCR) at 0, 4 and 12 hours post commencement of treatment. Then twice daily until negative. Follow up PCR will be performed at Day 10 and Day 28/Day 84 or EOS if withdrawn before).  If the participant is clinically well then frequency of blood collection to achieve two consecutive negative tests may be relaxed to provide a break from phlebotomy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 1: blood stage parasite clearance profiles by pPCR following treatment with Artemether-Lumefantrine (Riamet(Registered Trademark))</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre inoculation and then daily from Day 6 until PCR positive for malaria, and until Riamet(Registered Trademark) dosing. Blood sampling will occur for parasitaemia (PCR) at 0, 4 and 12 hours post commencement of treatment. Then twice daily until parasitaemia by qPCR is undetectable or stable suggesting gametocytemia.. Follow up PCR will be performed at Day 10 and Day 28/Day 84 or EOS if withdrawn before).  If the participant is clinically well then frequency of blood collection to achieve two consecutive negative tests may be relaxed to provide a break from phlebotomy.; measured twice daily </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 2: the infectivity of P. malariae to vector mosquitoes in the induced blood stage malaria (IBSM) model</outcome>
      <timepoint>Direct Feeding Assays: Up to 2 time points until participants receive the anti-malarial treatment i.e. 10-14 days following infection with blood stage parasites if gametocytes are indicated by PCR. 
Indirect Feeding Assays: Up to 2 time-points prior to anti-malarial treatment i.e. 10-14 days following infection with blood stage parasites if gametocytes are indicated by PCR and one following the completion of the treatment if evidence of gametocytaemia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot clinical trial will characterize the wild type Plasmodium malariae isolate HMPBS-Pm as an agent for use in CHMI for the future assessment of antimalarial treatments. The study has been designed based on previous experience with similar Plasmodium spp. master cell banks. Inoculum preparation, administration and clinical score criteria are unchanged. Participant follow up intervals have been adjusted to account for differences in Plasmodium spp. lifecycles. The study population will consist of healthy participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria for similar trials, including appropriate ABO and Rh (female participants) blood group matching. 
It is hypothesized that the inoculum HMPBS-Pm will demonstrate infectivity in healthy participants. Parasite growth rates are expected to be slower compared to P. falciparum and P. vivax cell banks.
