  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient-specific cutting guides will be manufactured based on pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Total knee arthroplasty will be peformed using computer-assisted surgery. The approximate duration of the procedure is 90-120 minutes. Participants will undergo either intra-operative assessment of cutting guide precision (Group A) or use of the cutting guides to perform bony resection of the distal femur and proximal tibia (Group B). Total knee replacement components will be implanted. Participants whre the cutting guides were used in surgery will undergo post-operative Computed Tomography (CT) scans.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A - Published results of studies of precision of instrumentation in total knee joint replacement from all available years.
Group B - Historical controls of patients undergoing total knee joint replacement at study sites (dates vary by surgeon and site), published literature and other related sponsored studies for Triathlon Primary Total Knee System since 2005. Published and unpublished data using Perth CT protocol for assessment of total knee replacement outcomes since 2004.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total knee joint replacement is a successful operation for the relief of symptoms such as pain, loss of function and inability to perform daily activities. New techniques are constantly being developed to improve these results even further. 

This study aims to see how well a very new technique for total knee joint replacement surgery performs in a small number of patients. The technique involves patients having a MRI scan before their operation. This scan enables very detailed 3-D pictures of the bones, cartilage and soft-tissues around the hip, knee and ankle to be obtained. This information is then used to reconstruct a 3-D model of the pre-disease anatomy for that particular patient. This model is used to create two plastic blocks which will be used by the surgeon to perform a total knee joint replacement.

Specific questions about how precise the cutting guides can be positioned onto the bone (that is, if the guides are positioned several times, how much does the position vary?) and are there advantages in the recovery and function of patients in the period after their operation will be addressed by this study. The results of this study will be compared to the results obtained using similar total joint replacement components.

Patients will be asked to complete surveys to assess their pain, quality of life and knee function before and after their operation. 

It is hoped that the information collected during this multi-centre study will provide valuable information regarding the use of patient-specific cutting guides for total knee joint replacement.</summary>
