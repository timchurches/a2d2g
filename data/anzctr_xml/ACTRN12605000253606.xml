  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oxygen is the commonest neonatal therapy. Unfortunately, both too much and too little oxygen may be harmful for very premature infants. We now measure the oxygen in a baby's blood by oxygen saturation but the optimum range in the first few weeks is unknown and no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has addressed this question. This proposal is for a New Zealand arm of a major international study involving 5000 babies, born at less than 28 weeks, to address this question. Babies will be randomised to a higher or lower target range of oxygen saturation from birth (85-89% or 91-95%). For all oximeters staff will target a masked range of 88-92%.  We will assess which of the two target ranges is associated with the best overall outcome, which is a composite measure of survival, disability on a standard test of neurodevelopment (Bayley scales), and visual function at 2 years of age.</summary>
