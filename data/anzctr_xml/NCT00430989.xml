          1. Adult males and females age = 45 years, undergoing noncardiac surgery and general
             anaesthesia expected to exceed two hours.

               1. history of coronary artery disease as defined by a history of any one of the
                  following: i. angina ii. MI iii. segmental wall motion abnormality on
                  echocardiography or a fixed defect on radionuclide imaging iv. a positive
                  exercise stress test for cardiac ischaemia v. a positive radionuclide exercise,
                  echocardiographic exercise, or pharmacological cardiovascular stress test for
                  cardiac ischaemia vi. coronary revascularization (CABG or PTCA) vii. angiographic
