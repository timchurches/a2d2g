  <interventions>
    <interventions>This cluster-randomised controlled trial will be conducted within intermediate level schools in Auckland  one or two low decile (1-3) and one or two high decile (8-10) - in order to determine provisional efficacy and feasibility of delivery in different settings.  Total number of participants is therefore expected to be 80-100 school students subject to recruitment rate. Two classes will be recruited from each school; one will be randomly allocated to HIIT, and the other to a control group who will continue with usual practice Physical  Education class delivery.  Assessments will be conducted at baseline and post intervention period (~10 weeks). The primary outcome measure will be aerobic fitness.  Secondary outcome measures will include a range of physiological outcomes, body composition, muscular fitness, cognitive function, academic performance, behaviour, and psychological wellbeing. Additionally, participants attitudes to, and perceptions of exercise will be assessed, and the teachers perceptions of their competence and willingness to continue delivery of HIIT will be determined. Teachers will receive resources and a professional development session (with approximately 4 ongoing brief feedback sessions throughout the term) to deliver the intervention, which will consist of brief HIIT sessions to fit within two PE periods per week.  The sessions will be designed to be deliverable in a variety of settings such that specialist space is not required, and with minimal, portable equipment. Specific aspects related to Level 4 Health and Physical Education Curriculum in New Zealand will be incorporated into succinct discussions after sessions.  Analysis will account for moderators (i.e.., decile, initial fitness level, score on the strengths and difficulties questionnaire, classification of weight status) and relative efficacy. 
The single pre-intervention one-day teacher professional development session and ongoing brief feedback throughout the intervention will contribute towards the 12 practising teacher criteria requirements for maintenance of teacher registration within NZ. They will address the latest evidence on the benefits of HIIT across all outcomes in order to enhance teacher buy-in and understanding.  Importantly, teachers will learn to deliver the HIIT using the SAAFE principles developed by Lubans and colleagues, within an Aotearoa  New Zealand context. A written HIIT resource will then be provided to teachers, along with brief videos of exercises to be used. They will also receive a 'class-pack' of heart rate monitors.  Teachers will be encouraged to complete an action plan and identify barriers and solutions to facilitate the integration of HIIT into their PE lessons. 
WHO
The professional development session will be delivered by the research team (all full-time academic staff members, PhDs) to the teachers of the intervention class. The HIIT sessions will be delivered by the teachers to the participant students in class.
INTERVENTION MODE
Teachers will deliver sessions to student participants in class.
Members of the research team will deliver the professional development to the intervention class teachers in person.
The HIIT sessions delivered by the teachers will be structured to fit within 10-15 minutes, twice per week, and involve a variety of work to rest ratios based on existing HIIT protocols.  Participants will wear heart rate monitors and have their de-identified heart rate displayed on screen for them to target at least 85% of predicted heart rate maximum as a guideline intensity towards the end of each work phase.  
Brief reflective questions at the end of each HIIT session will prompt critical thinking around the participants own relationship with vigorous physical activity and how that evolves over the course of the intervention period.  The questions will be developed in conjunction with the teachers.  Specific NZ Health and Physical Education Level 4 Curriculum learning area strands, achievement objectives, and key competencies addressed will include: 
Movement concepts and motor skills strand, and achievement objectives:
	Movement skills through the process of acquisition of exercise competency
	Positive attitudes though the aspects of resilience and perseverance.
Personal Health and Physical Development strand, and achievement objectives:
	Managing self and sense of responsibility for incorporating regular and enjoyable physical activity into personal lifestyle to enhance wellbeing.

NUMBER OF TIMES FOR INTERVENTION DELIVERY
Over one school term (8-10 weeks), 16-20, 10-15 minute sessions in total will be delivered in class by the teachers approximately twice per week.  
LOCATION
All HIIT sessions will be delivered in school (Year 8 level) during usual Physical Education class times.
The professional development session will be delivered to the teachers involved with the intervention class at the University facility of the research team.
ADHERENCE
Will be assessed via recording of class attendance.   No strategy will be employed to enhance adherence as it is reliant on usual attendance to class.

    <comparator>Usual Physical Education (PE) Curriculum delivery at Year 8.
Given that each different school has a unique approach to meeting curriculum requirements, the usual PE programme control groups will inevitably be somewhat varied, but the intention is to compare relative efficacy of HIIT with the current programme as it is.   Normal PE at this level involves twice weekly class sessions of 1-2 hours in length, covering introductory sports skills, some game based activities, and at times, a component of 'fitness' subject to individual teacher determination.</comparator>

      <outcome>In order to specifically address the acceptability of intervention, separate interviews will be conducted with student participants and teachers.  Student Voice will be heard through small group interviews to be conducted with student participants post intervention period.  Focus group discussions are regularly used with children and youth as they are generally more comfortable discussing matters in groups. These group discussions will be semi-structured with a casual approach that will be adapted for the specific age group targeted to ensure the discussion is more engaging for this cohort. The main focus of these group discussions is to enable the participants to express their views in regards to HIIT itself as well as their views, preferences, and perspectives toward vigorous activity in general and if that changed over the course of the intervention. Discussions will be conducted at the school and will recorded and transcribed verbatim by members of the research team. Transcripts will then be coded and thematically analysed and the key themes identified will be organized into higher and lower level themes.  

Individual interviews with teachers will be conducted post intervention to determine their impressions and experiences with intervention delivery, and solicit reflective feedback on possible future implementation and sustainability of the HIIT programme in their school.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adolescence is a key life phase in which physical activity levels and fitness appear to decline, yet is a very formative phase for future health. Emerging evidence now indicates the particular potency of so-called high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an effective, expedient and possibly palatable option for adolescents. Partnering with schools and teachers to integrate HIIT into the curriculum represents a scalable and sustainable way to facilitate participation in HIIT.
The aim of this Health Research Council funded study is to determine the preliminary efficacy and feasibility of embedding a teacher-delivered HIIT exercise programme within the school health and physical education curriculum at Year 8 across one school term. The research involves our research team working with teachers on their professional development, towards them delivering a one school term HIIT intervention in their class.  We will utilise a variety of detailed outcome assessments, and also seek feedback from both the teachers and participating school students on their perceptions of the HIIT.  This would be compared to another class (control) within the school who would simply continue with their standard physical education curriculum delivery.  The primary outcome measure is aerobic fitness.  Other key measures include body composition, muscular strength, blood analyses, cognitive function, and psychological wellbeing.  We hypothesize that the HIIT intervention will result in greater improvements in these outcomes than the standard physical education curriculum delivery in each school.
