  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Haemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibody Titre Seroconversion Rate After the First Vaccination - HI antibody titre seroconversion was defined as participants with a pre-vaccination titre of less than 1:10 achieving a post-vaccination HI antibody titre of 1:40 or more; or participants with a pre-vaccination HI titre of 1:10 or more achieving a four-fold or greater increase in post-vaccination HI titre.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and 21 days after the first vaccination</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HI Antibody Titre Seroconversion Rate After the Second Vaccination - HI antibody titre seroconversion was defined as participants with a pre-vaccination titre of less than 1:10 achieving a post-vaccination HI antibody titre of 1:40 or more; or participants with a pre-vaccination HI titre of 1:10 or more achieving a four-fold or greater increase in post-vaccination HI titre.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and 21 days after the second vaccination</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Geometric Mean Fold Increase (GMFI) in the HI Antibody Titre After the First Vaccination - GMFI in HI antibody titre was defined as the geometric mean of the fold increase in the post-vaccination antibody titre over the pre-vaccination antibody titre.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and 21 days after the first vaccination</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>GMFI in the HI Antibody Titre After the Second Vaccination - GMFI in HI antibody titre was defined as the geometric mean of the fold increase in the post-vaccination antibody titre over the pre-vaccination antibody titre.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and 21 days after the second vaccination</timepoint>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency and Intensity of Solicited Adverse Events (AEs) After the First or Second Vaccination - Solicited AEs included AEs that were specifically sought for. Grade 3 solicited AE definitions: Cried when limb was moved/spontaneously painful (Cohort A) or prevented normal daily activities (Cohort B) for injection site pain; Size &gt; 100 mm for injection site redness and induration/swelling; Temperature &gt; 103.1°F (39.5°C) for fevers; Prevented normal daily activities or required medical intervention for all other systemic AEs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 7 days after each vaccination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Solicited AEs After the First Vaccination - Solicited AEs included AEs that were specifically sought for.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 7 days after the first vaccination and up to Day 20 after the first vaccination if AE is ongoing at Day 7.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Solicited AEs After the Second Vaccination - Solicited AEs included AEs that were specifically sought for.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 7 days after the second vaccination and up to Day 20 after the second vaccination if AE was ongoing at Day 7.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), and New Onset of Chronic Illnesses (NOCIs) - An AESI was defined as an AE for which the association with seasonal influenza vaccine was unclear. A NOCI was defined as the diagnosis of a new medical condition that was chronic in nature, including those potentially controllable by medication (eg, diabetes, asthma).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 180 days after the last vaccination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency and Intensity of Unsolicited Adverse Events After the First or Second Vaccination - Unsolicited AEs included AEs other than those specifically sought for. Grade 1 unsolicited AE definition: Easily tolerated and did not interfere with normal daily activities. Grade 2 unsolicited AE definition: Some interference with normal daily activities. Grade 3 unsolicited AE definition: Prevented normal daily activities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the 21 days after each vaccination; up to 180 days after the last vaccination for SAEs, AESIs, and NOCIs</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
