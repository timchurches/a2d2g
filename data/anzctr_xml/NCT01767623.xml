Active Comparator: Cohort 1: Participants with Normal Liver Function - Participants with normal liver function (according to National Cancer Institute [NCI] liver dysfunction criteria) will receive vemurafenib 960 mg BID from Day 1 until the morning dose on Day 20 and then from Day 27 onward until disease progression, safety-related treatment termination, withdrawal of consent, death, or a decision by the Sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.

Experimental: Cohort 2: Participants with Severe Liver Dysfunction - Participants with severe liver dysfunction (according to NCI liver dysfunction criteria) will receive vemurafenib 720 mg BID from Day 1 until the morning dose on Day 20 and then from Day 27 onward until disease progression, safety-related treatment termination, withdrawal of consent, death, or a decision by the Sponsor to terminate the study, whichever occurs first.

    <summary>This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the impact of severe hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of vemurafenib in participants with BRAF V600 mutation positive
      cancer. Participants will receive vemurafenib 960 milligrams (mg) (normal hepatic function)
      or 720 mg (severe hepatic impairment) orally twice daily (BID) on Days 1 to 20 (morning dose)
      and from Day 27 onward until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.</summary>
