  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. All patients  recruited (undergoing a laparotomy) will be randomised into two groups either receiving a rectus sheath catheter inserted by a General Surgeon intra-operatively into the pre-peritoneal space under direct visualisation or by an Anaesthetist into the intra-fascicular space via ultrasound guidance post-operatively. 

2. Rectus sheath catheters placed by General Surgery will be on completion of the operation, prior to closure of the laparotomy wound. Anaesthetic placement of rectus sheath catheters will be at the end of the entire operation, prior to waking the patient up from general anaesthetic. Devices by both arms are standardised to 16G 110mm Touhy Needle, 16G Epidural catheter (multiperforated with 3 lateral eyes), 16/17G LOCKIT PLUS regional anaesthesia catheter securement device, ALARIS PRODUCTS 0.2microm Line Filters, 20ml Luer-lock syringe, Opsite Flexigrid (10X12cm). In regards to adherence and standardisation of procedure, prior to commencement of this study, consultant general surgeons and anaesthetists performing rectus sheath catheter insertions will be given a information session on placement of these catheters, equipments to be used and dosage of local anaesthetic to be infused (0.2% : 10-20mg/hr for up to 72hrs). These educational sessions will be led by the director of surgery and anaesthetics.  </interventions>

      <outcome>These will be assessed by review of medical records. All patients recruited into the study will undergo a chart review for the first 6 months to ensure these complications (if present) are not missed. 
Complications 
o	Wound infection
o	UTI
o	VTE
</outcome>
      <timepoint>While an inpatient, patients will be reviewed daily and complications such as wound infection, UTI and VTE are assessed directly. On discharge patients will be monitored via chart review for the first 6 months ensuring delayed complications such as VTE is recorded as these complications are managed as an outpatient in the general practice setting. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation of the sample size was performed by using the primary endpoint of 72-hour total morphine usage post laparotomy. In a similar previous study, the total dose of administered morphine was 62mg with a standard deviation of 16mg. It was decided that a difference of 20% (12mg) would be considered clinically relevant, similar to this previous study. 
Assuming a = 0·05 and ß = 0·15 (a power of 85 per cent), a total of 66 patients (33 patients per group) would be required to needed to find there was no difference between each group. Assuming a 10% dropout rate 72 patients need to be recruited (36 patients per group) to make this number.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare post-operative pain outcomes following the placement of rectus sheath catheters by surgeons and anaesthetist. A total of 72 patients will be included in this study, with 36 in each arm. One arm will receive rectus sheath catheters placed into the pre-peritoneal space intraoperatively by the operating surgeon, while the other arm will receive rectus sheath catheters placed under ultrasound guidance by an anaesthetist into the intrafasicular space. Both arms will then receive 20mL 0.2% Ropivacaine infusion through these catheters every 4 hrs for 3 days. The post-operative pain experience will be assessed by narcotic requirements which will be documented as IV morphine equivalents. </summary>
