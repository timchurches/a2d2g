  <interventions>
    <interventions>A low kilojoule (kJ) diet of 5,000 to 6,000 kJ/day, based on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, will be followed for 12 weeks.  Participants will also consume, by mouth, 6 x 1g/day fish oil capsules composed of 270mg Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and 70mg Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) per capsule.  Participants then progress to weight maintenance for 10 weeks and continue to take the 6 x 1 g/day fish oil capsules.

Participants receive 1 x 30 minutes per week education sessions on dietary modification and behaviour change for the first four weeks of weight loss</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group follow the identical low kJ diet with nutrition education and then weight maintenance with 6 x 1g/day capsules monounsaturated oil (placebo), to be taken by mouth</comparator>
