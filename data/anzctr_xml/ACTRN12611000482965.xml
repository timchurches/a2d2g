  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single doses of 2 dose levels (350 and 700 micrograms) of TD 4208 by inhalation via a nebulizer: 7-12 days apart.
Comparators are single doses of ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms) and placebo.
Subjects crossover to single doses of all four treatments.
The washout is a minium of 7 days and a maximum of 12 days between each single dose.  
The 7-12 day period is determined by the clinic's schedule,  the availability of the subjects and the re-assessment of eligibility criteria prior to each of the subsequent single doses.</interventions>
    <comparator>Ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms) will be administered as single doses and a placebo solution will be administered as positive and negative controls, respectively.
The placebo solution is made of cytric acid monohydrate, sodium citrate, and normal saline.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in peak forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) relative to baseline will be assessed using Spirometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In each of the four treatment periods, spirometry assessments will be obtained predose and at specified intervals through approximately 25 hours postdose; 15, 30, and 45 minutes postdose; and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 22, 23, 24, and 25 hours  postdose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate additional lung function parameters and duration of bronchodilatory effect, spirometry will be used to obtain data to evaluate area under the FEV1 vs. time curve, FEV1 at 12 and 24 hours postdose, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) ,forced expiratory flow from 25% to 75% of vital capacity (FEF25 to 75), forced vital capacity (FVC)  and area under the FVC vs time curve.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In each of the four treatment periods, spirometry assessments will be obtained predose and at specified intervals through approximately 25 hours postdose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of single doses of TD-4208 will be evaluated using physical exams, ECGs, vital signs, clinical safety labs, and adverse events.  The most frequently observed adverse events in the Phase 2 study include dysgeusia (taste disorder) and headaches.  Adverse Events will be assessed through physical examinations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Physical exams and safety labs will be done at baseline and in each period before dosing and at a follow-up visit.  Vital signs and ECGs will be collected at baseline and in each period before dosing and at specified times through 24 hours postdose.  Adverse events will be evaluated throughout the study.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic parameters (including time to maximum concentration [Tmax], maximum concentration [Cmax], elimination half-life [t1/2], area under the concentration-time curve[AUC]) for TD-4208 in blood and in urine will be determined for each dose level of TD-4208.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A total of 14 blood samples will be collected in each period predose and at specified times through 24 hours postdose.  Subjects will collect all urine for 24 hours postdose in each period.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After providing written informed consent, subjects are screened against enrollment criteria.  Those meeting all criteria will be assigned sequentially a treatment number from the randomization schedule by unblinded site staff.  The treatment number specifies the order in which a subject will  receive TD 4208 (2 dose levels), ipratropium bromide, and placebo in each of the four treatment periods.  In each treatment period, unblinded staff will prepare and dispense the study treatment in a nebulizer that is labeled with the subjectâ€™s treatment number.  Blinded site staff will then administer the study treatment to the study subject.</concealment>
    <sequence>A statistical programmer at Theravance who is not involved in the study was responsible for preparing the randomization schedule using a computer program.  The randomization schedule specifies the  treatment sequence for each treatment number.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Thirty-two subjects diagnosed with COPD will be enrolled with the goal of at least 28 subjects receiving each study treatment and completing the follow-up assessments.  During each of the four study periods, subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1 and housed overnight until after the last spirometry measurement.  Serial pulmonary function tests will be performed and PK samples collected up to 25 hours.  Subjects will be discharged from the clinic on Day 2 after evaluations.</summary>
