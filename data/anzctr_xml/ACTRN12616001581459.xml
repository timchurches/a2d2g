  <interventions>
    <interventions> There will be 2 exposure groups in this study:
Group 1: Patients with Alzheimers disease
Group 2: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment

Participants will complete a PET Imaging exam, MRI exam, neuropsychological assessment and provide a blood sample twice within a 5-year period, with a 2-year interval between each set of tests. Participants will also be asked to wear a smart sensing device periodically over the 5-year study period.Smart sensing wrist device which  will record movement profile and heart rate. Participants are asked to wear the device for a minimum of 5days of each month, for the duration of the study. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure beta-amyloid accumulation in the brain via PET Imaging. Standardized uptake values (SUV) will be calculated for all brain regions examined and SUV ratios (SUVR) will be generated by dividing all regional SUV by the cerebellar cortex SUV. Region of interest measurements will be averaged across both hemispheres. Neocortical amyloid burden will be expressed as the average SUVR of the area-weighted mean of frontal, superior parietal, lateral temporal, lateral occipital, and anterior and posterior cingulate regions. PET data will be corrected for partial volume effects using a 3 compartment model.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PISA project seeks to reduce Australias future dementia burden by elucidating methods to identify those Australians at the very early stages of dementia.  This project aims to achieve this goal by monitoring participants physical, cognitive and neurobiological ageing in a cross-sectional, longitudinal design. The tests used in this study include cognitive testing, MRI examinations, PET imaging examinations and blood sample collection. Participants will undergo testing once every two years, over a five year period. Participants will also be given a wearable smart sensing device that will record personalised health data in day to day life, over the course of the study.</summary>
