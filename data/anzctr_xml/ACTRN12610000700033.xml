  <interventions>
    <interventions>Up to 27 subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be administered MDX-1097 at a dose of 10 mg/kg via an intravenous (i.v.) infusion administered over 90 minutes every seven days to a total of 8 doses.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the efficacy of MDX-1097 in previously treated multiple myeloma subjects with stable measurable disease. A decrease in serum biological parameters; M-protein, free light chain (FLC), malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow and active metabolic disease as evidenced by positron emission topography (PET) scan will be used to establish whether a partial response (PR), very good partial response (vPR), complete response (CR) or stringent complete response (sCR) to anti-tumour treatment has been achieved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the Treatment phase, subjects will be required to visit the Investigators office or clinic on study day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 63, 79 and 94 for administration of study drug, response assessment, pharmacokinetic sampling, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, clinical laboratory testing, and the collection of adverse events.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Characterization of the safety and tolerability of 8 weekly doses of MDX-1097 at a dose level of 10 mg/kg, including acute and chronic toxicities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the Treatment phase, subjects will be required to visit the Investigators office or clinic on study day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 63, 79 and 94 for administration of study drug, pharmacokinetic sampling, vital sign measurements, physical examinations, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, clinical laboratory testing, and the collection of adverse events.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of MDX-1097 in subjects.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the Treatment phase, subjects will be required to visit the Investigators office or clinic on study day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 63, 79 and 94 for administration of study drug and pharmacokinetic sampling</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of immunogenicity of MDX-1097.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the Treatment phase, subjects will be required to visit the Investigators office or clinic on study day 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 63, 79 and 94 for administration of study drug and immunogenicity sampling</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of the safety and response to MDX-1097 treatment. Adverse events are graded using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After Day 94 post-infusion subjects will be assessed monthly for 12 months in the follow-up phase.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects with kappa light-chain restricted multiple myeloma  who have received at least one prior line of standard therapy, have achieved at least a minimal response (greater than 25% reduction in M-protein) and had stable measurable disease for at least 3 months prior to study enrollment will be eligible for the study. M protein of greater than or equal to 0.1 g/dL (1 g/L) and/or, 24 hour urinary light chain excretion of greater than or equal to 200 mg, and/or an abnormal free light chain assay (FreeLite assay) demonstrating an excess of kappa free light chains and a kappa: lambda abnormal ratio and/or presence of greater than 20% clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or active skeletal disease based on radiological evaluation or appropriate medical imaging such as computed tomograpy-positron emission tomograpy (CT-PET) scan.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II study is a single centre open-label, multiple dose study intended to determine the preliminary efficacy of MDX-1097. 
Up to 27 previously treated kappa light chain restricted multiple myeloma subjects with stable measurable disease will be enrolled in the study. Weekly i.v. infusion of MDX-1097 for a total of 8 weeks at a dose level of 10 mg/kg is planned for all subjects.  Subjects will be assigned to the clinical trial in the order of study entry.  The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening Phase, Treatment Phase and the Follow-up Phase.</summary>
