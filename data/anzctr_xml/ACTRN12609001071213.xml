  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 phases to this case series intervention. During Phase 1 all patients will have their baseline narcotic increased by at least 30% with actual dose being determined by the treating physician. After 3-5 days if pain levels persist above 4 on a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) with values ranging from 0 (none) to 10 (unbearable) or the patient reports unacceptable narcotic side-effects and the patient is in agreement they will be admitted to a specialist palliative care unit (if not already an inpatient). Phase 2 involves the patient having their current narcotic ceased and an equianalgesic dose of methadone(physeptone) commenced. Patients will be ordered appropriate breakthrough medications during this time. Patients will be monitored for emergent signs of central nervous system toxicity including respiratory depression while doses of methadone are titrated until the patient is stabilized with pain scores less than 4 on the NRS. Phase 3 involves the patient being discharged home and monitored for a further 4 days. If people are improved with rotation to methadone then they can keep taking it. Throughout the study period patients will be asked to keep a daily diary.  The primary outcome variable is change in rated pain from pre to post methadone rotation.  The secondary outcome variables include subjective ratings of nausea and vomiting, cognitive impairment (drowsiness and unclear thinking), constipation, mood and quality of life. These changes will be assessed in the same way as subjective pain.

      <timepoint>Participants will keep a daily diary commencing the day after the patient is consented and prior to rotation onto Physeptone until 4 days following discharge from the in-patient unit and will record all breakthrough/ rescue medications. To provide a more stable estimate of change in pain, an averaged rating over the last 3 days prior to admission will be compared to that of the last 3 days post-discharge and subsequent exit from the study.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project has been designed to investigate the efficacy of rotation to methadone for pain control in people with cancer whose pain is uncontrolled despite substantial increases in the dose of their prescribed narcotic.  By uncontrolled we mean that the person has rated their pain as being equal to or above 4 on an 11 point pain rating scale that ranges from 0 (equivalent to no pain at all), to 10 (equivalent to unbearable pain).  To be eligible for this study, a persons pain must have been clinically assessed to have two different components.  One component relates to the type of pain that results when injured body tissues cause pain receptors to fire (known as nociceptive pain) and the other component relates to the type of pain that results when nervous tissues is damaged (known as neuropathic pain).  People who meet these conditions will be rotated to a dose of methadone that is equivalent to their previous narcotic does in terms of analgesic potential.  They will be required to maintain a daily diary about their pain levels, possible narcotic side effects (such as constipation), quality of life and mood.  Diary entries before rotation to methadone will be compared statistically to diary entries after rotation to methadone.  If people are improved with rotation to methadone then they can keep taking it.</summary>
