  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nebulisation of animal derived lung surfactant commenced within the first hour of life, whilst infant supported on Constant Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Surfactant will be redosed by nebulisation 12 h after initial dosing if infant remains on CPAP and continues to have evidence of respiratory distress and/or oxygen requirement.
Curosurf dose will be 200 mg/kg for 29 w 0 d - 33 w 6 d gestation infants, and 100 mg/kg for newborns born at 34 w 0 d - 39 w 6 d gestation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment normally includes CPAP support only for mild-moderate severity of respiratory distress.  If infants require surfactant, normal protocol is intubation, mechanical ventilation and bolus instillation of the same dose of surfactant via the tracheal tube.  Standard unit treatment protocol will be the control group in this RCT.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Need for intubation.
Criteria for intubation will include one or more of the following: 
a) FiO2 &gt; 0.35 over more than 30 minutes OR  
b) FiO2 &gt; 0.45 at anytime, OR 
c) more than 4 apnoeas per hour OR 
d) two apnoeas requiring bag and mask ventilation, OR 
e) two capillary blood gas samples with a pH &lt; 7.2 and pCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg (or 60 mm Hg if arterial blood gas sample)
f) clinical deterioration necessitating intubation as judged by the treating clinician</outcome>
      <timepoint>Need for intubation in first 72 h of life</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of mechanical ventilation assessed in minutes from prospective documentation. 

Extubation criteria:babies will be extubated at the discretion of the attending consultant with regard to oxygen requirement and clinical condition</outcome>
      <timepoint>Duration of mechanical ventilation at the end of the 1st 72 h of life.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of the nebulisation procedure will be assessed by recording of apnea events and need for nasal suction occurring during the nebulisation period and comparing those to the background rate of apnea in the control group.
We will also record any significant clinical event during nebulisation requiring medical intervention.

Safety of the procedure will be further assessed by development of airleak syndromes, and frequency of apnea and/or bradycardia in the first 72 hours</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments will be made over the period of nebulisation, and again at 72 hours.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Surfactant replacement is the mainstay in prevention and therapy of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm neonates. Early treatment with surfactant reduces mortality, and incidence of chronic lung disease (CLD) and air leaks in preterm infants at risk of RDS. 
Current therapy consists of instilling a liquid bolus of surfactant into the trachea through an endotracheal tube, followed by mechanical ventilation of variable duration. This treatment actually requires the patient to be admitted to a level III care nursery and a risk of ventilator induced lung injury.

We propose a new approach to surfactant treatment for moderately preterm infants born with respiratory distress, as well as for more mature infants born in a non-tertiary hospital setting.  By using nebulised surfactant, we propose that babies will have their mild-moderate respiratory disease treated without the need for invasive ventilation or transport to a tertiary neonatal unit.</summary>
