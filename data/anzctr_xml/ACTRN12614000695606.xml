  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effects of short-term treatment with endocrine therapy (tamoxifen or letrozole) when given to women with newly diagnosed oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged 18 years or above, have been recently diagnosed with oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. Eligible candidates must have already provided consent to be part of the Breast Biomarker Project at Royal Melbourne Hospital.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive endocrine therapy for 5-7 days prior to surgery. Pre- or peri- menopausal women will receive 20mg oral tablet of tamoxifen per day whilst post-menopausal women will receive 2.5mg oral tablet of letrozole per day. Blood and tumour samples taken at the time of diagnosis will be compared to those taken at the time of surgery to determine changes in the tumour cells. The findings from this study will provide valuable information on the changes in breast cancer cells and their "signatures" following short-term exposure to endocrine therapy, and help with development of future breast cancer treatment.</summary>
