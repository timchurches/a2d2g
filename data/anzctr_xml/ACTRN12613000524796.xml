  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention.  Cross sectional, case control study.
(a) Biomarkers of DNA stability and nutritional status will be determined in Carers of partners/family members diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease.
(b) Biomarkers of telomere, genome and epigenome stability will be observed in association with physiological measures (plasma and saliva) of stress hormones and micronutrients status.  In addition questionnaire measures will be determined for perceived stress, healthy lifestyle behaviours and cognitive function.  
(c) Carers who meet the inclusion criteria, whose partner has been diagnosed with AD at least one year prior will be included. 
(d)  The 'case' group comprises primary Carers of a person diagnosed with AD at least 1 year prior to sample collection.  The 'control' group comprises age and gender matched non-carers.
Questionnaires will be posted out to participants prior to their single visit to the Clinic, together with a saliva collection kit.  Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaires (approximately 1 hour) in the week prior to their Clinic visit.  The saliva test will need to be self-administered the night prior to their Clinic appointment, and brought into their appointment.  The saliva test involves a cotton swab in the mouth for 3 minutes.  Participants will be required to attend a single Clinic visit only which is estimated to be approximately 1 hour in duration.  At this visit fasted blood samples will be taken, breakfast will be provided, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) will be administered in person by a member of the research team.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Telomere length (TL) will be determined by flow cytometry, in primary leukocytes isolated from whole blood by gradient separation.  TL will be measured in viable cells at G1 stage of the cell cycle.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biomarkers of DNA damage will be determined using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay which allows assessment of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, nuclear buds, fused or circular nuclei, damaged mononuclear cells, as well as markers of cytostasis (nuclear division index, apoptosis, necrosis).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Leukocytes will be isolated immediately upon blood collection and fresh 72-hour cultures established for the CBMN-cyt assay.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physiological measures:  Blood samples will be centrifuged and aliquotted for determination of plasma concentrations of micronutrients and related metabolites, plasma and salivary cortisol, plasma adrenaline (Ad) and noradrenaline (NAd) by the accredited medical pathology laboratory at the Institute of Veterinary &amp; Medical Sciences (IMVS), Adelaide, and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (Ad and NAd only).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fresh blood samples will be centrifuged immediately, aliquotted and collected by IMVS for analysis, or stored appropriately in -80 degree storage prior to shipping/analysis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Epigenome stability will be determined by analysis of DNA methylation status.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>100 participants will be recruited; 50 primary carers of partners diagnosed with AD, and 50 age/gender matched non carers (controls).  Where possible, we aim to recruit 25 males and 25 females. 
Power analysis - Telomere length:  With n = 50 participants per group we can detect difference in telomere length of 1.7%, with 99% power, with significance at p = 0.05.  Telomere shortening through natural ageing processes occurs at roughly 8% per decade, thus 1.7% would indicate approximately 2 years difference in ageing between groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: The aim of this pilot study is to examine the interactive effects of psychological stress and malnutrition on DNA damage and epigenome biomarkers in a long term chronically-stressed cohort.  

Hypotheses:  (i) Stress hormones induce specific types of DNA damage at the gene sequence, epigenome and chromosome level, including compromised telomere length and integrity; (ii) Susceptibility to DNA damage by the stress hormone cortisol is increased when dietary B vitamin methyl donors (folate, vitamin B12, choline) are deficient; (iii) Telomere length is inversely associated with perceived and actual stress, and this relationship is strengthened with increased chronicity of stress exposure.</summary>
