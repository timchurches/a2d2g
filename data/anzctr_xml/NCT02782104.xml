    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Intranasal Esketamine

Experimental: Intranasal Esketamine - Open-Label Induction Phase: Participants will self-administer with esketamine intranasally twice per week for 4 weeks as a flexible dose regimen (56 milligram [mg] or 84 mg for those &lt; 65 years; 28 mg, 56 mg or 84 mg for those &gt;= 65 years). Participants &gt;= 65 years old will start at a dose of 28 mg on Day 1. Optimization/Maintenance Phase: Participants entering from studies ESKETINTRD3001 (NCT02417064), ESKETINTRD3002 (NCT02418585), ESKETINTRD3003 (NCT02493868), ESKETINTRD3004 (NCT02497287), or ESKETINTRD3006 (US sites only) will self-administer intranasal esketamine (same dose) once weekly. Participants entering from study ESKETINTRD3005 (NCT02422186) will self-administer Esketamine intranasally (28 mg in week 1; 28 or 56 mg in week 2; and 28, 56 or 84 mg in week 3 and 4) once weekly. After Week 4 (starting at Week 5), based on the Investigator's clinical judgment, the dose of esketamine for all participants can be adjusted based upon efficacy and tolerability.

A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems).
