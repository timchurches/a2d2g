  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Prochymal
Other interventions - Placebo

Placebo Comparator: 2 - Placebo

Active Comparator: 1 - Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymal.


Treatment: drugs: Prochymal
Subjects will be treated with a total of 6 infusions of investigational agent during the first 4 weeks of the study. Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly). Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymal at 2 x 106 hMSC/kg per infusion.

Other interventions: Placebo
Subjects will be treated with a total of 6 infusions of investigational agent during the first 4 weeks of the study. Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly). Subjects assigned to the non active treatment group will receive placebo (excipient, less cells). It is recommended that all subjects receive all six infusions. The discontinuation of investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy. All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart.

             including uncontrolled infection, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc.

          -  Subjects may not receive any other investigational agents (not approved by the FDA for

             randomization.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products or DMSO

          -  Subject has received a transplant for a solid tumor disease.

          -  Subject requires more than 2L/min of oxygen to maintain stable SaO2 greater than or
             equal to 92%

          -  Subject requires a renal dopamine dose greater than 1-3 mcg/kg/min to maintain renal
             blood flow associated with renal failure and improved urinary output.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of Prochymal versus placebo in combination with corticosteroids as
      initial therapy for acute GVHD. Corticosteroids have been the primary therapy for patients
      with previously untreated acute GVHD and the historical published data define an expected 35%
      complete response (CR) at Day +28 using this therapy.</summary>
