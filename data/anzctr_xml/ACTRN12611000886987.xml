For statin administration, newly diagnosed PCOS patients with hyperlipidemia and IGT were selected among PCOS patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. PCOS patients with a LDL-cholesterol level&gt;130 mg/dL and triglyceride (TG) level&gt;150 mg/dL were considered as hyperlipidemic patients. Among hyperlipidemic patients, 18 patients with a LDL-cholesterol level&gt; 160 mg/dL were scheduled to receive additional rosuvastatin therapy. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>

    <summary>Objective: We aimed to compare the effects of metformin and metformin plus rosuvastatin combination therapies on hyperandrogenism in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). 
Design:  A prospective, randomized study.
Setting: University hospital.
Patients: Thirty-eight  PCOS patients with hyperlipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) were included in the study.
Interventions: Patients were assigned to receive lifestyle intervention and metformin (2000mg/day, n= 20, M group) therapy or lifestyle intervention, metformin (2000mg/day) plus rosuvastatin therapies (10 mg/day rosuvastatin, n= 18, MR group) for 12 weeks. Blood samples were obtained before and after treatment.
Main Outcome Measures: Total and free testosterone, insulin, glucose and hs-CRP levels.  Results: After 12 weeks of treatment body mass index (BMI), insulin and glucose levels, HOMA-IR had similar decreaments in both groups (p= 0.5, p=0.97, p=0.74, p=0.94),  whereas there was a greater decline of the total and free testosterone levels in MR group (p&lt; 0.001, p= 0.004). DHEAS levels did not change in M group however significantly decreased in MR group after treatment (p=0.8, p=0.002). As expected hsCRP, triglyceride, total and LDL- cholesterol levels decreased more in MR group. 
Conclusion: Metformin and rosuvastatin combination therapy was proved to have more favorable effect on hyperandrogenism. Therefore statin therapy in PCOS patients with hyperlipidemia and higher cardiovascular risk can render hyperandrogenism treatment more successful.</summary>
