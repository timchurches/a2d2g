    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)/11 Total Score at Week 78 - The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Change From Baseline in the Disability Assessment for Demential (DAD) Total Score at Week 78 - The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71. - Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semiquantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants.</outcome>

      <outcome>The Change From Baseline in Phospho-tau Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) at Week 71. - Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau (p-tau) is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab.</outcome>
      <timepoint>71 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Change From Baseline in Brain Volume at Week 71 - Brain volume was examined in a subset of participants by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI). Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment.</outcome>
