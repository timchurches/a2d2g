    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible women are counselled and give signed, informed consent prior to enrolment. Trial entry details are obtained from the woman's casenotes and eligibility is confirmed. The woman is enrolled by contacting the central telephone randomisation service at the University of Adelaide. Random assignment to one of two groups: either the 'magnesium sulphate group' or the 'placebo group'.  A Study Number and a corresponding numbered treatment pack will be allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will use balanced variable blocks and will be created using computerise sequence generation by researchers not involved in clinical care, recruitment, data collection and follow-up assessment. Assignment to treatment group will be stratified for collaborating centre, gestational age (30 to 31 completed weeks; 32-33 completed weeksâ€™ gestation), and number of fetuses (1 or 2).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antenatal magnesium sulphate is recommended prior to preterm birth at less than 30 weeks gestation for neuroprotection of the fetus. Whether there are benefits at later gestations is uncertain. The primary aim of this randomised placebo controlled trial is to assess whether giving magnesium sulphate compared with placebo to women immediately prior to preterm birth between 30 and 34 weeks' gestation reduces the risks of death or cerebral palsy in their children at 2 years' corrected age. years' corrected age.</summary>
