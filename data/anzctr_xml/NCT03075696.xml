  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RO7082859
Treatment: drugs - Obinutuzumab
Treatment: drugs - Tocilizumab

Experimental: Part I: Dose Escalation - Participants will receive obinutuzumab 1000 milligrams (mg) single dose IV infusion on Day -7 (pre-treatment) followed by RO7082859 IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycle 1. From Cycle 2 onwards, ascending doses of RO7082859 will be administered on Day 1 of every 2 week cycle up to Cycle 12 (24 weeks) or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. RO7082859 dosing will be initiated at 5 micrograms (mcg) (flat dose) followed by doses of 15 mcg, 45 mcg, 135 mcg, 405 mcg and 810 mcg. Tocilizumab will be administered if required, for the management of severe Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) (if a study participant experiences severe CRS during or after any infusion of RO7082859).

Experimental: Part II: Dose Escalation - Part II (multiple participant cohorts) will start when either RO7082859 flat dose of 810 mcg is reached or a RO7082859-related greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) Grade 2 AE or DLT occurs, whichever comes first. Participants will receive obinutuzumab 1000 mg single dose IV infusion on Day -7 (pre-treatment) followed by RO7082859 IV infusion on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycle 1. From Cycle 2 onwards, ascending doses of RO7082859 will be administered on Day 1 of every 2 week cycle until either the MTD/OBD is defined. Tocilizumab will be administered if required, for the management of severe CRS (if a study participant experiences severe CRS during or after any infusion of RO7082859).

Experimental: Part III: Dose Expansion - Part III will start once OBD is defined. Participants will receive obinutuzumab 1000 mg single dose IV infusion on Day -7 (pre-treatment) followed by RO7082859 IV infusion at OBD on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycle 1. From Cycle 2 onwards, RO7082859 will be administered at OBD on Day 1 of every 2 week cycle up to Cycle 12 (24 weeks) or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Tocilizumab will be administered if required, for the management of severe CRS (if a study participant experiences severe CRS during or after any infusion of RO7082859).


Treatment: drugs: RO7082859
RO7082859 will be administered at a dose and as per the schedule specified in the respective arms.

Treatment: drugs: Obinutuzumab
Obinutuzumab 1000 mg single dose IV infusion on Day -7

Treatment: drugs: Tocilizumab
Tocilizumab will be administered as an IV infusion as per the methods described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) or other similar local prescribing documents.

    <summary>This is a Phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a novel T-Cell bispecific (TCB), RO7082859,
      administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, following the pretreatment administration of a
      one-time, fixed dose of obinutuzumab. The study is divided in 3 parts: dose escalation (Parts
      I and II) and dose expansion (Part III). Single-participant dose-escalation cohorts will be
      used in Part I, followed by conversion to multiple participant dose-escalation cohorts (Part
      II), in order to define a tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or optimal biological dose
      (OBD). The expansion cohorts (Part III) will be initiated when the tentative MTD/OBD is
      defined, to further evaluate the safety, PK and therapeutic activity of RO7082859.</summary>
