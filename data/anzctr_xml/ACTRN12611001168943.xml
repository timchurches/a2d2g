  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participation will include filling out a brief background information sheet and taking part in a clinical/cognitive test battery (Study Part A) and brain imaging (Study Part B).

Clinical/cognitive test battery will take approximately 1 to 1.5 hours to complete and it will include the following:
- Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination
- Computerised spatial navigation task
- Computerised spatial attention task

Brain Imaging will include the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (both structural and diffusion) and it will take a total of 30 minutes to complete. 

Participants will be expected to complete these tasks (cognitive/clinical tasks and MRIs) only once, however, they can choose whether they would like to complete them as part of one session or to divide the participation over two sessions.

Further, participants can choose to participate in either Study Part A or Study Part B, or both. 

This study will continue until all participants have been tested.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is the age-matched control group. This group will receive all of the same cognitive/ clinical tests and brain imaging techniques as the clinical group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall purpose of this study is to develop magnetic resonance imaging methods to measure degeneration of brain regions and to validate new cognitive tools for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We expect that people in the control group will perform better on the cognitive tasks than people in the mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups (Part A). We also expect that people's performance on the cognitive tasks will be correlated with their brain volume as measured by the MRI (Part B) and that people's MRI screens will be predictive of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis (Part C).</summary>
