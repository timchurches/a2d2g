    <interventions>Provision of a question prompt list (QPL) to cancer patients (new and follow-up), the implementation method of which is to be negotiated with each individual cancer center. May include (i) receptionist offers QPL upon arrival to center, (ii) QPL sent out to patients prior to consultation, (iii) the participating doctor will offer the QPL in consultation, or (iv) the clinical care co-ordinator will offer the QPL at surgical discharge or initial medical oncology consultation. Implementation at each cancer center will be monitored for a period of 4-6 weeks (total period of data collection = approx. 6 months)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to establish the feasibility and acceptability of implementing Question Prompt Lists (QPLs) to cancer patients in order to improve doctor-patient communication and encourage greater patient involvement in decision-making during oncology consultations.  The QPL is a structured list of questions relating to illness and treatment that a patient may ask of their oncologist or surgeon.  Previous research evaluating their effectiveness has consistently shown increased question asking during consultation and increased patient satisfaction post-consultation.  As few evidence-based interventions are integrated into clinical practice, this project will examine the practical effects of, and attitudes to, the implementation of QPLs in four major hospitals across NSW.</summary>
