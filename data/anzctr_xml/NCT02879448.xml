    <inclusivecriteria>1. 18 years of age or older

          2. Documented paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF)
             and the patient has not been diagnosed with rheumatic mitral valvular heart disease

          3. At high risk of stroke or systemic embolism defined as CHADS2 score &gt; 2 or a
             CHA2DS2-VASc score of &gt; 3

          4. Has an appropriate rationale to seek an alternative to warfarin or other
             anticoagulation medication

          5. Deemed by investigator to be suitable for short term warfarin therapy but deemed
             unable to take long term oral anticoagulation following the conclusion of shared
             decision making (see inclusion criteria #6)

          6. Deemed suitable for LAA closure by a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals
             (including an independent non-interventional physician) involved in the formal and
             shared decision- making process, and by use of an evidence-based decision tool on oral
             anticoagulation (final determination must be documented in the subject's medical
             record)

    <summary>The Amulet device will be evaluated for safety and efficacy by demonstrating its performance
      is non-inferior to the commercially available WATCHMAN® left atrial appendage closure device
      in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Patients who are eligible for the trial
      will be randomized to receive either the Amulet device or the WATCHMAN device and will be
      followed for 5 years after device implant.</summary>
