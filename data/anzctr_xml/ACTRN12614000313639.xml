    <interventions>Mindfulness and acceptance-based group therapy (MABGT) for excessive worry includes 8 group sessions (1 x 2 hours session per week for 8 weeks) with 6 participants in each group. The MABGT program is based on the treatment manual for Geralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) by Roemer &amp; Orsillo (2005, 2007). The current study will only include the acceptance component in the original program and modify it to an eight-session intervention based on the procedure in the previous studies (Craigie, et al., 2008; Evans, et al., 2008). The MABGT begins with psychoeducation about worry and its function as experiential avoidance and how this impacts on performance and quality of life. Mindfulness practice is included to promote awareness and acceptance along with breathing exercise, progressive muscle relaxation and exploration of personal values. Self-monitoring forms are used to monitor daily activities to understand how often they engage in a specific valued activity and their internal experience (thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations). </interventions>

    <concealment>When volunteers make an enquiry through email or phone, a research assistant (Ms Kirstie Salter) will conduct a 15-minute telephone interview to assess the individual’s apparent eligibility and answer any queries. Following telephone screening, participants will be directed to a website link to complete the screening questionnaires assessing for excessive worry, life interference, active psychosis, suicidal ideation and alcohol/substance use. Prior to completing the online questionnaire, potential participants will receive an on-screen letter of introduction and an information sheet explaining what is required by participation. Consent is then obtained by the participant pressing an “I agree” button after reading them. Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Participants who consent will be randomly allocated to either MABGT or waitlist. Allocation is not concealed. Randomisation will be done using a random number generator in blocks that will allow for similar numbers in each treatment condition. All participants will complete the assessment measures at baseline and after treatment/waitlist. Participants in active treatment will also be sent email links to online follow-up questionnaires at 3 months after the treatment completion. All waitlist participants will be offered the MABGT at week 8 after their waitlist period. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>In Craigie, et al. (2008), post-treatment response of participants with GAD in a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy compared to their pre-treatment in PSWQ was 9.26 with a baseline standard deviation of 6.57. When this effect size is considered with an overall alpha level of .05 and a power of 80%, 22 participants per group are needed. Allowing for 20% attrition rate 30 per group are needed.

Separate outcome analyses will be conducted with the completer sample and the primary intent-to-treat sample. Missing data for dropouts will be estimated using multiple imputation strategies (Rubin, 1996). Our primary analysis comprises a pairwise comparison between MABGT vs. waitlist. The clinical significance of pre-post differences will be assessed using Cohens d statistic. The percentage of participants achieving statistically reliable change on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) will be determined using the reliable change index (Jacobson &amp; Traux, 1991).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anxiety and depression co-occur highly with each other, with 69% of anxious youth being diagnosed with depression and up to 75% of depressed youth meeting criteria for an anxiety disorder (Angold, Costello, &amp; Erkanli, 1999). When different classes of disorders co-occur at such high rates, selecting an appropriate treatment approach can be challenging. 

Traditional CBT for anxiety or depression are mostly single-target approaches focusing specifically on either anxiety or depression. Evidence-based interventions for multiple problems required a therapist to prioritise treatment goals and treat one problem at a time (Barlow, Allen, &amp; Choate, 2004). However, this approach risks client drop out before he or she receives essential treatment for co-occurring difficulties (Rohde, 2012). In addition, multiple interventions are often costly to the public health care system (Jacobson, Martell, &amp; Dimidjian, 2001). Given that the high comorbidity rates complicate the conceptualisation and provision of treatment and are generally associated with higher dropout, lower recovery, and poorer maintenance of gains (Rohde, 2012), treatment strategies that are flexible enough to accommodate diverse problems are needed. Recent development in unified treatments suggests that a transdiag-nostic approach appears to be more efficient and effective than treating disorders in a serial manner (Barlow et al., 2004). 

Unlike most traditional disorder specific treatments, transdiagnostic approaches target common features underlying symptoms in comorbid disorders (Barlow et al., 2004). They are more time-efficient and cost effective, simplifying treatment for both the client and therapist, which could improve the quality of care and satisfy a great need in public health (Rohde, 2012). Recent research (Barlow, et al., 2004) has identified that one of the common features in anxiety and depression is worry, a repetitive negative valanced process that reflects an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the occurrence of negative events or to devise coping strategies in case such events occur. Worry is an essential feature of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and is a presenting characteristic across all anxiety disorders and depressive disorders (Starcevic, et al., 2007).

Worry is characterised by the repeated experience of thoughts about potential negative events, and reported proneness to worry varies continuously across the normal population (Ruscio, Borkovec, &amp; Ruscio, 2001). According to the most widely recognized model of GAD (Borkovec, Alcaine, &amp; Behar, 2004), worry functions as a cognitive avoidance response, suppressing images and somatic activation and preventing the individual from emotional processing of fear that is important for successful habituation and extinction (Foa, Huppert, &amp; Cahill, 2006). Such avoidance brings initial relief but results in anxiety maintenance. The repetitive negative thoughts involving anticipating future threat in worriers may disrupt the implementation of effective strategies to solve problems, resulting in maintained or exacerbated levels of distress. Resent data has also highlighted the importance of behavioural avoidance in worry such as reassurance seeking, procrastinating, or over-preparing, aimed at reducing distress in the short term but contributing to the long term maintenance of symptoms (Beesdo-Baum et al., 2012). Therefore, an approach targeting such avoidance strategies in worriers is warranted.

Drawing from findings by Borkovec and colleagues (2004), Roemer and Orsillo (2005, 2007) argued that cognitive avoidance in worry may be experiential. That is, excessive worriers may be actively and/or automatically avoiding unpleasant internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, or bodily sensations) by focusing on future events and such avoidance is paradoxically associated with increased distress. Accordingly, training in the skill of mindfulness (i.e., paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment in a non-evaluative and expanded way to both internal and external sensations) may help to break this habitual anxious cycle of worry. An acceptance-based behaviour therapy (ABBT) was developed to specifically target the experiential avoidance in people with generalized anxiety disorder (Roemer &amp; Orsillo, 2005; Roemer &amp; Orsillo, 2007). The principles of the ABBT include (1) expanding present-moment awareness, (2) encouraging acceptance (a willingness to have ones internal responses in order to participate in meaningful experiences) rather than judgment and avoidance of internal experiences, and (3) promoting action in areas of importance to the individual. A recent meta-analysis has revealed that ABBT is effective at reducing worry and that gains are largely maintained at follow-up (Hanrahan, Field, Jones, &amp; Davey, 2013). Further, Hayes, Orsillo, &amp; Roemer (2010) found that both acceptance of internal experiences and engagement in meaningful activities were related to treatment responders status at post-treatment and predicted treatment outcome. Specifically, change in acceptance was related to quality of life at post-treatment. Based on these findings, the current study will emphasise the acceptance component and investigate whether such acceptance approach is effective at improving excessive worry in a sample of community populations. Specifically, we investigate the effect of a mindfulness and acceptance-based group therapy (MABGT) for excessive worry by comparing it with a waitlist control.
