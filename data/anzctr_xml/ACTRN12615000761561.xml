  <interventions>
    <interventions>The administration of Truce, a manualised, structured Acceptance and Commitment Therapy program for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with a parent with cancer. The program is delivered orally in a group format, by two psychologists/social workers with training in ACT. Groups consist of 4-8 participants and runs once a week for 7 sessions of 1.5-2 hours duration, for an overall duration of 7 weeks. Parallel to the intervention one parent of the participant (not necessarily the parent with cancer) is given a psychoeducational booklet which provides details about the program, ACT and research findings regarding the impact on children of having a parent with cancer. Session 6 is a joint participant-parent session. The content of session 6 follows on from the content of the parent psychoeducational booklet and provides an opportunity for the participants and their parents to discuss issues pertinent to the family situation when a parent has cancer. 


Homework is administered through weekly tasks with a participant booklet. Homework exercises consist of small daily tasks that would take approximately 30-60 minutes per week. Fidelity to the program measured by facilitator compliance to the manualised program, homework compliance and participant engagement. Facilitator compliance is measured through written logs of each group session which is sent to the independent administrating team and discussed at weekly briefing/debriefing meetings. Homework compliance is measured by a homework log that is completed by the participant at each session and forwarded to the administration team. Participant engagement is measured through a 10-point scale of session engagement administered to each participant at the end of each session. </interventions>
    <comparator>wait-list control group comprises of participants who are interested in the program but unable to attend the group or it is  not available in their area. Provided with an informational booklet until eligible/available for group participation. 
The informational booklet is uses psychoeducation: about cancer, treatment, some of the common family changes that can result from having a parent with cancer and practical suggestions for support and emotional regulation. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample will include a total of 130 young people who have a parent with cancer and, where possible, one parent of each young person. The number of required participants is based on sample size analyses assuming: 80% power, alpha of 0.05 and a minimally important change in K10 scores of 4.9 (effect size of 0.5). According to these calculations, 65 participants are needed in each of the intervention conditions.

Descriptive statistics will be used to report demographic information. Fidelity and satisfaction measures will also be summarised. Missing data will be managed using multiple imputation techniques. The impact of the treatment condition on the change in outcome variables will be assessed using mixed-models statistical analysis. Secondary analyses (such as testing for potential moderators and mediators) will be conducted using multiple regression statistical techniques.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to measure the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in reducing distress and increasing positive wellbeing in Adolescent and Young Adults (AYAs) who are offspring (children) of cancer patients. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 14 and 22 years and have a parent or caregiver with a current (last 5 years) diagnosis of cancer, who is not currently in palliative care or terminal.
Study details:
Participants in this study will receive Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in small group sessions administered by 2 psychologists/social workers trained in ACT. Sessions will be conducted weekly in 1.5-2 hour sessions across seven weeks. ACT is a psychological therapy designed to help people find new ways of managing their difficult thoughts and feelings by changing how they respond to them. ACT teaches skills in mindfulness and also ways to commit to values-based living despite difficult circumstances. 
Completion of 6 homework tasks, administered weekly is also required. Participants who are interested in the program but unable to attend the group or if it is not available in their area, will be provided with an informational booklet until eligible/available for group participation. All participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires at baseline, post-intervention and 2 months post intervention in order to evaluate their levels of distress, depression and their psychological wellbeing.</summary>
