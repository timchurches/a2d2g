  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A reduction in third or fourth degree perineal tears.

Third or Fourth degree tear defined as:

Third degree: 
Injury to perineum involving the anal sphincter complex
3a: Less than 50% of external anal sphincter thickness torn
3b: More than 50% of external anal sphincter thickness torn
3c: Both internal and external anal sphincter torn

Fourth degree:	
Injury to perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (external and internal anal sphincter) and anal epithelium  (i.e. involving anal epithelium and / or rectal mucosa)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following delivery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain: The VAS will be used to measure perception of pain. The VAS is an ungraded 100mm long horizontal straight line with the endpoints no pain to the left  (0) and worst pain imaginable to the right</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain will be assessed at one point between 12-24 hours post delivery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infection: For surgical site surveillance, the clinician adheres to criteria defined by the National Nosocomaial Infection Surveillance System</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 weeks post delivery:</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dehiscence:  A follow up phone call made by the Researcher to each participant 3 weeks following birth and data collected from chart audit relating to perineal outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Third and 4th degree tears occur during childbirth when an episiotomy (a cut made to enlarge the birth canal) extends to the anal sphincter. At the research hospital, higher than average rates of 3rd and 4th degree tears have been observed among women having their first child. Episiotomies are generally cut on an angle, away from the anus but studies suggest that the angle is often less than the recommended 45 degrees. One strategy to ensure a 45 degree angle and to potentially decrease 3rd and 4th degree tears may be to use curved scissors that naturally take the incision away from the anus. The proposed study will test this assumption by comparing straight and curved scissors to cut an episiotomy.</summary>
