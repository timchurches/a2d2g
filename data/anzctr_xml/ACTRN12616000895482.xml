    <interventions>Standard care arm
Temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel or prasugrel or ticagelor):
Cessation 7 days prior to colonoscopy and recommencement 2 days after colonoscopy. 
If a patient is not usually on aspirin, low dose aspirin (75mg - 100mg) orally daily will be commenced to bridge the period the patient is off antiplatelet medication. 
If a patient is on antiplatelet therapy plus aspirin, patients usual dose of aspirin is continued
If there are any concerns about temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy, the endoscopist can liaise with cardiology/neurology to decide whether it is appropriate to temporarily interrupt antiplatelet therapy, or the patient can be excluded from the trial.  

Polypectomy:
Cold snare polypectomy 
Polyps less than or equal to 10mm 
Up to 10 polyps during a single colonoscopy
Observe polypectomy site 
If there is any bleeding observe for 2 minutes. 
At the end of 2 minutes if haemostasis has not occurred, adjunctive therapy in the form of mechanical clips will be used.
If polyps larger than 10mm are encountered, management is up to the discretion of the endoscopist with options including a) piecemeal cold snare, b) endoscopic mucosal resection, c) reschedule patient. 

Intervention arm
Continue antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel or prasugrel or ticagrelor).

Polypectomy:
Cold snare polypectomy 
Polyps less than or equal to 10mm 
Up to 10 polyps during a single colonoscopy
Observe polypectomy site 
If there is any bleeding observe for 2 minutes.

    <concealment>Patients will be screened for eligibility from their referrals to the endoscopy service or identified in gastroenterology clinic and mailed the Participant Information and Consent Forms together with a letter of invitation and reply-paid envelope. Eligibility will be confirmed by a member of the research team at a follow up phone call approximately one week after patients have received the PICF. Patients who are willing to participate will be asked to return the signed PICF. On receiving the signed consent form, the research nurse will randomise participants according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence which will be placed in opaque sealed envelopes. Patients will then be notified by telephone call of their randomisation. Endoscopists will remain blinded to allocation.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Analysis sets
Full Analysis Set 1 (FAS1):  All patients who were randomized to a treatment arm.  In accordance with the intention to treat principle, these patients will be analysed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized regardless of subsequent treatment actually received.

Full Analysis Set 2 (FAS2):  The set of randomized patients, a subset of FAS1, who subsequently had a polypectomy.  In accordance with the intention to treat principle, these patients will be analysed according to the treatment arm to which they were randomized.

Per-Protocol Set 1 (PPS1):  The subset of patients in FAS1 who did not have a major protocol deviation.  Major protocol deviations include, but are not limited to: Actual study treatment different from the treatment assigned by randomization, and, documentation that key exclusion criteria were met at the time of randomization, namely, liver cirrhosis, chronic renal impairment (eGFR less than or equal to 30), history of a bleeding diathesis, thrombocytopenia of any cause (Platelet count less than or equal to 90), other concurrent anticoagulation/antiplatelet agents, percutaneous coronary intervention with bare metal stent within the last 30 days or with drug eluding stent within the last 12 months, or, acute coronary syndrome within the last 90 days.  Other major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from PPS1 will be identified and documented prior to the locking of the database for the final analysis.

Per-Protocol Set 2 (PPS2):  The subset of patients in FAS2 who did not have a major protocol deviation.  Major protocol deviations include, but are not limited to, those listed for PPS1.  Other major protocol deviations leading to exclusion from PPS2 will be identified and documented prior to the locking of the database for the final analysis.

Safety Set 1 (SS1):  All patients in FAS1 who subsequently have a colonoscopy.  Randomized patients who withdraw or who are deemed lost-to-follow-up prior to their scheduled colonoscopy will be excluded from SS1. 

Safety Set 2 (SS2):  All patients in FAS2.

2. Primary endpoint
Occurrence of a bleed defined as (i) the use of rescue endoscopic clips post-polypectomy to control immediate intra-procedural bleeding or (ii) the occurrence of a symptomatically or clinically overt major post-polypectomy bleed.  This endpoint is measurable only in randomized patients who subsequently have a polypectomy (FAS2).

3. Statistical hypothesis, model and method of analysis
We wish to compare the occurrence of bleeds with the intervention (continuous antiplatelet therapy) to the standard practice or control (temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy, defined as cessation 7 days prior to colonoscopy and recommencement at least 2 days after colonoscopy).  The proportion of patients in a treatment arm who experience a bleed will be calculated using the number in that treatment arm who are in the analysis set as the denominator.  We will investigate if one treatment arm is inferior (greater occurrence of bleeds) to the other.  

4. Handling of missing values, censoring and discontinuation
Patients in FAS2, the set of randomized patients who subsequently had a polypectomy, who for any reason have a missing assessment of the primary endpoint will be deemed to have met the primary endpoint (i.e. a bleed event).

5. Supportive analyses
Two supportive analyses of the primary endpoint are anticipated.  In the first supportive analysis, the two-sided binomial test will be repeated on PPS2 (the subset of patients in FAS2 who did not have a major protocol deviation).  In the second supportive analysis, limited to patients in FAS2, a logistic regression analysis of the occurrence of a bleed event will be conducted with covariates that include, but are not limited to, type (if any) of anti-coagulants, gender and age.  The adjusted odds-ratio, and its associated 95% confidence interval, for a bleed event in the intervention arm versus the control arm will be reported, one-by-one for each covariate and for a best fitting model involving some or all of the nominated covariates.  The set of candidate covariates will be pre-specified in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be finalized prior to the first interim analysis.

6. Secondary objectives, endpoints and analyses
Analyses of all binary secondary endpoints will be restricted to FAS2 and will be of two types  two-sided binomial tests and logistic regression analyses in the manner of the supportive analysis of the primary endpoint.  Details will be pre-specified in the SAP.

7. Safety objectives, endpoints and analyses
Summary tables of adverse events of any grade, occurring up to 30 days post colonoscopy, will be reported by type and treatment arm for both SS1 and SS2.

8. Interim analyses
We are aiming for a target of 992 patients in FAS2 and we expect that this will require up to 2730 patients to be registered on the study and randomized (1:1) to the two treatment arms.  Up to two interim analyses of the primary endpoint, occurrence of a bleed event (after polypectomy), are planned to occur when approximately one third and two thirds of the patients in the FAS2 have been randomized on the study and have had their polypectomies and associated assessments.  These interim analyses will be based on the two-sided test comparing the rates of bleeding in each arm and are intended to provide a trigger for modification or stopping of the trial if one arm is evidently inferior to the other.  The Lan-DeMets (OBrien-Fleming-like) alpha-spending function will be used to set the significance level (alpha) at the time of each interim analysis.   If the interim analyses occur precisely after n=331 and n=661 patients have been assessed then the respective alphas are 0.0002 and 0.0120, and, for the final analysis, a=0.0463 (in this way the cumulative alpha at the final analysis is 0.05).

9. Sample size calculation
For the primary endpoint, we conjecture that pc = 0.10 and we will test the null hypothesis that the two treatment arms have the same rates (H0: pt = pc) with a two-sided binomial test conducted at the 5% significance level (a=0.05).  Under the specific alternative that one treatment arm is inferior to the other, either, pt  pc &gt; 0.06 or pt  pc &lt; -0.06 we require at least 980 evaluable patients (490 in each treatment arm) in order for the two-sided test to have 80% power.  With provision for two interim analyses, roughly equally spaced in terms of the number of accrued and evaluable patients, we require 992 evaluable patients (496 per arm).  We estimate that should the trial continue to a final analysis of 992 evaluable patients, we will need to make provision for the registration and randomization of up to 2730 patients.
If the trial does not stop early, and the null hypothesis is not rejected at the final analysis, the probability that the 90% CI for the difference in the rates lies entirely within the equivalence limits of +/- 0.055 is greater than 77% when the true rate is 0.10 in both treatment arms.

    <summary>Colonoscopic  polypectomy reduces morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer. A proportion of patients undergoing colonoscopic polypectomy are on antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel/prasugrel  and ticagrelor. Current recommendations about peri-endoscopic management of these medications is individualized with guidelines generally recommending temporary interruption although the evidence behind this is poor. This randomized controlled trial aims to determined whether these antiplatelet agents can be continued for screening colonoscopy, mitigating the cardiovascular risk of temporary interruption of clopidogrel/prasurgrel or ticagrelor.
