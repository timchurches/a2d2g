  <interventions>
    <interventions>Over the past 6 years, our research team has developed an evidence-based after-school program called Wollongong Sport. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Wollongong SPORT when implemented in Big Fat Smile after-school centres. We hypothesise that, over a 18 week period, children in centres randomised to implement Wollongong SPORT will significantly increase their after-school physical activity, academic performance and cognitive development compared with children in the control group.

Wollongong SPORT is a physical activity and academic enrichment program for 5-10 year-old children. It will be implemented three afternoons per week in the intervention centres. 
The Program has two components: one is optional tutoring, and two is the  physical activity sessions (90min). BFS Centre staff and pre- service UOW education students will be trained to implement the Program over a six-month period. The UOW students will be recruited through a compulsory 4th year undergraduate subject (EDSE401) in which they are required to complete a minimum of 30 hours of service in a local community-based organisation. The aim of the physical activity sessions is to engage children for at least 50% of the time in Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA), which is consistent with international policy and has been achieved in our pilot studies. Children will participate in team sports such as soccer and basketball, and activity sessions based on popular TV shows such as The Amazing Race and Survivor. All activities have been designed to be fun whilst at the same time challenging (both tactically and physiologically). There is an optional tutoring element available if the participant child wishes to take part in tutoring before the afternoon's sports session. The optional tutoring session will run for a maximum of 30 minutes. The sports program will run for 90 minutes. Giving a total program time of 2 hours, if the child takes part in the optional tutoring. Otherwise the participant will take part in up to 90 minutes of sports games.
Currently there are two intervention centres, requiring 6 students per centre to run the program. Each intervention centre will receive equipment up to the value of $500 to assist with running the program. 

Physical activity and cognitive development data will be collected at baseline and 6-month follow-up by trained research assistants blinded to group allocation. Physical activity will be measured during centre hours using the Actigraph accelerometer (worn on childs hip using an elastic belt). Cognitive development will be measured using the Figural Intersections Task (a measure of working memory/attentional capacity). All instruments are valid and reliable among primary school-aged children. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Centres randomised to the control group will continue with their usual after- school programs. The Wollongong SPORT Program, including $500 worth of equipment, will be provided to these centres at the end of the intervention period.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive development will be measured using three tasks, presented as games. All instruments are valid and reliable among primary school-aged children.
The tasks (positioned as 'games') we will be administering measure executive functions (i.e., working memory, inhibition, shifting) and non-verbal performance intelligence/reasoning.  
Details of the Executive Functioning tests are below:

The tasks (positioned as 'games') we will be administering measure executive functions (i.e., working memory, inhibition, shifting) and non-verbal performance intelligence/reasoning. The tasks are as follows:
-Matrix Reasoning Subtest of the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (non-verbal performance intelligence) - children are presented with an array of designs that form a pattern. Children are required to select the next design in the pattern from a range of options presented at the bottom of the page.
-Mr. Ant (visual-spatial working memory) - children see a cartoon ant with 1 to 8 coloured stickers on his person. Children are required to remember the placement of these stickers and, after a delay, indicate these spatial locations.
-Go/No-Go (inhibition) - children see a series of fish and sharks quickly swim across the screen. Children are required to 'catch' the fish (by tapping the screen) and 'avoid' the sharks (withhold tapping the screen). Because of the speeded nature of the task, and the majority of trials being go trials (fish), the prepotent tendency to respond needs to be overcome for no-go trails (sharks).
-Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (shifting) - children are required to sort cards by one dimension (e.g., colour) before switching to a new sorting dimension (e.g., shape). If completed successfully, children are required to flexibly switch between colour and shape sorting rules on the basis of the presence/absence of a border around the stimulus.
Together, these 4 tasks take approximately 20 minutes to complete (in some cases shorter, due to stop rules). These measures will be administered at both baseline and follow-up.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a Cohens d effect size of 0.4 (i.e. a moderate effect size) and a two-tailed, 5% alpha level test, a total sample size of approximately 104 children (52 in each group) would provide 80% power to detect an effect of at least this size. This calculation is based on estimating the effect of the F statistic of the interaction term in a repeated measures design, and is inflated to account for a mild intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC; 0.01) to reflect the group randomised design. As some attrition may occur, we will increase the sample by 15% for a total of 120 children (60 in each group or 30 per centre). This will require four centres to be recruited. Sample size calculations were done using G*Power and the adjustment for the ICC using the Killip formula.

Data analysis Plan: Each matching pair of Centres will be randomised to treatment or control group using the biased-coin method. As participants are treated within one group it is likely that, over time, their outcomes will be correlated and ignoring this correlation may result in an inflated type I error. Post hoc the ICC for the treatment arm will be estimated, however, a priori the results of the primary outcomes will be analysed using a mixed model approach where the group is included as a nested random effect and the degrees of freedom are altered based on the number of groups. Baseline measures and relevant covariates will be included with the treatment term in the model. The analysis will be conducted using PROC MIXED in SAS. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is the purpose of this study?
After-school care is formal care provided by non-school staff between 3pm and 6pm. In Australia around 10% of children aged 5-12 attend some form of after-school care. Limited Australian data exist for these settings, but internationally they are characterised by high levels of physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour and unhealthy snacking, and little opportunity for academic enrichment

The aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of the Wollongong SPORT program when implemented in Big Fat Smile after-school centres. Wollongong SPORT is a physical activity and academic enrichment program for 5-10 year-old children. This program will be implemented in your childs after school centre. The research that we are seeking your consent for is to collect data from your child on the effect of the program on your childs physical activity and cognitive development.
