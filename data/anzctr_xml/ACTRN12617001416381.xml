    <scientifictitle>CASSETTE  Clindamycin Adjunctive therapy for Severe Staphylococcus aureus Treatment Evaluation. A multi-centre, pilot RCT to determine if 7 days of clindamycin in combination with standard therapy will lead to a faster resolution of systemic inflammation than standard therapy alone in adults and children with severe methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) infection.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm1: Interventional Group (Combination therapy group) - will receive standard therapy as per control group in Arm 2. In addition, they will also receive open label clindamycin (10mg/kg/dose up to 600mg 4 times per day intravenously in both adult and children) for 7 days (day 1 being the day of randomisation  hence the actual duration of clindamycin use will range from 6 to 7 days, depending on the time of day that the patient is randomized). The intravenous route for clindamycin is recommended but not mandated for the entire duration of therapy (7days). If switch to oral therapy is thought to be necessary and appropriate by the site PI, transition to oral clindamycin 450mg 3 times per day for adults or 10mg/kg/dose orally 3 times per day (max 450mg) for children is recommended. Each dose of medication will be recorded in the case report form and analysised for adherence to at least 75%of the dosage over the 7 days. This will form part of the study analysis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: Control Group - will receive standard therapy, also called backbone therapy. This will consist of IV flucloxacillin 50mg/kg/dose up to 2g q4-6h given intermittently or given via 24-hour infusion; Flucloxacillin can be substituted with IV cefazolin 50mg/kg/dose up to 2g q6-8h if there is a history of minor allergic reaction to penicillin, as defined as rash or unclear allergic reaction, but not anaphylaxis or angioedema, or at the site PIs discretion. The dose of backbone therapy will be adjusted for renal function as per recommendations in TG15 and antimicrobial dosing in renal impairment guidelines of the Childrens Hospital at Westmead.</comparator>

    <sequence>Randomisation will be stratified by age (child versus adult) and be in a 1:1 ratio, in permuted blocks of variable size. Randomisation will not be stratified by site, as an average site is only likely to randomise 5-10 patients and hence the strata will be too small. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>60 patients, at least 20 of whom are aged less than 16 years. As this is a pilot study, the sample size is based on the number achievable in the time frame, and the number needed to determine feasibility and to refine assumptions and study design. 

Analysis of the primary outcome will be by modified intention to treat (all participants with data available for the primary endpoint will be analysed according to the treatment allocation, regardless of what treatment they received). The primary outcome measure will be compared using a Mann-Whitney U or Students t-test as appropriate.  A per protocol analysis will also be performed. The per-protocol population is defined as 1) for the clindamycin group: received at least 75% of clindamycin doses; 2) for the standard treatment group: received less than equal to 1 defined daily dose of clindamycin post randomisation; 3) has available data to determine primary endpoint. We also plan pre-specified subgroup analyses for the following groups: i) Main treatment was flucloxacillin vs. cefazolin ii) Those who received greater than 24 hours of lincosamides or other anti-toxin antibiotics in the 7 days prior to randomisation compared with those who did not. iii) Children (less than 16 years) versus adults (greater then or equal to 16 years).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine if 7 days of clindamycin in combination with standard therapy will lead to a faster resolution of systemic inflammation than standard therapy alone in adults and children with severe methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) infection. We hypothesise that the addition of lincosamides (clindamycin) to standard therapy will lead to more rapid resolution of local and systemic inflammation due to blockade of exotoxin production by Staphylococcus aureus(SA).  The results of this pilot study will be used to determine the feasibility and refine study design of a definitive randomised controlled trial assessing the effects of adjunctive lincosamide on patient-centred outcomes in children and adults with severe MSSA infection.</summary>
