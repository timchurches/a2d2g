  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time-weighted Average Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Weakness Score Over 3 Years - Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) test. QMG total scores range from 0 to 39 for a given visit, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The time weighted average is a calculation that provides an integrated measure of the outcome over the time of followup. The denominator that was used to compute the time-weighted average for the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score and the prednisone dose was the number of days from randomization to the last visit. Computations used the trapezoidal method where in the QMG score is multiplied by the number of days at this level from one visit to the next and added up over the entire followup experience and divided by the total number of days from randomization.</outcome>
