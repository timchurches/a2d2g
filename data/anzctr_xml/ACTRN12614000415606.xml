  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participatory Action Research (PAR)- community facilitation. Over a period of 9-12 months per community.
i) Share community history. This will include relaying
information from recent survey data on function,
prevalence of dementia, falls, continence issues, chronic
pain, depression, service utilisation and carer burden
to the recruited community, via
council members, local stakeholders and nominated
community champions. A formal discussion about the
PAR process will be undertaken, with permission sought
from the council. This will take place in a workshop
setting, and provide a means for the community members
to express their knowledge and history.
(ii) Create a common vision. At this workshop the health
care area/areas to develop into a program, and selection of
potential community health champions to employ will be
discussed. Example of topics that may be chosen by the
community may include ways to minimise depression, how to access services, how to minimise
carer stress etc. The community can express their wishes regarding the topics to address. Support of
project champions will be provided by researchers and project staff and will comprise regular face-to-face as well as telephone and email contact.
(iii) Identify evaluation stakeholders. Other decisions to be made at this early stage with the
community group include, the involvement of other partners (e.g. NGO, local groups, clinic staff,
HACC staff and others), nomination of a steering committee, location and time of meetings, the role
of a facilitator and establishing a conflict resolution process to manage any unresolved disagreements.
(iv) Identify indicators and targets objectives. This includes determination of outcomes and utilising resources available in the community, and the documentation of an action plan. For
example as part of a falls prevention model, a target outcome may be a medical review for all over
45 years. Alternatively it may be that a number of people in the community are supported to
undergo Aged Care III certificates or other training. The community may choose to take part in a
formal empowerment program.
(v) Identify strategies to reach targets. This will be determined by each community, facilitated by
health champions, and recorded in the action plan. One strategy for example may include an
awareness raising campaign, or a recall system through Health Workers in the clinic to address a
particular health issue. Available culturally appropriate programs may be utilised (e.g. Looking out
for dementia, Alzheimers Australia NT)
(vi) Track indicators and collect data. Researchers and health champions will facilitate this
process, that may include employment of local people to assist with data collection (see Outcome
measures below).
(vii) Analyse data. The frequency of data analysis and feedback will be determined by the group,
aiming for a number of informal reviews every 2-3 months, with a formal review at 9 months. The
2-3 monthly reviews is to ensure adequate progression towards target objectives, with review of  information collected. The reviews also comprise the reflection/evaluation stages of the PAR cycle. Researchers will be collaborating on a regular basis with local champions to trouble shoot any issues, and will call on the community committee as required.
(viii) Communicate results. The data will be presented back to the community for the iterative cycle to continue. Within this process will be a discussion of the sustainability of programs developed, and how this will be achieved long term.</interventions>
    <comparator>Regular service provision with 6-8 education sessions for carers. Over a period of 6-8 months per community.
Education sessions include: being a carer, depression, carer burden, dementia, incontinence, pain, falls, mobility and physical activity.
Duration of each education session is 2 hours.
Regular service provision continues.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project Strong Carers, Strong Communities aims to test an empowerment approach to health service development through collaboration with Aboriginal carers of people with disabilities, frail aged and mental illness. The caregivers are supported to set the service development agenda and outcomes in a culturally secure and highly participatory manner, to build capacity and drive change. Partnerships will be created with stakeholders. Comparison of outcomes from this participatory method to usual practice with education will be evaluated. The collaborative approach can be utilised as a template for future community services.
The hypothesis central to this research is that collaborative health and community services that commit to facilitating the empowerment of Aboriginal consumers will have a significantly greater impact on their health and well-being, as compared to the provision of education and regular service practice alone.</summary>
