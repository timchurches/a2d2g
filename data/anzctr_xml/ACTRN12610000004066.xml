    <interventions>The main purpose of this study is to assess the frequency of emergence of oseltamivir resistant viruses, and their virological characteristics, in patients treated with standard and double dose oseltamivir (oral capsules or suspension) for influenza caused by A/H1N1 2009 (swine flu) and other human influenza viruses during periods of high transmission. Limited clinical information will also be collected.

This is an unblinded randomized study. Patients with clinical symptoms indicative of influenza, who present within 48 hours of the onset of fever during confirmed influenza activity in the community, will be randomized to receive immediate treatment with oseltamivir at a standard age-appropriate dose or a double dose, twice daily for 5 days. Patients will have baseline virus samples taken for typing and oseltamivir sensitivity and also on day 5 of treatment.</interventions>

      <outcome>The objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of double dose Oseltamivir treatment initiated within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms compared with standard dose Oseltamivir on:
Primary
1. frequency of isolation of resistant virus in subject aged 5 years or greater. 

Virological test including culture/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) will be done to check viral resistance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every patient will be treated for 5 days with oseltamivir. Nasal swab for virological test will be collected before commencing the treatment (Day 1) and after 5 days (Day 5) of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. reductions in viral load</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nasal swab for virological test (culture/PCR) will be collected before commencing the treatment (Day 1) and after 5 days (Day 5) of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Presence or absence of clinical signs and symptoms in patients shedding resistant virus at day 5.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical information collected before commencing the treatment (Day 1) and after 5 days (Day 5) of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Do those who begin treatment after 24 hours and up to 48 hours derive benefit from the treatment? Stratified analysis by duration (&lt;24hours, 24 to 48hours) of symptoms before commencement of treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical information collected before commencing the treatment (Day 1) and after 5 days (Day 5) of treatment.</timepoint>
