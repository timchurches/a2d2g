  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aboriginal Community Control Health Organisations (ACCHOs) in the intervention arm will receive a multifactorial, ecologically based collaborative intervention for 24 months. Strategies, including recall registers and reminders, access to specialist advice, and staff training, will be included within a broader ecological approach which will identify and address barriers to change. Representative from each ACCHO will meet with researchers to review data related to screening and managment of Type 2 diabetes, explore the evidence practice gap and discuss potential solutions.  Workshops at ACCHOs and inter-organisation meetings will be held throughout the intervention to provide educational material, staff training, and information on effective recall and reminder systems. ACCHOs will be able to access a website that will contain latest information on diabetes care, information tailored for each ACCHO, guidelines and clinical care prompts. Each ACCHO will set short-term and long-term clinical targets. There will be on-going feedback of clinical data to ACCHOs and access to an expert advisory group to help develop systems to providing best practice diabetes care.</interventions>
    <comparator>ACCHOs in the control group will not be provided with feedback data or assistance from the research team. Their patients will receive the usual care during the intervention and assessment period. If the outcome analysis indicates  there has been a significant positive effect on screening and managment of type 2 diabetes in intervention ACCHOs then the control group will be offered the intervention.</comparator>

random plasma glucose test within the recommended 3 year period.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ACCHOs have an important role to play in reducing the impact of diabetes on Indigenous people. This study aims to trial a strategy for helping ACCHOs improve screening for diabetes and diabetes care. Existing data such as rates of HbA1c testing and outcomes of these tests will be used to assess whether the strategy is successful</summary>
