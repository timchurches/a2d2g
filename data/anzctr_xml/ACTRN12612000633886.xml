    <interventions>Low level laser therapy (LLLT)
The irradiation will be performed in contact mode with the laser probe held stationary with slight pressure at a 90 degrees angle on each of the three treatment points and to do the LLLT irradiations in the same biceps area for each participant, a template will be utilized. The three treatments points will be along the muscle belly of brachii biceps and each application of laser will be approximately 45 seconds. . Each subject will receive two irradiations, in the same day, with either active LLLT or placebo LLLT, finishing 5 minutes before and commencing 5 minutes after the eccentric exercise protocol. The laser parameters are: 830 nm infrared wavelength (GaAlAs), continuous wave output, optical output of 110 mW, spot size of 78 mm2, energy of 5 J per point, 12 points of irradiation, total energy of 60 J, energy density of 0,64 J/cm2. The eccentric exercise protocol  will be realized in a isokinect dynamometer with the participants seated and using the elbow/sholder attachment; three sets with 20 repetions of elbow contraction and extension, with an intensity corresponding to 80% of their predertermined maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo. The placebo group will be treated with un-activated low level laser therapy during the same time that the activated laser light.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) test</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MVC test will be carried on eight time: one week before the exercise protocol; immediately before and after exercise protocol; after 24 hs, 48 hs, 72 hs, 144hs and 196 hs of exercise.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Range of Motion. The range of motion (ROM) will be determined for the goniometer to measure the angle between the humerus and the radius. A semi-permanent marker will be used to identify the lateral middle point of the humerus, the lateral axis point of elbow joint, and the lateral middle point between radius and ulna. Flexed elbow joint angle (FANG) will be determined when the participant was asked to fully flex the elbow joint by touching his palm to the shoulder. Relaxed elbow joint angle (RANG) will be the angle when the elbow was extended (Chen et al. 2009).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The ROM will be evaluated during seven occasions: one week before the exercise protocol, immediatly after the eccentric exercise, after 24 hs, 48 hs, 72 hs, 144hs and 196 hs of exercise.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain</outcome>
      <timepoint>The algometry will be pressed against the biceps muscle skin until the participant report pain. Pressure pain algometry will be evaluated on each of 7 occasions: one week before the exercise protocol; immediatly after the exercise; after 24 hs, 48 hs, 72 hs, 144hs and 196 hs of exercise.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>creatine kinase (CK), lactate desidrogenase (LD), IL-8 and IL-6 levels through the blood samples analysis. PhD candidate Natalia Rodrigues will be undertaking the phlebotomy for blood samples. Mrs Rodrigues is
therefore currently undertaking the phlebotomist training course under the direction of certified trainer Dr
Andrew Bulmer (Griffith University), in conjunction with the Gold Coast Hospital.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The blood samples will be taken before the exercise protocol and at the following time points: one week before the exercise protocol; immediatly after the exercise; after 24 hs, 48 hs, 72 hs, 144hs and 196 hs of exercise.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle biopsies (for analysis of muscle
morphology and later analysis of mitochondrial function).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Muscle biopsies will be extracted from a sub-group of
consenting participants at two time points (1 week before and 24 hs after the exercise event at the usual peak of symptoms).</timepoint>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: Group 1: eccentric exercise protocol plus sham laser before and after the exercise protocol; and Group 2: eccentric exercise protocol plus laser irradiation before and after the exercise protocol. This division will be done one day before the eccentric exercise protocol, without the participants and the researchers knowledge. Because the division will occur using a computerised random number generator freely available on line (Randomizer.org). However, the researchers  will determine who is eligible for inclusion in the trial until complete 10 subjects.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: Group 1: eccentric exercise protocol plus sham

    <designfeatures>The effect of this relationship will be minimised by the fact that the recruitment, screening and consent
process will be conducted by the PhD student (Ms Rodrigues). n order to blind the assessor (Ms Rodrigues) A/Prof Laakso will apply the laser and sham laser to all
participants. Other than this contact, A/Prof Laakso will have no further involvement with participants.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is known that the symptoms of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), such as pain, weakness and swelling, occur after intense exercise, mainly after unaccustomed eccentric exercise. Eccentric exercise is the type that occurs when a muscle tenses whilst it is lengthening e.g., when you are lowering a dumbbell after completing a biceps curl. DOMS leads to impaired performance for athletes and untrained individuals. There are no effective means of treating DOMS other than perhaps to avoid it in the first instance. Research investigating the effect of low level laser therapy (LLLT) on muscle injury from exercises that cause fatigue, suggests that LLLT may be useful for treating DOMS. This study will analyse if LLLT, used before and after eccentric exercise, is able to prevent or minimize the symptoms associated with DOMS, as well as evaluate indicators of muscle damage that can be assessed in a range of ways including blood sample and muscle biopsy and what it will permit to visualize the muscle recovery after the eccentric exercise and laser therapy.</summary>
