  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises: A cycle of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CMR therapy). The CMR is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument. The protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF), involves the application of a probe of the CMR on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points. The protocol envisages 18 sessions of ONPF treatment on alternating days, for eight (8)weeks. Assessment, at baseline and immediately at the end of treatment, with Psychological Stress Measure Test (validated in Italian)</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The CMR device will be indistinguishable and only the external operator that will manage the computer program of randomization and assignment of the single subjects to the various therapy rooms, where to effect the therapy, will know of it.
These information will be kept in closed envelope and actually sealed by the same external operator at the end of the study. For such motive the recruited subjects, in randomised way, will be divided in four groups. The assignment to the four groups and to the therapy rooms will be produced by an external operator to our Institute through such a computerized procedure, to produce a relationship random among the two groups of around 3 to 1.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this trial we have used the Psychological Stress Measure Test  (validated in Italian) to assess the effectiveness of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO) with Conveyer of Modulating Radiance - CMR Therapy in reducing the subjective perception of stress and stress-related symptoms. The reduction of the perception of subjective stress and stress-related symptoms after a NPPO cycle with CMR therapy shows significant results (P&lt;.05) with respect to a control group that was treated with placebo (inactivated CMR).</summary>
