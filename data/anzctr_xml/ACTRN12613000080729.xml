    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization will be done prior to the commence of the study. The method of allocation concealment used sealed envelopes. 1. sealed opaque envelopes 2. The randomized code will be kept in a sealed envelope and numbered for individual patient. 3. The researcher assistant was at central administration site Allocating the treatment 1.	The participant who is in a moderate risk level of the ASSIST (score 4-26 for other substance and score 11-26 for alcohol ), will be checked for his/her inclusion/exclusion criteria by a research assistance. The eligible participant will be recruited into the study. 2.	The research assistant will administer the ASI, TLFB, SOCRETES, Life Event Record Form and SEIQol. This process will be carried out in a private room in the study hospital. 3.	Upon the completion of the above CRFs, the research assistant opens the randomization code envelope. The subject who is randomized into the BI group will be sent to the research nurse who will provide the BI. The subject who is assigned to the control group will be given a standard intervention by the research nurse. 4.	After completion of the BI or standard intervention, the appointment will be set for the subject to come back to the clinic at 3-month and at completion of the 6-month follow-up period.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be done prior to the commence of the study, using randomization permutation block.

 The randomised code will be kept in a sealed envelope and numbered for individual patient.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol and drug use leads to the highest Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) loss from several diseases and conditions, e.g. traffic accidents, cancers, liver cirrhosis, homicide and suicide. The WHO Alcohol, Smoking, Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) and its linked Brief intervention (BI) can help prevent this loss by detecting the harmful substance use and providing intervention at an early stage before it has caused serious diseases or other problems. 
Objectives of this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of the ASSIST-linked BI and standard intervention and also evaluate the cost-utility of ASSIST-linked BI for reduction of substance use in primary health care (PHC) settings.</summary>
