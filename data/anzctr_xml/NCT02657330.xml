Experimental: SBP-101 - SBP-101 is administered as a subcutaneous injection once daily, Monday through Friday for 3 weeks (total of 15 doses) followed by a 5-week rest period (3 weeks on, 5 weeks off = 1 treatment cycle). Dose escalation in phase 1a will continue until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.

    <summary>This phase 1 first-in-human study evaluates safety and tolerability of SBP-101 in subjects
      with previously treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and will identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). In addition, this study will also assess the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile and preliminary efficacy of SBP-101.</summary>
