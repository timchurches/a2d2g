    <interventions>Participants randomised to the exercise group will complete a daily home program of isometric exercise for 8 weeks. Following baseline examination, participants allocated to exercise will receive a 30 minute individualised session with the trial Physiotherapist who will provide written and verbal education about the exercise program as well as general advice regarding activity modification. Participants will be provided equipment (flask with handle) to begin their home program the following day. Isometric exercise will be performed by holding the water filled container in the affected arm, with the forearm resting on the edge of a table (elbow approximately 90 degrees flexion, forearm pronated, wrist 30 degrees extension). The water level will be initially filled to achieve a load equivalent to 20% of the maximal voluntary wrist extension capacity of the unaffected arm. Participants will be instructed to increase the load by 5% each fortnight (by adding a set volume of water). The following progressions will be adopted to enable a progressive increase in weekly exercise volume (load x hold time x sets).
Week 1: 20% load, 4x30s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 2: 20% load, 3x45s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 3: 25% load, 4x30s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 4: 25% load, 3x45s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 5: 30% load, 4x30s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 6: 30% load, 3x45s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 7: 35% load, 4x30s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Week 8: 35% load, 3x45s isometric holds, 30s intervals
Participants will complete a daily exercise diary to evaluate compliance (load, duration and sets achieved) and symptoms (rating of perceived exertion (RPE-CR10 and pain intensity (numercial rating scale, 0=no pain, 10=worst imaginable pain) during exercise. Exercise diaries will be sent to the trial Physiotherapist at the end of each week.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the control group will receive a booklet outlining standardised care (e.g., advice to remain active and continue activities that do not provoke their pain; to avoid activities that sharply increase their elbow pain or last longer than 10 minutes; to avoid gripping or lifting with the forearm pronated and arm outstretched; use over the counter pain medication or ice packs as needed). Following baseline examination, participants will meet with the trial Physiotherapist for a 15 minute individualised session to discuss the advice contained in the brochure.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this project, we will study the clinical efficacy of an 8 week graded isometric home exercise program in patients with tennis elbow, by comparing it to a wait and see approach. Exercise is commonly prescribed to reduce pain and disability from tendinopathy, however the optimal type and dose of exercise is not clear. A recent systematic review identified only two clinical trials investigating the effects of isometric exercise in people with tennis elbow, with inconsistent findings. Neither of these studies quantified the exercise load, limiting conclusions regarding dose response. We will compare the effects of an 8 week home program of isometric exercise with a wait and see approach on global recovery, pain, disability and pain free grip strength.
Many patients with tennis elbow exhibit signs of central sensitisation, including widespread sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli. It is not known whether exercise can improve the processes involved in central sensitisation. We will test the effects of 8 weeks of exercise on quantitative sensory tests and conditioned pain modulation. Exercise induced analgesia will be also evaluated at baseline using a submaximal (20% MVC) isometric endurance task. </summary>
