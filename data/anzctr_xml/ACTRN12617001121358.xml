  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants chose to join the experimental group receiving one-hour multisensory training, three times a week for twelve weeks or the control group receiving one-hour healthy education, one time for every two-week, total for six sessions. All participants were assessed at baseline, mid-test at 8th week and post-intervention. 
Training procedure for Experimental Group:
For participants in the experimental group, all subjects attended 36 individual training sessions, lasting approximately 60 min, 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Each session started with a 10-mintue warming up and a 10-mintue cool down period of stretching after training. Subjects underwent the multisensory training program consisting of: (1) Proprioceptive training, mainly for the lower limbs; (2) Vestibular and eye control training; (3) Facilitation and integration of proprioceptive and vestibular impulses. For each session, a physical therapist guided participants to accomplish each training program. The intensity progressed when the participant adapt to the program and show the better performance.  The program included: 
1. Proprioception (Bare foot)
Standing (including balance cushion, trampoline)
Weight shifting all direction
Stamping feet on the spot
Walking 
Uneven surface &amp; different texture

2. Vestibular &amp; eye control
Sitting &amp; Standing 
Head (quick) rotation with eye fixed 
Head (quick) rotation with eye followed
Head (quick) rotation with eye closed 
Standing
Disc rotation with eye open and closed 
Walking and bouncing 

3. Combined proprioception and vestibular
Standing on a balance cushion or trampoline
Head (quick) rotation with eye fixed 
Head (quick) rotation with eye followed
Head (quick) rotation with eye closed
Reaching for an object in different direction 
Catching and throwing ball
Keeping a balloon in the air
Walking 
Catching and throwing ball
Keeping a balloon in the air
Moving head or fixing gaze
Quick turn
The adherence of participants is register of attendance at sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Training procedure for Control Group:
A one-hour session of healthy promotion education provided by a physical therapist was given to participants every two-week. 6 sessions over 12 weeks in totals.  Education included issue of how to choose suitable exercises, illness knowledge and fall-prevented education and the educations are present by small group presentation session. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The effective sample size in this study was 46 based on an effect size f of 0.35, a type I error of 0.05, an 50 percent power, at least 23 patients in each group were required for identifying statistically significant differences in primary performance (two-way ANOVA). Considering about the drop out rate, we set the target sample size to 50. 
Two way ( group by time ) repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to analyze dependent variables. The independent t test and Tukey post hoc test will be used to analyze data between two group. The significance was accepted for values of p less than 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the purpose of this study is  to investigate effects of multisensory training on dual task performance in community-dwelling older adults. Fifty participants older than 65 years without neurological disorder, bone fracture impacting upper limb or lower limb activities or vestibular deficits will be recruited from communities. They are allocated into multisensory training group accepting multisensory exercise three times a week for 12 weeks or control group accepting health promotion education one time every 2 weeks over 12 weeks. Participants receive assessment of Timed Up and Go with secondary tasks (motor and cognitive), Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Scale, Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale Taiwan version, Functional Gait Assessment and 10 Meter Walk Test before and after the intervention. The two way ( group Ã— time ) repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to analyze dependent variables. The independent t test and Tukey post hoc test will be used to analyze datas between two group. The significance was accepted for values of p&lt;0.05.</summary>
