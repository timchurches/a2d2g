  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to determine whether bacteria in the colon of humans can release butyrate bound to starch.  This will be investigated by feeding a modified test starch to volunteers and measuring butyrate levels in faeces, the effects on the bacteria and other bowel health indicators.</summary>
