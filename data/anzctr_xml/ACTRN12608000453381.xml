  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention arms received dietary advice to include polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) rich foods into their daily diet for 3 months. Participants see dietitians on a monthly basis, approximately 1 hour each session, for dietary education and support and handout on the number of serves of foods was given to each participant.

Group 1: higher polyunsaturated fatty acid diet and energy balance

Group 2: higher polyunsaturated fatty acid diet plus energy deficit (deficit of 2 mega joule per day)</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arms received dietary advice to limit dietary fat intake to lower than 30% of daily energy consumption for 3 months. Participants also see dietitians on a monthly basis, approximately 1 hour each session, for dietary advice and support where handout on the number of serves of foods were also given.
