    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients undergoing elective hip or knee arthroplasty in our institution will be deemed eligible for inclusion. During preoperative anesthesia visit the patient meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be informed about the possibilities to enter the study. After inclusion the informed consent will be signed. Randomization in 1:1 proportion (stratification to hip / knee arthroplasties) will be performed on the OR by the treating anesthesiologist (member of the research team) - sealed envelopes technique. The randomization sheet will be than marked with the patients identification, sealed again and held concealed till the end of the study. All other members of the team as well as other hospital staff will be unaware of patient allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization will be performed by random drafting of sealed envelopes containing group allocation (Intervention vs. Control; 1:1 ratio). Stratification to hip and knee group (1:1 ratio).</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>As the treating anesthesiologist will provide the intervention he cannot be blinded to the group allocation. All other members and hospital staff will be unaware of the group allocation (partial blinding).</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim of the trial is to evaluate the possibility of goal-directed fluid therapy during major orthopedic procedures under general anesthesia using protocol based on pulse pressure variation obtained by noninvasive continuous arterial pressure monitoring in comparison to standard usually given care. Influence on the postoperative outcome (number and rate of complications and hospital length of stay) will be assessed.</summary>
