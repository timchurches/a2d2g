  <interventions>
    <interventions>15 subjects with no previous history of knee joint pathology had their knee joint infused with dextrose saline to a standardised intra-articular pressure of 50mmHg to mimic the swelling associated with knee injury, surgey and arthritis.

Subjects were randomly assigned to a cryotherapy (n=8) or control (n=7) group.

The cryotherapy group had crushed ice wrapped around their knee joint on a single occasion for a 20 minute duration.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective:
Arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI) contributes to quadriceps weakness and atrophy in knee arthritis and following joint injury. This laboratory based study examined the efficacy of cryotherapy in reducing quadriceps AMI caused by intra-articular swelling. 
 
Methods:
Fifteen subjects without knee pathology participated, and were randomly assigned to a cryotherapy (n=8) or control (n=7) group. Electromyographic signals (EMG) from vastus medialis and quadriceps torque measurements were recorded during maximum effort isometric contractions. All subjects then received an experimental joint infusion, whereby dextrose saline was injected into the knee to an intra-articular pressure of 50 mmHg.  EMG and torque measures were repeated.  Thereafter, the cryotherapy group had ice applied to the knee for 20 minutes while the control group did not receive an intervention.  EMG and torque measures were then collected again. Quadriceps peak torque, muscle fibre conduction velocity (MFCV) and the root mean square (RMS) of EMG signals from vastus medialis were analysed.
 
Results:
Quadriceps peak torque, MFCV and RMS declined significantly following joint infusion (p = 0.001).  Cryotherapy led to a significant increase in quadriceps torque and MFCV compared to control subjects (p &lt; 0.05). There was a trend for RMS to increase more in the cryotherapy group relative to the control group (p = 0.09). 

Conclusions:
The study demonstrated that cryotherapy is effective in reducing AMI induced by swelling. Cryotherapy may allow earlier and more effective quadriceps strengthening to take place in patients with knee joint pathology.</summary>
