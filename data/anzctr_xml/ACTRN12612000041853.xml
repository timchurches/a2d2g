  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects with a clinical diagnosis of cervicothoracic regional myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) will be randomly allocated to equal test and control groups; the test group will self-apply quadripolar magnets that contain two positive and two negative poles arranged in a circle. The magnets will be self-applied on the surface of the skin directly over a clinically identified myofascial trigger point locus in the supraspinatus muscle for seven days beginning immediately upon waking in the morning and removed before retiring for the evening. Subjects will also be asked to complete a daily pain questionnaire just after removing the magnet for the evening.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects in the control group will self-apply a sham device, identical in appearance to the quadripolar magnets used in the test group. However, the sham device will have no magnetic properties and like the test device, it will be self-applied on the surface of the skin directly over a clinically identified myofascial trigger point locus in the supraspinatus muscle for seven days beginning immediately upon waking in the morning and removed before retiring for the evening. Subjects will also be asked to complete a daily pain questionnaire just after removing the magnet for the evening.</comparator>

    <concealment>Prospective participants will be recruited from the patient roster of an outpatient medical clinic and asked to complete a confidential medical history to identify exclusion criteria.  The presiding clinician will then perform a physical examination to identify trigger points in the supraspinatus muscles bilaterally.  Qualifying participants will then be randomly allocated to test or control groups by the clinic research assistant using a random draw technique.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation will be performed using a random draw technique using labelled slips of paper (test, control) drawn from an opaque bin.  The research team will be blinded to group allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Musculoskeletal conditions are the most common cause of long-term pain and physical disability.  Given the aging population, cost-effective approaches to treatment and management of myofascial pain are vital to reducing the burden of these conditions on our health delivery system.  The current literature has suggests that magnet therapy may be a safe, non-invasive option in the treatment and management of MPS.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the antinociceptive effects of quadripolar magnets in the treatment of myofascial pain syndrome.</summary>
