  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) From Baseline to Endpoint</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline and 32 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Actual and Change From Baseline Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Values - The summary statistics represents the mean of all subjects. Change from baseline is calculated for each individual subject for the specific visit and then the "mean change from baseline" is calculated by averaging out for all subjects. [Sum over all (i) {A1c at Week 8 for Subject(i) minus A1c Baseline for Subject (i)}/Total Subjects]. Therefore, for example, the Change from Baseline is not equal to the difference of Mean A1c for Week 8 minus Mean A1c for baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8,16, 24, 32 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) Less Than or Equal to 7.0% and HbA1c Less Than or Equal to 6.5%</outcome>
      <timepoint>32 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7-Point Self-Monitored Blood Glucose (SMBG) at Endpoint - Actual daily mean blood glucose levels at endpoint. The SMBG excursion is the difference between the postprandial and preprandial blood glucose concentration taken at the morning, midday and evening meals.</outcome>
      <timepoint>32 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycemic Variability at Endpoint - Glycemic variability was measured by standard deviation (SD) value of fasting blood glucose as measured by intra-patient glycemic variability (determined by the 7-point self-monitored blood glucose [SMBG] profiles at endpoint); mean value (M-value), which was the mean of the intra-days self-monitored blood glucose values, and by the mean of daily difference (MODD), which was the mean of the between-days self-monitored blood glucose values.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Self-Reported Hypoglycemic Episodes (Including Nocturnal, Non-Nocturnal, and Severe Hypoglycemia) Overall and at Endpoint - Nocturnal: Defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between bedtime and waking. Non-Nocturnal: Defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between waking and bedtime. Severe: An episode with symptoms consistent with neuroglycopenia in which the patient requires the assistance of another person; associated with either a blood glucose level of &lt;2.8 mmol/L (&lt;50 mg/dL) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, glucagon, or intravenous glucose.</outcome>

Non-Nocturnal: Defined as any hypoglycemic event that occurs between waking and bedtime. Severe: An episode with symptoms consistent with neuroglycopenia in which the patient requires the assistance of another person; associated with either a blood glucose level of &lt;2.8 mmol/L (&lt;50 mg/dL) or prompt recovery after oral carbohydrate, glucagon, or intravenous glucose.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of insulin lispro protamine
      suspension (ILPS) as compared to insulin detemir as basal insulin combined with mealtime
      insulin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. A gatekeeper strategy will be employed for
      sequentially testing the secondary objectives.</summary>
