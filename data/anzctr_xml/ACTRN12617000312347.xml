  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the interventional arm will be those who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The interventional involves patients receiving a personal activity tracker (Fitbit Charge 2) prior to hospital discharge. They will be educated regarding its use and will be asked to aim for a minimum of 10,000 steps per day. This will also be synchronized with the Fitbit application on the patients smartphone. Prior to randomisation the patients will undergo physical activity testing in the form of a 6 minute walk test, with distance recorded. In addition other baseline characteristics will be recorded with testing of mood, exercise motivation, quality of life and physical activity levels. Patients will have no further interaction with investigators until the 8 week follow up at which point all tests will be repeated. The patient will be followed up as an outpatient in a clinic to be determined. Adherence to intervention (device worn and steps taken) will be assessed remotely via automatic uploading of the step count to the Fitbit cloud. There will be no interventions to improve fidelity during the study period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control arm will complete cardiac rehabilitation as per standard of care. This includes either a 4 or 6 week cardiac rehabilitation program incorporating education regarding diet, cardiovascular risk factors and prescription of a tailored exercise program. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>UP-STEP ACS is a prospective single-blinded, two-arm, parallel, randomized control trial with an aim to enrol 200 patients assessing the affect that personal activity monitors have on exercise capacity in patients post acute coronary syndromes primarily measured by a six minute walk test. Secondary end points will be the change in cardiovascular risk factors, namely; blood lipid and glucose levels, weight, waist circumference, medication adherence, mood and quality of life and cardiac rehabilitation adherence. Patients will be randomized to either receive a personal activity tracker or not after initial baseline assessment has been completed while inpatients during their index event. At 8 weeks patients will return for a clinical review and repeat of baseline assessments.  </summary>
