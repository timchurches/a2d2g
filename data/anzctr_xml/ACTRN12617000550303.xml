    <statisticalmethods>The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) "benchmark" for hip prostheses is a revision rate of 10% or less over a 10 year period. Data in the current study will be used to determine revision rates for this study population and will be determined using Kaplan-Meier methods. The Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel (ODEP) which advises the NHS Supply Chain, require 10 years of followup in at least 500 patients across 3 or more center to be able to classify the evidence for clinical effectiveness of a prosthesis as "strong". Data from this study will support global data to evaluate the ODEP rating for this device.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> Factors for operative treatment include severity of diseases that affect the hip, symptoms, clinical finding on physical examination and radiological assessment of the hip.  When referring to total hip replacement (THR) surgery, both the acetabular socket and the head of the femur are replaced with a suitable prosthetic device consisting of a cup fitted into the acetabulum (socket) and a new head (ball) with stem fitted into the upper shaft of the femur.

Two major factors influence the outcome of THR (outside the surgery process itself) and these are the fixation of the components to the bone and wear of the implanted surfaces. (between the ball and socket).  THR is an extremely successful operation due to continuous improvements in surgical techniques, bio-materials and implant design.  It is necessary however, to safely evaluate new advances in the design of hip replacement components so that improvements are sought to continually enhance patient outcomes. The design and materials used in the MASTER-SL femoral implant are very similar to other prosthesis already used by surgeons. 

The aim of this trial is to assess the clinical performance of the MASTER-SL femoral stem over a two year period under standard condition of use in THR.</summary>
