  <interventions>
    <interventions>Empagliflozin 25mg orally daily for 6 months. Compliance will be monitored by assessing drug packets returned.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Protocol compliance, measured by the frequency of deviation from the study protocol. Deviations will be assessed by pill counts at monthly visits and by reviewing visit data, collected monthly for the first 3 months and then 6-weekly up to 9 months after starting study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>9 months after starting study drug.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number and severity of adverse events. 
Adverse events will be reported directly to the medical monitor by email or telephone. The severity will be graded 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively for mild, moderate, severe and undesirable, life-threatening and disabling, and fatal events. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
1.	Unrelated: The adverse event is clearly not related to empagliflozin.
2.	Unlikely: The adverse event is doubtfully related to empagliflozin.
3.	Possible: The adverse event may be related to empagliflozin.
4.	Probable: The adverse event is likely related to empagliflozin.
5.	Definite: The adverse event is clearly related to empagliflozin.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Beta cell function, defined as the  C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) for two hours following a liquid meal. Serum C-peptide will be measured by Royal Melbourne Hospital Biochemistry Laboratory.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The C-peptide AUC will be calculated from results obtained at -10, -5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after the mixed meal. The C-peptide AUC will be calculated at 3, 6 and 9 months after starting study drug.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Glycaemic variability, measured using a masked iPro subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor, worn for 96 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Empagliflozin is used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by promoting loss of glucose in the urine. Recent evidence suggests this drug might help preserve pancreas function in people with diabetes. This study will assess the feasibility and safety of this approach in people who are within 100 days of being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. </summary>
