  <interventions>
    <interventions>688 subjects were selected randomly from a 888 group to be subjected to a cycle of Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF) with CMR therapy and 200 subjects were used for the control group.The instrument used in this study is a biomedical radiofrequency instrument, called Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CRM) authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health, in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC.The empiric protocol used, called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (ONPF)®, involves the application of a probe of the CMR® on specific points of the auricular pavilion for an activation time of roughly 500 mms. The ONPF ® protocol is activated in a precise sequence on seven auricular points.The protocol envisages 18 sessions of ONPF® treatment on alternating days, for eight (8)weeks. 
In this study we have chosen the PSM Test to investigate if an NPPO® cycle with CMR® therapy - is effective in reducing the subjective perception of stress, stress correlated anxiety and depression.</interventions>
    <comparator>The reduction of the symptomatology of stress correlated anxiety and depression after an NPPO® cycle with CMR® therapy shows significant results (P&lt;.05) with respect to a control group that was treated with inactivated CRM.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been shown that chronic stress causes a progressive malfunction in some structures of the nervous system which contribute to generating the symptoms of stress correlated anxiety and depression. In this study we have chosen a test used at an international level and validated in Italian (PSM Test) to prove that the use of an innovative instrument Conveyer of Modulating Radiance (CMR) - is effective in reducing the subjective perception of stress, stress correlated anxiety and depression.</summary>
