  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study follows on from a previous pilot study with a similar design (http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12611000981921.aspx) After randomisation, the patient will receive paracetamol (1gm intravenously) or placebo 6 hourly until one of the following occurs:
1. the patient ceases antimicrobial therapy
2. the patient is discharged from ICU
3. the patient is deemed to have completed the course of study medication (as described below)
4. the patient reaches day 28 post randomisation (672 hours post randomisation)

Provided that the patient remains on antimicrobial therapy and remains in ICU, they will receive paracetamol or placebo until at least the morning of study day 2. On the morning of study day 2 at 8 am the patient will be assessed.   If the patient has not had a standardised body temperature of  less than 37.5 degrees celsius for the previous 24 hours, they will continue to receive paracetamol or placebo 6 hourly and will be assessed by the research co-ordinator on each subsequent morning to determine if they have had a standardised body temperature of  less than 37.5  degrees celsius for the previous 24 hours. If, at the time of assessment, the patient has had a standardised body temperature of less than 37.5 degrees celsius for the entire past 24 hours, further study treatment will be withheld.  If the patient does not develop a fever of greater than or equal to 38 degrees celsius within 48 hours, they will be deemed to have completed the course of study medication.  If the patient does develop another standardised body temperature of greater than or equal to 38 degrees celsius, the patient will restart study medication and, thereafter, they will be assessed each morning at 8 am to determine whether they a have had a standardised body temperature of less than 37.5 degrees celsius for a period of 24 hours at which point medication will be withheld and then stopped as described above.  

Once the patient has completed the course of study medication, they may receive open label paracetamol at the discretion of the treating clinician.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy measure is the number of "alive ICU-free days" to study day 28. The number of ICU-free days will be calculated as 28 minus the number of days in ICU (excluding days of ICU readmission). Patients who die before day 90 will be counted as having zero ICU free days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>ICU-free survival will be determined at 672 hours from the time of randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean daily temperature measured via axillary thermometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study day 0 to day 7 while in ICU (determined from 6 hourly temperature measurements at 00:00hr, 06:00hr, 12:00hr, and 18:00hr)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum daily temperature via axillary thermometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>Maximum daily temperature recorded at any time during the calendar day each day from day 0 to day 28 while the patient is in ICU</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects who stop study treatment due to the development of liver dysfunction (defined as development of a serum bilirubin of greater than twice the upper limit of normal or a serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) / serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of greater than five times the upper limit of normal.)  

Note that only one of AST or ALT is required to be measured with the choice depending on local hospital preference.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Bilirubin and AST / ALT are mandatory for day 0 to day 7 while the subject is in ICU</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>Daily for study day 0 to day 7</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU-support-free survival.  The number of ICU-support-free survival days will be calculated as 28 minus the number of days in ICU (excluding days of ICU readmission) that the patient received any of the following supports - invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, inotrope or vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy or other extracorporeal support. Patients who die before day 90 will be counted as having zero ICU free days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 28.  The number of hours of each type of ICU support will be recorded daily.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital-free survival.  The number of hospital-free days survival days will be calculated as 28 minus the number of days in hospital (excluding days of hospital readmission). This will be determined from the hospital discharge date documented in the medical record.  Patients who die before day 90 will be counted as having zero ICU free days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mechanical ventilation free survival will be calculated as 28 minus the number of days in ICU receiving mechanical ventilation (excluding days of ICU readmission). This will be determined from the medical record.  Patients who die before day 90 will be counted as having zero ICU free days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 28.  The number of hours of mechanical ventilation will be recorded daily until day 28 to allow calculation of this end point</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inotrope / vasopressor free survival will be calculated as 28 minus the number of days in ICU receiving inotropes or vasopressors (excluding days of ICU readmission). This will be determined from the medical record.  Patients who die before day 90 will be counted as having zero ICU free days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>day 28.  The number of hours of inotrope / vasopressor support will be recorded daily until day 28 to allow calculation of this end point</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fever is an adaptive response to infections which occurs widely in the animal kingdom. The suppression of fever increases the risk of mortality in animals, although the effect of antipyretics in critically ill patients is unknown. The objective of this study is to determine whether paracetamol influences the risk of mortality in critically ill patients with fever and known or suspected infection. A phase 2b double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of paracetamol will be undertaken in 700 patients with fever and known or suspected infection in New Zealand and Australia under the auspices of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Clinical Trials Group (ANZICS CTG). If either the aggressive or permissive antipyretic regimes influence outcomes including survival in patients with fever and infection, the findings will have a major impact on the burden of infectious disease in New Zealand and internationally.
