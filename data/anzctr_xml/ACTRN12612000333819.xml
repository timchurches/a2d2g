  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive eculizumab by IV infusion over 45 minutes. All patients will receive study drug for 9 weeks post transplantation.  There will be 9 doses of eculizumab over 9 weeks, with 1200mg intravenously just before transplant reperfusion, followed by 900mg dosed weekly for 4 weeks, then 1200mg administered fortnightly for 6 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary composite endpoint is the week 9 post transplantation treatment failure rate defined as the occurrence of biopsy-proven AMR, graft loss, patient death or loss to follow up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Endpoints will be assessed at week 9 post transplant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and efficacy of eculizumab to prevent AMR in sensitized recipients of deceased donor kidney transplant will also be evaluated. Evaluation of these endpoints will be assessed by monitoring of all adverse events (including serious adverse events, regular monitoring of blood test results), incidence of clinically significant infection requiring intervention, incidence of biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection and incidence of allograft loss for reasons other than AMR.
Commonly reported AEs on this drug include headache, thrombocytopenia, viral infection and more severe infection including sepsis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Endpoints will be evaluated at week 9 and month 12 post transplantation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cumulative incidence of AMR occurring between week 9 and month 12 post transplant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Biopsies will be taken post reperfusion, day 14, month 3, month 12 and month 36 post transplant</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antibody mediated rejection post kidney transplant has become a significant clinical problem given that over 25% of kidney transplant candidates have antibodies (are sensitized) to potential organ donors. Currently there are no approved treatments for AMR and options to treat are limited. It is hoped that eculizumab will reduce the incidence of AMR post kidney transplant from deceased donors to whom the recipient is sensitized.</summary>
