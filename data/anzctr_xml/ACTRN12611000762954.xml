  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate all patients with cancer and develop blood clots at adult age group who are treated at the Launceston General Hospital (LGH) for their cancer during   a period of 12  months. The data of the trial will help us enormously to understand and know the risk factors for developing clots among this high-risk group of patients. 

This trial has the potential to change the treatment approach and the preventive strategies for cancer patients at all ages to improve outcome and benefit all patients avoiding serious complications of treatment of cancer.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although most patients with different blood cancers and solid tumours present with clotting, there is little known about how many patients develop these complications and what risk factors are involved.  

This study will investigate all patients with cancer and develop blood clots at adult age group who are treated at the Launceston General Hospital for their cancer. The data of the trial will help us enormously to understand and know the risk factors for developing clots among this high-risk group of patients. 

This trial has the potential to change the treatment approach and the preventive strategies for cancer patients at all ages to improve outcome and benefit all patients avoiding serious complications of treatment of cancer. 

This trial may able to change the current protocols for prevention of clots during the treatment of oncology patients by applying the best preventive strategy against blood clotting.  

We are aiming to publish these data and the trial results in adequate international peer reviewed medical journal.</summary>
