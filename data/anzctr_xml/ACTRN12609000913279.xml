  <interventions>
    <interventions>Preliminary screening of interested subjects will ensure that patients who have an existing psychotic disorder or are currently receiving any form of psychotherapy, or are alcohol or substance dependant as assessed by their treating clinician or the investigators are excluded from both groups (by notes review, discussion with treating doctor, and by checklist of questions to subjects). Subjects will then be randomised to either the CBT or standard care group. Patients in the CBT group will be offered a choice between a face-to-face therapy and online therapy. All participants randomised to the CBT group will then have a screening interview with a Clinical Psychologist to assess suitability for CBT before the beginning of the trial. Moreover, patients will need to be available to attend the 2-hour 10 week group program (1 x 2 hour session per week) at the RAH or complete online exercises under the guidance of Senior Clinical Psychologist in a similar format to face-to-face sessions and agree to complete questionnaires at baseline, (10 weeks), 6, 12 and 24 months. Patients will be required to provide written informed consent before the beginning of the trial. CBT and standard care groups will have separate patient information sheets. The CBT will be a group program designed specifically for this patient population. It will be delivered in two modes, face-to-face and online providing a patient with a choice, with both following exactly the same program. Online CBT will have a weekly chat option and option to exchange emails with a Senior Clinical Psychologist built-in, in order to provide the opportunity to interact with the therapist mirroring face-to-face groups mode. CBT is a form of psychotherapy that aims to identify and modify unhelpful negative thinking styles and the maladaptive behaviors associated with those thinking styles. The CBT intervention will also comprise elements of education about IBD and psychoeducation in addition to relaxation. The 10 week program will consist of:

Session 1: Education about CBT, IBD (gastroenterologists from the clinic will be facilitating the part on IBD). Psycho-education about stress responses and stress management techniques. Breathing control excercises. 
Session 2: Stress and Awareness. Introduction to relaxation techniques. 
Session 3: Automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions. Becoming aware of negative thinking patterns, learning to recognize anxiety-producing appraisals. 
Session 4: Cognitve restructuring: Replacing distorted thinking with more rational and balanced thoughts.
Session 5. Exposure and overcoming avoidance. Planning and increasing activities. 
Session 6. Introducation to coping strategies. Mindfulness exercise. Goal setting. 
Session 7. Assertivness training. Developing awareness of unpleasant feelings (i.e. anger) and changing maladaptive patterns. 
Session 8. Social support. Relationships and Communciation. Increasing communication around sensitve topics (i.e. sexuality). 
Session 9. Attention and Distraction techniques. 
Session 10. Relapse prevention. Predict problems for the future. Reinforce plan to use coping skills and reassess physical illness narrative using new skills learned. 

The program can be accessed via: http://www.tameyourgut.com/ 

Attendance at each weekly session will be noted and patients that did not attend at least 5 sessions will be excluded from the main analysis.

At baseline and at the end of the final group session (10 weeks) questionnaires will be handed in to participants. Follow-up questionnaires (6, 12 and 24 months) as well as all the assessments in the control group will be conducted while participants visit the clinic for a blood test. Patients will be reminded about their scheduled blood tests and will be sent a referral.</interventions>

    <concealment>After preliminary screening (as described above), permuted blocks will be used to allocate patients to either the CBT or usual care (control) group. After each 20 subjects are randomised, groups will be reviewed to ensure they are similar with respect to demographics and IBD subtype. If groups are found to differ greatly the process will be repeated until they are more similar in these characteristics. Randomisation will be conducted by a researcher with no direct patient contact (AMW). Complete blinding of patients is not possible. However, the control group will not be informed that an experimental group receives the intervention. Moreover, all treating gastroenteroligists will be blinded to whether patients receive an intervention or standard treatment, and patients will be asked to refrain from specifically discussing it with their Gastroenterologists unless they specifically wish to discuss concerns arising from the sessions.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Studies have demonstrated usefulness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in managing distress in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, few have focused on IBD course. The present trial aimed to investigate whether adding CBT to standard treatment prolongs remission in IBD in comparison to standard therapy alone.
Methods: A 2-arm parallel pragmatic randomised controlled trial (+CBT  standard care plus either face-to-face (F2F) or online over 10 weeks versus standard care alone (SC)) was conducted with adult patients in remission. IBD remission at 12 months since baseline was the primary outcome measure while the secondary outcome measures were mental health status and quality of life (QoL). Linear mixed-effect models were used to compare groups on outcome variables while controlling for baseline.
Results: Participants were 174 patients with IBD (90 +CBT, 84 SC). There was no difference in remission rates between groups, with similar numbers flaring at 12 months. Groups did not differ in anxiety, depression or coping at 6 or 12 months (p&gt;0.05). When only participants classified as in need (young, high baseline IBD activity, recently diagnosed; poor mental health) were examined in the post-hoc analysis (n=74, 34 CBT and 40 controls), CBT significantly improved mental QoL (p=.034, d=.56) at 6 months. Online CBT group had a higher score on Precontemplation than the F2F group, which is consistent with less developed coping with IBD in the cCBT group (p=.045). 
Conclusions: Future studies should direct psychological interventions to patients in need and attempt to recruit larger samples to compensate for significant attrition when using online CBT.
