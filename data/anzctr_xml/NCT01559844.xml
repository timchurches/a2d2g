  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective is to determine if the administration of a combination of sofosbuvir
      (SOF; GS-7977; PSI-7977) and ribavirin (RBV) to HCV-infected adults with hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC) meeting the MILAN criteria prior to undergoing liver transplantation could
      prevent post-transplant re-infection as determined by a sustained post-transplant virological
      response (HCV RNA &lt; LLoQ) at 12 weeks post-transplant.

      Participants will enroll in the pretransplant treatment phase (24 or 48 weeks). Participants
      enrolling for 24 weeks in the pretransplant treatment phase may receive treatment for up to
      an additional 24 weeks in the pretransplant retreatment phase. Participants enrolling for 48
      weeks in the pretransplant treatment will have a second baseline at Week 24 for combined
      analysis in the pretransplant retreatment phase.

      Participants who undergo liver transplant will stop all study drug 24 hours prior to
      transplant, and enter a 48-week follow-up phase to monitor for recurrent HCV infection.</summary>
