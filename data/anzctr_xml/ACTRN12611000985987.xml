  <interventions>
    <interventions>All children undergoing tooth extraction under general anaesthetic, if in the intervention group will have lignocaine administered prior to extraction. The lignocaine will be given lingually or buccally and all children to a maximum of 7mg/kg. The actual amount will depend on the number of teeth being extracted. All children will receive Gas induction and intra operative pain relief- Sevofluorane/Nitrous Oxide, Propofol 2mg/kg, Fentanyl 10mcg/kg, Morphine: 0.1mg/kg and Diclofenac: 1mg/kg
 A patients post operative pain and distress will be compared between the groups using the FLACC Paediatric Pain scale.</interventions>
    <comparator>All children will be treated under general anaesthetic whether having local anaesthetic or not. Children receiving standard local anaesthetic as is standard treatment at the moment will be compared to the children receiving no local anaesthetic for their teeth extractions. There is no seperate control group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When children are having their baby teeth removed under general anaesthetic (asleep) we commonly give them an injection of local anaesthetic just before they wake up to reduce the pain they may have after their operation. Some dentists do not give the local anaesthetic because children do not like the feeling of the numbness when they wake up and the numbness feeling can be quite distressing for children. All children while they are asleep are given pain medicine such as Panadol or morphine regardless of whether they get injections or not. For the children in this study we are going to use local anaesthetic in some patients and not in others and the parents and the nurses are going to determine if the children like having or not having the local anaesthetic. We expect the children will like not having the numbness feeling and the pain relief provided by the doctors (anaesthetists) while asleep will keep the children comfortable.</summary>
