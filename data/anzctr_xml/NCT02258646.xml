  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project aims to conduct a three-arm multi-center randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) on an innovative telerehabilitation intervention for patients with chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). The overall purpose of the RCT is to demonstrate whether long-term
      integrated telerehabilitation involving exercise training at home, telemonitoring, and
      education/self-management will prevent hospital readmissions, thus reducing healthcare costs,
      for patients with COPD, and will improve patient status and quality of life.</summary>
