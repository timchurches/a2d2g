    <interventions>This retrospective study aims to evaluate the role of hip arthroscopy in patients who have undergone hip resurfacing surgery and who continue to have symptoms in the same hip. 


Symptoms may include pain, stiffness, clicking, giving way episodes or weakness.  Pathologies causing these symptoms, which reside within the hip joint can be more accurately assessed and treated by the insertion of an arthoscope within the hip joint capsule.  
 
The study involves reviewing patient files and operating notes from 2001-2008, and subsequently conducting a phone call or a follow up visit, if possible, to evaluate current patient status. There will not be follow up appointments made specifically for fulfilling the purposes of the study.  However, if the patient is attending a pre-booked follow up visit, then evaluation of patient functional status will be carried out concurrently.

The source of this data will be from patients treated and seen through the Melbourne Orthopaedic Group.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess and measure the benefit of arthroscopy when managing a symptomatic resurfaced hip arthroplasty.


Results will be analysed by the researchers and then published in formal medical scientific journals. There is currently no standard scoring or analysis tools in this unique area of surgery, however the validated scoring clinical tools of the WOMAC hip score, Mahorn Hip Outcome Tool (MHOT) and the Non-arthritic hip score will provide functional quantitative data.  Total assessment of clinical signs and symptoms will also be analysed.  This will allow for a greater proportion of qualitative analysis, combined with the quantitative data collected via the validated questionnaires.</outcome>

    <summary>This retrospective study aims to evaluate the role of hip arthroscopy in patients who have undergone hip resurfacing surgery and who continue to have symptoms in the same hip. 

Symptoms may include pain, stiffness, clicking, giving way episodes or weakness.  Pathologies causing these symptoms, which reside within the hip joint can be more accurately assessed and treated by the insertion of an arthoscope within the hip joint capsule.  
 
The study involves reviewing patient files and operating notes and subsequently conducting a phone call or a follow up visit, if possible, to evaluate current patient status. There will not be follow up appointments made specifically for fulfilling the purposes of the study.  However, if the patient is attending a pre-booked follow up visit, then evaluation of patient functional status will be carried out concurrently.

By analysing our series of hip arthroscopies used to treat symptomatic resurfacing arthroplasties, we hope to better 
define and categorise causes of persisting problems.  This will help improve patient outcomes. 

Arthroscopy after hip resurfacing may assist in final diagnosis and address symptoms, yielding good clinical results.</summary>
