  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is conducted in 2 steps
In the pilot phase of the trial which is to test for feasability, first 10 patients will be treated with FOLFIRINOX.  The feasibility will be defined as the ability of 6 out of 10 pilot patients to undergo curative gastric resection within 18 weeks of starting FOLFIRINOX.
Then we will proceed to phase II of trial where patients will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to standard ECF chemotherapy versus FOLFIRINOX.  
Patients will be adequately staged using CT scan chest/ abdomen/ pelvis, Echo, lung functions and laparoscopy to rule out metastatic disease and assess fitness for curative gastric resection. The patients will be discussed at the Statewide Upper GI MDT. 
Patients will be consented and have PICC or PORT inserted prior to start of treatment. 
Folfirinox Chemotherapy will be administered for six cycles preoperatively (3 months). 
A typical cycle will consist of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 ; irinotecan 150 mg/m2; leucovorin 50mg. These will be given as a bolus simultaneously followed by 5 FU 2400 mg/m2. 5FU will be a 46-hour continuous infusion, Each cycle is given once every 2 weeks. Patients will be provided with adequate anti emetics and supportive medications as per the institution preference. Growth factors and prophylactic antibiotics are not mandated. 
Before each cycle of chemotherapy, a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests will be checked.  Patients will be reviewed and assessed every two weeks in the FOLFIRINOX arm to monitor their treatment.
After completing all prescribed cycles of chemotherapy, patients will undergo restaging with CT scan and endoscopy prior to surgery. A minimum interval of 3 weeks will be mandated from last day of chemotherapy to surgery. Majority of the patients will have surgical resection within 3-6 weeks of completing chemotherapy. Post surgery, patients will be followed clinically every 3 months and will have surveillance CT scans at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months or as clinically indicated.
</interventions>
    <comparator>ECF WILL BE THE CONTROL GROUP WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE STANDARD OF TREATMENT FOR RESECTABLE GASTRIC CANCER
ECF chemotherapy will be given as per the standard doses and schedule with 3 cycles pre-operatively followed by surgery after 4-6 weeks of last dose of chemotherapy. Once the patient recovers from surgery, chemotherapy will be restarted after 4-6 weeks of surgery. 3 cycles will be given post operatively. Each cycle consists of Epirubicin 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin 60mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle 5FU will be given as an infusion of 1400 mg/m2 over 7 days (equivalent to 200 mg/m2/day) through PICC or port on day 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Each cycle will be given intravenously every 3 weeks. Before each cycle of chemotherapy, a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests will be checked.  Patients will be reviewed and assessed every 3 weeks in the ECF arm prior to each chemotherapy cycle.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival (PFS). Progression-free survival (PFS) is the time from the date of randomization to the date of event defined as the first documented progression or death due to any cause. If a patient has not had an event, PFS is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post completion of all chemotherapy cycles after surgery, patients will be followed clinically every 3 months and will have surveillance CT scan at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months or as clinically indicated to monitor for PFS.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Ability of patients to proceed to curative gastric resection. The first 10 patients treated will form part of the pilot phase. This refers to the pilot phase of the trial, </outcome>
      <timepoint>1.Ability of patients to undergo curative gastric resection within 18 weeks of starting FOLFIRINOX will allow the opening of the randomised phase II portion. 
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Feasibility of this regimen by assessing toxicities and side effects. Adverse drug reactions and serious adverse drug reactions will be assessed by CTCAE Version 4.0, changes in hematology and chemistry values, specifically those associated with hepatic and renal function; and assessment of physical examinations, vital signs and electrocardiograms</outcome>
      <timepoint>2.Before each cycle of chemotherapy, a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests will be checked.  Patients will be reviewed and assessed every two weeks in the FOLFIRINOX  arm in the clinic on the first day of each cycle and if well, they will proceed with chemotherapy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Pathological complete response including surgical assessments of down-staging (i.e., tumor diameter, tumor stage, and nodal status). This will be assessed by CT scan and review of the surgical biopsy specimen</outcome>
      <timepoint>3.  A minimum interval of 3 weeks will be mandated from last day of chemotherapy to assess patient for eligibility for surgery. Ct scan will also be done 3 weeks after last dose of chemotherapy to assess disease response. Majority of the patients will have surgical resection within 4-6 weeks of completing chemotherapy. Post surgery, the specimen will be evaluated for pathological complete response</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Overall survival (OS). This is defined as the time from histological diagnosis to date of death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4. patients will be followed clinically every 3 months post last dose of chemotherapy and will have surveillance CT scan at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months or as clinically indicated. Minimum timepoint would be 5 years to see the overall survival rate at 5 years which will be calculated from the time they had their first cycle of chemotherapy. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The ability of 6 patients to undergo curative gastric resection within 18 weeks of starting FOLFIRINOX  will allow opening of the randomised phase II portion of the trial. 
The PFS in the ECF arm was 45% at 2 years. A clinically meaningful improvement would be increase to 65% in the experimental arm at 2 years. 
Group sample sizes of 96 in Group 1 and 96 in Group 2 achieve 80% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.200. The proportion in Group 1 (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.4500 under the null hypothesis and 0.6500 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Group 2 (the control group) is 0.4500. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with pooled variance. The significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500. To compare two survival proportion at the end of 2 years, Z test if fine and the sample size calculation is actually based on Z test with pooled variance, not Person chi-square test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy for the treatment of gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer prior to surgery.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 to 80 years and have been diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma for which you are scheduled to undergo radical gastrectomy.

Study details
The first ten participants enrolled in this trial will all receive FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy prior to surgery. If six of these participants are able to undergo surgery as planned, then all remaining participants enrolled in this trial will then be randomly allocated computer generated software to receive either FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy prior to surgery, or to receive standard care ECF chemotherapy prior to surgery. Participants in the FOLFIRINOX group will receive a 46 hours continuous infusion of chemotherapy once every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Participants in the ECF group will receive a 46 hours continuous infusion of chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 12 weeks before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery which will be also be every 3 weeks for 12 weeks . It is anticipated that all participants will then undergo surgery within 3-6 weeks.

Participants will be assessed for side effects and followed-up for up to five years to assess disease progression and survival.

It is hoped that the findings of this trial will establish whether FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy may be a safe and effective alternative to ECF chemotherapy for the pre-surgical treatment of gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
