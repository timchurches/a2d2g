    <statisticalmethods>Two analysis populations will be defined: 
* Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants who are enrolled and received study medication, completed the study, were at least 80% compliant with study medication, and showed no other serious deviations from the study protocol. 
* Safety population will include all participants who are enrolled and received at least one confirmed dose of study medication.
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of participants in each category will be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of participants appropriate or the purpose of analysis.
For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of participants), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to investigate the pharmacology of MTC896 Gel in otherwise healthy female participants with oily skin. In this study, MTC896 Gel will be applied at 1 concentration, twice daily (bid) for 4 weeks to the postauricular region (behind the ear) a region known to be rich in sebaceous glands.  Participants will be required to administer study drug at home, other than when applications coincide with study outpatient visits.

All participants will be required to attend a screening visit, at which skin oilyness will be measured with a Sebumeter (a non-invasive skin probe), If participants are deemed eligible for the study, a small biopsy will be collected from the post auricular region.  Study participants will be shown how to administer study drug, and will be discharged with study medication for home dosing.  Participants will be asked to record their doses and any symptoms in a diary during the 28 day follow up period. 
 
Participants will be asked to return for an outpatient visit after 14 days, then a final follow up visit at 28 days.  At the final follow up visit a second biopsy sample will be collected from the post-auricular region, and sebum (oil) levels will be evaluated with a sebumeter.

It is hoped that the results of this study will provide evidence that MCL16001 is able to reduce skin oiliness, and may therefore be useful in the prevention and treatment of acne.</summary>
