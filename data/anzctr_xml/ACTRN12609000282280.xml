  <interventions>
    <interventions>Activity levels will be observed on 3 separate occasions: baseline; 3-months and 1-year. Activity levels at baseline and 3-months will be measured over a 7 day period using an RT3 triaxial accelerometer worn on the right hip, an activity diary and a 7 day activity recall questionnaire. At 1-year activity levels will be measured with the Baecke physical activity recall questionnaire. The levels and types of activities performed by each of the participants at each time point will be individually recorded and thus will differ for each participant.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with an acute episode of low back pain are normally encouraged to stay active as part of the overall management of this condition. However, little is known on how activity levels influence the course of low back pain and particularly whether staying active helps to improve rates of recovery or re-occurrence of back pain over time. The main purpose of the study is to find out whether changes in the levels and types of activities performed by participants with acute low back pain have a relationship with recovery and/or re- occurrence of low back pain over a 1-year period.</summary>
