  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study tests the effectiveness of LASER acupuncture on osteo arthritis knee (OAK) pain. OAK is the most common form of arthritis. 
OAK sufferers and LASER and acupuncture practitioners would benefit from the study in a number of ways. For example, a positive outcome:
 1. Would determine an effective LASER acupuncture treatment protocol and influence clinical practice. 
2. May help reduce dependency on pharmacological treatments and alleviate associated drug side effects.
3. May reduce the cost and/or financial burden of OA treatment for individuals and the community as a whole.
4. Would help increase awareness about the choice of available treatments.

A negative study outcome:
1. May prove the null hypothesis correct (i.e. LASER acupuncture is not effective for OAK).
2. Would encourage further investigations to test the validity of the study design or develop new experiments.</summary>
