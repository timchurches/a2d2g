  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) involves the application of a weak electric current to the scalp to non-invasively increase cortical excitability. Two surface electrodes are attached to the scalp. The anode is placed on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the cathode on the right forehead. Participants sit upright in a chair and are awake and alert for the period of stimulation. 

Participants will be asked to attend for two sessions, spaced at least one week apart, with each session lasting approximately 2 hours. In each session tDCS will be applied by a trained researcher for two 13 minute blocks with a 20 minute break between. The first block of tDCS will be either active (2mA) or sham stimulation, with the second block active. Sessions will be counterbalanced across participants. </interventions>
    <comparator>Performance will be compared across the sham and active conditions. Sham stimulation will involve an identical set up and duration to active stimulation however no current will be applied. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) is believed to represent a transition period between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. People with a-MCI experience problems with their memory without it impacting on their daily functioning. As a-MCI represents a stage prior to irreversible neurodegeneration, it is important from a therapeutic perspective that neural changes occurring in a-MCI are determined in order to see if there remains potential for response to treatment. 

Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to re-organize its function in response to the environment. One aspect of this is known as long-term potentiation (LTP), which is imperative in learning and memory. LTP-like plasticity can be induced through brain stimulation techniques including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Application of tDCS through a gentle electrical current can increase brain activity as measured through electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioural outcomes. When transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied in combination with EEG, the cortical excitability of the stimulated and surrounding brain regions can be determined. This provides information about the LTP-like plasticity that is present. Recent evidence has shown that spaced application of tDCS may be more beneficial in enhancing cognitive performance and neural plasticity compared to only a single session. 

Therefore the aim of our study is to investigate whether LTP can be induced in a-MCI and if there are differences in LTP-like plasticity and cognitive performance with spaced application of tDCS compared to a single active tDCS condition. </summary>
