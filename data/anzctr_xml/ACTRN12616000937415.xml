  <interventions>
    <interventions>3x3 factorial design: Participants will be randomised into a blood pressure (BP) arm and a cholesterol arm. The BP arm consists of: 1. Low-dose BP lowering combination (telmisartan 20 mg + amlodipine 2.5 mg + indapamide 1.25 mg); 2. Propranolol (160 mg/day); or 3. placebo. The cholesterol arm consists of: 1. Low-dose cholesterol lowering combination (rosuvastatin 10 mg + ezetimibe 10mg); 2. Simvastatin (20 mg/day); or 3. placebo. Medication is to be taken orally, once daily for 12 weeks. Medication usage is assessed at every follow up visit via counting remaining capsules. Any unused medication is returned at the 12 week follow up visit.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recurrent headache is a common, disabling condition affecting millions of Australians. Migraine is a major cause of burden of disease ranking up to 6th highest cause of major disability worldwide. Globally, an estimated 0.8 billion people suffer from migraine. 
Headaches are a leading cause of lost work productivity, with reduced performance rather than absence from work being the main cause of lost productive time.
There would therefore be considerable value in a simple, highly tolerable preventive therapy for the large number of people suffering from frequent migraine. In the pilot phase of this trial, the key objectives are to determine the recruitment, adherence, BP and LDL differences and assess the safety of the inventions consisting of a low-dose BP lowering combination and/or a low-dose statin in participants who experience frequent migraine.
