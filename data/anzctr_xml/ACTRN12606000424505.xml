    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of twice-daily (bid) topical application of NEO101 in healthy adult male subjects. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at baseline and then at each study visit (every weekday during the 28-day treatment period), and at the end of the two-week post-treatment follow-up period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
