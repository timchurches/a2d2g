  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an 18-month factorial 2x2 design randomised controlled trial (with a 12 month follow-up) in which community dwelling men aged 50+ years will be randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1)  exercise + calcium-vitamin D fortified milk; (2) exercise alone; (3) calcium-vitamin D fortified milk alone; or (4) a usual care control group. Men randomised to the exercise program will be asked to train three times per week (60 minutes per session) and complete a program consisting of moderate to high intensity (60 - 85% of maximum strength) progressive resistance training (PRT) and multidirectional moderate to high impact weight-bearing activities (eg. jumping, hopping). For the first 12 months the exercises will be performed in a slow and controlled manner and for the final 6-months the program will focus on high velocity resistance training (rapid concentric muscle contractions). The exercise program will be run within community leisure centres, individually tailored and supervised by qualified trainers. Exercise logs and completed exercise cards will be regularly checked by the trainers and will be used to monitor exercise adherence. For men allocated to the calcium-vitamin D fortified milk, they will be asked to consume 400 mls/d (2 x 200 ml tetra packs) of reduced fat (1%) ultra-high temperature milk each day. Each 200 ml milk tetra pack will contain approximately 500 mg calcium, 400 IU vitamin D3, 418 kJ energy, 6.6g protein, 2.2 g fat, 11 g lactose, 100 mg sodium and 250 mg phosphorus. Adherence to the milk drink will be monitored using a daily food calendar. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive their usual care (eg. health and medical assessment/review) from their medical practitioner as required. No placebo will be used in this trial. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata on an ITT basis. Where possible, we will obtain all endpoint measures from all withdrawals and include all randomised participants in the final analysis. Baseline characteristics between the groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pooled time series regression analysis for longitudinal data will be used to test for an interaction between exercise and calcium-vitamin D3. If no significant interactions are detected, the main effects of exercise (exercise + fortified milk and exercise alone versus fortified milk and control) and calcium-vitamin D3 fortified milk (exercise + fortified milk and fortified milk versus exercise and controls) will be examined.

Sample size calculations: Using an alpha level of 0.05 and common standard deviation of 1.6% for the change in femoral neck BMD based on data by Prince et al. (J Bone Miner Res 1995), it was estimated that a sample size of 58 men per group would be required to detect a difference between any of the groups with an effect size 0.24 at 80% power (assuming a 15% attrition).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to investigate whether milk fortified with calcium and vitamin D3 combined with high intensity resistance training and weight-bearing impact exercise can lead to a greater effect on BMD at loaded sites than the sum of each factor alone in community-dwelling men aged over 50 years. It is hypothesized that the combination of exercise + calcium-vitamin D fortified milk will lead to greater gains in bone density at the hip than either exercise or calcium-vitamin D alone. This is an 18-month factorial design intervention with a 12-month follow up in which men will be randomised to one of four groups: (1) exercise + fortified milk; (2) exercise alone; (3) fortified milk alone; or (4) a usual control group. The primary outcome is femoral neck  bone mineral density. Secondary aims (outcomes) are to: 1) evaluate the effects of the intervention on DXA total hip and lumbar spine BMD, QCT bone density, structure and strength at the spine, femur and tibia, body composition (lean and fat mass and muscle size), muscle strength and function, blood pressure and blood lipids, inflammatory and bone turnover markers, health related quality of life and mood, and 2) evaluate the long-term residual effects (12 months post intervention). The results from this trial will provide important information as to whether food-based nutritional supplementation (calcium-vitamin D enriched milk) can enhance the effects of exercise on musculoskeletal health and function in older men with normal to low bone density. </summary>
