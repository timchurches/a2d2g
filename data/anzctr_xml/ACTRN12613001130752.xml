  <interventions>
    <interventions>Internet-based cognitive bias modification intervention with 4  sessions
(1 x 20 minute session/day) of written scenarios delivered over 1 week.

Each CBM session consists of delivery of 41 initially ambiguous scenarios that 100% of the time terminate with a positive resolution.

Adherence to the daily CBM sessions will be automatically tracked by the computer program. Standardised email reminders will be sent to a participant if more than 2 days lapse between logins.

Each of the 164 training scenarios is followed by a comprehension question to ascertain compliance with the training instructions.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were informed by effect sizes (ESs) reported in the most comparable study design (Clerkin &amp; Teachman, 2011) of a moderate between-group ES of training on interpretive bias of Cohens d = .76. 
We therefore estimated each condition to require a minimum of 22 participants per group (alpha = .05; power = .80), but at least 20% more will be recruited to hedge against potential data loss.
