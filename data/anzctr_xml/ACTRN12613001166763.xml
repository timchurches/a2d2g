  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behavioural activation therapy.  A behaviourally based intervention for depression which involves establishing new patterns of behaviour.

Therapy is administered in face-to-face sessions held in professional suites.  

Participants attend a weekly session of one-hour duration and undertake activity assignments over a 12 week course.  

Participants undertake activity assignments in three treatment phases.   The phases related to goals in the areas of (1) physical fitness, (2) purposeful domestic activities and (3) vocational and/or social activities.  

Treatment is based on "Lejuez, C.W., et al. (2010). Ten Year Revision of the Brief Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD): Revised Treatment Manual (BATD-R)."  The BATD-R includes a treatment adherence checklist.  The treatment sessions will be videorecorded and a researcher will rate adherence to the treatment manual</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency of engagement in activities relevant to social/vocational, exercise and ADL goals.  This is assessed by collecting logs of activities and behaviours performed by the participants. Logs are collected by the participants themselves, and by informants such as family members, carers and treatment team members.</outcome>

      <timepoint>Measurement at each phase of the study (i.e. at baseline and during each of three treatment phases, and at conclusion).  This is measured at the beginning of the study and at the end of each phase (i.e. beginning and end of baseline phase, and at the end of each treatment phase)</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a larger body of work evaluating non-pharmacological interventions for depression following traumatic brain injury (TBI).  In this project we intend to evaluate specific psychological strategies by applying a single-case experimental design (SCED), also referred to as an n-of-1 trial.  The participants will be two people with a history of TBI who are referred to a clinical psychologist in private practice.  These individuals will be subject to standardized forms of psychological assessment during a baseline phase.  They will then undergo a comprehensive psychological intervention following treatment protocols developed with non-TBI patients.  Following this time they will both be assessed during a follow up phase.</summary>
