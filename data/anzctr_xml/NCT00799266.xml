    <inclusivecriteria>Key Inclusion criteria

          1. Written informed consent before any study related procedure

          2. Children, male or female, between 5 and 17 years of age at Visit 1 of the study

          3. Confirmed diagnosis of a chronic inflammatory condition including rheumatic conditions
             or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) nonmalignant conditions requiring treatment with
             systemic glucocorticoids (including but not limited to rheumatic conditions,
             Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nephrotic syndrome),
             requiring treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (i.v. or oral) within the 12 months
             preceding enrollment in the study (any duration)

          4. LS-BMD Z-score of -0.5 or worse confirmed by the central imaging vendor

          5. Evidence of at least 1 vertebral compression fracture (at least Genant Grade 1
             vertebral compression or radiographic signs of vertebral compression) confirmed by
             central reading OR At least one lower OR 2 upper extremity long-bone, low-trauma,
             fracture which occurred sometime within the 2 years or preceding enrollment in the
             study, confirmed by central reading or radiological report. (Low trauma fracture is
             defined as falling from standing height or less).

          2. Prior use of bisphosphonates or sodium fluoride (doses for osteoporosis not for dental

             severe scoliosis or spinal fusion.

          4. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia: any value (age-matched) below the normal range at
             screening

          5. Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations of &lt; 20 ng/mL or &lt; 50

             screening visit and consent to pregnancy tests during the study.</exclusivecriteria>
