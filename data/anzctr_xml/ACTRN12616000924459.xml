    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be by intention to treat with a per protocol sensitivity analysis.  Data analysis will involve computations of Fishers exact tests (for dichotomous outcome measures), Chi-square tests (for categorical data with greater than or equal to 2 levels) and ANOVA (for continuous measures).   Data will be described using 95% confidence intervals.   A Statistical Analysis Plan will be drawn up to include a priori protocols for withdrawal, distributional transformations, outliers, methods for handling drop outs, any model assumptions including incorporation of covariates into analyses and handling of multiple comparisons.  
Power calculations are 2 tailed, alpha 0.05, power 0.8, 1:1 case:control. TOBOGM is powered to detect a 6% difference between the treated and untreated Booking GDM groups.  This is because the trial is not a test of treatment vs no treatment of GDM, but of treatment &lt;20 weeks vs deferral to 24-28 weeks gestation when women will be treated if GDM is then found. It is therefore proposed to use the difference between the metabolic composite for treated GDM women compared to normal control: 10% vs 4% hypoglycaemia/hyperbilirubinaemia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Identifying and treating women early in pregnancy with significant hyperglycaemia at glucose values on oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), characterised as Diabetes in Pregnancy (DIP), is important as it improves maternal and fetal outcomes.  Similarly, there is good evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that identifying women with lesser degrees of hyperglycaemia on OGTT and characterised as Gestational Diabetes (GDM) at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy, also improves such outcomes. There is, however, currently no randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence that using the same criteria to diagnose and treat women for GDM prior to 24-28 weeks gestation, benefits either babies or their mothers, while there is potential for harm through fetal undernutrition, inappropriately medicalising some pregnancies, and increasing overall clinical workload.  ToBOGM is a multicentre RCT comparing immediate referral for treatment for those women with booking GDM on OGTT vs treating such women as normal and awaiting the results of a repeat OGTT at 24-28 weeks, proceeding to treatment only if GDM is diagnosed at that stage. TOBOGM has been through peer review and is to be funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</summary>
