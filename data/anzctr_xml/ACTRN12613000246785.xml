  <interventions>
    <interventions>It will be assess sacroiliacal joints using specific physiotherapy tests:
COMPRESSION TEST 
The test is perfomed with the patient in side-lying. The examiner stands behind the patient with their elbows locked in extension and palms interlocked over the upper part of the patient's iliac crest and exerts a downward force towards the floor. An increased feeling of pressure in the sacroiliac joints indicates a positive sign for the compression test.
DISTRACTION TEST
The test is performed with the patient in a supine position. The examiner places both hands on the patient's anterior superior iliac spine, pressing downward and laterally. Unilateral gluteal or posterior leg pain indicates a positive test for the distraction test.
FORTIN FINGER TEST
The test is performed with the patient standing, facing away from the examiner. The subject is asked to use one finger to point to the area of pain.The test is considered positive if the patient can pinpoint the pain with one finger, the area pointed to is immediately inferomedial to the posterior superior iliac spine within 1 cm.
POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TEST
The test is performed supine and the patient's hip flexed to an angle of 90 degrees on the side to be examined: light manual pressure is applied to the patient's flexed knee along the longitudinal axisis of the femur while the pelvis is stabilized by the examiner's other hand resting on the patients contralateral superior anterior iliac spine. The test is positive when the patient feels localized pain deep in the gluteal area on the provoked side. 
GILLET TEST
The test is performed with the patient standing, facing away from the examiner, with the feet approximately a foot apart. Once each posterior superior iliac spine is localized by the examiner's thumbs, the patient is asked to stand on one leg while bringing the opposite knee up toward the chest. If the sacroilacal joint on the side on which the knee is flexed moves slightly or in a superior direction, the joint is considered hypomobile, which indicates a positive test.
NUMBER RATING SCALE
The scale assesses the severity of pain on a numerical scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain, 1-3 means mild pain (nagging, annoying, interfering little with daily activities), 46  means moderate pain (interferes significantly with daily activities) and 7-10 means severe pain (disabling; unable to perform daily activities).
PREGNANCY MOBILTY INDEX
Pregnancy mobility index assesses the degree of disability in activities of daily living in pregnant women. Estimated daily mobility in the house (standing up from a hard chair, standing up from a soft chair, standing up from the bed, getting things from the floor, putting on shoes, turning around in bed, standing up from the floor), household activities (vacuum cleaning, doing laundry, hanging wash to dry, working on the knees, sitting in squatted position, working standing up, lifting 5 kilograms, lifting 10 kilograms, walking stairs) and mobility outdoors (traveling by train, traveling by car, traveling by bicycle, traveling by bus, walking 50 meters, walking 200 meters, walking 500 meters, walking in uneven area). Every item has a score option from 0-3 where 0 means no problems performing this task, 1 means some effort performing this task, 2 means much effort performing this task and 3 means performing this task is impossible or only possible with the aid of others.
All participants will undergo all of these tests. Tests will take a half an hour. Every day we will assess 15 participants every a half an hour over 6 months, at each individual session, supervised one on one with an physiotherapist. Each participants will only come in for a single visit, the test will take half an hour for each participants.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy cause a pain and and limitation the activities of daily living in pregnant women what leads to a reduction in quality. The purpose of this study is the ability to detect sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy using specific tests of physiotherapy assessment,to detect correlation between sacroiliacal dysfunction and pain, and correlation between sacroiliacal dysunction and mobilty in first, second and third trimester.Materials and methods: The sample consisted of an experimental group, 500 pregnant women in each trimester, which means that total number of pregnant women who were included in study is 500 (N=500). In study were used following tests: compression test, distraction test, fortin finger test, posterior pelvic pain provocation test, Gillet test, Number rating scale and Pregnancy mobility index.Results and discussion: For statistical analyses it will be used calculated the frequency (for determining how much patient have positive specific physiotherapy test, how much patients have pain and how much patient have limitation of mobility in daily activities with sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy), t-test for high paired samples (for determining the existence and/or absence of statistically significant differences) and correlation test (to determining corellation between sacroiliacal dysfunction and pain and corelattion between sacroiliacal dysfunction and mobility during pregnancy). Results should indicate the possibility of detection sacroiliacal dysfunction using specific tests of physiotherapy assessment,presence and/or absence of corellation between sacroiliacal dysfunction and pain, and corelattion between sacroiliacal dysfunction and mobility during pregnancy. Using Number rating scale and Pregnancy mobility index are expected to detect intensity of pain and degree of disability during everyday activities in pregnant women. Conclusion: The results of this study should give us guidellines for physiotherapy intervention in patinets with sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy and further clinical research.</summary>
