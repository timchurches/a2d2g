  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will take one dose of regular low dose oral sustained release morphine (10 mg) every morning and one dose of oral clonazepam (0.5 mg) every evening of each day of the intervention period.  A total of four doses of oral clonazepam and five doses of low dose oral sustained release morphine will be administered to all participants.
This is a four day (96 hour) study. Participants will complete the study intervention in the morning of the 5th day when the exit assessments will be made. In order that participants may continue with ongoing treatment a 5th morphine dose is administered in the morning of the exit assessment.</interventions>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All people with breathlessness will be referred to the study.  The study nurse will ask the consultant in charge for permission to approach potentially eligible participants to briefly explain the study.  If the person is interested to learn more about the study, the Site Investigator will be available to explain the study further.
Obtaining consent for this study will be a process of information exchange between the site investigator, the potential participant and any other person the potential participant believes should be included in the discussion.  The participant information sheet will be used as a basis for the discussion, which will cover all procedures, benefits, burdens and side effects expected of possible during the study.  The participant will be given opportunity (in time and physical capacity) to consider the study and formulate questions.  Any questions will be addressed and answered fully.
All baseline assessments will be undertaken before the first study dose.  The first dose of regular low dose sustained release morphine (10 mg) will be taken on the morning of day 1 and the first dose of clonazepam (0.5 mg) will be started on the evening of day 1. Both will be taken at 24 hourly intervals.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breathlessness at rest or on minimal exertion (speaking, bathing, dressing) continues to be a major clinical problem for many people with advanced progressive illnesses such as cancer, end-stage cardiac failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease even when they are receiving the best treatment for that underlying disease. Although there are some interventions that may offer benefit (oxygen therapy (when oxygen levels in the blood are low), sustained release low dose morphine) for this refractory breathlessness, other therapeutic options need to be explored.

Benzodiazepines are widely used as sedatives to help with sleep, to reduce anxiety and to decrease the risk of seizures in people who have, or are at risk of epilepsy.  These medications are also widely used around the world to treat breathlessness, however there have been no adequately powered studies that have explored net symptomatic benefit (symptom relief, side effects, maintenance of any benefit) for refractory breathlessness. Each benzodiazepine has slightly different properties in the level of sedation, ability to reduce anxiety and duration of effect.   

Two key questions need to be answered in order to establish the place of benzodiazepines in the management of refractory background dyspnoea: is there a net symptomatic benefit from benzodiazepines and, if so, is that benefit maintained over time? The latter question is important given the rapid tolerance to benzodiazepines when used as sedatives. 

Given the ability to dose once daily, the well defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (including in children) and the range of formulations/routes of administration available, clonazepam has been chosen for this study.  The proposed dose is unlikely to cause significant sedation and is at the lower end of the dosing range for its major long term clinical use in epilepsy. 

Aim: The primary aim of this pilot study is to refine protocol design including recruitment and retention to the study, establish levels of symptomatic response and variance in that response for power calculations for a definitive trial, and establish whether that benefit is maintained at two weeks.</summary>
