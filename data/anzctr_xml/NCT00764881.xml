    <summary>The aim of the study is to investigate whether women on oral contraceptives (OCs) suffering
      from acquired OC-associated female sexual dysfunction (FSD) for at least 3 months but no
      longer than one year will express the same level of sexual distress when taking SH T00658ID
      compared to Microgynon, the usual OC prescribed for women with OC-associated FSD.</summary>
