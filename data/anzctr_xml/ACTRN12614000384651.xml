  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 week intervention of butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB), The starch supplement (HAMSB or placebo starch) will consist of two pre-packed 20 g sachets daily, one consumed in the morning and one in the evening.  The supplements will be consumed by mixing the starches into 250 mL reduced fat flavoured UHT milk or orange juice which will be provided orally to the participants.  The washout period is 4 weeks.  All unused sachets will be collected to monitor compliance, furthermore SCFA levels will be measured in the stools of subjects to further verify compliance to the test starches.</interventions>
    <comparator>2 weeks intervention of  placebo starch, which  is a commercially available low amylose cornstarch, consumed orally as per the HAMSB starch.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is a measure of gastrointestinal symptoms which is based on the symptom questionnaire score sheet.
Symtoms include:
Lower pain (Pain noticeable beneath navel)
Abdominal cramps (spasmodic or colic like stomach pain without specified localization)
Bloating (visible swelling of tummy)
Diarrhoea (more than 3 bowel movements per day, loose stool)
Constipation (less than 3 bowel movements per day, hard/lumpy stool)
Mucus (white or green slimy material)
Urgency (Having to rush to have a bowel movement)
Straining (Difficulty to pass stool)
Flatulence (Passage of gas)</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 2 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood inflammatory markers includings cytokines and CRP.
Measured by hospital pathology/biochemistry laboratory</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 2 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Faecal microbiota  measured by qPCR, whereby a panel of bacteria related to IBD and inflammation will be selected and measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 2 weeks</timepoint>

Allocation is by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is located “off-site” or at central administration site.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The trial design is a modification of a study based on Murakami et al. (2012, The effect of Lactobacillus brevis KB290 against irritable bowel syndrome: a placebo-controlled double-blind crossover trial. Biopsychosoc Med 2012;6(1):16.), whereby twenty patients were required for the study to be adequately powered (possess power of 80% to detect a difference between two interventions when alpha = 0.05). The present study will recruit 30 participants with a medically diagnosed functional bowel disorder (which allows for dropouts/withdrawals).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To assess the effectiveness of butyrylated high amylose maize starch (HAMSB) in reducing gastrointestinal symptoms in volunteers suffering a functional bowel disorder. 

Aim 1:  The primary aim is to determine if ingestion of HAMSB reduces symptoms in subjects that suffer a functional bowel disorder HAMSB.

Aim 2:  The secondary aim is to determine the effect of HAMSB on blood inflammatory markers and faecal microbiota in subjects suffering a functional bowel disorder.
