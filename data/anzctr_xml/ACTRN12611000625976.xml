  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) Immediate education group; or 2) Delayed education group.  All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for either social phobia and/or panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) and/or generalised anxiety disorder.  All participants will complete 6 lessons of Internet based education about managemnt of symptoms of anxiety.  One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days.  Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete.  Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about people with anxiety, taking a further 20 mins per summary.  Participants in both groups will receive weekly reminder telephone calls, and have access to an online forum that will be moderated by the researchder to allow discussion of content of the program, during the treatment-phase of their participation.  The duration of phone calls and forum participation is expected to be 2-7 mins.  The duration of the program is 9 weeks, but participants will be contacted 3 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires.  Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, and at 3-months post-education.  These will take about 20 minutes to complete.  The educational materials are based on the Shyness, Panic and Worry Programs, which applies cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed eduction group will receive no contact during the 10 weeks then will be reassessed and then provided with internet based education for anxiety disorders with automatic email, weekly telephone reminders, and access to online discussion forums.</comparator>
