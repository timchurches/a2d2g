  <interventions>
    <interventions>Postoperative Epidural analgesia.
Lumbar epidural anaesthesia provided intraoperatively by catheter is to be continued postoperatively by continuous infusion using Ropivacaine 0.2% at the minimal rate required by titration to provide effective analgesia without producing side effects such as hypotension or excessive lower limb motor block. This is to be continued for 72 hours from the completion of surgery. All patients to receive aspirin 100mg daily. After 72 hours patients to convert to simple oral analgesia.</interventions>
    <comparator>Postoperative Parenteral Analgesia.
Lumbar epidural analgesia provided intraoperatively is ceased at the completion of surgery and the epidural catheter removed. Ongoing analgesia thereafter is to be provided using combination oral and parenteral agents on "as required" basis according to ward practice. Agents used include morphine 5-10mg intramuscularly or subcutaneously 3 to 4 hourly, Oxycodone 5-10mg orally 4 to 6 hourly, Paracetamol 0.5-1g orally 6 hourly. All patients to receive aspirin 100mg daily.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vascular Graft Patency.
Graft surveillance is performed at least 4 hourly throughout the hospital admission by assessment of pulses and, in the absence of a pulse, Doppler ultrasound. Graft failure is defined as the requirement for thrombectomy, regrafting or unexpected amputation.
Method of assessment includes patient history review for the duration of inpatient admission. Following discharge, histories are reviewed for information from outpatient appointments where available. Where this is incomplete or unavailable, patients and/or their primary care physician are contacted by telephone call.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 months from the day of surgery; graft complications within 30 days define early graft failure; graft complications between 30 days and 6 months define late graft failure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Any other postoperative medical or surgical morbidity, defined as presentation of a new illness or exacerbation of a pre-existing illness. 
Method of assessment includes patient history review for the duration of inpatient admission. Following discharge, histories are reviewed for information from outpatient appointments where available. Where this is incomplete or unavailable, patients and/or their primary care physician are contacted by telephone call.</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days, 6 months from the day of surgery; morbidity within 30 days defines early morbidity; morbidity between 30 days and 6 months defines late morbidity.</timepoint>
