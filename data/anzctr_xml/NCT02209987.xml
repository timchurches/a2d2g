  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GS-5745 SC
Treatment: drugs - GS-5745 IV

Experimental: GS-5745 SC - Participants will receive a single dose of GS-5745 by SC injection.

Experimental: GS-5745 IV - Participants will receive a single dose of GS-5745 by IV infusion.


Treatment: drugs: GS-5745 SC
GS-5745 150 mg administered by SC injection formulated as a sterile, aqueous buffered solution in a single-use pre-filled syringe

Treatment: drugs: GS-5745 IV
GS-5745 150 mg administered by IV infusion formulated as a sterile, aqueous buffered solution in single-use glass vials

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PK profile of GS-5745 - This composite endpoint will measure the plasma PK profile of GS-5745. The following parameters will be measured, where applicable:
Cmax: maximum observed concentration of drug in plasma
AUClast: concentration of drug from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration
AUC0-inf: area under the plasma concentration versus time curve starting with time zero to infinity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Predose and postdose on Days 1 and Day 11, and Weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidences of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities - This composite endpoint will measure the safety and tolerability profile of GS-5745.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 8 weeks</timepoint>

    <summary>This study will estimate the absolute bioavailability of subcutaneously injected GS-5745,
      characterize the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of GS-5745 after
      subcutaneous (SC) injection and intravenous (IV) administration, and evaluate the formation
      of anti-GS-5745 antibodies after SC and IV administration.</summary>
