  <interventions>
    <interventions>Proactive screening and identification of full time employees with untreated symptoms of depression and provision of either a single or multiple telephone contacts to increase engagement in treatment. Recruitment of full-time emp0lyee particpants occurred between October 2004 and March 2006. Data collection continued to October 2007. Participants in the multiple contact condition received an average of 8.7 telephone contacts in addition to the single contact. However, the number of contacts was allowed to vary on the basis of clinical judgment of severity of symptoms and need. These contacts focused on addressing the participant's barriers to treatment. Once the participant indicated that they had seen a health professional specifically for their emotional/psychological symptoms, the focus of the contacts shifted to monitoring progress and addressing concerns the person might have with their progress in treatment. Depression is often characterised by cognitions of hopelessness and helplessness; cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in addition to motivational interviewing strategies were used by the psychologists to address these issues. People who could not access in person services or who refused in person treatment were offered telephone CBT to assist with their depressive symptoms.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reported depression symptom severity using two measures: The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self Report (QIDS-SR) (Rush et al., 2003) and, The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, Spitzer et al., 1999). The QIDS-SR was administered by blinded external assessors at each survey time: baseline (Wave1), and post verbal consent at 6-weeks (Wave 2), 3-months (Wave 3), 6-months (Wave 4), 12-months (Wave 5)and 18-months (Wave 6).</outcome>

    <concealment>Allocation involved two concealed steps. The baseline QIDS-SR and PHQ-9 was delivered by trained survey interviewers at an external contracted call centre service conducting the telephone interviews. The data from eligible participants was then transferred to the senior clinical psychologist who supervised the psychology/care manger team in making the initial single contact with all eligible participants. Following successful contact with a participant, the care manger psychologists, who had conducted the single contact and determined eligibility, returned the file to the senior psychologist who then gave the participant information to a non-clinical research assistant who was located at the central administration site.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was carried out following the single contact (SC) and verbal consent procedure by a non-clinical research assistant using a random number generation randomisation table for each site (employer) yielding different orders for each site with the exception of those participants who had been assessed for suicide risk.</sequence>
