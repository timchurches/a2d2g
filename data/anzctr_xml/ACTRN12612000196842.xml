    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>1. An intention-to-treat analysis will be used to assess the effect of L. rhamnosus (HN001) on the 12 month cumulative prevalence of eczema and SCORAD greater than or equal to 10 using hazard ratios, and the point prevalence of atopy at age 12 months, using relative rate. 
2. Chisq test will also be used to compare the proportion in each study group with detectable levels of each cytokine and immunological marker in breast milk and cord blood and for those with detectable levels, t-tests will be used to compare the groups if the data is log-normally distributed. If the data is not log-normally distributed a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used. 
3. The association of L. rhamnosus (HN001) with the presence of gestational diabetes mellitus, bacterial vaginosis and Group B Strep will be assessed using relative rate. 
4. The effect of weight gain will be investigated as an intermediate variable by adding it to the model in the GDM analysis. 

Power calculation
From our previous study the hazard ratio for eczema, for L rhamnosus HN001, based on the data at 6 and 12 months, was 0.39, with 12.3% of people having eczema at either 6 or 12 months. With a sample size of 400 and 13% drop out rate 42.8 babies are expected to be assessed as having eczema. Using the sample size formula from Therneau and Grambsch Modeling Survival Data 2000 Springer, the study would have 87% power.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The increase in allergic disease among children in the developed world is widely believed to be due to reductions in exposure to infective agents (the hygiene hypothesis). One way to counteract this is by exposing pregnant women to beneficial bacteria, such as probiotics. Using a randomized controlled double-blinded trial, we aim to investigate the effect of L rhamnosus HN001 taken daily (9X10^9 CFU) by pregnant women from the first trimester of pregnancy and during breast feeding until 6 months post-partum on the development of eczema and atopic sensitization in their infants at age 12 months. The effects of this probiotic on maternal health in pregnancy, including gestational diabetes mellitus, group B streptococcal vaginal infection and bacterial vaginosis will also be investigated as secondary outcomes. Probiotics are a cheap and safe intervention that may prevent cases of eczema and allergy in infancy and improve pregnancy outcomes for women.</summary>
