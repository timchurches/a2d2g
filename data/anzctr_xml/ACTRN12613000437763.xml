  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty-eight patients with SSc were random in to 2 group (14 persons per group).

Group 1, All participants receive Traditional Thai Massage by a relative, hand stretching exercise, and wearing glove more than 6 hour per day (the nylon glove is worn on both hands) in 2 weeks home program.

Group 2, All participants receive Traditional Thai Massage by a relative, and hand stretching exercise in 2 weeks home program. None gloving.

For both groups: 
a) the duration and frequency of Traditional Thai Massage, 15 minute in each upper extremity and hand side, left and right; total  30 minute massage per day for 2 weeks; Massage by relative which trained by physiotherapist (single 30 minute session at baseline).
b) hand stretching exercise performd by patient (self care) after Traditional Thai Massage which trained by physiotherapist.
c) physiotherapist demonstrates hand stretching exercises at 30 min baseline session (Forearm pronation, Forearm supination, Wrist flexion, Wrist extension, Wrist radial/ulnar deviation, Finger abduction, Finger flexion, Finger extension, Thumb abduction/adduction and flexion/extension, Terminal pinch all finger opposite the thumb); participants then complete these stretches for 30 min once daily over 2 week period.

1.Perform everyday in 2 weeks, one session per day after receive Traditional Thai Massage. 
2.Stretch to the end of the range of motion at a point of tightness, without inducing discomfort
3.Hold each stretch for 30 seconds
4.Complete 4 repetitions for each stretch on both sides.
5.Perform static stretching, that is avoiding ballistic, bouncing movement, with emphasis on muscle groups (joint) that have reduce ROM. Consequently, this was a strict precaution on hand in patients with SSc (The American College Sport Medicine [ACSM], 2006).  
 	All patients were received example picture of stretching exercise procedure on hand and daily home program exercise was record in diary. 

For group 1 the type of glove worn is nylon fabric glove, whether it is worn on both hands, and it is worn after Traditional Thai Massage, during the normal activity of daily living more than 6 hours per day, including the hand stretching exercises.

Superficial heating is also part of the home program. It is househood material, warm water or a hot pack, about 40 Celsius degree. Apply on hand before Traditional Thai Massage 15 minute.

All patients were received example picture of stretching exercise procedure on hand and daily home program exercise was record in diary and telephone visit (10 minute telephone call at 1 week in both groups.). Final test after 2 week patients will show a diary.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HAMIS is a performance index that consists of 9 items.
Assessing the hand movements include in an ordinary Range Of Motion test such as pronation and supination of the forearm, volar flexion and dorsal extension of the wrist, finger flexion and extension and thumb abduction.
It also evaluates the ability to make a thumb pincer grip and to make finger abduction. Each exercise is grade on 0-3 scales, where 0 corresponds to normal function and 3 determines that the patient is unable to perform the task.
In this study, each participant was sit in starting position and perform the test following by 9 items in HAMIS under the instruction of physical therapist.

    <concealment>This study is a randomized control trial that was conducted with scleroderma (SSc) patients of the rheumatology department at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen University and carried out at the Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Khon Kaen University, Thailand.

    <statisticalmethods>Data of Hand mobility in scleroderma (HAMIS) test is expressed as a median: (Q1-Q3). Any significant difference between daily home program with glove group and daily home program group after two weeks of treatment was determined by using The Mann Whitney U test. The differences between the groups are significant at p-value&lt;0.05.

Participants needed to achieve study objectives was determined by statistical assumptions supporting any sample size calculations by Vannajak et al., 2010.
