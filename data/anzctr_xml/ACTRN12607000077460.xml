  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate with clinical or radiological evidence of metastatic disease.2. Confirmed Hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) with a minimum of 4 weeks having elapsed between the withdrawal of antiandrogens and enrolment.3. Patients must have a baseline serum Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)&gt; 10 ng/ml (referred to as PSA #1), and two consecutive rises in serum PSA (referred to as PSA #2 and PSA #3) greater than PSA #1 with each test performed at least one week apart. If PSA #3 is less than PSA #2, the patient remains eligible provided a fourth PSA (PSA #4) is greater than PSA #2.4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) 0-3.5. A neutrophil count of at least 1500 per cubic millimetre and a platelet count of at least 100 000 per cubic millimetre.6. Normal bilirubin level and AST, ALT and serum creatinine no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of the normal range. 7. Castrate testosterone levels due to either luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists or orchidectomy.8. Informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if a new genetic test (GSTP1 methylation) is a better way of assessing patients response to chemotherapy compared to the standard methods (eg PSA blood test). In addition, this study will attempt to find new ways of predicting patients response to chemotherapy before they start treatment.</summary>
