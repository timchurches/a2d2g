    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>At each centre, patients will be sequentially allocated a patient number on referral to the study. This ID number will be used for all subsequent study documentation for that participant.

On notification of a participant, the pharmacist at each site will allocate the next code available according to the supplied schedule and prepare the active or inactive drug delivered in a labeled opaque screw top bottle. The participant ID, allocation code, dates of request, preparation, and dispensing will be recorded in a log maintained by the pharmacist and supplied to the central registry on each randomisation.
At all times, from eligibility screening to completion of the study, all study staff are unaware of the treatment allocation. Allocation is concealed from the investigator at the time of the participant inclusion in the trial, the allocation is determined by contacting the site pharmacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation schedules will be developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Treatment for each patient will be allocated according to a block randomisation schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1:1 ratio. Block randomisation will ensure even allocation to each code in each site. The central registry will supply the schedule tables to each site pharmacy.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Delirium is prevalent in patients with advanced cancer and in the palliative care setting, and is associated with significant and distressing symptomatology and poor prognosis. Antipsychotics are considered by most clinicians as first line pharmacotherapeutic agents for delirium despite limited randomized double blind controlled evidence for management of delirium in any health care setting, including palliative care. The few studies that exist explore post treatment efficacy in relation to total delirium score reduction, and do not guide management of target symptomatology. There as been no systematic evaluation of toxicity profile in relation to delirium management with typical or atypical antipsychotics, in particular extrapyramidal toxicity and degree of sedation. There is need for randomized control trial evidence of the efficacy of antipsychotics to control targeted delirium symptoms, and also to consider broader implications on caregiver and patient distress.</summary>
