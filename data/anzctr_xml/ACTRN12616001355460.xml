  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will receive behavioural support phone calls of around 10 minutes duration, twice weekly, delivered by trained research assistants, for the first 6 weeks after randomisation. The calls will follow a standard format and content that includes encouragement to stay abstinent, avoid cues to relapse, tips for dealing with cravings and so on.

Varenicline tartrate 0.5 mg and 1 mg tablets (Pfizer); taken orally twice daily following a 2-week up-titration: Days 1  3: 0.5 mg once daily; Days 4  7: 0.5 mg twice daily; Day 8 14 :1 mg twice daily. Day 15 (randomisation date) - end of Week 10: 1 mg twice daily.

PLUS EITHER
Bupropion hydrochloride 150mg tablet (GSK), taken orally twice daily following a short titration period: Days 1- 3: 150 mg once daily; Days 4- end of week 10: 150 mg twice daily.

OR PLUS
E-cigarettes with nicotine, inhaled ad libitum, 18 mg (eVOD starter kit, NZVAPOR, e-liquid from Sydney Sterile Compounding) commencing on Day 1 for 10 weeks after randomisation.

Adherence will be assessed by direct enquiry by research assistants at the 6 week call and when participants return to the clinic for dispensing further supplies they will be asked to bring their medication packs for checking by the pharmacist or research assistants.

    <designfeatures>There will be  run in period of two weeks as participants titrate up varenicline to full strength during which time they are expected to quit or if not, cut down smoking. Those who quit or have cut down by at least half (compared with baseline) by the end of the two weeks are not followed up further. Only those who fail to cut down by at least 50% are randomised into one of the 3 arms.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This sample size of 798 is adjusted for multiple comparisons and an anticipated 30% loss-to-follow-up to confer 80% power, p=0.05 to detect an absolute difference of 13% in 24-week carbon monoxide verified (&lt;10 ppm) abstinence rates between the varenicline plus bupropion and the varenicline only groups and (predicted abstinence of 28% and 15% respectively) and 90% power to detect 15% difference between the varenicline plus e-cigarette group and varenicline alone group, with a predicted abstinence rate in the varenicline plus e-cigarette group of 30%.

All data analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis in which participant outcome data are analysed according to the group to which they were allocated at randomisation. Simple incidence rates, relative risks, absolute risks and the 95% confidence intervals around these estimates will be obtained for all binary variables, and multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for other variables simultaneously will also be conducted. Continuous data will be analysed using multiple linear regression modelling or non-parametric analysis. Standard sensitivity analyses will be undertaken including per protocol analysis. Cost analyses will include calculating the cost per quitter and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and incremental cost utility ratio.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with mental illnesses or alcohol and/or other drug addictions are a group that needs to quit smoking: smoking prevalence is high among this population. They also have a high burden of tobacco-related illness. Current cessation treatments adopt a one size fits all approach, overlooking considerable between-person variation in response to medication: the one third of smokers who reduce the amount they smoke by at least 50% (responders) during the first two weeks after starting varenicline or nicotine replacement treatment (NRT) are 2.5 times more likely to quit smoking than those who do not (non-responders). Trials (total N=557) showed NRT non-responders without a dual diagnosis can experience quit rates at 6 months identical to NRT responders by switching to varenicline or adding bupropion to NRT. Combining varenicline with either bupropion or NRT increased quit rates over varenicline alone, whilst the efficacy of nicotine e-cigarettes may be enhanced when used in addition to varenicline. These approaches to treatment have neither been integrated nor trialed among people with a dual diagnosis who are varenicline non-responders (a group with great opportunity to benefit should such simple changes to the use of available treatments lead to improved cessation efficacy).
Aims : To determine whether adding either bupropion or a nicotine e-cigarette to varenicline plus behavioural support improves 6 month smoking cessation outcomes, relative to remaining on varenicline alone plus behavioural support, in people with a dual diagnosis who are varenicline non-responders.
Design: An open label, pragmatic  3 arm, randomised controlled trial  with the study population adult (18 years and older) outpatients currently receiving treatment who want to stop smoking. Exclusion criteria: contra-indications to trial medications and uncontrolled dual diagnosis symptoms (assessed by case doctor). Interventions: Participants will be prescribed varenicline by their case doctor, and receive telephone behavioural support from smoking cessation specialists for 2 weeks; those reporting a reduction in baseline cigarettes smoked per day of &gt;50% by day 14 will continue on varenicline with referral to local cessation services. Varenicline non-responders will be randomised to one of 3 treatment arms for 12 weeks: 1) varenicline + bupropion; 2) varenicline + nicotine e-cigarette; 3) varenicline only. All participants will set a target quit date for 2 weeks later and receive 6 more support calls over the next 6 weeks; the primary outcome will be measured at 24 weeks after randomisation.</summary>
