  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective multi-centre biomarker study involving the collection of plasma from patients with a Ras wild-type (according to the local standard of care) tumour planned for treatment with first-line cetuximab in combination with Irinotecan with fluorouracil (5FU) and folinic acid (FOLFIRI) or Oxaliplatin with fluorouracil (5FU) and folinic acid (FOLFOX) will be periodically assessed with the following minimum study procedures. Additional non-study assessments may occur at the discretion of the treating clinician.

Blood sampling at the following time points:
a) Baseline (within 7 days of starting anti-EGFR treatment)
b) Week 3 of anti-EGFR treatment (after 2 weeks of treatment)
c) Week 5 of anti-EGFR treatment (after 4 weeks of treatment)
d) Every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression

Representative archival tumour sample (either primary or metastasis tissue) will be made available for next-generation sequencing (NGS) based Ras testing (unless already performed) and/or for repeat RAS mutation analysis by BEAMing  (Beads, Emulsions, Amplification, and Magnetics) digital PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay where there is any discordance between tumour tissue and cfDNA analysis.

Images from the following staging CT chest/abdomen/pelvis performed as part of routine care will be centrally reviewed by a radiologist:

a. Screening  within 4 weeks of starting anti-EGFR therapy
b. Every 8 weeks until disease progression using CEA and imaging.

Follow-up as per standard practice until disease progression, death or a maximum of 3 years, which ever occurs first.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the emergence of Ras mutations in cfDNA as an escape mechanism for first-line cetuximab anti-EGFR therapy.
To examine the emergence of Ras mutations during anti-EGFR therapy therapy, serial blood samples (30mls) will be collected and processed into plasma. The plasma will then be tested for Ras mutant status using BEAMing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be examined for the period of time from therapy initiation to time when Ras mutations are first detected and followed by similar testing till disease progression.
In addition, the levels (quantities) of Ras mutations detected in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in plasma will be examined and compared over time. This will occur at baseline, week 3, week 5 and every 4 weeks thereafter while patients remain on anti-EGFR treatment or until disease progression.
Patients recruited will be followed to documented disease progression; a mean time of follow up is estimated to be 11.4 months (estimated time from initiation of first-line cetuximab therapy to mean time progression free survival). 
Please note that cfDNA and ctDNA are used interchangeably. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this study is to explore the emergence of RAS mutations as an escape mechanism in patients receiving first-line cetuximab anti-EGFR therapy in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as well as to demonstrate the general utility of cfDNA RAS mutation monitoring as compared to standard care measurements of treatment resistance and disease progression using CEA and imaging.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive first line anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) therapy in combination with either irinotecan-based (FOLFIRI) or oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOX) chemotherapy, as chosen by their treating medical oncologist.

To examine the emergence of RAS mutations during anti-EGFR therapy, serial blood samples (30mls) will be collected from patients. The timing of emergence and genotype analysis of RAS mutations from cfDNA in patients undergoing 1st line treatment with cetuximab in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI will then be examined. For all patients, disease progression will be examined by comparing RAS mutation levels to routine CEA assessment and imaging. 

Patients having RAS WT tumours and receiving first-line cetuximab therapy in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI will be monitored until documented tumour progression. </summary>
