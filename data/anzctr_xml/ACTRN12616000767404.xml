  <interventions>
    <interventions>Active minds, happy kids is a centre-based a intervention feasibility study which aims to increase physical activity, decrease sedentary behaviour, and decrease screen time. It is a 10 week pre- and post-intervention feasibility study to develop, implement and evaluate centre-based behaviour change strategies. Four preschools and/or childcare centres (hereafter collectively referred to as centres), and five families per centre, will be recruited.

Strategies align with the ecological model, targeting individual, social and physical environment characteristics. All strategies will be implemented into existing curriculum (e.g. replacing sedentary story time with active story time) and are designed to be simple to deliver. Teachers will be provided a 30-60 minutes, in-house training session by experienced research staff (all teachers at each centre will be trained at the same time if available; training will be tailored to meet teacher and centre needs). Some of the strategies will include removing chairs from tables to create standing stations, active rather than passive story time, energy breaks, etc. They will also be provided an online education module (which teachers can access at their leisure) covering topics relevant to preschoolers physical activity and sedentary behaviour. In 2015, Hinkley discussed proposed strategies with a convenience sample of teachers who commented on acceptability; strategies have been modified as necessary. All training will take place prior to implementation of the intervention. Teachers will be provided with on-going support by researchers throughout implementation, by request through phone call, email, and/or speak to the teachers in person if needed. Research staff will contact centre staff at least fortnightly throughout implementation of the program to provide an opportunity for question and support. Centres will also be provided with equipment to support physical activity to the value of $200. A small alarm clock will be provided to each centre to facilitate implementation of the energy breaks (2-3 mins of activity after every 30 mins of indoor time).

To assess intervention adherence, teachers will complete a log of centre activities undertaken (e.g. energy breaks, active story time) throughout the intervention period.

      <outcome>Change in child screen time pre- to post-intervention. Outcome assessed by parent questionnaire. The questionnaire will capture childrens time in a number of types of screen time including TV viewing, computer use, smart phones and digital tablets. Parents will report their childs usual week and weekend day time using each of the screen devices.
Parents questionnaire: Participant parents will complete a short online survey pre- and post-intervention to report on demographic family characteristics (pre- only), child behaviours (active play, screen time; pre- and post-) and to assess knowledge of the program (post- only); non-participant parents at each centre will be provided with the option of completing a shortened version of the survey anonymously post-intervention to assess program reach. The questionnaires are designed specifically for this study.

      <outcome>Centre environments: Trained research assistants will audit centre environment characteristics (e.g. availability and placement of equipment, use of chairs). A modified version of a previously developed audit instrument will be used. The instrument draws from existing audit instruments (e.g. the NAP SACC, the EPAO) and includes checklists, observation points, and counts of items such as outdoor equipment, etc.</outcome>

      <outcome>Teacher characteristics: teachers will complete an online survey of demographic (e.g. age, education) at baseline and other relevant constructs (e.g. knowledge, self-efficacy to support child behaviours) at pre- and post-intervention.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>In 2016, eligible participating families will have one child aged between 3-5 years who attends preschool at one of the participating preschools. The only inclusion criteria for families is having a child aged between 3 to 5 years old enrolled at one of the participating centres. Key inclusion criteria for centres is participation of five families and willingness to undertake intervention activities and implementation of strategies. This is our ONLY key inclusion criteria.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Active minds, happy kids is a centre-based intervention feasibility study which aims to increase physical activity, decrease sedentary behaviour, and decrease screen time.

The centre-based components will be implementing in 2016. It is a 10 week pre- and post-intervention feasibility study to develop, implement and evaluate centre-based behaviour change strategies. Four preschools and/or childcare centres (hereafter collectively referred to as centres), and five families per centre, will be recruited.

This research is being conducted by Dr Trina Hinkley, Prof Jo Salmon, Prof Anna Timperio, and Dr Kylie Hesketh. 

We anticipate benefits of this research may include gains in knowledge, insight, understanding of child behaviours and strategies to support healthy levels of physical activity and sedentary behaviours. The collection of this data will inform the development of a larger intervention in this population. Once effective strategies are identified, these can be disseminated to a larger segment of the population.
