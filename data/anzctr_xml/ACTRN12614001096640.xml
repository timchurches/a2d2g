  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Coronary Angiogram Database of South Australia (CADOSA) is a registry of cardiac catheterisation procedures performed in the four public tertiary hospitals of South Australia (SA). This will be referred to the CADOSA-Quality Assurance (or CADOSA-QA) registry and is distinguished from the research protocol referred to as the CADOSA Outcomes study (CADOSA-Outcomes). The CADOSA-QA registry collects a standardised 8-page case report form (CRF) for all public coronary angiograms and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed in the SA. The CRF is compatible with the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data Registry. The purpose of this registry is a quality assurance measure to monitor the patients and the in-hospital care they receive undergoing angiography/PCI. This registry will also evaluate future cardiac events (30-day &amp; 12-month all-cause mortality/myocardial infarction/cardiac re-admission) by analysis of administrative datasets. 

The CADOSA-Outcomes Study will compliment the CADOSA-QA Registry by obtaining 12-month health outcomes in a subpopulation of the CADOSA cohort. Patients participating in this study will be provided with a patient information sheet during their admission for the procedure and consented for follow-up contact. Consenting patients will complete a health status assessment via administration of quality of life questionnaires (QoL) in hospital. Patients will then be contacted via phone by the study staff  at 1 and 12 months following angiography. The will be asked several questions relating to their cardiac status and medications changes, as well as being asked several quality of life questionnaires over the phone. The QoL questionnaires will include: Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and Short Form-36 (SF-36).</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Clinical characteristics and health status outcomes will be reported as general descriptive statistics. Categorical variables will be presented as frequency values and proportions and continuous variables with a normal distribution are presented as mean/SD and median/IQR for non-parametric data. The cumulative incidence of mortality will be presented by Kaplan-Meier event curves for the different years and cohorts. Cox regression analyses will be performed to adjust for covariates. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) will be reported together with the corresponding 95% CI. In regards to sample size determination, this was based on Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) scores. The treatment satisfaction scale of the SAQ has the smallest difference over time. Mean treatment satisfaction scores are 77.1 +- 10 in coronary heart disease populations. In order to detect a 1-point change in scores over 12months, with repeated measures analyses, at a power of 90% and statistical significance of 5%, 1051 patients would be required. To allow for a 10% patients dropout, recruitment targets will aim for 1,200 patients. </statisticalmethods>
