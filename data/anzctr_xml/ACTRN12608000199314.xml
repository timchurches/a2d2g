  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low red blood cell counts (anaemia) occur in the vast majority of patients with chronic kidney disease. In most cases, these low red blood cell counts respond to treatment with medications, such as erythropoietin (Eprex®) or darbepoietin alpha (Aranesp®). However, about 10-15% of patients continue to be anaemic even with appropriate treatment. Such patients are at increased risk of being hospitalized, developing complications such as heart failure, and dying. A number of small studies have suggested that a drug called oxpentifylline (Trental®) is very good at safely raising red blood cell counts in persistently anaemic patients. However, this drug has not yet been properly tested in a controlled trial (that is, where the drug is given to 1 group of patients, but not another).</summary>
