Other interventions: Focus group
Initially, ten focus groups with an average sample size of 5-7 participants each will be performed in two communities within South Australia, one being Adelaide and the other Murray Bridge, this includes focus groups held with healthcare workers.
The proposed focus groups will be conducted by experienced mediators who have undertaken Aboriginal cultural awareness training and have experience in qualitative research methods. Both mediators have also been involved in all aspects of project development and consultation with Aboriginal Elders and key stakeholders since its conception.
We will be using topic guides (reviewed by Aboriginal Elders and researchers) that will be semi-structured with open-ended questions designed to encourage group discussion around smoking cessation and the use of pharmacotherapies in particular, in addition to other objectives identified during the consultation phase of this research.

Other interventions: One-on-one interviews
One-on- one interviews will be held with both medical clinicians and key stakeholders and will be conducted by existing TQEH (The Queen Elizabeth Hospital), Clinical Practice Unit employees, experienced in qualitative research. Informed consent will be required and the interview will be audio taped to allow analysis of the qualitative data. All interviews will remain anonymous, unless the interviewee prefers to be named. In this case, they will be named in the acknowledgement section of all publications and presentations. Moderator guides have been developed and reviewed in the same process undergone by the focus group moderator guides

Other interventions: Survey
A four page survey will be administered to all focus group and interview participants in addition to select cohorts including tobacco related special interest groups of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ). The survey will include demographic data, smoking history and current smoking status (questions related to smoking for current tobacco users include the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, multiple Likert scales for cravings, motivation to quit, confidence etc.) and Likert scales examining perceptions, attitudes and knowledge about tobacco use, cessation, prevention, health and research in the Aboriginal setting.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the barriers and facilitators to pharmacological initiatives for tobacco cessation in Aboriginal populations - Qualitative analysis (focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys). The use of pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation significantly improves the probability of successful abstinence. Identification of the barriers and facilitators for tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies will be determined through these qualitative discussions and mixed method approaches</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the barriers and facilitators for tobacco prevention initiatives, particularly related to Aboriginal youth - Qualitative analysis (focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys). The use of tobacco prevention initiatives significantly improves the probability of lower tobacco prevalence long-term. Identification of the barriers and facilitators for tobacco prevention initiatives will be determined through these qualitative discussions and mixed method approaches</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify the barriers and facilitators for doctor visits by Aboriginal people - Qualitative analysis (focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys). Regular doctor visits by Aboriginal people can significantly reduce the progression of chronic illnesses, improve quality of life and reduce health care costs. Identification of the barriers and facilitators for these doctor visits, particularly with Respiratory physicians, will be determined through these qualitative discussions and mixed method approaches</outcome>
      <timepoint>18 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify barriers and facilitators to research initiatives in Aboriginal people and identify self-reported health priorities - Qualitative analysis (focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys). Research in Aboriginal populations are often lengthy and in many cases fail to achieve their objectives, often due to inappropriate methodology or a lack of consultation with Aboriginal Elders or key stakeholders research initiatives particularly related to tobacco and chronic illnesses will be determined through these qualitative discussions and mixed method approaches. In addition, we aim to identify health priorities identified by participants within the focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys that can be targeted for future research initiatives.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To identify barriers and facilitators in the uptake of smoking cessation
      pharmacotherapies, tobacco prevention, doctor visits, smoking amongst youth, community held
      health priorities and barriers to research in Aboriginal Australians from the perspectives
      of:

        -  Aboriginal smokers and ex/non-smokers

        -  Aboriginal Healthcare workers

        -  Consultants/general practitioners, and

        -  Key stakeholders in Aboriginal health

      Focus groups, one-on-one interviews and surveys will be conducted to provide information at
      the 'grass-roots' level including examinations into perceived differences in locally held
      beliefs, attitudes, knowledge, traditional practices and the cultural and social constructs,
      to assist implementation of future tobacco cessation/prevention interventions and treatment
      of smoking related illnesses. This information can be used to improve the health of
      Aboriginal people by identifying inadequacies in current practices and highlighting what
      these are through the eyes of community members, healthcare workers, consultants/general
      practitioners and key stakeholders. We also intend on examining any facilitators that are
      identified as positive and working aspects of current initiatives e.g. community
      infrastructure, in an effort to not 'reinvent the wheel' and acknowledge what is working.</summary>
