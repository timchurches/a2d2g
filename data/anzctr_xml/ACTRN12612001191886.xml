  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Control of appetite is of primary importance in managing body weight and maintaining good health. The human gut plays an important role in controlling food intake by detecting and relaying to the brain changes in the chemical composition of the food as it is digested and absorbed. The gut detects these chemical changes by using a variety of nutrient sensing systems (e.g. nutrient transporters, taste and odorant receptors). The levels of some of these sensory components have been shown to vary across different regions of the gut and may reflect specific sensory abilities at these different sites. We plan to investigate the distribution of these sensory systems in the stomach, small intestine and bowel by obtaining small biopsies of the inner wall of the gut (mucosa) from participants undergoing routine gastroscopy or colonoscopy procedures. By understanding the distribution of these chemosensory systems within the human gut, we hope in the future to be able to design foods that deliver better appetite control.</summary>
