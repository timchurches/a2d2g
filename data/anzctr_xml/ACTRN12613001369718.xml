  <interventions>
    <interventions>According to usual cardiac rehabilitation protocol, all participants, whether allocated to the experimental group (with participant-selected music) or the control group (with usual care), will receive the National Heart Foundation Guidelines during group presentations and in individual physiotherapy consultations. The guidelines encourage participants to complete at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity (e.g., walking in 10 minute blocks or more) for five days of each week (150 minutes) with an opportunity to rest on two days if desired. Participants in both groups will be asked to maintain these guidelines following discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program using walking as a moderate level physical activity. All participants, whether allocated to the music or control group will receive a weekly phone call for the first 6 weeks of the study and then monthly until week 26. The phone calls will ask participants if they have any question or concerns. Participants in both groups will also be asked to maintain an exercise logbook for the first 6 weeks of the study.

Participants allocated to the music intervention (experimental group) will meet with a registered music therapist to select preferred music for walking. Experimental group participants will be able to freely select music that they expect to find physiologically arousing and/or evoke supportive emotions for walking-based exercise.  Participants will be encouraged to select as many songs as they wish, potentially several hours of music. Music selection will be assisted by the Brunel Music Rating Inventory-2 (BMRI-2), a 6-item scale with quotients ranging from 6 (low) to 42 (highly motivating) (Karageorghis et al., 2006). Preferred music rated as motivating for walking will be loaded onto lightweight portable music playing devices (MP3 players) for personal use over the 6-month period of the study. Participants will be asked to use the portable music devices when walking. Participants in the experimental group will also be offered an opportunity to review their music at 3-months.

    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive usual care available in the community following discharge from cardiac rehabilitation. Usual care involves access to community exercise groups and centres. Participants in both groups will have received details of community exercise groups and centres during their cardiac rehabilitation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will evaluate the proportions of participants in each group meeting the physical activity guidelines at 6 and 26 weeks following discharge from cardiac rehabilitation. 

Continuous recording using uni-axial accelerometer-based activity monitors (ActivPAL, PAL Technologies, Glasgow) (Ryan et al., 2006) will calculate number of minutes of moderate intensity physical activity. Moderate level physical activity will be defined by threshold values of walking cadence greater than 60 steps/minute recommended as appropriate for populations with limited mobility (Peiris, Taylor &amp; Shields, 2013), and activity counts greater than 1075 counts per 15 seconds (Ainsworth et al., 2000). The ActivPAL has demonstrated high inter-device reliability for numbers of steps and cadence (ICC (2,1) equal to 0.99) (Ryan et al., 2006), and has been successfully used to document physical activity levels in older adults during inpatient rehabilitation (Peiris, Shields &amp; Taylor, 2012).

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome will compare groups to evaluate walking endurance using the 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The test will be performed in a level indoor corridor equal or greater than 20 metres. Ratings of perceived exertion (BORG scale RPE CR 10) (Foster et al., 2001) will be monitored throughout the 6MWT. Distances walked during the 6MWT have demonstrated strong correlation with peak VO2 (r equal to 0.70) in older adults (Miyamoto et al., 2000).

    <statisticalmethods>Primary hypothesis. Relative risk ratios are planned to determine if the proportion of participants meeting the recommended guidelines of 150 minutes moderate intensity physical is greater in the music group than the control group during week 6 and week 26 following discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program. 
Secondary hypotheses. Analysis of covariance using baseline measures as co variates is planned to determine whether the secondary outcomes of step count, time spent upright (activity counts), 6MWT distance, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and self-efficacy is greater in the music group than the control group at week 6 and week 26 following discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program. Relative risk ratios are also planned to determine if measures indicating elevated risk factors (blood pressure &gt; 120/80, BMI &gt; 24.9, and waist circumference &gt; 94cm for men and &gt; 80cm for women) are less likely amongst participants from the music group than the control group at week 6 and week 26 following discharge from the cardiac rehabilitation program. Logbooks will be analyzed descriptively for any differences in adherence or adverse events between the groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:
Regular exercise is fundamental for older adults with heart disease. However, most find it difficult to meet the National Physical Activity Guidelines of 150 minutes per week moderate intensity exercise (for example, walking). Music is easy to use and may motivate older adults with heart disease to complete more physical activity.

Aim:
To find out if listening to music while walking helps older adults with heart disease to achieve recommended amounts of physical activity.

Design:
A randomised controlled trial, comparing one group of participants walking with self-selected music, and another group walking without music. Measures will be collected at discharge from cardiac rehabilitation (baseline), and at weeks 6 and 26 following discharge.

Participants:
We will recruit 53 participants and randomly allocate then to either walking with or without music. Participants will be eligible if they are 60 years and older, have been diagnosed with heart disease, and walk independently. 

Measures:
Amounts of physical activity will be measured over 7-days using an accelerometer, a small device attached to each participant's thigh. We will also test walking endurance, blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference. Participants will be asked to answer a questionnaire about exercise and complete an exercise log-book.

Intervention:
All participants in the music group will receive a personal music playing device with their preferred music to use during walking. Participants in the group without music will receive usual care. 

Data analysis:
Comparisons between the two groups will aim to see if there are more participants in the music group who meet the National Physical Activity Guidelines than in the group without music. </summary>
