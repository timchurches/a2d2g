  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian,
             primary peritoneal and fallopian tube carcinoma; all histologic subtypes of epithelial
             ovarian cancer are eligible, but only patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer
             will be considered for the statistical analysis; non-high grade serous cancers will be
             allowed in an exploratory cohort

             platinum-refractory disease as per Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup Committee (GCIC)
             criteria; disease progression has to be radiologic or clinical; biomarker progression
             with CA125 after a platinum based regimen would not be sufficient evidence of disease
             progression; the patients must have had radiological progression to that regimen

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for

             neuropathy can also be included; palliative radiation to &lt; 10% of bone marrow is
             permissible if completed within one week of commencing study treatment as long as the
             toxicities secondary to palliative radiotherapy are limited to grade 1; the lesions
             that have received radiation treatment immediately before will be excluded as target
             lesions; previously irradiated lesions can be considered as targeted lesions, as long
             as there is prove of radiological progression

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and WEE1
      inhibitor MK-1775 work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back after a period of
      time. Gemcitabine hydrochloride may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, molecules that contain instructions for the proper development
      and functioning of cells), which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein WEE1 may
      help to repair the damaged tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor
      MK-1775 may block the WEE1 protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine
      hydrochloride by preventing the WEE1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells without
      causing harm to normal cells. It is not yet known whether gemcitabine hydrochloride with or
      without WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian, primary
      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.</summary>
