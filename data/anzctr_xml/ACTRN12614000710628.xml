  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Toolbox which consists of a website and virtual application as an online space for young people to access a personalised, ongoing recommendation service for evidence based tools and applications (apps) to support their wellbeing and mental health. The Toolbox has been developed by ReachOut.com by Inspire Foundation under contract with the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre (Young and Well CRC). The Toolbox has over 50 different tools that have been reviewed by a panel of both mental health professionals and consumers for their usefulness, effectiveness and usability.

The Toolbox focuses on wellbeing and positive functioning, and is designed to improve (a) emotional wellbeing (i.e. positive affect and life satisfaction); (b) psychological wellbeing (i.e. self-acceptance, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, autonomy and positive relations with others; (c) social wellbeing (i.e. social acceptance, social contribution, social coherence social integration, and social actualization); and (d) physical wellbeing (Shochet, Keyes &amp; Smith, 2011).

This study will evaluate the Toolbox by assessing changes in the participants wellbeing levels before and after using the website and associated apps.

We intend to recruit young people living in Australia who are between 16-25 years old by using online and community based recruitment strategies. 

After login participants will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will have immediate access to the Toolbox while the control group will be allocated to waiting list for 4 weeks. All participants will be asked to provide general demographics and significant covariate variables at sign up and prompted to complete surveys tracking wellbeing changes at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months.

The Toolbox houses over 50 mental health and wellbeing tools and apps that have been reviewed by a panel of both mental health professionals and consumers for their credibility, functionality, engagement and aesthetics according to the Mobile Application Rating Scale developed by Queensland University of Technology (Stoyanov et al. 2014).  During the intervention, users can select one or more wellbeing goals and are recommended trusted apps that will help them to achieve their goal.  If they are unsure where to start, a short quiz will help them to discern the area theyd like to focus on and recommend relevant apps to them.   They can come back any time using a secure log in to update their goals and download new apps. Users will also have the ability to track their progress in real time.

Participants are free to use the Toolbox at their own discretion. The intervention group will have access to the Toolbox for a total of 6 months.

To ensure adherence, emails and text messages will be sent to participants at evaluation points throughout the trial to remind them to log in and complete follow-up measures.

    <comparator>Wait list control

After login participants will be randomized into two groups. The intervention group will have immediate access to the Toolbox while the control group will be allocated to waiting list for 4 weeks. Once this phase is over all participants will be granted access to the Toolbox and will be followed up tracking wellbeing changes at 3 and 6 months. The control group will have access to the Toolbox for a total of 5 months.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the effect of the use of virtual tools (Toolbox) in supporting wellbeing and mental health in young
Australians.

The results of the Mental Health Continuum- Short Form (MHC-SF) will track changes in wellbeing at different
times according to the research design. This validated scale measures three components constituent of wellbeing: social wellbeing, psychological wellbeing and emotional wellbeing.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the factors that contribute to the variance in wellbeing scores through time.

Information about wellbeing fluctuations will be contrasted with significant covariates as found in previous wellbeing studies (Boiler at al, 2013; Sawyer, 2000; Keyes, 2002; 2005). These covariates are: age, gender, educational level, geographical location, occupation, education, accommodation, living circumstances and cultural background. Similarly, changes in wellbeing will be contrasted with data collected by ReachOut.com according to their own protocols: number of visits to the Toolbox, user duration, user experience, goal tracking and preferred apps.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine significant intervention areas for wellbeing improvement in young people.

The analysis described previously will enable us to find potential relationships and patterns that could guide future significant research and interventions to improve wellbeing in young people e.g. improving personal relationships, improving inclusion policies, etc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at 6 months </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine the relative cost-effectiveness of the Toolbox compared to the waiting list in supporting wellbeing and mental health in young Australians.

An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial estimating the relative cost-effectiveness of the Toolbox compared to the waiting list. The evaluation will take the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a primary outcome of cost per unique visit to the Toolbox. Utility-based outcomes will also be incorporated into the analysis allowing a secondary outcome to be cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (based on AQoL 8D values). Cost and outcome data will be collected on every participant within the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at baseline, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine any associations between depression and wellbeing fluctuations. 

Previous trials have shown high association between depression and wellbeing (Boiler et al, 2013; Sin, 2009). Results from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) will be used to measure associations between depression and wellbeing fluctuations in the context of the two continua model of wellbeing proposed by Keyes (2002).</outcome>

Once recruited, participants will be randomised in two groups. The intervention group will have direct access to the Toolbox while the control group will be allocated in a waiting list for four weeks. Once this phase is over all participants will be granted access to the Toolbox and will be followed up tracking wellbeing changes at 3 and 6 months.

Allocation concealment will be conducted using central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 180 completed participants (90/arm) are required in order to provide 90% power to detect a difference in improvement between arms of 0.37 with a 2-tailed type 1 error of 0.05. This assumes an overall standard deviation of 0.63 at baseline and 0.87 at 1 month follow up scores as found in (Boiler et al, 2013). that a positive response rate of 30% in the placebo arm.  Given the fact that screening and randomisation are completed electronically we intend to recruit 250 subjects.  

The primary analysis is intention to treat and missing values from all randomised subjects will be imputed with 50 resamples drawn.  The primary outcome measure is change in well-being between arms and will be assessed using random effects mixed modelling, with dependent variable well-being score (MHC-SF), independent variables time, group and the interaction (product) term time x group, and clustered over different times (YYYY) to account for possible correlated readings.   Sensitivity and secondary continuous outcomes will be assessed similarly, but also adjusting for potential confounders such as age, gender, region, work status, ethnicity, education level and living conditions.  All results will be reported with 95% confidence intervals and p-values. A p-value of 0.05 (two tailed) is considered statistically significant.  All analyses will be conducted using Stata 13.1 (Statacorp, Texas, USA).    

An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside the trial estimating the relative cost-effectiveness of The Toolbox compared to the waiting list. The evaluation will take the form of a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a primary outcome of cost per unique visit to the online wellbeing centre. Utility-based outcomes will also be incorporated into the analysis allowing a secondary outcome to be cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (based on AQoL 8D values). 

Cost and outcome data will be collected on every participant within the trial. Costs will be estimated by combining data on resource use associated with both the intervention and control groups with unit costs for each of the resource items. Resource use data will be collected using a resource use questionnaire. Unit costs (e.g. staff, drug and equipment costs) will be collected from published data sets including Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), Medical Benefits Scheme (MBS) and the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-DRG) cost weights. A patient level analysis will be undertaken to determine the mean costs, increases in number of visits to the online wellbeing centre and QALYs for each trial arm. To test the robustness of the economic evaluation results, non-parametric bootstrapping and appropriate sensitivity analyses will be carried out and results will be reported in terms of incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost effectiveness acceptability curves. The final results will be presented in the CONSORT (Altman et al. 2001 ) format for reporting randomised trials.</statisticalmethods>
