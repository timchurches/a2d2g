  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will only receive flecainide during the 32-week treatment phase; not during the initial 12-week lead-in phase. Patients will not receive anything in addition to their pre-existing medications during the lead-in phase.

Flecainide will be taken 50mg twice per day in the first week of the 32-week treatment phase, and 100mg twice per day thereafter. Patients will receive flecainide for 32 weeks. Oral mode of administration.</interventions>
