    <interventions>The aim of the study is to assess electrophysiological and thermal changes after single extracorporeal shock wave stimulation on upper limb spasticity in patients after ischemic stroke. 

Intervention:
All patients will be randomized and randomly assigned into two comparative groups. Group A will be the study group, where active shock wave stimulation (ESW) will be used. Group B will be a placebo group where the participants will be received a quasi-ESW without biological effect. A single active ESW or placebo ESW stimulation will be performed in all patients, depending on the random assignment to a particular group. Physical energy will be applied directly to the spastic carpal flexors muscle bellies in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. 
To carry out the stimulation, a device BTL-5000 ESW Power (BTL, Poland) emitting radial shock wave will be used. ESW parameters in the study group will involve safe and painless dose with no local anaesthesia. Pressure will be at 1.5 bar (0.1 mJ/mm2), frequency at 5 pulses per second (5 Hz) and total 1500 number of pulses. ESW is administered once only over a period of approximately 5 minutes.
In the placebo group, a passive quasi-ESW lacking biologically active component will be applied. The special polyethylene cap filled with sponge to ensure an absorption of the ESW shocks in placebo-controlled group will cover an applicator head over.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis and evaluation of the results will be based on the comparison of intra- and intergroup results. Statistical analysis of these results will be performed by means of the Statistica 10 software, manufactured by StatSoft (licence of Medical University in Wroclaw). 

All analysed intergroup qualitative variables will be checked with respect to their similarity (chi2 NW). For measurable variables (quantitative), arithmetic mean, standard deviations, medians and range of variability (extreme values) will be calculated and the normal  distribution will be used by Shapiro  Wilk test. For qualitative variables, the frequency of occurrence (percentage) will be calculated. Comparison of intergroup results (for the independent variables) in order to determine the significance of the achieved differences, will be performed by means of parametric (Student's t-test) or non-parametric (Mann-Whitney's test) tests, depending on meeting criteria for the specific test. The parameters before and after the study will be compared in the groups (for dependent variables) by parametric (t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon's  test), depending on meeting criteria for the specific test. For all analysis a critical significance level a = 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

According to statistical estimation the population over 30-35 is needed for further analysis of normal distribution, the scientific team had to include at least 80 participants in two groups to this study and use the parametric tests. To achieve study objectives the minimal number of participants is 40 in each group. Smaller number of patients is not enough from both statistical and clinical point of view.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-stroke spasticity is still a significant medical problem and challenge for the medicine specialist as well as physiotherapist. In two thirds of patients, the spasticity impairs the limb function, mostly affecting the upper limbs. A total of 12 million people worldwide suffer from spasticity. There are wide range of physical modalities reducing spasticity but without any doubts the ESW is a novel and promising method.
Biological mechanism of the shock wave has not been fully known and explained. Well designed clinical studies confirmed efficiency and safety of ESW therapy in musculoskeletal disorders especially. Recent reports have suggested strong analgesic properties and favourable changes at the microcirculation level. 
The ESW effect causing the reduction of muscle hypertonia associated with neurological disorders is insufficiently studied, both in Poland and around the world. Recent data suggest that focused ESW could be valuable supportive therapy in post-stroke patients but clinical investigations are still in the initial stages.</summary>
