Treatment: drugs: PG545
PG545 Lyophilized Powder for Subcutaneous Injection. Patients will be dosed once weekly until they exhibit disease progression, are discontinued for reasons of tolerability, or the study reaches its defined end-point. This study is a dose escalation study with doses of 25 mg to 500 mg planned.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This first-in-human study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of PG545 and to
      evaluate its safety in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In addition the study will
      explore whether PG545 exposure results in changes to chemicals produced by the body that are
      associated with cancer growth and spread.</summary>
