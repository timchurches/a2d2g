  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will attend 2 baseline sessions then 16 therapy sessions and a further 2 sessions to collect post-therapy data. Each therapy session will consist of games which focus on rule abstraction and cognitive flexibility.
a) Therapy sessions will be held twice weekly with each session lasting approximately 45 minutes. Therapy will last for 8 weeks.
b) Sessions will be individualised with the child and parent. Sessions will be administered by a Speech Pathology Honours student. c) Games will consist of puzzles, book sharing, play with toys such as farm animals which are familiar and appropriate for three year old children.
Each baseline session will last for approximately 45 minutes, and be held within the same week. During the post-therapy session data will be collected on cognitive flexibility, rule abstraction, phonology and phonological awareness.</interventions>
    <comparator>The research design is repeated measures single-case study research design thus each participant will act as their own control. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-and post-therapy outcomes will be measured using the Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP) (Dodd, Hua, Crosbie, Holm, Ozanne 2006) to measure percent consonants correct, percent vowels correct and number of atypical errors. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week after the final therapy session.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Flexible Item Selection Task (FIST) (Jacques and Zelazo 2001) will be used to measure improvement in cognitive flexibility and rule abstraction during therapy.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week following completion of therapy block.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Cracking the Code phonological awareness measure (Kelly and Cicerello 2014) will be used to measure emergence of phonological awareness. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week after the final therapy session</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A 40 word picture naming task will be used to measure speech sound errors, and number of atypical errors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, one week after the final therapy session, and at the beginning of each therapy session.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Six participants from a larger longitudinal study will be invited to participate in the intervention study. All participants must be aged between 3;0 and 3;11 at the commencement of intervention, and have made more than 10 atypical errors on the Toddler Phonology Test when assessed at the age of 2.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate the efficacy of providing cognitive flexibility and rule abstraction therapy to six children with atypical phonology at age three, an age at whcih many children are referred to speech pathologists. It is hypothesised that therapy will lead to improvements in cognitive flexibility and rule abstraction, phonology and phonological awareness. </summary>
