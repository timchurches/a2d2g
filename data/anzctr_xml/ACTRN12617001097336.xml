    <interventions>Part one, proof of concept:
 Two amputated lower limbs will be imaged with a near-infra red (NIR) camera and indocyanine green dye contrast. The imaging will involve recording the peak intensity of the fluorescence of the dye, and the time taken to peak intensity. Bright spots will be indicated and marked on the limb. After imaging, the limb will undergo resin casting, whereby resin will be injected into veins of the limb and allowed to set. This will produce a map of the micro venous system, with markers where imaging showed potential areas of reflux. The resulting resin map will be analysed to determine the degree of venous reflux in multiple regions of interest in the limb. This will be correlated with the data obtained from the NIR imaging.
Part Two: Continuation
If part one provides usable data from both imaging and resin casting, participants will be asked if they would like to undergo imaging prior to amputation, to allow for better correlation. The imaging session will take less than one hour, and involves cannulating the participant for a local injection of indocyanine green (ICG) dye.  of ICG solution (0.02 mg/ml) will be injected into a vein in the foot or at the level of the ankle, for the duration of the imaging sequence . This may be possible in neuropathic patients, who do not feel pain in their limbs. Patients will only be included in this extra imaging if a vascular surgeon who is not part of the study deems it appropriate. We aim to have three more participants, and hope to have at least one who is able to undergo imaging prior to amputation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is resin casting of the amputated limb, and each limb will have both the imaging and the resin casting. Resin (Batsons #17 resin, Polysciences Inc. Warrington, Pa) will be injected into the limb. As resin begins to flow from vessels at the proximal end of the limb, these vessels will be identified and ligated. Once the outflow vessels are closed, further resin will be injected until significant resistance is met. The limb will be immersed in saline for 12 hours to allow the resin to harden. Tissue will be removed by maceration in 15% sodium hydroxide (3.75 M) at 60C and the resulting cast will be analysed.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of ingress (intensity of the contrast dye from start to peak intensity) with reflux generation level of resin cast (in regions of interest). This will be assessed by first visually evaluating the image for regions of high, medium and low contrast intensity, and marking them with a permanant marker. After amputation, these spots (regions of interest) will be sutured using a polymer suture thread. Ingress will be assessed by using SPYQ software (SPY Novadaq Technologies Inc, Bonita Springs, FL).  Reflux generation level will be assigned based on how many generations of valves in the venous system are incompetent. The resin can pass freely into a tributary if the valves in that tributary are incompetent, so with no incompetence, only the great saphenous vein (GSV) is mapped in the resin cast. The GSV and its tributaries are generation 0 (no venous insufficiency). Valves in subsequent tributaries will be assigned a consecutively numbered generation, up to generation 4. Each individual region of interest will be given a generation designation, and this number will be compared with the SPYQ data that is also specific to that region. Spearmans rank correlation coefficients will be used to reflect the degree of relationships between variables. Significance will be indicated by two-sided p&lt;0.05.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 hour post amputation or 12 hours after patient death, the GSV of each limb will be cannulated with a 20 gauge needle at the level of the medial malleolus and flushed with saline. The limb will then be chilled at 4 degrees C for up to 12 hours if we are unable to do immediate imaging. 
In part 2, if a participant meets the criteria for imaging prior to amputation, NIR imaging will be conducted within 2 days of amputation.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesise that near-infra red imaging will allow the visualization and quantification of microvenous reflux (i.e., reflux in the tiny skin vessels) which has previously been unseen using standard ultrasound technologies, and that the results of this imaging will correlate with microvenous insufficiencies seen in retrograde resin casting. This may give us further insight into understanding how venous insufficiency leads to skin damage, and in ascertaining patient risk.</summary>
