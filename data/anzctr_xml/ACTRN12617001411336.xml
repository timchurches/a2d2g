  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will exercise in a hydrotherapy pool, heated to 32-33 degrees.  The exercise sessions will last approximately 45 minutes and will be similar in structure to traditional land-based pulmonary rehabilitation classes.  The participants will complete a variety of aerobic and strengthening exercises in the water, aiming to achieve a moderate level of breathlessness or fatigue as determined by the modified Borg Scale.  The sessions will run twice/weekly for eight weeks and will be supervised by two experienced physiotherapists.  Exercise sessions will be group classes with a maximum of ten attendees each session.  Intervention adherence rates will be monitored by documenting which participants have attended each session and each participants exercise routine will be documented on a recording sheet each session.  Exercises will be progressed gradually based on participants' symptoms and willingness.  No particular strategies are being employed to increase adherence or participation apart from general encouragement to attend and education about signs the participants are ready to progress</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effect of an aquatic or water-based exercise program on exercise capacity and quality of life in people with chronic heart failure and/or a chronic respiratory disease.
People will be recruited to the study after their initial assessment with the Chronic Disease Community Rehabilitation Service at Royal North Shore, Ryde and Hornsby Ku-rin-gai Hospitals.
The participants will attend a 45-60 minute exercise session in the hydrotherapy pool at the Graythwaite rehabilitation centre twice/weekly for eight weeks that focuses on endurance, lower limb and upper limb strengthening in a similar manner to traditional pulmonary and heart failure gym classes.
Outcome measures including six-minute walk distance, leg strength (measured by five sit to stand test), quality of life and levels of anxiety and depression will be retrieved from participants medical record after completion of the program as these measures are routinely performed as part of the CDCRS service.
An additional qualitative satisfaction survey will be completed by all participants at the end of the program to evaluate the new program.  All staff involved in the program will also complete a qualitative survey at the end of their involvement with the study.</summary>
