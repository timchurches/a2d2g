  <interventions>
    <interventions>One academic detailing session (30 minutes to 60 minutes in duration, tailored to GP needs) delivered by a medically trained peer to general practitioners via a phone session followed by expert feedback on the management of patients with atrial fibrillation.  During the academic detailing session, GPs' identify patients with AF for which they wish to receive expert feedback.  The medically trained peer proceeds through a standardised proforma collecting de-identified information about the presence of comorbidities, stroke risk factors, current anti-thrombotic treatments and records GPs' concerns/questions about the patient's management.  The de-identified proforma is returned to the research staff who forward a one-page summary to experts in stroke medicine (specifically Neurologists and Cardiologists) who reply to GP's queries.  The completed one-page summary is then returned to the GPs.</interventions>
    <comparator>One academic detailing session delivered by a medically trained peer to general practitioners via a phone session as for the intervention group.  The medically trained peer also completes de-identified patient proformas with the GPs and forwards these to the research team who then returns a one-page summary to GPs.  GPs allocated to the "control" arm therefore receive the same academic detailing session GPs allocated to the intervention arm (as allocation occurs after this session).</comparator>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>GPs are randomly selected from across Australia using a commercially available data-base.

Randomly selected GPs are first contacted via mail and asked to register their interest via a faxed or emailed form in a QA&amp;CPD education program about stroke prevention.  GPs are then mailed an information sheet and consent form.  Consenting GPs are sent educational materials and receive a phone call from a medically trained GP to complete an academic detailing session and nominate patients with AF for referral to an expert in stroke medicine (ie Neurologist or Cardiologist) for feedback about their management of patients.   All GPs completing this process are then randomised to receive expert decision support either before or after post-test assessment has been completed.

A statistician external to the study team is responsible for randomisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>GPs are ordered according to the date and time of completed academic detailing session and randomisation is stratified according to the number of patients GPs have referred to the study team (less than or equal to two patients versus 3 or more). Block randomisation is used, block size is unknown to the study investigators; the statistician has not advised the study investigators.</sequence>
