  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are multiple groups comprising the intervention group, randomised within each of the partner organisations to condition by worksite.  Every group randomised to the intervention group receives all of the components outlined below. 
Following randomisation to condition (discussed in more detail in following sections) intervention start-dates are established for each site based on resource availability and organisational readiness.  All sites are to commence Day 1 of intervention within 12 months from end 2010.
  

Days 1 and 2 
1.Standard intervention - Collaborative Recovery Model Training Program (CRM) (Oades et al. 2006):  2 day training program that equips mental health workers with theoretical and practical skills in recovery-oriented care

Day 3 of intervention:
2.  Values clarification - Survey of Life Principles (Ciarrochi &amp; Bailey, 2010) + Principles Success Rating Sheet (adapted from Sheldon and colleagues, 1998; 1999).  Participants are facilitated through a structured values clarification process using 60 cards and a structured card-sorting process.  The first "sort" aides identification of top 15 values / principles of living in life generally.  The participants are then facilitated through the card sort process again to identify their top 15 work values.

Days 1 - 3 are group-based face-to-face workshops.

3.  Values-focused coaching via CRM protocol:  12 x 1 hr monthly coaching sessions between staff participant and assigned in-service coach.  These one-on-one sessions are facilitated by in-house coaches once per month for a period of 12 months following initial training (Days 1-3).  The purpose of these coaching sessions is to continue practice /training in CRM protocol and to encourage purposeful striving toward values identified by participant in Day 3 and thereafter. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>There are multiple worksites in the control condition, identified via randomisation (outlines hereafter).  All worksites in the control group receive all intervention components below.
Intervention start dates for each of the groups in the control condition are negotiated based on resources and availability.  All groups commence within 12 month period from end 2010 and receive interventions according to the same schedule:

Implementation interventions:
Days 1 and 2:
1. Standard CRM Interventions as per experimental condition - Days 1 and 2.

Day 3:
2.  Implementation planning - Facilitated workshop + structured problem solving using SWOT analysis.  

Days 1 - 3 are group-based face-to-face workshops.
 
3. Implementation-focused coaching via CRM protocol:  12 x 1hr monthly coaching sessions between staff participant and assigned inservice coach.  These are one-on-one sessions conducted face-to-face for a period of 12 months following initial training (Days 1-3).  The purpose of these coaching sessions is to continue practice / training in CRM protocol and to encourage implementation of these into workplace practice by assisting participating staff to overcome barriers.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participating organisations will nominate an even number of total sites from across their organisation based on capacity and feasibility.  
Each site will be randomly allocated to either experimental (values) or control (implementation) using a computerised random number generator which also allocation concealment.  Equal numbers of sites will be allocated to each condition within individual organisations.  

Cluster-randomisation has been adopted (as opposed to single-subject randomisation) to maximise fidelity to condition and foster feasibility / utility for partner organisations.

    <statisticalmethods>Simple correlations will be used to explore direction and strength of relationships between experimental variables.  Factor analysis will be used to test assumptions and advance models relating to autonomous motivation for change that is imposed.  Two way analysis of variance will be used to investigate the effect of condition and time on main outcome variables (e.g. transfer, self-reported uptake) and other variables of interest at various time points.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of values-focused interventions for mental health support workers on their uptake of newly-acquired evidence-based recovery practices.

Main hypothesis:  Staff who participate in values-focused interventions (i.e. clarification during training and 12 x 1 monthly values-based coaching) will have higher rates of transfer than those in the control (implementation) condition.  </summary>
