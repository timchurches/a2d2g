  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the outpatient department of the hospital, participants will be provided with a smartphone application (Health App - with the smartphone worn in a pocket)  and two wearable devices (Fitbit One worn clipped to the waistband and Fitbit Flex worn on the wrist). They will complete the gold standard battery of physical function tests for approximately 30 minutes as well as conduct a 10 minute treadmill walk while wearing the devices, including the smartphone. The participants will be asked to wear the devices and to carry the smartphone for a 7-day period for as much of the 24 hours as possible in their usual living accommodations. After Day 7, they will undergo a twenty minute telephone assessment of physical function, relay the data from the smartphone applications and be prompted to return the wearable devices via the pre-paid envelope.</interventions>
    <comparator>The gold standard tests include:

1. Step count  - counted directly on a treadmill by the research assistant
2. Functional Independence Measure (FIM)
3. Six minute walk test
4. Grip strength

    <statisticalmethods>There is no universally accepted standard as to how precise the 95% CI for the limits of agreement need to be in order to be clinically useful. The sample size of 60 is based on our interpretation of the clinical literature regarding acceptably precise measurement, at feasible cost, as well as having at least as great precision as those published.
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe observations and frequency data and analysed according to normality of distribution (tested via Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) with subsequent parametric or non-parametric equivalent tests chosen as appropriate.
Concurrent validity will be tested for each of the three devices, using a Bland-Altman plot to calculate the 95% limits of agreement  between device step counts and the gold standard of directly counted steps (i.e. Smartphone app vs. direct step count; Fitbit One vs. direct step count and Fitbit Flex vs. direct step count). The device that has the smallest 95% limits of agreement will demonstrate the best concurrent validity of the three.
Concurrent validity will be tested for each of the three devices and each gold standard measure, using a Bland-Altman plot to calculate the 95% limits of agreement (i.e. nine Bland-Altman plots: Smartphone app vs FIM; Fitbit One vs FIM and Fitbit Flex vs FIM; repeated for 6MWT and grip strength respectively). The limits of agreement will be compared across the three gold standard tests to analyse whether step count can replace measurement of any of these outcomes in clinical trials; they will also be visually inspected for evidence of floor or ceiling effects. 
Concurrent validity will be tested for each telephone assessment and each gold standard measure, using a Bland-Altman plot to calculate the 95% limits of agreement (i.e. nine Bland-Altman plots: FIM vs. GOSE; FIM vs. EQ-5D; FIM vs. Rivermead Mobility Index; repeated for 6MWT and grip strength respectively). The limits of agreement will be compared across the three gold standard tests to analyze whether the telephone measures can replace measurement of any of these outcomes in clinical trials. 
Chi-square statistics will be used to assess for pairwise differences between the devices.
We will also include scatter plots as physical function is a complex variable.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will compare two "next generation" methods of measurement of physical function to the accepted gold standard assessment of physical function: in-person
testing using validated physical function outcome measures.
We will measure physical activity using (1) wearable devices and smartphone applications and (2) a telephone assessment of global function; we will compare these convenient at home assessments to the gold standard in-person assessments in order to quantify the validity and feasibility of these new approaches to inform future clinical trial design.
The results will be used both within Australia and New Zealand, and internationally, to design future RCTs aiming to measure post discharge and long term physical function outcomes. Moreover, our results will also inform the design of new in-home monitoring strategies for post-ICU clinics and interventions.</summary>
