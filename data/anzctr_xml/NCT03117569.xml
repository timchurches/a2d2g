  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if treatment monitoring schedule for chronic HCV
      patients treated with glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir (120mg) can be simplified.

      Data has shown that direct acting antiviral (DAA) regimen of glecaprevir (300mg)/pibrentasvir
      (120mg), a protease inhibitor and NS5A inhibitor respectively , provides key features for HCV
      treatment simplification.

      Eligible participants (naïve pre-cirrhosis chronic HCV patients) will be randomized (1:2) to
      the standard or simplified monitoring arm and will receive treatment for 8 weeks.

      One post treatment visit will be conducted 12 weeks after the final dose of study medication
      to evaluate the proportion of patients with undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint (SVR12).</summary>
