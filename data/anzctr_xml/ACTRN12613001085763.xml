Two groups of pregnant with history of recurrent abortion due to primary antiphospholipid syndrome. The control group was treated with acetyl salicylic acid 81 mg oral tablets (low dose aspirin) alone once daily and the study group was treated with low dose aspirin 81 mg oral tablets  plus 20 mg isosorbid mononitrate  tablets applied vaginally once daily. Treatment in both groups started once pregnancy was confirmed by B-hGC and ultrasound examination and continued till the end of pregnancy. All patients were firmly instructed to adhere to treatment through regular antenatal care followup and drug tablet return</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antiphospholipid syndrome (an autoimmune disease) is important cause for recurrent abortion (Three or more spontaneous successive abortion). Low dose aspirin and low molecular weight heparin are used for treatment on the assumption that the disease leads to placental thrombosis and fetal demise but results of treatment are unsatisfactory. Recently, abnormal endogenous nitric oxide synthesis was alleged to play a role.This study was performed to know if treatment with nitric oxide donors (drugs the release nitric oxide in the body) will improve pregnancy outcome and the full term live birth rate
