  <interventions>
    <interventions>KDF-07002 will be adminstered in the morning on day 1 of the study as a single intravenous infusion.  The doses in the study will be 0.013, 0.026, 0.053,
0.105, 0.158, 0.237, 0.356, 0.533, and 0.800 mL/kg of bodyweight.  Duration of infusion will be based on dose but should not exceed 1 hour.  Particiapnats will be observed for 48 hours in clinic, released with a followup visit ocurring on day 7.  Escalation of dose will proceed based on results of vital signs and clinical chemistry analyses.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and maximum tolerated dose of KDF 07002.  Safety assessments of participants will be performed by the Pricipal Investigators and Medical Monitors of the study based on vital signs, ECG, and clinical chemistry values.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be monitored in the clinical unit for 48 hours then released.  Particiapnts are requyired to return to the clinic on day 7 for follow-up assessment of ECG, vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate measurements; a blood sample will be taken for clinical chemistry, hepatic profile, renal profile, hematology, and coagulation measures</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole blood samples will be taken for analysis of KDF-07002 to determine the Pharmacokinetic profile of KDF-07002.  Trained scientists will use special software to analyze the resutls to determine how quickly the KDF-07002 exits the bloodstream.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a Phase 1a, single-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, dose escalating study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of a single, intravenous dose of KDF-07002 in healthy adults.    Up to 54 subjects will be sequentially enrolled into one of nine cohorts.  Each cohort will be randomised to receive KDF 07002 or placebo at a 2:1 ratio.  All eligible subjects will be assigned an enrollment number in sequential order beginning with 01.  After completion of screening, eligible subjects will be randomized to receive KDF-07002 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1.  

Each cohort will receive KDF-07002 in the following ascending dose order: 0.013, 0.026, 0.053, 0.105, 0.158, 0.237, 0.356, 0.533, 0.800 mL/kg of bodyweight.  Safety and tolerability will be assessed immediately after dosing until Day 7.</summary>
