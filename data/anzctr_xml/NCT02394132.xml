  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using either radiotherapy
      (RT) or Imiquimod (ImiQ) to treat the Lentigo Maligna (LM), when surgery is not possible, is
      refused, or fails.

      Surgery is the standard treatment for people diagnosed with LM. However for some people, it
      may not be possible due to the location of their LM lesion(s).

      Currently, the Australian and New Zealand Melanoma Treatment Guidelines recommend
      radiotherapy for the treatment of LM however there is no clinical trial evidence for this and
      a trial is needed to prove which treatment is safer and more effective. Some clinicians may
      also recommend the use of a cream called Imiquimod. It is approved and widely used in
      Australia to treat solar keratosis, superficial basal cell carcinoma, external genital warts,
      and perianal warts. Although not currently licensed for treatment use in LM, there is some
      evidence to suggest that it is both safe and effective in treating LM.

      This trial will scientifically evaluate and compare these two treatments in a controlled
      clinical setting.</summary>
