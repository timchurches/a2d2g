  <interventions>
    <interventions>A structured telephone intervention delivered by a cancer nurse. The primary carers of people diagnosed with poor prognosis gastrointestinal cancer (colorectal Duke's stage D, oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder, bile duct or small bowel) will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire. Carers will then be randomised into the intervention or control group. Carers in the intervention group will receive five telephone calls from the cancer nurse in the 10 weeks following the patient that they are carer for is discharged from hospital (the first call is at Day 3 post-discharge and then the remaining four will be fortnightly ie Day 17, 31, 45 and 59). Calls will vary in duration and be dependent on each individual carer's need however will be based a standardised structured screening tool. The intervention will provide information and advice to the carer on physical, psychosocial, information, practical and supportive care needs. Other needs that carers have will also be explored. It is anticipated that calls will last about 20-30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Carers assigned to the control group will not receive any additional support and follow-up other than what has been provided or arranged for them (or the person they are caring for) by the treating medical team at Royal Prince Alfred, Concord or Westmead Hospitals</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life (QoL).
QoL of carers and patients will be measured using the SF-12, a generic measure of health-related quality of life. The SF-12 comprises of 12 items relating to physical and psychological QoL</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (during the patients hospital admission) then 1, 3 and 6 months after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Unmet supportive care needs. 
Unmet supportive care needs of carers and patients will be measured using the Partner and Caregiver version of the Supportive Care Needs Survey. This is a 44 item questionnaire assessing physical, psychosocial, information and practical needs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (during the patients hospital admission) then 1, 3 and 6 months after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Carer and patient psychological distress will be measured using the "Distress Thermometer".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (during the patients hospital admission) then 1, 3 and 6 months after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Carer burden will be measured using the Caregiver Reaction Assessment, a 24-item questionnaire that assesses four negative and one positive dimensions of burden.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (during the patient they are a carers for hospital admission) then 1, 3 and 6 months after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Unplanned health service utlisation. Patients unplanned health service utilisation (emergency department visits, general practitioner, surgeon, oncologist, palliative care, allied health, community services) will be ascertained in a telephone interview with the carer</outcome>
      <timepoint>1, 3 and 6 months after the patient's hospital discharge.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients who are admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH), Concord Repatriation General Hospital (CRGH) and Westmead Hospital for surgery for an upper gastrointestinal malignancy (oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, gall bladder or bile duct, small bowel) or for Dukes D colorectal cancer will be invited to participate by their surgeon who will provide them with written and verbal information about the study and obtain written consent. Patients will be asked to nominate their main carer. The surgeon will provide the details of consenting patients to the research coordinator [RC] who will then visit the patient prior to their discharge from hospital. The RC will explain the study processes in more detail and will obtain contact details for the nominated carer and permission from the patient for their carer to be contacted by a member of the research team. The RC will then contact each nominated carer and arrange to meet them prior to the patientâ€™s discharge from hospital. The RC will explain the study to the carer, obtain written consent and ask them to complete a baseline self-administered questionnaire. Demographic information about the carer will be obtained in a short face-to-face interview with the RC. The details of consenting carers and patients and baseline data will be forwarded by the RC to a central second, independent researcher who will randomly allocate carers to the intervention or control groups using a computer-generated randomisation schedule. This will ensure allocation concealment in that the surgeons and RC who are actively involved in recruiting participants will be unaware of the group allocation sequence.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A pilot randomised study (ACTRN12609000452291) has been conducted and this current study is a larger multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT). This RCT will further evaluate a novel telephone-based intervention for carers of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. The intervention involves five structured calls from a nurse to the carer over 10 weeks, aiming to improve psychosocial outcomes for carers. 

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the intervention on carers quality of life, unmet supportive care needs, psychological distress and carer burden. This study will also ascertain effectiveness of the carer intervention to improve patient outcomes (patients unmet needs, psychological distress, quality of life and unplanned health service utilisation).</summary>
