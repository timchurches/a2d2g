  <interventions>
    <interventions>Semi-structured 30 minute osteopathy treatment, administered 2 times per week for 3 weeks by supervised, final year osteopathy students. Treatment consisted of a selection of manual techniques applied to the neck and upper-mid back and included postural advice and exercise prescription if indicated.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants were randomised to immediate or 3-week delayed start of treatment. The group randomised to delayed start acted as a control group for the period of the delay.</comparator>

    <concealment>Allocation was not concealed. The randomised allocation for immediate versus delayed-start was produced at the start of the trial and was available to those assessing participants for eligibility.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants were randomly assigned to 3-week delayed start of treatment, thus creating a randomised controlled trial for first 3 weeks of treatment. All participants eventually received 3 weeks of treatment and 3-week post-treatment follow-up. Secondary analysis of whole cohort was performed.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Mixed ANOVA model (1 repeated-measures factor and 1 independent-measures factor) for RCT analysis.

Mixed-model (multi-level linear) approach to ANOVA for single cohort analysis.

Prior to the study, calculations showed that a sample size of 10 participants per group would be required to detect a change in NDI or VAS of an effect size of 1 (VAS changes = 2.7) assuming 80% statistical power and alpha = 5%. An additional 2 participants per group was targeted to allow for possible withdrawals from the study.</statisticalmethods>
