  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects design. Participants will receive 20 minutes of either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Each participant will attend the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre on two occasions at least 72 hours apart. 

Active tDCS will be delivered using electrodes placed within the Starstim system cap. The anode, or activating, electrode will be placed over F3 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG placement, which has been determined to be an accurate estimate of the left DLPFC. The cathodal, or reference, electrode will be placed over the right supraorbital space. Stimulation will be applied at 0.028 ma/cm for 20mins.
Sham tDCS is achieved by switching off stimulation after approx. 30s ; which occurs within the software of the Starstim system allowing for administrator and patient blinding. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Design is within-subject. The session order of participants (i.e. active then sham; sham then active) will be randomized and counterbalanced using a computer-generated list. The sham condition will act as a control.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measures will be the accuracy and RT measures from the following cognitive task:
a..Reaction time task: This will require participants to respond with a button press when an X appears on the computer screen before them.  (duration 5 mins). This task is a measure of attention and processing speed.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive tasks will be completed at three time points:
Baseline/Time 1: Before 20 minutes of tDCS
Post Stimulation/Time 2: Immediately following tDCS
Delay/ Time 3: After a 30 minute delay</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measures will be the accuracy and RT measures from the following cognitive task:

b .Speed of information processing task: In this task two different stimuli will appear on a computer screen (either an A or an X). Participants will be required to respond with a button press only when the letter A appears on the screen  (duration 5 mins). This task is a measure of attention and processing speed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive tasks will be completed at three time points:
Baseline/Time 1: Before 20 minutes of tDCS
Post Stimulation/Time 2: Immediately following tDCS
Delay/ Time 3: After a 30 minute delay
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measures will be the accuracy and RT measures from the following cognitive task:
c..Working memory task: The working memory assessment will consisted of 5 minutes of the 2-back and 5 minutes of the 3-back. For the n back tasks a (pseudo-) random series of the letters A to J are presented consecutively and participants are required to respond with a button press when the presented letter was the same as the letter presented either 2 or 3 trials earlier.  (duration 10 mins)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive tasks will be completed at three time points:
Baseline/Time 1: Before 20 minutes of tDCS
Post Stimulation/Time 2: Immediately following tDCS
Delay/ Time 3: After a 30 minute delay
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome will be electrophysiological:
The electrical activity of the brain will be recorded using the StarStim Enobio System (Neurolectrics, Spain). We will use an 8 electrode array and mastoid electrodes will serve as the reference. 
 </outcome>
      <timepoint>EEG will be collected with participants at rest before and directly after 20 minutes of tDCS stimulation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This is the fourth primary outcome measure and includes  accuracy and RT measures from the following cognitive task:

d..Social Decision Making task: This task will require participants to answer a series of questions with either YES or No responses via a button box (i.e. Are you in Paris?). They will be instructed for each question to either tell the truth or lie.  (duration 5 mins). This task is a measure of executive function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cognitive task will be completed at three time points:
Baseline/Time 1: Before 20 minutes of tDCS
Post Stimulation/Time 2: Immediately following tDCS
Delay/ Time 3: After a 30 minute delay
</timepoint>

    <concealment>The session order of participants (i.e. active then sham; sham then active) will be randomized and counterbalanced using a computer-generated list. As each new participant is enrolled they will be allocated to the randomisation. A researcher not involved in data collection will  conduct the randomisation and only they will have access to the file. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS Version 20. Analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) will be used to investigate the change in working memory and social decision making after controlling for change in reaction time and speed of information processing between the two conditions (active tDCS, sham tDCS). ANOVAs will be utilised to investigate any changes in EEG measure from pre to post between the two conditions (i.e. active tDCS, sham tDCS). Post hoc analysis will be conducted to tease out any main effects. 

A total of 50 participants will be recruited. The primary outcome measures will be behavioural, i.e. the reaction time, and where relevant the accuracy, results from each of the cognitive tasks undertaken. We will also analyses differences in the relevant EEG data for each of the tasks. Multiple studies investigating tDCS have found group differences in cognitive performance and EEG activity with groups of this size or smaller (Hoy et al, 2013; Wirth et al., 2011). No formal power calculation was conducted.

    <summary>The aim of the research project is to investigate whether the broad improvements seen across cognitive domains following tDCS in the healthy population are a result of general effects (i.e. improving speed of information processing) or specific effects (i.e. improving working memory capacity or social decision making ability).</summary>
