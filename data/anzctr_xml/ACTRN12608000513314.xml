  <interventions>
    <interventions>The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy and clinical agreement between arterial glucose concentration and capillary or central venous measures. A sole set of tests per patient was obtained from all patients in about 5 minutes. Capilary strip, arterial strip, venous and arterial laboratory dosages were performed.  Arterial and central venous lines were forcefully used for the samples collection. The catheters lumen was washed with 10mL distilled water, followed by aspiration of 5mL fluids to be disposed of before the collection. Arterial and venous glucose were performed in the Olympus Au640e device, hexochinase G-6-PDHA reagent. For strip determination of glycemia blood from finger pulp lanced with a 26G needle was used. The glucometer available at the institution was the Medisense  FreeStyle Optium® (Abbott Laboratories, USA).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pearson coefficient was used to determine the correlation between the different measurements of glucose levels in relation to the arterial laboratory one. This correlation analysis between methods was based on standards established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) that sets out that two different methods for glucose level evaluation are equivalent if Pearsons coefficient is greater than 0.9751.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All samples were drawn at the same time for accuracy determination. The correlation between different measurements was determined after the completion of the data collection phase, which is 3 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of conformity in clinical management using results provided by different methods. This was performed based on the institution protocol (Anesthesiology Department of Federal University of Sao Paulo), using the latest capillary glucose level for comparison.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All samples were drawn at the same time for accuracy determination. The assessment of conformity in clinical managemente using those results was performed after the completion of the data collection phase, which is 3 months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Samples from patients with septic shock or from stable individuals without infection were collected. The correlation between measures was assessed by Pearsons test, agreement by Bland and Altman test and accuracy by following the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) criteria, both in the global sample and in the subgroups on noradrenalin and with signs of tissue hypoperfusion.</summary>
