    <sequence>The computer software used was Minitab,a statistical software program.Initially 14 random allocations for RMH and 14 for Frances Perry. These were done separately, but guaranteeing equal sample sizes in the two groups, at each site (7 and 7). Subsequently another 12 for Frances Perry, and I used the same software and the same approach, so that among the 12 there were guaranteed to be 6 in each group</sequence>
