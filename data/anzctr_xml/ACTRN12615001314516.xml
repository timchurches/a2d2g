  <interventions>
    <interventions>Critical patients treated in a medical/surgical ICU or intermediary unit will receive supplemental parenteral amino acids in addition to their ongoing nutrition. The supplemental amino acids will be given as an equivalent of 1 gram protein/kg body weight per day for 24 hours.  A mixture of amino acids (Glavamin, Fresenius) will be infused at a continuous rate of 0.083 g/kg/h for 24 hours. Infusion rates for the supplement will be automatically registered in the on-line clinical management system (ClinSoft). Measurements of whole-body protein kinetics is performed just before supplementation and  at 3 and 24 hours after start of the supplementation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole-body protein balance.

Whole-body protein balance is calculated by the difference between whole-body protein synthesis and breakdown rates which are assessed by the infusion of stable isotope labelled phenylalanine and tyrosine, detection of its amounts in plasma of the patients by mass spectrometry and kinetic modelling.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Whole-body protein balance measured just before (baseline) and at 3 and 24 hours after start of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whole-body phenylalanine oxidation.

Whole-body phenylalanine is calculated from the decarboxylation rate which is assessed by the infusion of stable isotope labelled phenylalanine and tyrosine, detection of its amounts in plasma of the patients by mass spectrometry and kinetic modelling.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Whole-body phenylalanine oxidation will be measured just before (baseline) and at 3 and 24 hours after start of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma amino acid profile.

Plasma amino acid profile is measured by established HPLC technique on plasma samples from the patients. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Critical ill patients loose lean body and muscle mass at a high rate. This fast wasting is related to a worsened clinical outcome. Appropriate protein feeding might prevent or reduce the wasting and thereby affect outcome. However, the best amount of protein for this is not well characterized. In a previous study we have shown that an 3 hour parenteral supplementation of amino acid to these patients results in a positive protein balance and that the extra amino acids are not oxidizes (Liebau et al. Crit Care 2015, 19:106.). The aim of the present study is to investigate if this effect persists over a longer time and therefore measurements of protein balance and oxidation are performed during 24 hours of supplementation after both 3 and 24 hours.</summary>
