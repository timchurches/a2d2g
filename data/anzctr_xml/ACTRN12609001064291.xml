  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty health volunteers, with age between 20 and 65 years old, will be selected and undergo 28 days of washout before the start the treatment. Then they will be divided in two groups: one will ingest from 3 to 4 cups daily (100 mL each one for people over 60 years old and 150 mL for people under 60 years old) of coffee brew with light roasting and another with dark roasting for 4 weeks. After, will be made a cross-over and the volunteers will ingest the coffee brew for over 4 weeks. Coffee will be provided to participants in daily portion. There will not have a washout between the two coffee groups, because studies show that phenolic acids bioavailability is short (After 4 hours of coffee intake, phenolic acid are not present in plasma in detectable amount), therefore 4 weeks are sufficient to eliminate the effect of one rosting on the other).</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment studied: coffee brew with light roasting and coffee brew with dark roasting. There will no have a control group, because each volunteer will be its own control</comparator>
