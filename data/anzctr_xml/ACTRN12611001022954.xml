  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound - an ultrasound of the knee that has undergone replacement surgery will be done during the clinic visit date. Presence of synovitis defined as synovial hypertrophy, synovial fluid and presence of power doppler signal. A single measurement of suprapatellar pouch thickness will also be performed.
Questionnaire - symptoms in osteoarthritis assessing domains of pain, physical function and patient global assessment using the following instruments - WOMAC pain and functional impairment subscale, patient global assesment.
Recruitment will take place from 2nd September 2011 to 31st October 2011.
Only 1 visit is required for the study.
Patients will be recruited from the Joint Assessment Clinic at the Shenton Park Campus of Royal Perth Hospital. Patient's records from the database will be accessed and 25 consecutive patients who report at least moderate pain (using the knee society score) at 2 years post TKA and agree to the study will be recruited</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to assess the presence of inflammation in the knee joint that has undergone replacement surgery for osteoarthritis and to correlate the presence of inflammation with pain. 
	Pain is the most common indication for knee joint replacement surgery yet there are patients who continue to report persistent pain after surgery. 
	There is evidence that inflammation is common in osteoarthritis and may be associated with pain. To date, we are unaware of evidence of inflammation post knee joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee. However, there are reports of joint fluid, which may occur due to inflammation, in the prosthetic knee. We would like to study whether the presence of inflammation correlates with the presence of persistent or unexplained pain post joint replacement surgery. 
	The information routinely collected for the Joint Replacement Registry will be obtained and in addition, an ultrasound assessment of the knee joint that has undergone replacement surgery will be done. Ultrasound has been used for the investigation and management of patients with musculoskeletal disease for at least 30 years. As there is no radiation risk with ultrasound and no medical intervention used in this study, there are no foreseeable risks involved.</summary>
