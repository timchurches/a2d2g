    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Etafilcon A, Lotrafilcon B , Senofilcon A

Other: Presbyopic group - Low Add - 40 years and over Add of less than +1.50D
Control lens : Lotrafilcon B and Senofilcon A
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against commercial control/s in each parallel arm in a randomised cross over fashion. Each lenses will be worn for a week with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types. Each lens will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances - a fitting visit and an evaluation visit.

Other: Presbyopic group - Med Add - 40 years and over Add of +1.50D to +1.75D
Control lens : Lotrafilcon B and Senofilcon A
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against commercial control/s in each parallel arm in a randomised cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types. Each lens assessment will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances - a fitting visit and an evaluation visit.

Other: Presbyopic group - High Add - 40 years and over Add of +2.00D to +2.50D
Control lens : Lotrafilcon B and Senofilcon A
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against commercial control/s in each parallel arm in a randomised cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types. Each lens assessment will require 2 scheduled clinic attendances - a fitting visit and an evaluation visit.

Other: Non-presbyopic group - 18 to 39 years old No Add
Control lens : Lotrafilcon B and Etafilcon A
Test lens: Etafilcon A
Up to 4 test lens designs will be assessed against commercial control/s in each parallel arm in a randomised cross over fashion, with a minimum 2 day washout period between the lens types.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in visual performance over 1-week lens wear - Visual Acuity Visual acuity will be recorded on an interval scale. Data will be summarised as means ± standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Visual acuity will be compared between test and control lens types and time across 1 week. Interactions will be tested and, if present, the significance of lens types will be determined at each time point and over time for each lens type. Visual acuity will be analysed using linear mixed model with subject random intercepts and / or paired t-test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after about 20 minutes of lens wear and after about 1 week of lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in subjective response over 1-week of lens wear - Subjective ratings Questionnaire Subjective ratings will be recorded on a scale of 1 to 10 on steps of 1. Data will be summarised as means ± standard deviations. No transformation is likely to be required. Subjective ratings will be compared between test and control lens types and time across 1 week. Interactions will be tested and, if present, the significance of lens type will be determined at each time point and over time for each lens type. Subjective ratings will be analysed using linear mixed model with subject random intercepts and / or paired t-test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After about 40 mins of lens wear and after 2 days, 4 days and 1 week of lens wear</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by
             signing a record of informed consent

          -  Be at least 18 years old, male or female

          -  Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by
             the Investigator

          -  Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent the
             participant from safely wearing contact lenses

          -  Correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses

          -  Be willing to not wear contact lenses for a minimum of 2 days before each stage of the
             clinical trial (after informed consent)</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or
             disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens
             fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses

          -  Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves
             disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis,
             Sjögrens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic
             hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants

          -  Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment
             and/or during the clinical trial

          -  Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter
             normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health /
             physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at
             enrolment and/or during the clinical trial NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on
             an "as needed basis", provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial and
             at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product is used

          -  Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.

          -  Previous corneal refractive surgery

          -  Contraindications to contact lens wear

          -  Known allergy or intolerance to ingredients in any of the clinical trial products

        The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone who they believe may not be
        able to fulfil the clinical trial requirements or it is believed to be in the participant's
        best interests</exclusivecriteria>
