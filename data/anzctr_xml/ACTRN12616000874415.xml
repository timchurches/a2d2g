Plus
A fourteen-week structured physical activity programme. 
- participant will meet a dedicated physiotherapist at the hospital, three times each week (1hr) for seven weeks. After this participant can decide whether to meet face to face or talk over the telephone, weekly, for another seven weeks. (duration of session time depends on participant)
- participants are give a brief diary to fill out and a pedometer (a small device that counts the number of steps you take during the day). 
- During the first seven weeks they will take part in a supervised physical activity program at the treating hospital (1hr or shorter if participant is not able to do a full hour). As part of this program they will do some fitness, strength and balance exercises under the supervision of the exercise provider.
These exercises are provided individually but may at some time be performed in a group.
- If participants are not able to do the activities this can be adapted to them, intensity is individualised for each participant

In weeks 8-14 patients receive a one on one supervised exercise session and are expected to perform daily exercise at home (amount of time to what the patient feels comfortable with). 

From weeks 14-21 patients are required to perform exercise daily at home independently. (this can be similar exercises to what they have been doing or other forms of exercise they feel comfortable with. 
 
For the physical activity: a) exercise intensity is measured by the RPE borg Scale. 
                                    b) exercises are chosen based on the patients level of function. They include a cardio component eg: cycling, walking, treadmill. Strength component and balance.
 
Intervention is individualised for each patient based on their mobility, strength, co-morbidities and desired outcomes of exercise.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of delivering the physical activity program and participant assessments 

In order to assess the feasibility of i) delivering the intervention and ii) completing study assessment the following information will be recorded for each participant:
- Adherence to physical activity sessions will be measured by recording attendance at these sessions
- Adherence to the planned unsupervised physical activity will be measured via patient diary
- Adherence to study assessments will be assessed via:
- Completion of self-report measures
- Completion of functional performance measures
- Completion of body composition measures
- Accelerometer data will be collected during week 4-6 of the program.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 weeks
Weekly from baseline to 14 weeks after intervention commencement  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life
Quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC-QLQC30. The Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire extensively validated in cancer patients. This questionnaire consists of five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting) and a number of single items assessing additional symptoms.

Baseline, Week 7, Week 14, Week 21 after intervention commencement </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional performance
Functional performance will be assessed via the:
- Six minute Walk Test (6MWT): distance walked by participant in six minutes
- Timed up and go: time taken to rise from seat, walk a specified circuit and return to sitting.
- 30 second chair stand: number of times participant rises to full stand and returns to seated position in 30 seconds.
- Comfortable gait speed: time taken to walk 10 metres. 
- One-legged stand tests: time able to stand on one leg.

Weekly from baseline to 14 weeks after intervention commencement  </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective markers of physical fitness 
The daily physical activity levels of participants during the intensive phase of the program will be accessed once for one week only (between weeks four to six of the program) by accelerometer. The accelerometer, a small device worn on the participants hip and attached to a light belt, will obtain information about the amount of activity performed and will be used as an objective confirmation of activity. </outcome>

Along with the physical activity levels that will be measured with the accelerometer, we will also collect data regarding participant sleep patterns to provide objective evidence of changes in self-reported sleep outcomes as well as changes in sleep patterns over time.

- Change from baseline across study time points for functional performance, body         composition, quality of life, fatigue, sleep, distress, and adverse events.

Data from all participants completing at least the baseline and one other assessment will be included in the analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of a physical activity program in patients who are newly diagnosed with grade III or IV high grade glioma.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been newly diagnosed with grade III or IV high grade glioma. 

Study details
Participants will be allocated to the group depending on participants wishes and abilities ,  Participants in one group will receive a structured physical activity program plus usual medical care, while the other group will receive usual medical care only. The physical activity program includes 3 x [1hr] supervised sessions per week for 7 weeks followed by once weekly support for weeks 8-14. 
All participants will be assessed for suitability to determine which group they should go into. Results from this pilot study will guide development of future studies on physical activity intervention programs in brain cancer patients.
