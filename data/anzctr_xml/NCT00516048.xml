    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to assess the anti-exenatide-antibody response to
      exenatide re-exposure as measured by anti-exenatide antibodies and incidence of
      treatment-emergent allergy and hypersensitivity reactions following a period of treatment
      interruption, in patients previously exposed to exenatide.</summary>
