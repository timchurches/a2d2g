  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to investigate the acute impact of different footwear and footwear features on gait of 2, 3 and 4 year old children. These exposures include boots, sandals, and runners in a soft sole and hard sole to determine the differences between each of the footwear and barefoot as measured on the GAITRite ('Registered Trademark) system. A selection of children will also wear a Trigno EMG Systems for Electromyography (EMG) sensor at the lateral gastrocnemius, biceps femoris and lateral branch of the rectus femoris. 

Shoes were selected as commonly wore footwear by children during the different seasons and play. All shoes will have the same features for each participant. The runners have a firm heel counter, and velcro fasteners. The boots are above the ankle, have a zip at the inside and elastic on the outside to assist in fitting and the sandals have  velcro strap fixture, enclosed heel and open toe. 

Seven conditions will be tested- 1. Barefoot (no footwear) 2. Sandals (Hard sole) 3. Sandals (Soft sole) , 4. Runners (Hard sole), 5. Runners (Soft soles), 6 Boots (Hard sole) and 7. Boot (Soft sole), will be used and the immediate effect on gait will be measured. Each condition consists of three walking trials and three running trials along the GaitRite mat, which is four (4) metres in length. During recording, if the initial or final contact is a partial foot fall, due to the potential for the foot to strike the mat in a partial sensor area, this data will be excluded. All other contacts within the recording, will be recorded for analysis. A one metre space will be provided at each end of the mat to allow the children to accelerate and decelerate as required. 

Conditions are as follows: Condition 1: After familiarisation, the child will be asked to remove their footwear and walk along the GAITRite('Registered Trademark) mat at their preferred pace for 3 passes. Then the child will be asked to run as fast as they can for three passes. 

Conditions 2-7: The children will be placed in socks and the footwear of interest while walking along the GAITRite('Registered Trademark) mat. The child will then repeat the trial running at their select selected fastest. 

A randomization procedure by use of a Latin square design will be employed for the seven conditions. Between each of these conditions, there is not anticipated to be a washout period and there will be 5 minutes between each testing period. 
I.e.: 
Condition 1, Condition 2, Condition 3, Condition 4, Condition 5, Condition 6, Condition 7
Condition 2, Condition 3, Condition 4, Condition 5, Condition 6, Condition 7, Condition 1
Condition 3, Condition 4, Condition 5, Condition 6, Condition 7 Condition 1, Condition 2
etc

The first five children in each age group will wear the Trigno surface EMG during testing. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The descriptive statistics will be used to express each variable in means (SD) or frequency (%) for all full foot strikes.  Linear regression analyses will be used to determine the difference in outcome measures between the barefoot (condition 1) versus each other condition. The data will be clustered within individual participants and robust variance estimates used to account for the within-subject nature of these data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The common footwear advice provided to parents of young children involves seeking out shoes with particular fixtures and features.  This advice is historic, and there is little evidence supporting this advice. It is unknown if there are particular features which change children gait. This also comes in the advent on softer and more flexible soles. 

This research aims to understand the impact of different features and sole hardness of common footwear on young children's gait compared to walking and running barefoot. That is, comparing sandals, boots and runners in identical styles with different sole hardnesses to barefoot to see if there are any differences. 

It is hoped through understanding any impact of footwear on gait, this research can be translated into parent footwear advice and shoe design. </summary>
