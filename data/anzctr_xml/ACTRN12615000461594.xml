  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing two formulations of modafinil with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, modafinil is an wakefulness promoting agent. It is used to improve wakefulness in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.</healthcondition>

      <conditioncode2>Research that is not of generic health relevance and not applicable to specific health categories listed above</conditioncode2>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of modafinil (1 x 100 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of modafinil (1 x 100 mg) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of modafinil.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 
Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and will be monitored for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose (1 x 100 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of modafinil (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for modafinil using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. </outcome>
