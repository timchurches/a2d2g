  <interventions>
    <interventions>In order to assessed the efficacy of cognitive training program, a computerized software (COGPACK) were used. The training consists of attention, executive function, visual spatial working memory and processing speed training derived from Cogpack training content. The training was conducted individually  2 to 3 hours  a day over  4 weeks. The participants were required to complete each session between 2 hours to 3 hours depending on their ability. Participants were introduced to the use of computers and mild assistance was given if they have any difficulties with computer training. The training  program was supervised by a trained clinical psychologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control group. Both group will attend the training program. Immediate group will access to training immediately after the baseline assessment meanwhile the wait list group had to wait for a month  before attending  training program.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcomes is based on improvement in cognition after training and whether it is maintained at 3 month follow-up. The outcomes will be based on scores on a battery of psychological assessment that involved a multiple cognitive areas. The improvement will also be measured on  the result in electrophysiological indices: mismatch negativity and P300</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>The participants will be excluded if they are found to be suffering from neurological impairment ( such as stroke, Parkinson disorder etc), mental illness or suspected mild cognitive impairment i.e hearing threshold less than 20dB. They will also be excluded if they have IQ less than 75.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participants will be randomly assigned to two groups, an immediate treatment group and waitlist control group. The participants were recruited via Hunter Medical Research Institution and flyers were displayed in strategic places. Cumulative samplings were used in two stages whereby 100 information sheets were sent to volunteer homes for participation in the research. Allocation was concealed by  a number containers. All participants were screened for their eligibility and assessed with various assessments including baseline assessment before been randomised to either treatment group or waitlist group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomised numbers were generated from randomised software that available in website.  Paper toss was performed by two researcher that blind to procedure of the research and   to randomly according to number that generated by the software to assign the participant to  either immediate group or waitlist group. Researchers who involved in testing with neuropsychological assessment and EEG recording were single blinded during these procedures
