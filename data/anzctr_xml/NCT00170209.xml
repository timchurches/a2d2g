  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Isoniazid
Treatment: drugs - Rifampin

Active Comparator: Isoniazid - The standard therapy will be daily self-administered INH, 5 mg/kg/day (max=300mg/day) for 9 months (9INH). Dosage will be adjusted if weight is less than 42 kg at 200mg/day for 9 months.

Active Comparator: Rifampin - The experimental arm will be daily self-administered RIF 10 mg/kg/day for 4 months (4RIF). Dosage will be adjusted if weight is 36-49 kg at 450 mg/day or at 300 mg/day for weight of 35 kg and less.


Treatment: drugs: Isoniazid
The dosage of the medication is determined according to the weight of the child. The dose is once per day, 10-15 mg/kg/day (max=300mg/day). Total duration of treatment is 9 months. Both a detailed dose chart calculating doses by weight and age and protocols for preparation of medications (crushing pills, mixing suspensions) are available.

Treatment: drugs: Rifampin
The dosage of the medication is determined according to the weight of the child. The dose is once per day, 10-20 mg/kg/day (max=600mg/day). Total duration of treatment is 4 months. Both a detailed dose chart calculating doses by weight and age and protocols for preparation of medications (crushing pills, mixing suspensions) are available.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Children (age &lt;18) with documented positive TST (or in the absence of TST, a positive
             QFT or T-Spot) and prescribed 9INH for LTBI for the following indications:

               1. HIV positive (TST &gt;5 mm or QFT+)

               2. Age 5 or less (TST &gt;5 mm or QFT+)

               3. Other reason for immuno-compromised state - such as therapy for malignancy or
                  post-transplant (TST &gt;5 mm or QFT+)

               4. Contact: with adult or adolescent with active contagious pulmonary TB. (TST &gt;5 mm
                  or QFT +)

               5. Have both of the following factors if TST = 10-14mm or QFT + or one factor if TST
                  &gt;15mm :

                    1. Arrival in Canada, Australia, or Saudi Arabia in the past 2 years from
                       countries with estimated annual incidence of active TB greater than 100 per
                       100,000

                    2. Body mass index (BMI) less than 10th percentile for their age</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients who were contacts of TB cases known to be resistant to Isoniazid, Rifampin,
             or both.

          -  Known HIV-infected individuals on anti-retroviral agents whose efficacy would be
             substantially reduced by Rifampin, unless therapy can safely be changed to agents not
             affected by Rifampin.

          -  Pregnant women - Rifampin and Isoniazid are considered safe in pregnancy but therapy
             is usually deferred until 2-3 months post-partum to avoid fetal risk and the potential
             for increased hepato-toxicity immediately post partum.

          -  Patients on any medication with clinically important drug interactions with Isoniazid
             or Rifampin, which their physician believes would make either arm contra-indicated.

          -  Patients with a history of allergy/hypersensitivity to Isoniazid or to Rifampin,
             Rifabutin, or Rifapentine.

          -  Patients with active TB. Patients initially suspected to have active TB can be
             randomized once this has been excluded.

          -  Prior complete LTBI therapy or if children have taken &gt;1 week and are still taking the
             treatment. Children will be eligible if they took an incomplete LTBI therapy (less
             than 80% of recommended total dose) but &gt; 6 months ago.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tuberculosis (TB) is spread by airborne transmission from adults with active contiguous TB to
      children, especially those living in the same household. Once children are exposed and
      infected they are at very high risk to develop active TB - which can be lethal if not
      detected and treated promptly. This makes it very important to detect TB infection as soon as
      possible, and treat this while it is still latent or dormant. Current therapy for latent TB
      infection is 9 months of Isoniazid; this is very effective if taken properly but because
      treatment is so long many children do not finish this. Four months of Rifampin is a
      recommended alternative. In adults this has been shown to be safer with much higher
      completion rates. However the effectiveness of this treatment is unclear, and is being
      studied in an ongoing study. The investigators plan to compare the safety as well as the
      acceptability and effectiveness of 4 months Rifampin with 9 months Isoniazid (standard
      treatment) in children in several sites in Canada and other countries.

      It is hypothesized that among children at high risk for development of active TB,
      intolerance/adverse events will not be worse (non-inferiority), among those randomized to
      4RIF compared to those randomized to 9INH. In addition completion of latent tuberculosis
      infection (LTBI) therapy will be significantly greater (superiority), and subsequent rates of
      active TB will not be significantly higher (non-inferiority) in children taking 4RIF.</summary>
