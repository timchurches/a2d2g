  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised to either exercise challenge as per American Thoracic Society guidelines on first day or inhaled dry powder mannitol challenge (potentially 635mg). Second day the challenge not undertaken on day 1 will be undertaken, ie. cross-over design.
The testing is completed over 2 consecutive days, however a diary card is completed over a 28 day period, 4 days prior to testing and a further 24 days post testing.</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy controls will undertake the same protocol as children with cough, ie. 2 consecutive days of testing.</comparator>

    <sequence>Children are randomised within strata of "children with cough" or "healthy controls".
They are subsequently allocated to the next number and sequence of testing on a list, which was previously generated, in random order, at a remote site. The method of randomisation was permutated block design by computer generation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise is used to make a diagnosis of exercise induced bronchoconstriction (narrowing of the airways) in children and adults with a history of breathlessness during or after exertion.

We are aiming to find out how much change in exhaled nitric oxide occurs after exercise and whether the amount of exhaled nitric oxide is related to exercise induced cough.</summary>
