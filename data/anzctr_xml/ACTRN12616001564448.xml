  <interventions>
    <interventions>1)Sigh35 is a hemodynamic test allowing the prediction of fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients showing spontaneous breathing activity. Sigh35 consists in the application of 35cmH20 for 4 seconds by a mechanical ventilator. The rise of the intrathoracic pressure causes a drop in pulse pressure (PP) and stroke volume index (SVI) which are proportional to preload dependency of the right ventricle (i.e. a patient who needs fluid will have a more consistent drop than a patient who does not need fluid). Sigh35 has been tested in a pilot study (ACTRN12615001232527).
2)End expiratory occlusion test (EEO) is another hemodynamic test allowing the prediction of fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients showing spontaneous breathing activity. By abolishing the inspiratory increase in intrathoracic pressure, EEO increases venous return and CO that could act as a volume challenge for detecting preload responsiveness.
The EEO consists in the interruption of the inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator by means of a manual end-expiratory occlusion of the airways for 15 seconds. Usually, on the main screen of the ventilator is displayed an "end-expiratory" maneuver button, since the stop on inspiratory pressure is also used to calculated totale end expiratory positive pressure. 
3) The passive leg raising is a hemodynamic test known to be effective and reliable also in patients showing spontaneous breathing activity. Passive leg raising consist in the elevation of the trunk and legs up to 45 degrees and while the thorax is simultaneously lowered to zero degrees.
4)Fluid challenge consisting in 500 ml of intravenous crystalloids (both saline 0,9% or Ringer Acetate or Lactate were allowed), administered in 10 minutes.
The Fluid challenge is administered by the attending physician to correct hemodynamic instability during the surgical procedure or in intensive care unit (see also eligibility).
All the patients received hemodynamic monitoring with the MostCare system which provides all the hemodynamic variables evaluated in the study before and after fluid challenge administration (PP, SVI, arterial elastance, cardiac cycle efficiency).
The protocol defines:
1) All the 3 tests will be used before fluid challenge in the same patient, The three test well be delivered following an order obtained by using opaque sealed envelopes to define which test (SIGH35, EEO and PLR) will be firstly delivered. 
This is NOT a randomized trial since there is NOT a random allocation to intervention /control group. In fact, when if patient presents the predetermined criteria for inclusion, without exclusion criteria, then he/she will be tested with Sigh35, EEO and PLR before FC administration.
Because of a potential statistical bias in the delivering the three tests always in the same order (for example PLR, EEO, SIGH35), the opaque sealed envelope will contain different orders (for example PLR, SIGH35, EEO or EEO, PLR, SIGH35 or SIGH35, PLR, EEO etc.).
Each test will be delivered according to definition (SIGH 35 in 4 seconds, EEO in 15 seconds, PLR within 30 seconds) and a pause of 3 minutes will separate each test from the others,
The variations of stroke volume, cardiac output, pulse pressure and systolic pressure will be recorded after each test and will be compared to the baseline values (pre-test values).
 Each test will be administered only one time unless the occurrence of cough or sporadic extrasystoles after SIGH35. For these reasons SIGH35 will be repeated for a maximum of another time. The occurrence of triggering of ventilator will determine the failure of EEO. The incorrect delivering of PLR will determine the failure of PLR.
2) Each test will be delivered by an expert ICU physician  with minimum 5 years experience
3)  Predetermined cut-offs have been described in the literature for SIGH35 (35% of pulse pressure reduction with respect to the baseline), EEO (5% of cardiac index increase with respect to the baseline) and PLR (10-15% of cardiac index with respect to the baseline), However, since a ROC curve approach will be used in the study, the cut offs of each test will be defined by the ROC curve constructed after fluid challenge administration and response.</interventions>
    <comparator>The gold standard for both EEO and SIgh35 will be the response of a patient to the administration of the fluid challenge. A patient will be considered responder if the cardiac index increases of at least 15% with respect to the baseline value after FC administration.The response of a patient to the fluid challenge will be assessed by means of hemodynamic monitoring with the MostCare system.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analysis
We use a statistical software (MedCalc statistical software 13.0, MedCalc, Ostend, Belgium) for all the statistical tests. Data distribution are evaluated by means of the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Continuous variable are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, while categorical as percentage (95% confidence interval [CI].
For identifying possible extrasystoles or arrhythmic patterns not recognized at the bedside, the beat-to-beat pulse pressure values obtained after EEO and SIGH35 are analyzed using the ROUT method for outliers identification with Q set at 0.1%. 
The primary end point will be assessed by means of calculation of ROC curve; we will consider clinically relevant an AUC of at least 0.85 and a failure an AUC equal or less than 0.70. Taking into account an alfa-risk of 5% and a beta-risk of 20%, the minimal sample size is calculated to be 82 patients. For SIGH35 , receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (95% CI) will be constructed for percent changes of systolic arterial pressure, pulse pressure (PP) and stroke volume index (SVI), between baseline and nadir after SIGH35 vs. the response to the fluid challange. 
As secondary end point, AUC of SIGH35 will be compared to AUC of EEO and PLR. For EEO the ROC curve was constructed to test the ability of the percent change during the last 5 seconds of the maneuver in PP, CI and SVI.For PLR the ROC curve was constructed to test the ability of the percent change during the maneuver in PP, CI and SVI. 
Comparison of AUCs of EEO and SIGH35 is performed by using a nonparametric paired technique, as described previously.
Differences in hemodynamic and respiratory parameters for responders and non-responders at baseline are assessed using the unpaired Students t-test, while changes before and after FC by means of the paired Students t-test. Discrete variables are analyzed using the Chi-squared or Fishers exact test, depending on the number of observations.
For all tests, the null hypothesis is rejected for p values &lt; 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Assessing fluid responsiveness in ICU patients undergoing pressure support ventilation is challenging. Insofar, the hemodynamic testes proposed for this purpose have drawbacks and cannot be applied extensively.
Sigh35 is a novel reliable hemodynamic test who is based on different physiological purposes.
The primary end point will be assessed by means of calculation of ROC curve; we will consider clinically relevant an AUC of at least 0.85 and a failure an AUC equal or less than 0.70. Taking into account an alfa-risk of 5% and a beta-risk of 20%, the minimal sample size is calculated to be 82 patients. For SIGH35 , receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (95% CI) will be constructed for percent changes of systolic arterial pressure, pulse pressure (PP) and stroke volume index (SVI), between baseline and nadir after SIGH35 vs. the response to the fluid challange. 
As secondary end point, AUC of SIGH35 will be compared to AUC of EEO. For EEO the ROC curve was constructed to test the ability of the percent change during the last 5 seconds of the maneuver in PP, CI and SVI. For PLR the ROC curve was constructed to test the ability of the percent change during the maneuver in PP, CI and SVI.
Comparison of AUCs of EEO and SIGH35 is performed by using a nonparametric paired technique, as described previously.</summary>
