  <interventions>
    <interventions>[Arm 1 - Exercise 1 day per week: Participants assigned to this intervention group will be asked to attend a supervised training session once a week for 12 weeks. The exercise program will target improving the strength and endurance of the muscles of the trunk. This session will be conducted as a group session and is expected to last up to 90 minutes. Outside of this single training session, participants will be asked to maintain their normal daily lives and not to partake in additional structured exercise. Participants will be asked to complete and submit a physical activity log once per week to facilitate the measurement of physical activity and to monitor compliance to the program. A weekly follow-up by telephone and/or email will also be used as a secondary means of ascertaining the participants compliance. Participants in this group will also receive the same weekly multidisciplinary health tips as the education group via their preferred method each week during the 12-week training program.]</interventions>
    <comparator>[Education (Control) Group: Participants assigned to this group will be encouraged to continue their day-to-day lives, as usual, but will receive a weekly multidisciplinary health tip for 12-weeks via their preferred method, (postal service or email) that will explain how, for example, exercise, nutrition and/or sleep quality may influence their falls risk and quality of life.]</comparator>

    <concealment>[Prospective participants will be sent an invitation to participate in the study, which will include information about the risks and benefits of the study, the nature of the assessments and the time commitment involved for volunteers. Individuals who provide consent to participate in this study will be asked to attend an initial session to allow a series of baseline assessments of cognition, symptom severity, balance and gait to be performed. Following the baseline assessments, participants will be assigned to one of two intervention groups; i) education (placebo); ii) exercise once per week. The assignment of participants to one of these groups will be determined using the permuted block randomisation method following their recruitment into the study. To minimise the risk of biasing the sample, the randomisation process will be completed by a member of the research team who will have no direct involvement in the recruitment or assessment of the research participants.]</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>[Population Estimation: Based on the results of a statistical power calculation, it was determined that a minimum of 11 participants per group is needed to confidently report any significant changes in standing and walking stability (Power = 80%, p = 0.05).  Given the longitudinal nature of the research, the recruitment of 15 individuals to each intervention group would accommodate a 25% attrition rate.]
[To assess for any significant differences between the groups with respect to the continuous demographic variables (e.g. age, height, weight,) a one way ANOVA will be used, while the Chi-square test will be sued to identify any significant differences in the frequency of categorical data (e.g. gender, Hoehn &amp; Yahr scale).  If a significant difference is found, the Tukeys honestly significant difference test will be used to perform post-hoc comparisons between groups.  If the assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilks test) and homogeneity of variance (Levenes test) of the ANOVA are violated, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test will be used.  Analysis of the outcome measures for static and dynamic postural stability will be based on an intention to treat.  To assess acute (12weeks) and long-term (24 weeks) effects of the intervention on measures of postural stability, a repeated measures analysis of covariance (RM_ANCOVA) will be conducted, with the baseline value for each outcome measure and disease severity entered as covariates.  To determine covariates, variables of age and disease severity will be graphed in relation to baseline measures of postural stability to identify any linear relationships.]</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>[The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether an exercise program targeted at improving the strength and endurance of the trunk muscles has the potential to improve standing and walking balance in individuals with Parkinsons disease.  It is hypothesized that exercise will improve aspects of standing and walking stability in people with PD, particularly the smoothness of head and trunk motion.]</summary>
