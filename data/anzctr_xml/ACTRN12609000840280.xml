  <interventions>
    <interventions>Identify patients with diabetes and obesity who have vitamin D deficiency by screening from cardiology outpatient settings (n=200). Vitamin D supplementation at 3000 international units (IU)/day or placebo orally for 3 months will be given to these patients (n=20). Cross-over between active treatment and placebo will be done for a further 3 months after a 3 month wash-out period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endothelial function: plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (assessed by a blood test), flow mediated dilatation (An ultrasound of the upper arm's artery will be conducted. This will involve lying down in a comfortable position for 15 to 20 minutes while the ultrasound is performed. The change in diameter of the upper arm's artery will be assessed after release of a tight blood pressure cuff and drug administration (glyceryl trinitrate, 25 mcg), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (blood test)</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months of treatment, 3 months of wash-out period, and a further 3 months of cross-over study. The outcome will be measured 4 times, at 3 monthly intervals: at entry, after 3 months of treatment, after 3 months of wash-out, and after 3 months of the second phase of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>platelet responsiveness to nitric oxide (NO). A blood sample will be taken, and platelet aggregation will be measured using a platelet aggregometer,. Platelet aggregation will be measured upon addition to a nitric oxide (NO)donor using the platelet aggregometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be measured 4 times, at 3 monthly intervals: at entry, 3 after 3 months of treatment, after 3 months of wash-out, and after 3 months of the second phase of the study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We invite you to participate in a research project which we believe is of potential importance in identifying the significance of vitamin D deficiency in patients with obesity and diabetes. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to poorly affect cardiovascular health, and we hope to investigate whether vitamin D supplementation will improve markers associated with cardiovascular health. We hope that the findings of this study will help us better manage this condition in future.</summary>
