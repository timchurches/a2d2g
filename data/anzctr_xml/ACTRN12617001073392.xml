    <interventions>The aim of this study is to identify whether or not women in a low-income setting (western Uganda) suffering from obstetric fistula, pelvic organ prolapse, or chronic 4th-degree obstetric tears, are at risk of domestic violence. It has previously been documented there is a high rate overall of domestic violence occurring in Uganda. 

The local nurses will administer the questionnaire in the local language as many women are illiterate or use local dialects. The questionnaire will be administered during admission to the hospital. The questionnaires are the "Women Abuse Screening Tool" (WAST) and "Hurt, Insult, Threat and Scream" (HITS).

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Women presenting to the Kagando Hospital, Kasese District, Uganda with obstetric fistula, chronic 4th degree tears and symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse.

Women who are not patients but attending the hospital e.g. family members of any hospital patients. In rural Uganda, there is limited staff on the ward and so family members come into hospital with any patient that is being admitted to assist the patients e.g. cooking meals, cleaning.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women in western Uganda live in a low income and resource poor setting. Without safe and effective obstetric care, many women develop obstetric fistulas and chronic 4th-degree obstetric tear. In addition women who develop pelvic organ prolapse have no access to treatment. Within Uganda, the 2011 Uganda Demographic Health Survey has identified a frightening incidence of domestic violence (either physical or sexual) at 41%. In a recent survey of women undergoing surgery for chronic 4th-degree obstetric tear, several women volunteered the information that they had been subject to domestic violence which they attributed to being caused by their condition. 

This project aims to invite women undergoing surgery for obstetric fistula, chronic 4th-degree obstetric tear and pelvic organ prolapse to participate in a questionnaire regarding their exposure to domestic violence. In addition, women who are not patients but are visiting the hospital will also be invited to participate in the questionnaire as a control group in order to obtain a baseline rate of domestic violence in that region. There is a paucity of information in the published literature on whether these women are more likely to experience domestic violence compared to the general population. Indeed any degree of domestic violence identified either in these women undergoing surgery or in the general population needs to be highlighted.</summary>
