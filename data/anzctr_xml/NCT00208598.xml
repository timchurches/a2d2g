  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been proposed that a higher cut off for BMI (body mass index) is to be used in Maori
      to define overweight and obesity. However, no one has assessed the prevalence of co-morbid
      conditions associated with BMI. It is well known that Maori are at greater risk of diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease compared to non-Maori and a delay in the identification of those
      who are overweight and obese may be detrimental for Maori. We will assess BMI, other measures
      of adiposity and prevalence of co-morbid conditions with a comparison with a similar matched
      non-Maori population.</summary>
