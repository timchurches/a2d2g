  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Brentuximab Vedotin
Treatment: drugs - Methotrexate or Bexarotene

Experimental: Methotrexate or Bexarotene - Methotrexate or Bexarotene as per physician's choice

Experimental: Brentuximab Vedotin - Brentuximab Vedotin Monotherapy


Treatment: drugs: Brentuximab Vedotin
Brentuximab vedotin (1.8 mg/kg) will be administered intravenously over approximately 30 minutes once every 21 days and may continue as monotherapy for up to a total of 16 cycles (48 weeks)

Treatment: drugs: Methotrexate or Bexarotene
Methotrexate will be administered orally (5 to 50 mg) once weekly. Dose adjustment is guided by patient response and toxicity or Bexarotene will be administered orally (300 mg/m2) once daily with meals.
