  <interventions>
    <interventions>The research will be conducted twice a week for 45 minutes, for four weeks. The simple task training consists only in the use of a treadmill and the dual task training consists on the use of a treadmill associated with visual stimuli.  The treadmill training will last 15 minutes, and the visual stimuli will last 10 minutes with 5 seconds between each image. Only the intervention group will be
submitted to the dual task training.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Indeed, this research is justified by the need to determine the effects of an intervention strategy aimed at improving the static and dynamic balance in elderly women, as the falls occur largely during events which, although relatively simple and routine as walking, require frequent postural reactions, mainly due to unexpected disruptions.

Hypothesis: 
The dual-task training on a treadmill, compared to simple training on a treadmill, promotes statistically significant difference in postural control of pre-frail elderly? 

Objetives:
- Check the effects of training dual-task and simple task on measures of postural control in community elderly with phenotype of frailty;  
- Compare the performance between groups in the evaluation tests of balance in the force platform and the Balance Scale Berg; 
- Check if there was retention of training effects after one month of the end of it.</summary>
