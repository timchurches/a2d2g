Treatment: drugs - Moxonidine
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Other: Olanzapine - Participants taking olanzapine at the time of recruitment will continue to take this medication as part of standard care for schizophrenia.

Other: Clozapine - Participants taking clozapine at the time of recruitment will continue to take this medication as part of standard care for schizophrenia.


Treatment: drugs: Moxonidine
Participants who are randomly assigned to the moxonidine/experimental group will be treated with moxonidine oral tablets for twelve weeks. Participants will begin their moxonidine treatment at 0.2mg dosage, which will be increased to 0.4mg over the first two weeks.
At the end of the twelve weeks of treatment, participants will be withdrawn from moxonidine over a period of two weeks.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
To examine the effects of moxonidine treatment, a placebo oral tablet will be used for comparison purposes.
The duration and number of placebo tablets participants will be required to take will be the same as the amount required in the moxonidine group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of antipsychotic medications has increased over the past decade. While more recently
      developed medications are improved with regards to extrapyramidal side effects, the use of
      atypical antipsychotics has been associated with substantial weight gain and a worsening of
      metabolic profile. The time course and extent of weight gain differs among antipsychotics,
      with olanzapine and clozapine being associated with greatest weight gain.

      Mechanisms underlying a worsening metabolic profile, obesity and obesity-related illnesses
      are complex, extending beyond sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and genetic predisposition.
      There is also a growing body of evidence that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) has a role
      in the generation of both obesity and obesity-related illness. While the role of the SNS in
      blood pressure control is readily acknowledged it is less well appreciated that activation of
      the SNS exerts profound metabolic effects.

      Although the fact of a causal relation linking antipsychotic drugs and obesity is
      unequivocally established, the biological mechanisms operating are unclear, and strategies
      for preventive therapy remain largely unformulated.

      This study aims to investigate the role of the SNS and its association with the metabolic
      abnormalities that are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia following treatment
      with antipsychotic medications.

      Additionally, the study will investigate whether treatment with the centrally acting
      sympatholytic agent moxonidine will modify SNS activity and, hence, favourably influence the
      downstream metabolic abnormalities seen in antipsychotic treated patients with schizophrenia.

      Hypothesis 1: Elevated sympathetic nervous system activity underlies the metabolic
      disturbances observed in patients following antipsychotic therapy.

      Aim 1: To investigate the role of the sympathetic nervous system and its association with the
      metabolic abnormalities that are frequently observed in patients with schizophrenia following
      treatment with antipsychotic medications

      Hypothesis 2: Central sympathoinhibition with moxonidine will blunt the elevated sympathetic
      nervous activity and downstream metabolic abnormalities observed in antipsychotic treated
      patients with schizophrenia.

      Aim 2: Determine whether treatment with the centrally acting sympatholytic agent moxonidine
      will modify sympathetic nervous system activity and, hence, favourably influence the
      downstream metabolic abnormalities seen in antipsychotic treated patients with schizophrenia.</summary>
