  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With the cessation of manufacture of MBDV in 2005, alternative JE vaccines were developed, including the VCDV approved by the TGA in Jan 2009. This vaccine was selected by the Australian Defence Force to continue its program of JE vaccination of members on 'short-notice-to-move'. Prior to this study there were no published reports of tolerability and immunogenicity of VCDV in previous MBDV vaccinees.

Military volunteers who had previously received MBDV and were due for boosting were invited to take part in the study (the alternative was to have a single booster dose of MBDV from remaining stocks). The full primary course of two doses of VCDV 28 days apart was provided to each participant (shown by the manufacturer to be effective at inducing immunogenicity), and blood was drawn prior to each dose for PRNT50 assays of immunogenicity. This was done in order to determine whether a single dose of VCDV was effective as a 'booster' dose, as measured at 28 days. The aim of the study was to determine tolerability of the vaccine in this population, and to determine whether a single dose of VCDV would be adequate to boost immunogenicity in this population.</summary>
