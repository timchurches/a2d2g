    <interventions>The intervention to be tested in this trial is a consumer pain self-management App: WebMD Pain Coach. This App has been selected based on a systematic review of quality and older people specific usability of currently available pain self-management Apps recently been completed by the investigator team (Bhattarai et al, 2017). In this systematic review the WebMD Pain Coach App generated the highest quality and usability score.  
Description of the WebMD Pain Coach App:
The WebMD Pain Coach App has been designed by the WebMD Health Network based in the United States for the self-management management of various kinds of painful conditions including arthritis, and features: 588 tips, 379 articles and 25 videos aimed at facilitating and strengthening pain self-management practices. The WebMD Pain Coach App features could be broadly classed as encompassing:
	Assessment and documentation: The WebMD Pain coach App offers an option to assess pain in a 0-5 Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and keeps a time-stamped record of the NRS score. This pain intensity scale can be used as frequently as the user desires. Users can also record other symptoms that accompanies their pain, the perceived pain trigger and treatment utilised to ease their pain; and 
	Pain self-management education: The WebMD Pain coach provides education on a range of different topics relating to pain self-management such as basic science of pain and pain self-management, problem solving, medication use, and communication with health professionals. Information on management of mood, sleep, and nutrition is also provided while highlighting the relevance of depression and anxiety in chronic pain management. This App incorporates various Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based pain self-management approaches; for example, goal setting is incorporated within the app function where the users can set various goals and track their own progress. In addition education and tips are provided on practicing mindfulness meditation, relaxation, diversion/distraction, and guided imagery. Physical exercise component of pain self-management is also well covered by this App with features such as ability to create personalised exercise list, stepwise instruction on stretching and strengthening exercises; and education and tips on carrying out aerobic exercises.
Intervention delivery:
Consenting older participants will be met for a face-to-face session conducted by the PhD student undertaking this study (Ms Bhattarai), who is an experienced clinical trials nurse and a research assistant. This session will be carried out at a mutually convenient location- either the university, participants home, or at a local library and is estimated to take approximately 45 minutes. The session will be aimed at providing all the relevant intervention details to the participants and also to organise the App download to their device. The baseline (Day 0) data collection will also be carried out during this meeting using a collection of questionnaires. A wireless enabled device will be purchased for the purpose of this trial that will be used for downloading the App to the face-to-face meeting participants device. If a face-to-face meeting is not feasible; and the participant is willing and able to use their own wireless or mobile internet for the App download, this session will be carried out over the phone (tele-meeting).
During this session participants will be provided a brief training on how to use the WebMD Pain coach App while providing a detailed demonstration of the App features. As the WebMD Pain Coach App features clear menu structure and simplistic user interface, it is expected that the participants will be able to use this app following a brief training. Participants will be advised to use the app however they want throughout the trial period (i.e the use of the app will not be prescribed). 
In addition, participants will be provided with a contact card with the name and contact number of the research team and instruction to contact if assistance is needed. The contact card will be posted out to those taking part in the tele-meeting. The meeting will then be summarised and participant will be instructed to use the app for four weeks (Day 1-28). Participants will be contacted again on Day 29 for the follow-up data collection. This data collection session is expected take approximately 30 minutes

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to synthesize socio-demographic data of the participants. Frequencies and percentages will be reported for categorical variables, normally distributed continuous variables will be presented as mean and standard deviations, and median and inter-quartile range will be reported for non-normally distributed continuous variables. Participants pre-test self-reported pain data (pain intensity and pain interference), pain self-efficacy, and online technology self-efficacy will be compared with their post-test reports. A paired t-test analysis will be conducted to compare the pre-test reports with post-test so as to identify any statistically significant differences. The paired t-test is an appropriate statistical test for when there is just one observation for each combination of nominal values, i.e. before and after the intervention. The difference between the two time points will be considered significant if the p value is less that 0.05 (p&lt;0.05). The data analysis results will be presented in tabular and/or graphical form as appropriate. 
Additional information regarding sample size and outcomes: 
We consulted with a senior statistician and referred to relevant literature with regards to  sample size.  As this study is a Phase I feasibility study which is a non-randomised, non-stratified, pilot study to gauge acceptability of this treatment modality with older adults, a sample size calculation was considered to be inappropriate. However, based on comparable feasibility studies in the literature, we are aiming to recruit 30 participants for the study.
Further we also note that the outcomes this feasibility study aims to measure are preliminary outcomes only The preliminary outcomes data is expected to indicate if there is any evidence of likely effect of the intervention on the outcomes of interest.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arthritis is a major cause of illness and disability, particularly among older people. It is estimated that 70% of community dwelling older people experience unrelieved arthritic pain. As with any other chronic conditions, people living with chronic arthritic pain are required to self-manage their condition adopting various pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Therefore, innovative and cost-effective approaches are necessary to build older peoples pain self-management capabilities. One of such approaches is the use of digital technologies such as smartphone apps. 
In this study we aim to explore the suitability of a pain self-management App [WebMD Pain Coach] in assisting older people living in the community to more effectively manage their arthritic pain.
English speaking older people (i.e. those aged 65 years or over); living with arthritis related pain in the community; who use a smartphone or a tablet-computer, will be invited to participate. Interested older people will be asked to sign a written consent form. 
A meeting (M1) will be organized with consenting participants for App download and study questionnaire completion. With the assistance of one of the researchers, participants will be asked to download the freely available WebMD Pain Coach App to their smartphone or tablet, and to complete a questionnaire. Participants will be instructed to use the App for four weeks, after which another meeting (M2) will be scheduled for completion of the follow-up questionnaire. It is estimated that this meeting will take up to 45 minutes and can be carried out face-to-face or via telephone. Face-to-face meetings will take place at a mutually convenient location. 
This will be followed by data analysis process and reporting the results.  
We expect that the results of this study will help develop recommendation for future pain interventions designed to optimise older peoples pain management capabilities in the community. </summary>
