  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomised to the intervention group will receive a coordinated care intervention targeting healthy lifestyle, with two components: a) clinical intervention from a physiotherapist and dietitian; and b) referral to telephone-based health coaching for weight management (diet and exercise via the NSW Get Healthy Service), and smoking cessation (counseling by the NSW Quitline) for those participants who identify as smokers.
All intervention components are delivered with individual patients. 

a)	Clinical intervention - Low back pain assessment, advice and monitoring (week 0-1, 3, 6 and 12)
An experienced physiotherapist will conduct an initial 1 hour clinical assessment  and provide condition specific advice and education, along with instructions about the coordinated care intervention. The advice will incorporate international guideline recommended education and reassurance, with explanation of the mechanisms by which lifestyle factors such as weight, diet, physical activity and smoking cessation can improve symptoms, and reduce health risks. Specifically, provision of advice aims to improve understanding of self-management principles for low back pain, reinforce the need to stay active or gradually increase activity, and avoid bed rest, and provide rationale for the importance of the telephone healthy lifestyle coaching as part of their treatment approach. Follow up appointments will be 30 minutes in length. 
Patients will also see a dietitian at week 3 immediately after physiotherapy appointments for 30-45 minutes for advice and education on healthy eating and strategies to improve their diet. 
Clinicians will work to support lifestyle change and address barriers to participation in the supplemental telephone services. 
Patients will also be provided with printed and online materials (email of PDFs, access to a vodcast) detailing the messages provided by clinicans.

b)	Telephone-based health coaching 
	Weight loss, physical activity and diet coaching program  Get Healthy  (week 1 to 26)
All patients will be referred to a 6-month telephone-based weight loss coaching program delivered by allied health professionals from the NSW Get Healthy Service. Calls occur bimonthly for the first 3 months (n=6) and monthly thereafter. Call duration will vary on the delivery of the content and counseling provided to the patient. 
Get Healthy sessions are delivered by a range of health professionals trained in dietetics, psychology and exercise science. The coaching sessions are based on self-regulation principles, including self-monitoring, goal setting, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and environmental management, to assist patients set goals, achieve a healthy body weight, and improve diet and physical activity and overcome barriers to making such changes. All content and advice is provided according to standardized protocols and aligns with national diet and physical activity guidelines. 
Get Healthy coaches will receive low back pain-specific training to tailor content for study participants. This includes a 3 hour face to face group interactive education workshop including a power point presentation providing information on prognosis of low back pain, lifestyle associations and challenges in addressing behavior change in this group of patients. The health coaches are also provided with a paper resource that reflects the presentation information and participate in discussion addressing some case studies of patients with low back pain seeking lifestyle change support. 

	Smoking cessation program - Quitline (week 12)
Participants who smoke, will be referred to the NSW Quitline. Quitline counselors (advisors) who are trained in smoking cessation, will contact participants, and systematically record information on smoking history and previous quit attempts. Advisors encourage smokers to set a quit date, and assist in maximizing success of quitting by guiding participants through evidence-based cessation methods with consideration of individual preferences and past history of quitting. Advisors also assist callers to deal with issues such as withdrawal symptoms. After the initial contact, and establishment of a quit date, participants will be phoned on the following occasions for support: the day before the agreed quit date; within the first two days after the quit date; within the first week of the quit date; twice within the following three weeks; three months after the quit date. 
Duration of the phone sessions vary depending on the patients needs and counseling provided.

Adherence to the intervention will be collected from the telephone services themselves at 6 months (regarding number of calls completed) and adherence to the consultations will be tracked throughout weeks 1-12 by the intervention physiotherapists and research team.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients allocated to the control group will receive usual care management via a hospital physiotherapy department. This may include up to three clinical appointments. No systematic process for the provision of weight loss management or smoking cessation care to patients currently exists within the study hospital. Patients may receive care from their GP/surgeon, or access care independent to this trial. Receipt of any care outside of this trial will be measured at each follow up. </comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible consenting patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group (1:1) after baseline assessment over the phone. Randomisation will be not be disclosed to patients. Patients will be advised that they will be scheduled for an appointment with a physiotherapist (without disclosing information that there are specific physiotherapists who will deliver the intervention and usual care). All patients will fill in a written consent form to say they have read the information letter and understand and consent to participate in the program. Patients will also be asked to consent to their information being collected from any services they may be referred to as part of their care. </concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be randomised using a central randomisation service to ensure concealment of treatment allocation. A permuted block randomization approach will be used so that the distribution of overweight and obesity across treatment conditions (intervention or control) will be maintained regardless of their prevalence in the final sample size.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated using the method of Twisk for mixed models. With 3 repeated observations, an estimated intra-cluster correlation (correlation between the observations) of 0.5, alpha set at 5%, and allowing for up to 18% non-compliance, we require 346 patients to have an 80% power to detect between group differences of 3 points on Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (SD 5) at 6 months. This is the smallest worthwhile effect that would justify implementation of the intervention. In these calculations we have conservatively ignored the increase in statistical power conferred by baseline covariates and stratification. 

For the primary outcome, a P value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. while for the key secondary outcomes a P value of &lt;0.025 will be considered significant. We will analyse the effect of treatment separately for each outcome using linear mixed models with random intercepts for individuals to account for correlation of repeated measures. We will obtain estimates of the effect of the intervention and 95% confidence intervals by constructing linear contrasts to compare the adjusted mean change (continuous variables) or difference in proportions (dichotomous variables) in outcome from baseline to each time point between the treatment and control groups.
Mediation analysis will be undertaken to investigate the mechanisms underlying the intervention using causal mediation analysis. We will assess the mediating effect of physical activity, diet, pain self-efficacy, pain self-efficacy and symptoms of psychological distress on low back pain disability.

Three economic analyses will also be conducted. First, a cost model will be prepared comparing the costs associated with the control and intervention pathways. Second, a cost-utility analysis conducted from the perspective of the health sector. Third, a cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective in which the additional costs (and cost savings) associated with use of community services will be conducted. Intervention costs along with costs of other health care services will be factored in with levels of utilisation to estimate the costs of healthcare use for participants. Other health care services will be valued at standard rates published by the Australian Government. Private non-medical healthcare services will be valued at standard rates published by the relevant professional body or a third party payer. Costs of community services will be based on the self-reported costs to participants. Health state utilities, required to estimate quality-adjusted life-years, will be based on measures obtained from the SF-12 and transformed into health state utilities via the SF-6D algorithm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients with chronic low back pain are referred for surgical consultation without clear indications for surgical intervention. Patients often wait for extended periods for consultation during which their disability worsens and general health declines. Furthermore, a high percentage of these patients are overweight or obese and may benefit from conservative healthy lifestyle care. Unfortunately, this type of care is rarely offered to these patients. This study will test the effectiveness of a coordinated care program that includes: evidence based advice and education for low back pain, and telephone based lifestyle and weight management and smoking cessation counselling. We hypothesise that this intervention will confer a 3-point reduction in disability measured on the 0-24 point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, compared to usual care. </summary>
