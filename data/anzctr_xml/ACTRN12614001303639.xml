  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a single centre, open-label, fixed-sequence study to investigate the effects of PRN1008 on the PK of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy participants.

Participants will be screened for participation in this study within 28 days before dosing. Participants will be admitted to the study unit the day before dosing (Day -1) and will remain in the clinic up to Day 5, after collection of the final PK sample.
Participants enrolled will complete a two-period, fixed sequence study:

Period 1: Study Days 1 to 3.
Following a single oral 2 mg dose of midazolam on Day 1, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours to characterize the PK profile of midazolam and  alpha-hydroxymidazolam.

Period 2: Study Days 4 to 5
On Day 4, participants will receive an oral 600 mg dose of PRN1008 one hour prior to receiving an oral 2 mg dose of midazolam. Blood samples for determination of PRN1008, midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam PK will be obtained over a period of 25 hours.

For both periods, subjects will be monitored on dosing days under supervision of the researcher to ensure administration of the products has been completed in accordance to protocol.

Following discharge from the study unit, participants will return for a final follow-up assessment between day 11 to 14.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on historical healthy volunteer data for midazolam PK, an intrapatient coefficient of variation (CV) of 15% was utilized. Using a two one-sided tests procedure with alpha = 0.05, 10 participants are required to have greater than 80 percent power to detect equivalence assuming no true differences in mean PK parameters. Equivalence is defined as the 90 percent confidence limit of the ratio of AUC or Cmax within the equivalence interval of 80-125 percent. To account for dropouts, 12 participants will be enrolled.</statisticalmethods>
