  <interventions>
    <interventions>A postural bio-feedback device worn by subjects for 4-10hours a day for 6 days spread across 6 weeks for the sub acute low back pain group and for 8 days spread across 10 weeks for the chronic group. The device records movement and muscle activity data relating to the lower back. Bio-feedback is delivered to the subject as an audible tone, visual cue or vibration and aims to prompt the subject to alter their posture or position in line with recommendations given by the treating practitioner. Four small sensors are adhered to the lower back and send data wirelessly to a datalogger carried in the pocket by the subject (the size of a small mobile phone).</interventions>
    <comparator>The device is worn as a placebo with no bio-feedback given to the subject. The subjects in the control group wear the device for 4-10 hours a day for 6 days spread across 6 weeks for the sub acute low back pain group and for 8 days spread across 10 weeks for the chronic group.</comparator>

1.Lower back surgery within previous twelve (12) months.
2.Females who are pregnant.
3.Subjects with a severe hearing impairment.
4.Evidence of non mechanical contributing cause for lower back pain e.g. neoplasm, infection, fracture, inflammatory disorder.
5.Preceding chronic neurological changes (Sub Acute group only).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies using bulky lower back measuring devices have shown postural bio-feedback is useful in improving outcomes for subjects who experience low back pain. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a new monitoring and feedback device, that is wireless and discrete, can improve outcomes for subjects with low back pain, via the delivery of postural bio-feedabck.</summary>
