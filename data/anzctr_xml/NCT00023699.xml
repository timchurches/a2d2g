    <summary>RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor
      cells and may slow the growth of ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have
      recurrent or persistent ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer.</summary>
