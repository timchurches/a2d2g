  <interventions>
    <interventions>COMBiT is an intensive group based day program combining two theoretically different interventions: constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) and bimanual upper limb training (BIM). CIMT upper limb training involves restraining the unimpaired limb using an individually tailored 'glove'combined with intense practice of tasks with the impaired limb during attendance at day camp. CIMT is performed first for 6 hours/day for 5 days=30 hours. This is followed by BIM which is based on motor learning and requires individualised 2 handed activities. This will be performed in the second week 6 hours/day for 5 day=30 hours. COMBiT will use a circus based theme for the day camp. The CIMT and BIM interventions will be conducted in a group based format faciliated by experienced occupational therapists and circus trainers. </interventions>
    <comparator>COMBiT intensive therapy will be compared to standard therapy which involves individually tailored therapy 2 hours/week for 6 weeks, in addition to a home program of 30 minutes a day for 6 days/week for 12 weeks. Standard care therapy will be conducted by experienced occupational therapists in a one on one sessions for the duration of the six week program. The occupational therapists will formulate the home program in consultation with the child's parent to target the child's individual upper limb functional goals. The parent ensures the home program is completed with regular contact with the occupational therapist.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will have reduced upper limb (UL) function due to predominant spasticity rather than dystonia, and sufficient cognitive capacity to follow instructions and participate in the UL intervention. The study will include school aged children and youth: 
1. Confirmed diagnosis of congential hemiplegia
2. Aged 5-16 years
3. Reduced upper limb function due to predominant spasticity rather than dystonia
4. Sufficient cooperation and cognitive understanding to particiapte in the therapy activities.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if they have:
1. Fixed contracture or severe muscle spasticity in the designated muscle groups
2. Previously undergone surgery in the UL
3. Received BoNT-A injections within 6 weeks prior to baseline assessments.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children will be matched in pairs according to age, gender, and side of hemiplegia. Once matching has been achieved and baseline assessments completed, children will be randomised within pairs from concealed envelopes opened by non study personnel. Treatment allocation will be recorded on a piece of folded paper inside each envelope in random order. The randomisation process will involved allocating a number '1' or '2' to each member of the pair which will be written on the paper inside the envelope. As each pair is entered, they will be allocated the next consecutive envelope, which will be opened by non study personnel who will read and record the treatment allocation from the paper inside the envelope. Study personnel will be informed of group allocation.</concealment>
