  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with renal failure feel increasingly unwell as the disease progresses. The onset of taste changes, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss is thought to be due to an accumulation of toxins that the kidney can no longer get rid of as the patient becomes more and more uraemic. No single uraemic toxin has been identified that accounts for all the clinical symptoms. Taste influences food palatability and appetite and may cause an inadequate dietary intake contributing to malnutrition often seen in renal failure. Patients with kidney disease often suffer taste and upper gastro-intestinal problems and may need to start dialysis due to these symptoms. This implicates an accumulation of toxins but the responsible toxins have not been determined.
The purpose of this project is to improve health outcomes and nutritional management of patients with chronic kidney disease. We would like to find out which strategies improve uraemic symptoms such as taste changes and nausea often experienced by chronic renal failure patients. If the reasons for these symptoms are found, the most suitable techniques to improve their symptoms can be determined. This would enhance renal patients wellbeing and potentially their nutritional status and may delay the need for dialysis.
A total of 30 people will be asked to participate in this project recruited from the Renal outpatient clinics. Patients will be asked to provide saliva sample for analysis on two separate occasions. They will be asked to complete a questionnaire on symptoms concerned with taste and eating and record what they eat over 24hours at the start of the study and at the end of the study. Patients will be asked to taste and rate a variety of fluids using common foods or food ingredients thought to influence uraemic symptoms. Patients will then be asked to sip or rinse their mouth with the fluid they felt most beneficial to their symptoms for about 3 weeks. The toxins found in the saliva will be compared to symptoms and the solutions chosen and if their use improved any uraemic symptoms and nutritional intake.</summary>
