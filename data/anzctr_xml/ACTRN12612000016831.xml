  <interventions>
    <interventions>Motivational interviewing: 

Patients will be offered 6 face-to-face visits to a Registered Nurse, trained in smoking cessation techniques. The initial visit will be at least 90 minutes for assessment and counselling. Thereafter visits will be between 15 to 30 minutes for further counselling using evidence-based guidelines and carbon monoxide analysis to indicate abstinence. It is anticipated that most patients will remain engaged with the smoking cessation program for 3 months; however this could be extended to 6 months for those that need further support.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(O) The most favourable outcome after access to the evidence based smoking cessation program is smoking abstinence. Objective measures will be taken during the clinical visits using the Smokelyser in order to validate abstinence. Carbon monoxide level CO levels below 10ppm (parts per million) are considered reliable indicator of non-smoking. Questions during the contacts with the clinical nurses will provide additional subjective data on the quit-rate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visits are scheduled 2 weekly and run for 12 weeks with optional extension to 24 weeks (same schedule) if indicated.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(O) Participants are aware of national secondary prevention guidelines. 
As part of the motivational interview technique, evidenced-based guidelines will be set in context with personalised risk factors of participants to motivate change and discuss knowledge of risk factors. Objective data like body weight, Body Mass Index and blood cholesterol levels will indicate uptake of secondary prevention guidelines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0 month, 3 months, 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(O) Early identification of risk factors.
Identification of vascular risk factors comprises the assessment of social life circumstances and general health. Risks screening also includes assessment and monitoring of depression / anxiety because of the association of coronary heart diseases, mental health issues and nicotine dependence. The following tools and measurements will quantify these risks

* Perceived social support; Instrument ESSI 
* Perceived general health status; Instrument SF-12
* Depression and anxiety risk; Instrument HADS
* Height/weight/waist circumference measurements</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 3 month, 6 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>(O) Patient satisfaction measures.
The overall patient satisfaction with our service will be measures with the Michigan Academic Consortium Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 3 months for participants who quit smoking after the 12 weeks schedule. 

After 6 months for patients who did not quit smoking after 3  months and did the 3 months cycle again.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study focuses on patients admitted to hospital with cardiovascular diseases. The cardiovascular system includes the heart and blood vessels that carry blood around the body. 
Smoking is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and following diagnosis individuals continue to smoke. We aim to particularly focus on these individuals for intensive treatment via a smoking cessation program. A specially trained Registered Nurse will undertake motivational interviewing techniques that consider the persons readiness to change smoking habits and promote lifestyle changes. For further support a cardiologist and psychologist will be available for consultation.</summary>
