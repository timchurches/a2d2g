    <studytitle>Effects of wholegrain breakfast meals on appetite</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Will eating a wholegrain breakfast meal with slower starch digestibility and higher polyphenol content result in greater post-prandial satiety, lower energy intake at a subsequent meal  and greater antioxidant effects in healthy adults?</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Intervention: Participants will undergo 3 test meals and 1 control meal. The order they receive the meals will be randomised.

Test meals:  45grams of  flaked wholegrain cereal biscuits derived from 3 different varieties of sorghum grain. The different test biscuits that are expected to have variable rates of starch digestibility and polyphenol content.
 
Control meal: 45g wholegrain breakfast meal using comparator cereals.

Duration of administration: Breakfast meals and subsequent 4 hours, following 12 hours overnight fast with a prior standardised dinner the night before.

Time of administration: Morning breakfast meal.

    <concealment>Participants will be drawn from the general public through media advertisements (local newspapers), institutional electronic messaging to students and staff of UOW and local primary school newsletters.

This study is powered to assess outcomes with 40 participants and 20 of these to be randomised into a sub-group to undertake blood sampling. A researcher independent of the subject interface will undertake the randomisation of subjects as to the order they ingest the test meals and also for the selection of the sub-group to participate in the blood sample collection. 

Participants will be informed the study involves wholegrain cereal products but not regarding the specific meal components or the specific component being tested.

Taking into consideration statistical expert opinion and the collective sample sizes in the referenced studies below (of similar study design as ours), we conclude that 40 participants in total to undergo subjective appetite studies through VAS AND of this group a 20 participant subset for biochemical marker analysis is required to achieve significant results. Importantly, the fact that no studies have previously investigated the effects of sorghum in humans warrants a larger sample size than in some of the studies referenced below, particularly in relation to the biochemical markers.

Justification for 20 subjects for blood studies (using GIP and GLP-1 as an example):
 
Najjar A.M. et al. BJN  (2009) 101, 391-398: The acute impact of ingestion of breads of varying composition on blood glucose, insulin and incretins following first and second meals
 
Maersk M. EJCN (2012): Satiety scores and satiety hormone response after sucrose-sweetened soft drink compared with isocaloric semi-skimmed milk and with non-caloric soft drink: a controlled trial
 
Justification for 35-40 subjects for VAS studies:
 
Flint A., Raben A, et al. International Journal of Obesity (2000) 24, 38-48: Reproducibility, power and validity of visual analogue scales in assessment of appetite sensations in single test meal studies
 -an effect size of 10% would be a reasonable and realistic difference to look for in studies of appetite. With a study power of 0.8 and using a paired design, 32 subjects will be enough to test all parameters.

Lemmens S.G ,et al. AJCN (2011) Changes in gut hormone and glucose concentrations in relation to hunger and fullness
-38 subjects in an acute meal study comparing VAS scores with glucose and hormone concentrations  (including GIP, GLP-1, ghrelin, insulin) over time in a randomized crossover design. Significance was achieved.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Wholegrains are rich in nutrients and other substances with antioxidant activity that have the potential to benefit human health, in a similar way to the effects of fruits and vegetables. Wholegrain foods have been associated with reduced weight gain, slowly digested carbohydrates and improved heart health, particularly in studies of populations that consume certain wholegrains as a staple food. We wish to investigate if some positive effects can be identified and measured in people consuming specific wholegrains in a single meal.

This study aims to demonstrate the immediate effects of eating a range of wholegrain breakfasts on appetite and blood levels of glucose, appetite hormones and antioxidants. Therefore, this study is a very important step towards building evidence for specific wholegrains as important foods in appetite control and disease prevention.
