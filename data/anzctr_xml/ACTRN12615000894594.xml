  <interventions>
    <interventions>Stage 1 is a cohort of up to 6 patients (Cohort 1), to confirm the dose of Oraxol when compared with IV paclitaxel.
This is a randomised trial and therefore Oraxol may be administered in Treatment Period 1 or Treatment Period 2.
Oraxol is administered over three days (i.e. Days 1, 2 and 3 of the applicable Treatment Period). The daily dose of Oraxol is one HM30181AK-US 15mg tablet administered one hour before oral paclitaxel 205mg/m2. Oraxol will be administered at the study site on each dosing day. Patients need to fast for 8 hours before and 4 hours after Oraxol administration.
Dosing for Treatment Period 2 may start on the last day of PK sampling for Treatment Period 1, or may be delayed for up to 3 weeks, if needed, to allow the participant to recover to less than or equal to Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) or baseline toxicity from the prior study treatment or to allow the participants flexibility in scheduling inpatient treatment.
An interim analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Cohort 1 will be conducted to determine if the administered regimen would appear likely to achieve BE (AUC0-inf), if tested in a greater number of participants in Stage 2. A decision will be made by consensus of the DSMB, Kinex, Zenith Technology, and the Principal Investigator as to whether a second cohort administered a different dose is required to complete Stage1 or whether the study can proceed to Stage 2 using the dose administered in Stage 1. An additional 18 to 42 evaluable participants will be enrolled into Stage 2 based on the Stage 1 results (AUC0-inf). The study design for Stage 2 is the same as for Stage 1. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment  for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 is one dose of intravenous paclitaxel 80mg/m2 administered over one hour. It will be administered at the study site on Day 1 of the applicable Treatment Period. There are no fasting requirements and premedication will be given as per standard local practice at the study site.
Dosing for Treatment Period 2 can begin on the last day of assessments for Treatment Period 1.  However the second period of randomized treatment may be delayed for up to 2 weeks, if needed, to allow the participant to recover to less than or equal to Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) or baseline toxicity from the prior study treatment or to allow the participants flexibility in scheduling inpatient treatment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Once a patient has been assessed as eligible for the study as far as can be determined at 5 days prior to dosing, the site will contact Zenith Technology where the randomisation list will be held. Zenith Technology will advise the site of the participant's randomisation number and their treatment sequence. Zenith Technology will be supplying pre-labelled PK sample collection packs and Oraxol and therefore need to randomise participants 5 working days before dosing of Treatment Period 1. This means that participants are randomised prior to the analysis and review of laboratory tests needed within 72hours prior to dosing. Therefore some participants may be randomised, found to be ineligible on the basis of these laboratory tests and not dosed. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomized to receive either treatment Sequence A or B. Assignment to treatment sequence will be based on a computer-generated central randomization scheme that will be reviewed and approved by an independent statistician.  
</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This is a randomised, multicenter, open-label, 2-stage study. Both stages of the study have a two treatment periods and a  crossover design.  Stage 1 will consist of an initial cohort of up to 6 evaluable participants who will receive a dosing regimen of Oraxol consisting of a 15-mg oral HM30181AK-US tablet plus an oral paclitaxel dose of 205 mg/m2, both administered once daily for 3 consecutive days.  An interim analysis of pharmacokinetic data from Cohort 1 will be conducted to determine if the administered regimen would appear likely to achieve BE (AUC0-inf), if tested in a greater number of participants in Stage 2.  If it appears unlikely that the selected regimen will meet the criteria for BE based on AUC0-inf data, a second cohort (Cohort 2) of up to 6 evaluable participants may be enrolled in Stage 1, and the dose of paclitaxel in Oraxol may be adjusted by a maximum of +/- 25%.  If Cohort 2 is enrolled, a second interim analysis will be conducted.
After the interim analysis/analyses, a decision will be made by consensus of the DSMB, Kinex, Zenith Technology, and the Principal Investigator as to what dose should be administered in Stage 2.  An additional 18 to 42 evaluable participants will be enrolled into Stage 2 based on the Stage 1 results (AUC0-inf).  Thus a total of up to 54 evaluable participants could potentially be enrolled in this study (6 each from Stage 1, Cohorts 1 and 2, and up to 42 participants in Stage 2).  
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Bio-equivalence</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A total of 24 to 48 evaluable participants receiving the selected Stage 1 dose will be evaluated for bioequivalence between Oraxol and IV paclitaxel based on a 2-sided 90% CI of log-transformed AUC0-inf between 80% and 125%. 
Based on the within-subject variability of at most 30% through a comparison of the PK of Oraxol to Taxol, a sample size of 24 to 48 patients is needed to achieve BE within the 80% to 125% confidence limits with 90% statistical power.
The data from the first 6 patients dosed will be analysed with the subsequent patients given the same dose. Therefore the additional 18-42 patients data will be added to the 6 from the same dose from stage 1 to give a total of 24-48 patients. If 2 sets of 6 patients are needed in Stage 1, a total of 54 patients will be dosed, but the first 6 patients who received the different/initial dose will not be included in the PK analyses because their data will confound the BE.

Statistical analyses will be reported using summary tables, graphs, and data listings. Continuous variables will be summarized using the mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum.  Summaries of PK parameters will also include the geometric mean and the coefficient of variation.  Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and by percentage of participants in corresponding categories.  All raw data obtained from the CRF/eCRF, as well as any derived data will be included in data listings.
The primary endpoint is area under the concentrationtime curve zero time extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-inf) derived for each participant by non-compartmental analysis using plasma concentration-time data for oral and IV paclitaxel.
Secondary endpoints include, but are not limited to the following PK parameters which will be derived for each participant by noncompartmental analysis using plasma concentration-time data for oral and IV paclitaxel:
* Maximum observed concentration (Cmax)
* Area under the concentrationtime curve zero time to time of last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-t)
* Time at which the highest drug concentration occurs (Tmax)
* Terminal elimination phase half-life (T1/2)
