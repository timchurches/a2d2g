    <statisticalmethods>Negative Binomial Generalised Linear Models will be fitted to estimate fall rates per household with outcome being counts of fall injuries and covariates address-specific falls in the year prior to the study, number of steps and a group identifier (treatment or control). A sub-analysis will be conducted to identify any interactions between the group identifier and (i) prior falls (ii) number of steps in two strata: 5-8 and 9-15.

On the basis of a previous study (the HIPI study) and analysis of new ACC claims for 2012 classified by the setting of the injury, injuries on steps can be estimated to occur in at least 6% of the population of houses studied per year, or 18% over three years, over which timespan injuries will be monitored for this study. For the power calculation, we have used 18% as the baseline rate. This may be conservative given that we will focus on houses with at least five steps with identified hazards, which we assume will pose a greater injury risk. 

The expected relative risk of these injuries for the treated houses relative to the control houses can be expected to be about 0.61 (a reduction in risk of 39%), based on HIPI results for specific injuries (those injuries most likely to be influenced by the modifications made in that study). We have conservatively used 0.65 (a reduction in risk of 35%) in our power calculations. For a study with 400 houses and 800 control houses with a three-year rate of falls per control house of 0.18 and a true relative risk of injury of 0.65, we will be able to reject the null hypothesis that this relative risk equals one with 82% power, using a Type I error probability of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Around 1,200 addresses will be identified in the Wellington Region and New Plymouth where there are more than 5 access steps and neither handrails nor step edgings (nosings). From these, 400 addresses will be randomly sampled to receive modifications at no cost to the occupants or owners. The modifications will consist of the provision of handrails and step edgings and minor step repairs where necessary. 
An address match for the treatment group homes and the control homes in the same area will then be conducted by the national injury insurer, ACC, to identify falls in the home that received ACC-funded medical treatment over the period before modification and after modification of the addresses in the study. Analysis will then be conducted on anonymised counts identified only by the general location, age group and sex of the injured people, and a random digit per address to identify falls happening at the same address (so that clustering by household can be accommodated in the analysis). The main analysis will be according to Intention to Treat principles, where injury rates for all homes allocated to the treatment group are compared to the controls. A secondary analysis will consider the safety benefits only for homes that consented to have the modifications done.
