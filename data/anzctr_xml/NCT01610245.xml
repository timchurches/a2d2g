    <exclusivecriteria>1. Severity of illness requiring or anticipated to require in-hospital care or subject

             the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for seasonal influenza in
             adults and children (Committee of Infectious Diseases (CID) 2009:48) or current
             Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Current criteria for
             persons 13-65 years of age who are at risk of influenza complications include (list to
             be reviewed and updated as required prior to initiation of the study and at least
             monthly during the study):

               1. Persons with asthma or other chronic pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis
                  in children or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults.

                  metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders.

              11. Persons with neuromuscular disorders, seizure disorders or cognitive dysfunction

             medical therapy.

         12. Presence of any pre-existing illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             place the subject at an unreasonably increased risk through participation in this
             study.

         13. Subjects who, in the judgment of the investigator, will be unlikely to comply with the
             requirements of this protocol.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This study is a global multicenter randomized factorial double-blind, placebo-controlled
      trial designed to evaluate (i) efficacy and safety of nitazoxanide 600 mg administered orally
      twice daily for five days compared to a placebo in the treatment of acute uncomplicated
      influenza and (ii) efficacy and safety of combination therapy with nitazoxanide 600 mg plus
      Oseltamivir 75 mg co-administered orally twice daily for five days compared to nitazoxanide
      monotherapy (600 mg b.i.d. for 5 days) and Oseltamivir monotherapy (75 mg b.i.d. for 5 days)
      in the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza.</summary>
