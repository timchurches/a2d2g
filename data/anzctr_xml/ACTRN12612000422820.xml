  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both study groups will undertake a stimulated IVF cycle.
The first( intervention) group will have all embryos cryostored electively for transfer in a later natural menstrual cycle.
The second group will have the best quality embryo transferred to the endometrial cavity fresh and all remaining embryos cryostored.
The protocol for the second group is standard practice today.
Both groups undertake the same drug regime therefore there is no difference in drug intervention</interventions>
    <comparator>All cycles will be using a standard antagonist protocol - Day 1 FSH &lt;12, Oestrogen &lt; 200pmol/L 

Commence FSH stimulation on day 2 of cycle with rFSH (Puregon, Organon) 150 Units +/- 50 Units per day (dose decided by physician based on BMI and age)  

Fixed daily dose of Orgalutran  0.25micrograms subcutaneous injection per day commenced  on day 5 of stimulation

Estradiol levels will be measured on Day 3/4 and Oestradiol, Progesterone, LH level and follicle measurements on  day 8 and 10 of stimulation

FSH  and Orgalutran injections continued until there are 2 or more lead follicles greater than 17mm in diameter. On that day Ovidrel  Serono 250 micrograms subcutaneous injection will be used to trigger ovulation

Trans-vaginal oocyte collection thirty-six hours after trigger injection under local anaesthetic and sedation or General anaesthetic. 

IVF or ICSI in the laboratory as per Genea laboratory protocol

There must be at minimum 2 embryos for cryostorage at 9:00 am on day 5. 
One blastocyst will be transferred in the fresh embryo group and vitrification of all other suitable embryos.


All embryos will be vitrified in the elective freezing group. 
Luteal phase support with Pregnyl 1500 U subcutaneous injection on day two and six post OPU or Cinone 8% vaginal suppository if judged to be at higher risk of hyper-stimulation syndrome. 

All frozen embryo transfers will be in a natural cryo cycle with transfer of a single thawed embryo on 
ovulation day +5. Ovulation will be determined by LH surge &gt; 20 IU Endometrial thickness must be &gt;6mm.

The whole cycle will last approximately 28 days</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At Genea frozen embryo transfer pregnancy success rates have improved to a level close to fresh embryo transfer success rates.  The embryos used in the frozen cycles are the second and third best embryos - as graded for development rate and morphology- compared to the embryos transferred in the fresh cycles when the best quality embryo is selected for transfer to the uterus.  The hormone stimulation undertaken prior to oocyte collection may affect the endometrium (uterine lining) - advancing it to a stage whereby the embryo implantation prospect could be  impaired  and therefore reducing the chance of an ongoing pregnancy.  The hypothesis is that freezing of all embryos may help to overcome any reduction in implantation potential by allowing improved synchronisation between the embryo and the endometrium, leading to both higher implantation and pregnancy rates.


There are a number of causes of pregnancy failure following IVF treatment including genetically abnormal embryos, poor quality embryos and potentially a non-receptive uterine environment.  The transfer of genetically and morphologically normal embryos into a non-receptive uterine environment will likely not achieve a pregnancy.  Generally the suitability of the uterine environment is measured by ultrasound.  However such measurement is not able to provide full information on how the uterus has developed under the influence of hormone stimulation drugs used routinely in an IVF treatment cycle.

Genea has extensive experience with vitrification technology having been the first clinic to introduce the procedure into routine clinical practise in Australia, January 2006.  Subsequently the technology has been performed routinely in all Genea laboratories following IVF, ICSI and PGD treatment cycles.  More than 1000 babies have now been born after vitrification at Genea.  

The vitrification procedure used in this study will be applied to embryos cultured at the Genea Kent Street laboratory for 5 days (blastocyst stage).   

By vitrifying and NOT TRANSFERRING embryos in routine IVF cycle fresh, we wish to see if this will:
increase the chance of fetal heart pregnancy and increase the chance of a live born baby</summary>
