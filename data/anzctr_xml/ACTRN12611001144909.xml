  <interventions>
    <interventions>The new surgery protocol is characterized as having a small cut on the neck of pterygium body for conjunctiva separation before the head of pterygium is taken down, removing the head of pterygium by using a forceps, and loosening the corneal epithelia by local anesthesia (1-2 drops of Oxybuprocaine Hydrochloride Eye Drops, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The averaged surgical time under the new protocol was approximately 8 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional removal method firstly cuts down the head of pterygium before seperating the conjunctiva from underlying degenerated Tenons layer. In addition, the head of ptergium is cut down with scalpel instead of being pulled with a forceps. The averaged surgical duration under conventional protocol was approximately 15 minutes.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Totally 20 primary pterygium cases were engaged to have the pterygium removed with the improved removal surgery. The new surgery protocol is characterized as having a small cut on the neck of pterygium body for conjunctiva separation before the head of pterygium is taken down, removing the head of pterygium by using a forceps, and loosening the corneal epithelia by local anesthesia. The advantages of the new surgery include shortened surgery time, reduced pain score, and shortened corneal wound healing.</summary>
