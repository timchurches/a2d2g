  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>- Confirmed diagnosis of dysferlinopathy proven by a) two (predicted) pathogenic dysferlin
        mutations, b) one (predicted) pathogenic dysferlin mutation and absent dysferlin protein on
        muscle immunoblot, or c) one (predicted) pathogenic dysferlin mutation and dysferlin
        protein level =20% of normal level determined by blood monocyte testing. Mutations will be
        checked for pathogenicity via the UMD bioinformatics tools.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The "Clinical Outcome Study for Dysferlinopathy" is being performed in centres in Europe (UK-
      Newcastle; Spain- Barcelona, Sevilla; Germany- Berlin, Munich; Italy- Padova; France- Paris,
      Marseille), USA (Charlotte, NC; Columbus, OH; Washington, DC; St.Louis, MO, Stanford CA),
      Japan (Tokyo) and Australia (Sydney). Oversight and funding for this study is being provided
      by the Jain Foundation, a non-profit foundation dedicated to finding therapies for
      dysferlinopathies(LGMD2b/Miyoshi). The aim of this "Clinical Outcome Study" is to determine
      the clinical outcome measures required for future clinical trials, characterize the disease
      progression of dysferlinopathy and collect biological samples for the identification of
      disease markers that are needed to non-invasively monitor the disease during clinical trials.
      Without this information, effective clinical trials cannot be performed.

      This study is recruiting a large number of genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy patients
      aged 10 years or older, who are ambulant or non-ambulant. Participants will be assessed at 6
      visits over 3 years via medical, physiotherapy, and MRI/MRS assessments, as well as standard
      blood tests. Optionally, the participants can donate blood samples and a skin sample for use
      in the identification of disease markers and other approved research.</summary>
