    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cetuximab
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: other - Radiotherapy

Experimental: Single arm - Chemoradiation (Cetuximab, Carboplatin and Radiotherapy)


Treatment: drugs: Cetuximab
Patients will receive weekly intravenous cetuximab (initial dose 400mg/m2 in the week prior to commencing radiotherapy, then weekly 250mg/m2)for the duration of the radiotherapy

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Weekly intravenous carboplatin (AUC 2) for the duration of the RT

Treatment: other: Radiotherapy
The radiotherapy schedule will be the "infield boost" (IFB) regimen, that is 66 Gy in 35 fractions over 5 weeks: daily for 3 weeks, then twice daily for 2 weeks (or 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks for a specific subgroup of patients where IFB is not recommended).

          -  Stage III or IV, excluding T1N1, and metastatic disease (to be confirmed by a chest
             CT, and abdominal CT or ultrasound scan if patients with abnormal liver function tests

             following reasons:

               -  Clinically significant sensori-neural hearing impairment (audiometric
                  abnormalities without corresponding clinical deafness will not be regarded as a
                  contraindication to cisplatin)

               -  Severe tinnitus

               -  Renal impairment (GFR &lt; 60ml/min)

               -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 2

               -  Inability to tolerate intravenous hydration eg due to cardiac disease

               -  Co-morbidities (based on clinical judgement by the investigator) associated with
                  ECOG PS 2 that in the view of the investigator would preclude the safe
                  administration of cisplatin

          -  Performance status ECOG 0, 1 or 2.

          -  Adequate haematological, renal and hepatic functions as defined by:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC, segmented cells (segs) + bands)&gt;= 1.5 x 109/L

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Distant metastases, i.e., any metastatic disease below the clavicles. Patients with
             lung nodules &gt;10mm will be excluded unless non-malignancy aetiology is established.
             Patients with lesions 5-10mm can be included if a FDG-PET scan is negative and the
             investigator considers on clinical grounds that metastasis is unlikely. Patients with
             lesions &lt; 5mm can be included if the investigator considers on clinical grounds that
             metastases are unlikely. Patients with multiple lung nodules should not be included
             unless there is a strong case that these do not represent metastases, e.g., stable on
             imaging for over 12 months, non-malignant aetiology apparent. The level of clinical
             suspicion may be influenced by clinical stage, e.g., N3 disease, low neck nodes. In
             general if there is any doubt patients should be excluded.

          -  Previous radical RT to the head &amp; neck region, excluding superficial RT for a
             non-melanomatous skin cancer.

          -  Patients with prior cancers, except: those diagnosed &gt; 5 years ago with no evidence of
             disease recurrence and clinical expectation of recurrence of less than 5%; or
             successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer; or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Significant intercurrent illness that will interfere with the chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy such as HIV infection, cardiac failure, pulmonary compromise, active
             infection

          -  Any history of myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, or unstable angina
             within the last 6 months

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Weight loss greater than 20 % of usual body weight in the 3 months preceding trial
             entry

          -  High risk for poor compliance with therapy or follow up as assessed by the
             investigator

          -  Prior radiation to greater than 30% of the bone marrow

          -  Prior systemic chemotherapy for cancer

          -  Refusal by male or female patients, to use appropriate contraception during the study
             and for 3 months afterwards

          -  Any condition or circumstance which might prevent the patient being able to give valid
             informed consent, or from completing participation in the study</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>This is a Phase II study of cetuximab, carboplatin and radiotherapy (RT) in patients with
      Locally Advanced Head and Neck Carcinomas (LAHNC) who are unfit for cisplatin.
