  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients with steatohepatitis will divided into  two groups (40 patients each):
Arm 1 (Group One). Ingestion of phosphatidylcholine (PC) chaperone formulation containing 450 mg of PC.
Arm 2. Ingestion of lycopene (7mg) fused with phosphatidylcholine (PC) chaperone (450 mg of PC).
Both formulations will be taken orally twice a day after meals during 6 month period. 
Adherence to the protocol will be verified by questioning the patients and laboratory tests (measurements of phosphatidylcholine and/or lycopene metabolites in blood). </interventions>
    <comparator>Intake of phosphatidylcholine chaperone formulation without lycopene will serve as a comparator for the lycopene PC-chaperone study group.</comparator>

At the end of the recruitment period each patients will be allocated to the one of the group study using computerized simple randomization model. Patients from the first arm of the study will receive a phosphatidylcholine (PC) chaperon alone, while patients from the second arm of the study will be given PC-chaperone fused with lycopene.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was determined based on preliminary results obtained in a pilot clinical trial. Sample size was calculated based on the standard deviation values. Major statistical requirement were as follows: significance of probability in one-tailed test was taken as 2.5%; the statistical power level was chosen as 90%. Twenty five patients are required for each arm of the study. The enrollment goal was set at 40 patients per group due to possible drop-outs. Values for standard deviation in the previously conducted pilot clinical trial were as follows: control group (n=10, ALT - 5.5 U/l, AST - 3,7 U/l). nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (n=10, ALT- 12.5 U/l, AST - 7,3 U/l).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Steatohepatitis treatment is a challenging task in the modern internal medicine.  Diet, exercise and antiglycemic drugs are among pharmacological options in the NASH treatment. There is a recent piece of evidence that vitamin and possibly other antioxidants therapy may attenuate steatohepatitis development. That is why use of antioxidants, including lycopene, may represent a novel strategy in management of steatohepatitis. We hypothesize that ingestion of highly bio-available   lycopene chaperoned with phosphatidylcholine may improve hepatic functions and inflammatory status in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.
