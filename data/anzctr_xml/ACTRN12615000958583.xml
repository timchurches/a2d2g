  <interventions>
    <interventions>Antibiotic: Amoxycillin clavulanic acid (500/125mg), 1 tablet twice a day for 90 days.

Adherence: Return of unused medication or empty bottles

MRI scans: Two lumbar spine MRI scans will be performed. The first is a screening MRI to determine the presence of lumbar disc herniation and the second is a followup MRI at 12 months. Both MRIs will allow the presence of modic changes to be examined. The MRI scans will performed at Melbourne-based imaging clinics by experienced radiographers/MRI specialists. Participants will be positioned in supine on a plinth which will retract into a cylindrical MRI scanner. The scans will take approximately 40 mins each. </interventions>

Cost questionnaires
The cost questionnaires will include information on all health care utilization due to chronic low back pain, such as the number and type of medical and allied health visits, imaging usage, amount and type of medication (using The Medication Quantification Scale), other care/assistance (ie home-care assistance), and hours of absenteeism from paid and unpaid work. Unit costs of resources will be obtained from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme's manual of costs. The Short form Health and Labour questionnaire, a validated questionnaire which examines work absenteeism in relation to injury or sickness, will allow data on absenteeism from paid work, production losses without absenteeism from paid work and hindrance in the performance of paid and unpaid work to be collected.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Summary statistics comparing randomized arms at baseline will be tabulated. Intention to treat analyses of primary and secondary continuous outcomes will be performed by linear regression adjusting for the baseline of the outcome variable where relevant. Logistic regression will be performed for binary outcomes. Adjustment for imbalanced baseline factors, including the presence of symptoms other than low back pain, will be performed as supplementary analyses. Analyses of treatment efficacy will be done by blinding individuals at the time of any protocol deviation and developing a model for the probability of deviation, followed by weighted analyses using only the uncensored individuals where the weights are the inverse probability of censoring. This produces estimates of treatment effect as if there was full compliance with the protocol in this RCT and is far preferable to per-protocol analyses based on (unweighted) observed compliance. This RCT is well-placed to model non-compliance with frequent monitoring for adverse events and resultant prognostic information

Sample size for primary outcome measure: With 85 patients in each arm of the trial there will be 90% power to detect a difference of 0.50 standard deviations in our primary outcome measure of pain. For the Low Back Pain rating scale, and assuming a between-person SD of 3.02, a difference of 1.5 units can be detected with 90% power. A clinically significant difference in pain intensity is regarded as being 2 to 3 units. For the secondary aim of assessing whether the effect of antibiotics is dependent on the presence of Modic changes, the relevant power calculation is that for detecting an interaction between antibiotic intervention and Modic status. We anticipate half the patients will demonstrate Modic changes at baseline, and assuming a between person SD of 3.0 in LBP rating scale 2, 85 patients per randomised arm will have 80% power to detect an interaction effect of size 2.6, meaning that the effect of antibiotics in patients with Modic changes is 2.6 units higher than inpatients without Modic changes. The value of 2.6 was observed in Albert et al and therefore there is sufficient power to detect a large antibiotic effect in the Modic changes subgroup compared to little effect if any in other patients. If there is a significant interaction effect between antibiotic effect and Modic changes, this will provide evidence to support the hypothesis that infection is important in the underlying pathogenesis in this subgroup of patients with pain. All analyses will adjust for the baseline value of the relevant outcome variable and this will further increase the power by an amount depending on the size of the baseline to followup correlation in the outcome.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain is a major public health problem in Australia, ranking 2nd only to cancer as the leading cause of disability.

While its prevalence is high, with 80% of Australians experiencing low back pain during their lifetime, effective treatments are limited.

In 2013 a study was published which showed that antibiotics were effective in treating a specific type of low back pain involving injury to the disc and oedema of the bone. 

The trial was based on the hypothesis that following a disc injury (experienced as acute back pain) a secondary
infection develops in the disc which leads to a chronic, disabling condition.

There has been both immense interest and controversy regarding this trial. While leading, international surgeons suggest that it should be nominated for a Nobel prize, others have called for further research.

To date the results of the trial have not been translated into clinical practice, as there are unanswered questions regarding the approach. 

The specific group of patients who need to be targeted is unclear, the effectiveness of this treatment in conjunction with standard care is unknown, and the costs and associated resistance to the antibiotic therapy has not been investigated.

We aim to perform a clinical trial to investigate the effectiveness of antibiotic treatment in a broader group of individuals with chronic low back pain and a disc injury, to determine whether specific Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) changes predict response to this approach, and to
examine the cost-effectiveness and antibiotic resistance of this therapy.

If antibiotics are found to be a cost-effective and safe treatment for some patients with chronic low back pain, this will provide a novel approach for the prevention of long term pain and disability in these individuals.</summary>
