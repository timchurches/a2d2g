  <interventions>
    <interventions>One session virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET).

During VRET, participants will be asked to wear a virtual reality headset (e..g, Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear VR) and view virtual environments that depict feared situations including needles, dentists, blood, wounds, injections and injury in a graded order (from least anxiety-provoking to most anxiety-provoking). Duration of VRET session is approximately 90 minutes, but can range up to 120 minutes. Virtual environments depict the following situations: medical office, dentist office, blood collection centre, nurses's office for wound dressing, and nurse's office for injections. Environments are graded as easy, medium or hard, and the participant can select either to observe another patient in the situation, or take the 1st person perspective of the patient.. The order is tailored to the specific concerns of the participant, who will choose the order in which the scenarios are delivered after the experimenter has explained the scenarios to them. Typically, the participant would be required to start at the easy step, and then move to the medium step when either their anxiety levels have reduced, or they are ready, and finally the hard step.. Each scenario lasts around 3-5 minutes, and the participant can stay in the scenario for as long as they choose, and/or repeat the scenario if they wish.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This RCT will evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a one-session Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy intervention targeting fears of blood, injection and injury, by comparing one-session of VRET with a waiting list control group (WLC).  This study will also explore individual difference factors that predict better response to VRET, the mediators of response to VRET as well as the effect of the intervention on comorbid symptoms (e.g., depression), cognitions and emotions. </summary>
