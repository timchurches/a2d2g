          -  Diagnosis of IIM based on the Bohan and Peter classification criteria:

             i) Subjects with dermatomyositis (DM) must also have a confirmed myositis-associated
             rash (Gottron's papules or a heliotrope rash preferably confirmed by skin biopsy) or a
             prior muscle biopsy diagnostic for IIM or a positive test for at least one identified
             myositis-associated autoantibody; ii) Subjects with IIM other than DM (PM, autoimmune
             necrotizing myopathy, myositis associated with other autoimmune connective diseases
             (overlap myositis), or juvenile myositis with age = 18 years) must also have a prior
             muscle biopsy diagnostic for IIM or a positive test for at least one identified
             myositis-associated autoantibody

          -  Demonstrable muscle weakness measured by the MMT-8 of = 135 units and any 3 of the
             following: i) MMT-8 = 125 units; ii) Physician's global assessment (PGA) visual analog
             scale (VAS) =2 cm; iii) Subject's global assessment (SGA) VAS =2 cm; iv) HAQ-DI = 0.5;
             v) One or more muscle enzyme (CK, aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), ALT) = 1.3 times upper limit of normal (ULN); vi) MDAAT
             Extramuscular Global Activity VAS =2 cm

          -  Demonstration of currently active IIM will be determined by an adjudication committee
             unless the subject has any one of the following: i) an active myositis-associated rash
             (Gottron's papules or heliotrope rash), or ii) a recent (within 1 month prior to
             signing informed consent) biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or electromyogram
             (EMG) demonstrating active disease, or iii) an elevated CK &gt; 5 times the upper limit
             of normal

          -  Active disease despite prior treatment with corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or
             biologics as determined by the investigator

          -  The subject must be on background standard treatment for IIM. The standard treatments
             that are allowed as background treatment for IIM includes: i) Corticosteroids alone,
             or ii) One of the following immunosuppressants: methotrexate, azathioprine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or cyclosporine (combinations of these treatments
             are not allowed), or iii) A combination of corticosteroids and one of the above
             immunosuppressants. The subject must have been on the same medication(s) for IIM for
             12 weeks prior to randomization and the dose must have been stable for 4 weeks prior
             to randomization.</inclusivecriteria>

             last 5 years prior to screening (except for a documented history of cured
