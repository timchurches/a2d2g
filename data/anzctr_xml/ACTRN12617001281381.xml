    <scientifictitle>Retinal Vein Occlusion Study: Branch vs Hemicentral. A study to show whether hemi-central retinal vein occlusions (hemi-CRVO) resolve quicker and require less treatment with anti-VEGF injections by developing more haemodynamically efficient collateral circulation much earlier than branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVO).</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCT-A) will be used to examine the vascular changes that occur at the sites of collateralisation in participants with a hemi-CRVO or a BRVO that has been treated using the standard conventional anti-VEGF treatments. OCT-A is a new, non-invasive imaging modality that is used to evaluate the retinal circulation. We will use the OCT-A images as well as the Fluorescein angiogram images (FA) taken from the participants medical records to determine the speed of development and the type of collateral circulation that develops. This study has only one visit, that will occur at least 3 months after the participant has been free of macula oedema from their conventional treatment. The number of anti-VEGF treatments that the participants have received will be compared to the development of the collateral vessels between the two groups. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine how effective the blood vessels (collateral vessels)  are that develop around the area where the blockage (occlusion) occurred in patients who have had treatment for a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or a hemicentral retinal vein occlusion (Hemi-CRVO).  The study visit will take place once the patient has been stable for 3 months requiring no anti-VEGF treatment for macula oedema. The  duration and number of anti-VEGF treatments that participants have  received during their treatment will be recorded.  Fluorescein angiography (FA)  and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images taken during the treatment will be used to determine how efficient the collateral circulation is that develops. We will also use a new imaging technique called optical coherence angiography (OCT-A) to examine the efficiency retinal circulation at the collateral sites. OCT-A is a non invasive imaging technique and takes about 45 minutes to complete. </summary>
