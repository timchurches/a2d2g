    <studytitle>Satiating effects of different carbohydrate foods within a mixed meal </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A randomised repeated measures design in which healthy subjects will consume three different carbohydrate staples (rice, potato, pasta) in random order, each with the same meat and vegetable complement (Bolognese-type sauce), on different days, and score their satiety using a visual analogue scale for three hours after each meal in order to assess the ability of the scale to discriminate between the meals on the basis of appetite.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dietary intervention in which participants consume about 250 g of different staples (potato, rice, pasta), in three different meals, in which each of the staples is consumed with the same meat and vegetable sauce. The meals will be consumed at midday, each on a different day. Washout period between treatments was 24 h.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine whether differences in satiation due to the consumption of different carbohydrate staples, each in a separate mixed meal, will have effects on satiety that are large enough for satiety data to be used in a resource that is being developed as an aid to healthier food choices in diabetes management. Subjects will consume each of the staples within a mixed meal, on different days, and score their satiety using a widely used visual analogue scale, for three hours after consuming each meal. </summary>
