  <interventions>
    <interventions>The present study aims to examine the potential of Low Intensity Laser Therapy (LILT) to reduce unresolved pain experienced by clients who are receiving home nursing care for chronic wounds. The two treatment groups will receive, in addition to best practice wound pain management, one of two LILT treatment options  a Hand Held Laser device, or the Scanning Laser for up to six weeks or less if problem resolved. The Scanning Laser is a free standing Scanning Laser emitting 2 wavelengths of 655nm visible red light with a power output of 50mW and 810nm infra red laser energy, with a power output of 500mW. The Hand Held Laser is a 12 diode hand held cluster laser consisting of 4 X 655nm visible red light with a power output of 5mW and 4X 655nm visible red light at 40mW power and 4X 785nm infra red laser energy at 55mW power. The LILT group will receive three LILT sessions per week. The duration of each session depends on the type of wound and Laser device.</interventions>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1-The client has a chronic wound on entire leg (of a maximum size of 10cms in diameter and depth of 2cm) which may be of a diabetic origin, pressure ulcer, venous, arterial and mixed aetiology ulcers
2.The wound is older than six weeks from its inception.
3.Wound healing is by secondary intention;  Wound healing is delayed and occurs by a process of granulation, contraction and epithelialisation (Carville, 2001)

Unresolved Pain
The client reports unresolved pain:

4.	The client has pain associated with a chronic wound that has not responded to standard pain management.
4.1. Pain is measured on a pain scale of 0-10 with 0 indicating the absence of pain and 10 indicating the worst pain the client can imagine. Clients are eligible if they report pain as being 1 or more on this scale.
4.2. Pain is to be evaluated as unresolved if any level of pain (1 or greater on the pain scale) persists after they have received pain management.
5.  The pain must be located within the wound (plus or minus pain in areas other than the wound i.e. the leg or associated with the wound i.e. when walking the wound is painful). 
6. The pain is experienced at times other than during dressing changes.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.	The client has been diagnosed with and/or is receiving treatment for a malignancy
2.	The clients health professional or appropriate wound specialist does not support the inclusion of the client in the Randomised Control Trial.
3.	Client is on a fee for service program inappropriate for inclusion in the study.
4.	The client has any planned absences over the coming three months.
      5.   Client does not agree to attend the Care and Assessment Centre three times weekly (two times weekly for control group) for six weeks and for 2 weekly review at 8, 10 and 12 weeks.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low Intensity Laser Therapy (LILT) is compressed laser light that is beamed over a specific area of the body; the laser light making its way through the surface of the skin with no heating effect or damage to the skin. Laser light directs the light energy to help promote natural healing and pain relief. Thus, the present study aims to examine the potential of Low Intensity Laser Therapy (LILT) as a means of reducing pain experienced by clients who have not had symptom relief using standard treatment.  Specifically, the aim of the investigation is to examine and explore the effectiveness of LILT treatment on chronic wound pain experienced by clients receiving care for chronic wounds.</summary>
