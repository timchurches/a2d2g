  <interventions>
    <interventions>Combined natural formula in the form of soft gelatin capsules combining 750 mg of lyophilized Royal Jelly with the standardized extracts of Ginkgo biloba 120 mg and Panax ginseng 150 mg per capsule.
The dose is 1 capsule taken daily for 4 weeks.
Adherence to the dose is monitored by calculating the number remained in the container from the 35 capsules.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of serious adverse effects.
The possible adverse events could be any allergic reaction (skin rash, allergic rhinitis, asthmatic attacks or anaphylaxis), headache, flushing,  irritability)
The case report form contains a questionnaire for possible drug reactions to remind investigators and patients to report if any.
Patients were also asked to revisit the same clinic as soon as possible to report any adverse event or every 2 weeks if there are no events.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Male or female patients, between 50 and 80 years old, who were complaining of memory impairment or forgetfulness and satisfying the clinical criteria of MCI in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) which included: memory complaint, normal activities of daily living, abnormal memory for age and no documented dementia.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>established diagnosis or current treatment for dementia with any drug, any herbal or nutritional supplements except patient with only mild cognitive impairment who stopped treatment for at least one month before enrollment; a baseline MMSE score below 21 or more than 27; or a recent history or current treatment for any specific acquired acute brain injury such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), acute onset stroke, or other acute medical conditions. Patients with a history or current treatment for major depressive or psychotic illnesses as well as critically ill patients or those with severe anemia or vital organ dysfunction hepatic, renal or cardiac failure were also excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size (minimum 26 for each group) was calculated to detect a mean difference of 2 points change from baseline MMSE score between both treatment groups with estimated group standard deviations of 2.5 and 2.5 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05, and 80% power, using a two-sided two-sample t-test. 

The MMSE scorings at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment in both groups were compared using the paired sample t test. 
The mean changes in MMSE from baseline after 4 weeks treatment were compared between both treatment groups using the student t test for independent samples as well as a General Linear Model (ANCOVA) adjusting for the effect of age as a covariate and educational levels as a nested factor within treatment groups. 
The effects of sex as an independent variable on the mean change in MMSE from baseline after 4 weeks treatment was tested by one way ANOVA.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sixty six subjects presenting with forgetfulness and satisfying the DSM-IV clinical criteria of MCI were randomly divided into an experimental group treated with Memo 1 capsule before breakfast daily for 4 weeks and a control group who took placebo. Mean difference of MMSE score from baseline and reported adverse effects were compared between both groups. </summary>
