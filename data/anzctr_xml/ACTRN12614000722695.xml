  <interventions>
    <interventions>120 subjects were randomized into two groups. Group A received ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg +  Drospirenone 3mg  (EE+DRSP; n=60) and Group B received ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg+Chlormadinone acetate 2 mg (EE+CMA; n=60). In Group A, one patient at 6 months, two patients at 12 months discontinued the treatment.  At 24 months one patient was lost to follow up and 56 subjects completed the study. In Group B, two patients at 6 months, two patients at 12 months and three patients at 24 months discontinued the treatment. One patient at 12 months, two patients at 24 months were lost to follow up and 50 subjects completed the study. Thus analyses were performed for 56 subjects in group A and 50 subjects in Group B.All subjects were advised to take the oral tablets once daily and with appropriate instructions cyclically ( 21 pill intake days followed by 7 pill free days) for 24 months. Oral tablet return was checked every 3 months to monitor adherence. Clinical, hormonal and biochemical parameters were compared at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group A received ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg +  Drospirenone 3mg and Group B received ethinyl estradiol 0.03 mg+Chlormadinone acetate 2 mg. The effects of two oral contraceptive pills were compared. Group A is considered to be the comparator treatment</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> free androgen index (FAI) 
Free androjen index (FAI) was calculated by the formula,
 FAI = (Total testesterone nmol/L) / sex hormone-binding globulin  nmol/L) x 100.
total testesterone and sex hormone-binding globulin levels  were determined by serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day 3 of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin resistance, defined by the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), which was calculated using the following equation: HOMA-IR = fasting insulin (microU/L) x fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5
fasting insulin and glucose levels  were determined by serum assay.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day 3 of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body mass index
The body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) / height square (m2).</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day 3 of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>waist/hip ratio (WHR)
Waist and hip circumferences were measured and waist/hip ratio (WHR) was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day 3 of the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>The subjects took no medications (oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, antiandrogens, insulin sensitizers, ovulation induction agents, or antiobesity drugs) that could affect the biochemical profile and metabolic variables for at least 6 months before entering the study. The exclusion criteria included Cushings syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, virilizing tumors, glucose intolerence or diabetes mellitus, hepatic dysfunction, renal dysfunction, hypertension and any contraindications for the use of combined oral contraceptives.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Drospirenone containing combined oral contraceptive (COC) is found to have more favorable effects on lipid profiles, high sensitive C reactive protein levels, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism when compared with the chlormadione acetate containing COC and appears to be more beneficial for the long term cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of PCOS.</summary>
