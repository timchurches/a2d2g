  <interventions>
    <interventions>Candies containing curcumin (500mg) of a proprietary blend of curcumin (BCM-95 'Registered Trademark') will be consumed twice daily for 8 weeks by children presenting with significant attentional problems. Adherence to supplementation intake will be monitored through pill return and count. In this crossover trial, there is no washout period between treatment arms.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be randomly allocated into placebo and treatment groups. These groups are named group 1 and group 2 and the primary investigator and participants will be unaware of which treatment these groups represent. Each participant will be allocated a participant number (1 to 60) based on the order of inclusion in the study. A computer-generated software will randomly assign the numbers 1 to 60 into either group 1 or 2.</concealment>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In this crossover study, children will be given an opportunity to take both curcumin and placebo. This ensures we have a sample size of 60 in each group. With a predicted moderate effect size of 0.5, this study is sufficiently powered to detect group differences. 

Pre and post analyses will be conducted to determine changes in the following:
1. Scores determined from the administration of the Connors Continuous Performance Test
2. Attention and impulsivity scores (ADHD rating scale)
3. Mood and behavioural scores (SDQ and RCADS questionnaires)

Comparisons will be made between the periods when participants were taking a placebo versus periods on curcumin to determine if there are any significant differences in the above measures. 

These analyses will be conducted via a repeated measures analysis of variance via SPSS</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study assessing the therapeutic effects of curcumin in 60 youth suffering from attentional problems. Each participant receives both treatments (8 weeks of curcumin and placebo) and randomisation is used to determine the order in which the participant receives each treatment,( i.e. curcumin followed by placebo, or placebo followed by curcumin). The curcumin dosage is 500mg of BCM-95 'Registered Trademark' twice daily. Changes in attentional symptoms will be assessed via a computerised test for attention and the completion of several questionnaires.</summary>
