  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are randomised to one of two procedures for hernia repair: 1) Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty using N-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate for mesh fixing or 2) Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty using nonabsorbable sutures for mesh fixing.

The use of this adhesive is only in the fixation of the mesh. The mesh is fixed using a drop of the N-Butyl-2-cyanoacrylate adhesive in each location where normally a stitch would be placed. </interventions>
    <comparator>The Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair, which is an example of hernioplasty and is currently one of the most popular open inguinal hernia repair techniques. 

Opening of the deep fascia of the thigh and exposure of the femoral canal to check for a femoral hernia. Division of the external oblique aponeurosis from the external ring laterally for up to 5 cm, safeguarding the ilioinguinal nerve.

Mobilization of the superior (safeguarding the iliohypogastric nerve) and inferior flaps of the external oblique aponeurosis to expose the underlying structures. Mobilization of the spermatic cord, along with the cremaster, including the ilioinguinal nerve, the genitofemoral nerve, and the spermatic vessels, opening of the coverings of the spermatic cord and identification and isolation of the hernia sac.
Inversion, division, resection, or ligation of the sac, as indicated; depending on the type of hernia and hernia sac. Placement and fixation of mesh. we set the prosthesis to the inguinal ligament with nonabsorbable suture, also place it around the spermatic cord creating a reinforcement to the internal inguinal ring.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis using SPSS 7.5-Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Chi-2 and Fisher exact test was used for qualitative variables expressed as frequencies and Student t test for quantitative variables expressed as mean and standard deviation, after checking the normal distribution. Statistical significance was set at p &lt;0.05.

We estimate the sample size on the basis of observations made previously by other researchers, who found differences between 1-3 points on the VAS scale in acute pain, and using a categorical variable (yes/no) chronic pain (pain 6 months after surgery) found a rate of 10% in suture group and 0 % adhesive group.

Accepting an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, 70 subjects in the first group and 70 are set out in the second to detect a difference equal to or greater than 1 unit on the VAS pain scale. It is assumed that the common standard deviation of 2 units. It has been estimated rate of loss to follow up of 10%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Randomized Clinical Trial, in which they have included patients with unilateral inguinal hernia, elective surgery, over 18 years and agreed to be included.
Patients were randomized to one of two treatment groups: Mesh fixation with nonabsorbable sutures or fixation with n- butyl-2 - cyanoacrylate. They have been collected from the patient 's own variables and associated with the intervention.
The main objective is to assess the impact on acute pain, secondary objectives are to assess chronic pain and the incidence of hernia recurrence. Pain was assessed using the visual analog scale at each patient visit. Recurrent hernia has been evaluated by physical examination in consultation, in case of doubt has been requested inguinal ultrasound.

We observed lower incidence of acute pain in the group of mesh fixation with cyanoacrylate (p&lt;0.05). There were no differences in the development of chronic pain or the incidence of hernia recurrence.
