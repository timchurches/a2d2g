  <interventions>
    <interventions>Presentation of CVD risk assessment results as either 5-year absolute risk of a heart attack/stroke or heart age, in one of three visual formats (text only, text + bar graph, text + line graph showing projected risk over age):
Arm 1: percentage, text
Arm 2: percentage, text and bar graph
Arm 3: percentage, text and projected risk graph
Arm 4: heart age, text
Arm 5: heart age, text and bar graph
Arm 6: heart age, text and projected risk graph

The CVD risk assessment is conducted via computer, based on the 5-year Framingham risk equation used in Australian CVD prevention guidelines. The equation uses age, gender, current smoking/diabetes status, systolic blood pressure and total/HDL cholesterol ratio values to estimate the probability of a CVD event (e.g. heart attack or stroke) over the next 5 years. The assessment is based on participant responses for each risk factor via an online survey, and/or Australian averages for their age/gender if they indicate that they do not know their risk factor values. 

The presentation formats are based on the following:

Percentage: the current absolute risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years

Heart age: the age at which a person of the same gender with 'ideal' risk factors (non-smoker, non-diabetic, systolic blood pressure equal to 120 mmHg, total/HDL cholesterol ratio equal to 4) would reach the current absolute risk result 

Text: a brief description of the current and 'ideal' result, and how the current result could be improved if applicable
Percentage example: Your risk of a cardiovascular event in the next 5 years is 11%. If you stopped smoking and had lower levels of cholesterol and blood pressure, your risk would be 3%. You can reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol by quitting smoking, improving your diet and increasing physical activity.
Heart age example: Your heart age is 74, 24 years older than you. If you stopped smoking and had lower levels of cholesterol and blood pressure, your heart age would be 50, the same as your current age. You can reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol by quitting smoking, improving your diet and increasing physical activity.

Bar graph: displays the current result and the 'ideal' result as separate bars on the same graph

Projected risk graph: displays the current result and the 'ideal' result as separate lines on the same graph, showing how both will increase with age up to 74 years (the maximum age in the Framingham risk model)</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The a priori sample size calculation indicated that 85 participants per group, totalling 510 participants, would provide 90% power to detect a moderate effect size of d=0.5 (standardised difference) in the primary outcome of intention to change lifestyle, assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05. We aimed to recruit 20% more cases to account for potential dropout.                                                                                                                                              
The Mann-Whitney test (non-parametric) was used to compare groups across continuous outcomes, and the Fisher's exact test was applied to categorical outcomes. We further explored the dependence of the results on participants calculated heart age result (younger/same versus older than current age) by testing an interaction using linear and multinomial models for continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. The significance level for all hypothesis tests was set at 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Who is it for?
Participants were eligible to join this study if they were aged between 45-64 years and not already known to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Study details:
Participants completed an online CVD risk assessment and were randomly (by chance) allocated to receive their results as either their 'heart age' or the equivalent percentage risk of a heart attack or stroke over the next 5 years, using three different visual formats. The researchers investigated how different ways of explaining CVD risk affected a range of psychological and behavioural outcomes, including intention to change lifestyle, risk perceptions, and behaviour change after 2 weeks.</summary>
