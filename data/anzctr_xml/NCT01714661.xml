          -  Signed informed consent, indicating that the subject understands the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study, before the initiation of any study specific

             in the study.

          -  Resides in a stable living situation, according to the investigator's judgment, and
             must have an identified informant who should be consistent throughout the study. If
             possible, the informant should accompany the subject or be available for in person
             ratings at the screening, baseline (Day 1), and final study visits. In person
             informant ratings on all relevant study visits are preferred whenever possible.
             However, if the informant is not available for in person ratings, telephone interview
             is acceptable. The informant must be available for a telephone interview throughout
             the study at all visits. As long as both the informant visit and subject visit are
             within the study visit windows, it is not necessary that they occur on the same day.
             The informant must interact with the subject at least 2 times a week.

          -  Diagnosis of Schizophrenia of at least 3 years duration. This diagnosis can be
             established utilizing the SCID-I, direct clinical assessments, family, informants, and
             confirmation of diagnosis from clinical sources. These may include medical records,
             confirmation of diagnosis by treating clinician through telephone contact, or written
             confirmation from treating clinic. If the listed sources are not available, other
             sources of diagnostic confirmation may also be acceptable after discussion with the
             medical monitor.

          -  Treated with atypical antipsychotic drug (in any approved dosage form) other than
             Clozapine at a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening and be clinically
             stable; the subject must remain clinically stable (in the opinion of the principal
             investigator) through randomization. The use of up to 2 atypical antipsychotic drugs
             is permitted, as long as in the opinion of the investigator, the second medication is
             not required to control treatment-resistant or intractable psychotic symptoms. No
             subject will be washed off antipsychotic therapy to become eligible for this study.

             Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Conceptual Disorganization item score = 4; and a BPRS
