  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are following patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours in the Intensive Care Unit. We check for the presence of Delirium during their ICU admission by administering the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). CAM-ICU is a validated and widely used instrument for diagnosing delirium with yes/no questions administered to non-speaking, mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Based on this assessment, we allocate patients into the delirium positive and the delirium negative group. Positive delirium is diagnosed if patients have following present: 1) Acute onset and fluctuating course of Mental State; 2) Inattention; and either 3) Altered Consciousness, or 4) Disorganised Thinking. Both delirium positive and delirium negative groups are then followed up for 12 months. .  </interventions>
    <comparator>We are looking at one cohort of mechanically ventilated patients. We are dividing these patients into two groups after testing for a presence of delirium. We are then comparing cognition and psychosocial outcomes of these two groups: delirium positive and  delirium negative group of patients.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods> We calculated that, at a type-I error rate of 5% (alpha 0.05), we could achieve an 80% power to find the clinically significant difference of 2 points with 80% power if we included minimum of 81 patients in each group (delirious/not delirious). To allow for potential drop-outs following recruitment, we plan to enrol 200 patients. 
All statistical analysis will be done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Research Engine, Version IBM SPSS Statistics (2015). We plan to employ Students t-test to compare mean outcomes in each group when the assumption of a normal underlying distribution can be justified, and the Mann-Whitney U-test Test to compare medians when this assumption fails. We will compare differences in proportionate outcomes using Chi-square analysis. For all of these methods, we will conclude there is a statistically significant difference between groups when the test statistic corresponds to a P-value &lt; 0.05. Results will be presented as differences between groups +/- 95% confidence intervals.  We will also consider both analysis of covariance (parametric) or Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric) testing as appropriate and will investigate the influence of potential confounders by logistic or multiple regression techniques as appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to evaluate the hypothesis that an experience of delirium during mechanical ventilation in the ICU impacts negatively on patients cognitive and psychosocial outcomes.
This is an observational, prospective study that is conducted in two Intensive Care Units in Australia: The Canberra Hospital in the Australian Capital Territory; and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, New South Wales. The study aims to recruit 162 patients who have been mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, and who meet the studys inclusion/exclusion criteria. Outcome assessments will be recorded at ICU discharge, and at six and 12 months after ICU discharge. We aim to evaluate the hypothesis that an experience of delirium during mechanical ventilation in the ICU impacts negatively on patients cognitive and psychosocial outcomes.
