      <outcome>- Incidence of local or systemic, moderate or severe adverse effects possibly related to treatment.
On each visit, the following assessments will be performed:
1. The Best Corrected LogMAR Visual acuity using ETDRS charts will be performed by masked certified BCVA examiner. Any vision change related adverse events (AE) or complications will be accessed and recorded.
2. IOP (applanation). This will detect the IOP increase. IOP increase by 5 mm Hg compare to the baseline or at any time IOP increase over 22 mm HG will be considered as an AE.
3. Cataract grading using Age-Related Eye Disease Study photographic standards. Cataract increases &gt;=2 compare to the baseline will be considered as AE.
4.Ophthalmic examinations including grading of anterior and posterior chamber cells and flare will be performed. This will monitor any inflammation, retinal detachment and other ocular AEs.
5.Vital signs including blood pressure, pause will be monitored and recorded.
6. Other AEs including any ocular and systemic AEs will be accessed. The Conmeds/procedures will also be accessed and recorded.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patient Orientation
The concept of steroid resistance and proposed open label use of ranibizumab will be explained in detail with particular reference to clinical data from our previous clinical trials of IVTA for macular oedema.
After obtaining the informed consent, we will perform the baseline examinations.
Baseline Examination
The examinations during the visits will include the following:
- Visual Acuity. Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed on LogMAR chart.
- Slit lamp examination for grading of lens opacities and assessment of intraocular pressure.
- Optical coherence tomography (OCT)
- Fundus photography and fluoroscein angiography will be performed at baseline and 12 months visits. 
- Visual fields RNFL and other specialised OCT scans and other investigations may be performed as indicated in to exclude other causes of impaired visual acuity such as anterior ischaemic retinopathy.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) is thought to result from a series of biochemical and cellular changes, causing progressive leakage and exudation. Focal and grid photocoagulation remains the standard care for diabetic maculopathy. However, the availability of new agents raises the possibility of improvements in outcomes. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels have been found to be elevated in the aqueous and vitreous humour of patients with DMO.The study is designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of ranibizumab (0.3 mg), an anti-VEGF agent, as therapy in patients with visual impairment due to DMO, in whom current treatments of intravitreal injections of triamcinolone (IVTA) is no longer effective. 
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether ranibizumab 0.3 mg given as monthly intravitreal injections is effective in patients who meet the criteria for steroid (IVTA) resistence, defined as: 
- An improvement in VA of less than 5 letters 
- A reduction in central retinal thickness in OCT of less than 100 microns 
(or less than 20%, whichever is greater) 6 weeks after treatment with IVTA for at least 2 consecutive injections 

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 
We will, after investigations to exclude any other cause of visual loss, conduct an open label study to administer intravitreal injections of 0.3 mg of ranibizumab at four weekly intervals to all enrolled patients, with a minimum 4 injections planned with additional doses at the same interval if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator for up to 12 months. All patients will be followed for at least 12 months.</summary>
