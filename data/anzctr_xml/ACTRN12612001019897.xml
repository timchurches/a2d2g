  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention/yoga group will continue to receive their usual medical care under their Consultant Rheumatologist and General Practitioner, and prescribed concomitant medication for their rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, they will receive an 8-week yoga programme of group and home practice, tailored for people with rheumatoid arthritis. Group practice will consist of a weekly 75- minute instructor-led yoga class, consisting of gentle yoga postures, breathing and relaxation techniques, with a focus on physical and mental relaxation. Home practice will consist of following a 20-minute audio relaxation practice, to be completed 3 times per week, at a time and day of the participants choice.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the usual care/control group will continue to receive their usual medical care under their Consultant Rheumatologist and General Practitioner, with prescribed concomitant medication for their rheumatoid arthritis. At the completion of the study, participants in the usual care group will be offered a weekend yoga workshop, consisting of the group and home yoga practices received by the intervention group.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Potential participants will be excluded if they already practice or have regularly practiced yoga in the previous 6 months; have recently had or expect to have surgery within 6 months of screening; have a medical condition, physical, or mental health impairment apart from RA that precludes their safe participation in exercise; are unable to commit to availability for the full course of the intervention; or have had or expect to have intra-articular steroid injections within 4 weeks of screening.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified from an existing list of rheumatoid arthritis patients at the Rheumatology Department, Dunedin Public Hospital (DPH). Additional participants may be approached through rheumatology and orthopedic outpatient clinics at DPH and invited to take part in the study. 

Potential participants will be posted a letter of invitation to the study, which will include an Information Sheet explaining the proposed yoga intervention. Those showing interest in the study will be telephoned by the main investigator, and a preliminary screening conducted to determine eligibility for the trial. 

Eligible potential participants will attend individual appointments at the School of Physiotherapy. Written informed consent will be obtained, a final screening for eligibility carried out, and baseline measures taken. Following the collection of baseline data participants will be assigned a participant identification number, and randomized into one of two groups.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomization schedule will be generated using the R statistical software package (R 2.14.2), by a research member not involved in the assessment of participants. Randomization will be by random permuted blocks, to ensure minimum and maximum class sizes. The generated numbers will be consecutively sealed in identical opaque envelopes, and kept in a locked cabinet. Envelopes will be allocated in sequence to participants, by an independent researcher not involved in the assessment of participants.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease, with an estimated prevalence of 0.83.2% in the New Zealand population. Current medical management of RA is predominantly pharmaceutical. However, exercise is also recommended as a non-pharmaceutical form of symptom management, targeting both mental and physical health. 

People with musculoskeletal conditions are the highest users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and an increasingly popular form of CAM among people with RA is yoga. In our previous research focus group research, people with RA perceived yoga as a form of exercise adaptable to the variable symptoms of their RA; and identified pain, sleep, and stress as symptoms of their RA they believe may be particularly amenable to a yoga practice. We have conducted a systematic review, which suggests yoga is a safe and acceptable form of physical exercise for individuals across a range of musculoskeletal conditions, with potentially clinically relevant improvements in physical and mental health. Additionally, we have completed a Delphi survey of leading yoga researchers and identified parameters of yoga interventions appropriate for people with a musculoskeletal condition. 

The present study will look at the effect of a yoga practice specifically tailored for people with RA on a participants mental and social health. The 8-week study design is guided by the results of our Delphi survey. The studys aims are: 1) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga intervention for rheumatoid arthritis, operationalized as time and rate of recruitment, protocol adherence, participant retention, safety, and acceptability of the intervention; and 2) To estimate the effect of yoga on primary outcomes of RA-related pain and sleep quality.</summary>
