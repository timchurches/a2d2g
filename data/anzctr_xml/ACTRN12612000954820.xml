  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete 6 online lessons in 10 weeks. The online lessons take approximately 30 minutes to read through, with homework exercises taking a further hour per day. The lessons are based on current best practice cognitive and behavioural techniques and include exposure and response prevention, and cognitive techniques. Exposure and response prevention involves gradually confronting feared situations whilst resisting the compulsive behaviours that would normally be used to reduce anxiety. The cognitive techniques are aimed at reducing the common cognitive biases seen in OCD and are aimed to help the participant to reduce their overestimation of threat and responsibility, reduce the need to control their thoughts and understand the misinterpretation of the meaning of these thoughts. The cognitive techniques also aim to help people to reduce their need for certainty and perfectionism.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>By conducting this project we hope to explore the short and long term benefits of a self-guided treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. We also hope to find out how acceptable the program is to consumers and how we can improve the program. The results will inform us about who is likely to benefit from this treatment protocol and how best to administer this program.</summary>
