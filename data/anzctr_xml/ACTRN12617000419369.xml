  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised two group placebo controlled treatment trial of a probiotic - mg orotate formula designed as a treatment for depression. Active condition participants will be administered four capsules of a probiotic formula for the entire study duration which are a combination of (20 bill CFU / day for 8 weeks duration along with magnesium orotate (1600 mg / day) or placebo taken as divided into both morning and evening doses. Participants can decide weather they take them with or without a meal. The probiotic strains to be tested are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Streptococcus thermophiles.  Each capsule contains 5 billion CFU of probiotic bacteria as well as 25.5mg magnesium salts attached to 400mg of orotate. Adherence to the dosage schedule will be monitored by  participant completed dosage logs and research assistant follow up to monitor conformity to the protocol. The product to be tested has the commercial name NRGBiotic and is developed and supplied by Medlab Australia.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will take a placebo capsule designed to replicate the look and size of the active formula. Participants will not know if they are allocated to active or placebo conditions.  Control participants will be subject to the same measures and intervals of assessment and follow up as the active condition. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants meeting all of the following inclusion criteria will be included in the study: Given that there is personality and mood factors that are involved with the assessment and treatment of depression, comprehensive assessment and management criteria has been developed to ensure a representative sample and participant safety.
Participants will meet the criteria for major depressive disorder (ICD-DSM criteria); not change whatever standard care they are receiving without consulting their primary care physician regardless of clinical improvement during the study; Participants that present with a high degree of comorbidity on Axis I, II, III (ICD-DSM criterion) will be accepted in the study as complex mood, personality and health problems are common in depression; Eligible participants will be 18 years of age with no upper age limit; Participants will be asked not to be currently taking or to administer any nutritional supplements that have antidepressant effects (a list will be provided to participants).  Participants will be advised not to self-medicate with probiotic supplements for the duration of the trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose is to develop our published pilot work. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a combined supplement combining orotate and probiotics using a placebo controlled randomsied treatment trial for the treatment of depression.  
The study hypotheses relate to:
1. participants taking the active supplement will have significantly reduced symptom scores compared with the placebo group. (psychiatric  assessments).
2. participants taking the active supplement will have reduced dysbiosis and blood inflammatory markers compared with the placebo group. 
Changes in dysbiosis will be assessed by fecal testing and changes in systemic inflammatory markers will be assessed by by blood tests.
