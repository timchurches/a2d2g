  <interventions>
    <interventions>The physical activity intervention is designed to increase physical activity towards a weekly target of 210 minutes of moderate-intensity (Rating of Perceived Exertion &lt;14 or &lt;75% Heart rate reserve) physical activity. Vigorous activity (Rating of Perceived Exertion &gt;14 or &gt;75% Heart rate reserve), such as running may be used to substitute moderate activity at a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. 10 minutes of vigorous activity would equate to 20 minutes of moderate activity). This level of activity exceeds the American Heart Association Physical Activity guidelines (Haskell et al., 2007). The rationale for this intervention is based on the LOOK AHEAD study in which a target of 200 minutes per week was used, resulting in significant weight loss and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and traditional cardiovascular risk factors (Jakicic et al., 2009; Wing et al., 2013). The incremental benefit on health with a higher exercise dose is also supported by large epidemiological studies (Wen et al., 2012, Lancet).
The program includes a weekly, 45-minute individual session (0-3 months) with an exercise physiologist (Dr Elliott), decreasing to fortnightly from 3-6 months. Within each session, participants will undertake supervised exercise training, discuss strategies to improve weekly PA and goal setting will be agreed between the health professional and the patient. Patients will maintain a journal detailing their physical activity and exercise habits. If required, additional sessions will be scheduled. 24-hour telephone and email support will be accessible to the patient. Participants will be asked to maintain a food diary and to adopt a diet consisting of high protein, low glycemic index foods. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>A usual care control group will be issued with written advice regarding physical activity and nutrition at commencement of their participation in the study. Patients in the usual care group will receive risk factor management at the discretion of their treating physician. All other medical care will continue as per best-practice guidelines</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AF Burden determined by 12-lead ECG, 48-hour Holter monitoring and a smartphone ECG device for home use. Episodes of AF lasting &gt;30s will be classified as an AF occurrence. The number of patients free from arrhythmia at follow-up will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AF Symptom Burden &amp; Severity: The University of Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS) used previously by our group (Abed et al., 2013; Pathak et al., 2014) will be used to determine symptom burden (episode frequency, duration) and severity at baseline and throughout follow-up. This questionnaire also provides an index of quality of life.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiorespiratory Fitness (CRF): Cardiorespiratory fitness will be determined using cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a treadmill using the Balke protocol. Patients will breathe through a facemask connected to an Oxycon Mobile CPX for the determination of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and minute ventilation. Cardiorespiratory fitness will be quantified by the peak oxygen consumption achieved during a maximal stress test. Heart rate and blood pressure will be recorded throughout the test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiac Structure &amp; Function: Composite outcome assessed using transthoracic echocardiographic measures of left and right atrial size, ventricular dimensions, ventricular hypertrophy, systolic function and diastolic function, including measurements of strain and torsion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Composite outcome of blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) will be quantified by venous sampling. Body mass and height will be measured to determine body mass index. Waist circumference will be measured according to standardised methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inflammation, assessed by composite outcome of of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-a) from venous blood.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite outcome of platelet aggregation &amp; thrombotic markers: Given the relationship between AF and embolic stroke, we will quantify circulating thrombotic (fibrinogen, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) and fibrinolytic markers (tissue-plasminogen activator) and 2) platelet aggregation from venous blood samples collected at specified timepoints.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6, and 12 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Profibrotic Markers: Composite outcome of Tissue Growth Factor (TGF-ÃŸ) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) will be quantified as markers of fibrosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Post-intervention, 3, 6 and 12 months post-intervention</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have recently shown that increasing fitness improves arrhythmia outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder. In this study, we intend to evaluate a goal-directed, lifestyle based physical activity intervention for the reduction of AF burden and symptom severity. We hypothesise that our physical activity intervention will lower arrhythmia burden and improve symptom severity when compared to standard medical care alone.</summary>
