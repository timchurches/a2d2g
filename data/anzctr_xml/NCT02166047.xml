  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of GS-9620 in virologically
      suppressed adults with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection who are currently being
      treated with oral antivirals (OAV). Participants will be randomized in 3 sequential cohorts.
      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized in a 1:3:3:3 ratio to placebo or one of
      the doses of GS-9620 (1, 2, or 4 mg) and all participants will continue on their current oral
      antiviral treatment for the entire duration of the study. Cohorts A, B, and C will consist of
      a different treatment period of 4, 8, or 12 weeks, respectively, and will be followed to Week
      48. After Cohort A completes treatment, a safety review will be conducted by an external data
      monitoring committee prior to beginning Cohort B. Another safety review will be conducted
      after Cohort B completes treatment prior to beginning Cohort C.</summary>
