  <interventions>
    <interventions>An individual sixty minutes intervention of Physiotherapy one per week from the beginning of the disease until the death of the patient.The intervention covers the whole group of deteriorated functions that each patient has:
- Chest physiotherapy to increase or preserve the pulmonary function: re-education of respiratory patterns, use of a volume-oriented device, use of manually assisted and unassisted coughing techniques and finally, use of a cough-assist device.
- Conventional Physiotherapy to preserve the ability to walk, the physical balance and the aerobic capacity: Static Cycle Bike for hands and legs, treadmill with suspension system to preserve the walk function and vibratory platform (Zeptor).
- Conventional Physiotherapy to preserve the whole range of movements: active and passive mobilization, manual therapy as well as stretching.
- Manual Therapy and Kinesiotaping to prevent the pain.
-Electro-stimulation in the swallowing muscles to preserve the swallowing and speech ability.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on our Clinical practice, this study started with the following hypothesis: physiotherapy has a positive and quantifiable effect on health condition and quality of life in Patients diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of a specialized physiotherapy intervention on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosiss patients. Specifically, how this intervention could affect the progression of the disease, health condition and quality of life in these patients.
