    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Tumor Response - Objective tumor response was defined as the presence of at least one Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 millimeter (mm). Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization until disease progression or death assessed every 8 weeks up to week 32, and thereafter every 12 weeks up to Data Cut-off (19 May 2015)</timepoint>

      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - PFS defined as time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression.CR:Disappearance of all target lesions.Any pathological lymph nodes(whether target or non-target)must have reduction in short axis to&lt;10 mm.PR:At least 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference baseline sum diameters.PD:At least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions,taking as reference smallest sum on study.In addition to relative increase of 20%,the sum also demonstrate absolute increase of at least 5 mm.SD:Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD,taking as reference smallest sum diameters while on study. PFS calculated as(Months)=first event date minus randomization or first dose date plus 1.Median PFS was computed using Kaplan-Meier estimates (product-limit estimates) and was presented with 95% confidence interval.The confidence intervals for median was calculated according to Brookmeyer and Crowley.</outcome>

SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: At least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters). CR: Disappearance of all target lesions.

      <outcome>Health Related Quality of Life (HrQoL) Assessed Using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) - EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire comprising of five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea/vomiting), six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial impact), and a global quality of life (QoL) scale summarized from two 7-point scales (overall QoL and overall general health). Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and the individual single-items ranged in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. High score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</outcome>

The 28-item module comprises of 6 symptom scales (abdominal/gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, other chemotherapy side-effects, hormonal symptoms, body image, attitude to disease and treatment), and sexual functioning. All of the scales and the individual single-items ranged in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate a better quality of life.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment and Death - TEAEs, SAEs and AEs was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) Version 4.0. An adverse events was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to data cut-off that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</outcome>
