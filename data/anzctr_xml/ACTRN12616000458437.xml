  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ortho-ATI (Trademark) is a Class 3 Biological autologous tenocyte implantation (ATI) product manufactured in Australia by Orthocell since 2008. Ortho-ATI (Trademark) is intended for homologous and autologous use only. The product comprises autologous tendon cells taken from healthy patellar tendons of patients. These autologous cells are proliferated using an in vitro cell culture technique and reconstituted with patients own serum for local injection. 

Patellar Tendon Biopsy
Autologous tenocytes will be harvested from participants via patellar tendon biopsy under local anaesthetic by an orthopaedic surgeon.  A 3 x 1mm strip of tendon will be harvested from the superficial surface of the patellar tendon using a 14 gauge biopsy needle.  Participants will be advised to avoid over use or excessive repetitive motions for 1-2 days

Tenocyte Injection
Approximately 4 weeks post-biopsy, the orthopaedic surgeon is provided with 2 vials containing 1ml each of  autologous human tenocytes (2-5 x 106 cells/ml) suspended in 10% autologous human serum. Under ultrasound guidance, using an 18-gauge needle, the surgeon will inject the suspension as described above into the tendinopathy site at the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon. The final volume injected will be determined by the surgeon during the procedure according to the capacity of the anatomical site. 

Participants will be advised to rest for two days and restrict activity to light household/office duties for four weeks.

    <comparator>Lateral Epicondylitis Surgery
Under general anaesthetic the patient is placed supine on the operating table. A tourniquet is placed on the operative arm. The arm is prepped and draped in a sterile manner. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is given. An Esmarch bandage is applied, then the tourniquet inflated to 250mmHg. A curvilinear incision is made over the lateral aspect of the elbow overlying and distal to the lateral epicondyle. The lateral epicondyle is approached and the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) tendon split giving exposure to the underlying extensor. The degenerative extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) is evident by the appearance of the tissue.  The degenerative ECRB is excised removing all degenerative appearing tissue down to the lateral epicondyle. The lateral epicondyle is abraded and multiple drill holes using 1.2mm K-wire are created to encourage bone bleeding for tendon reattachment. The wound is then thoroughly irrigated. The common extensor tendon is repaired to the lateral epicondyle using a 2.9mm suture anchor and two interlocking sutures. The ECRL split and incision are then closed using resorbable sutures.  Post-operatively, the patient will be placed in a volar wrist splint for 6 weeks. A sling is used as required for comfort for 2 weeks. The patient will be instructed not to use the elbow to lift anything greater than a coffee cup for six weeks. The procedure is performed by an orthopaedic surgeon and takes approximately 1-2 hours. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lateral epicondylitis (LE) or "tennis elbow" is the most commonly diagnosed condition of the elbow and occurs mostly in patients whose activities require strong gripping or repetitive movements. 1 in 10 patients with LE who receive standard therapies like coricosteriod injections do not obtain relief from symptoms. In Australia, such patients with severe, chronic non responsive LE for over 6 months are referred for surgical treatment.

OrthoATI (Trademark) is a class 3 biological autologous tenocyte implantation (ATI) product manufactured in Australia by Orthocell Ltd, that could potentially prevent or delay the need for surgery in LE patients who don't respond to standard therapies. OrthoATI (Trademark) is indicated for patients with symptoms of degenerative tendon injury who have failed conservative treatment methods. 

The current research project is a 1 year, single dose, single-centre, randomised, open label, parallel group, comparator controlled, non-inferiority study to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of OrthoATI (Trademark) in patients with severe, chronic, treatment resistant lateral epicondylitis compared to surgery.</summary>
