  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects were received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for 2 years. SIT was performed with a standardized mite depot-allergen extract (50% Der P and 50% Der f) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer Allergopharma Joachim Ganzer KG (Reinbek, Germany). The build-up phase (25 weeks) began at 5TU/ml of the final concentration and increased to 50TU/ml, 500TU/ml, and 5000TU/ml at 5-week intervals as tolerated. Maintenance immunotherapy was administrated with the 5000TU/ml concentration bi-weekly for 54 weeks and then tri-weekly for 27 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy volunteers without any allergy history were selected as a control group. The subjects in control group were not received any treatment.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical symptoms assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). The subjects were instructed that Score 0 meant overall symptoms not all bothersome and that Score 10 meant overall symptoms extremely bothersome. </outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years after administration</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Th17 response was inhibited by immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis, by assessing the expression levels of Th17 associated genes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years after adminstration</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients were (1) age from 20 to 45 years old; (2) having persistent AR symptoms during the past two consecutive years; (3) allergic sensitization to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, (Der p) &amp; Dermatophagoides farina (Der f)) confirmed by both skin prick test (SPT) and ImmunoCap (Registered Trademark) (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden); (4) no previous treatment of SIT; and (5) negative SPT results to other common inhalant allergens (e.g., common pollens, cockroach, fungi, and animal dander). Healthy subjects without any allergy history and allergic symptoms were selected as a control group. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>All recruited subjects (both allergic rhintis patients and healthy controls) did not have an infection, asthma, autoimmune diseases, or other upper airway diseases such as septal deviation, nasal polyps, or sinusitis before enrolment. Furthermore, all participants had not received any form of steroids or SIT at least six months before the study. </exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allergic rhinitis (AR) patients who were monosensitized to house dust mite were collected before the initiation of  specific immunotherapy (SIT) (SIT-untreated) and after the end of 2-year SIT (SIT-treated) treatment. The impact of specific immunotherapy on Th17 response and Th1/Th2/Treg changes in AR patients was investigated.</summary>
