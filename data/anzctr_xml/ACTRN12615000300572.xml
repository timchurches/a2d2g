    <interventions>Ambu AuraGain LMA 'Registered Trademark'. The Ambu AuraGain will be inserted and after achieving satisfactory ventilation via the supraglottic airway device, fibreopitc-guided tracheal intubation will then commence. A maximum of 2 attempts at intubation will be given. The intubation will be performed by an experienced anaesthetist (&gt;10 years since commencement of specialist training) who is familiar with the use of both devices (&gt;10 uses on each device) prior to the study. Assessment of any complications will occur directly post-operatively in recovery by the anaesthetist performing the intubation. </interventions>
    <comparator>LMA Fastrach 'Registered Trademark'. The LMA Fastrach will be inserted and after achieving satisfactory ventilation via the supraglottic airway device, fibreopitc-guided tracheal intubation will then commence.
