  <interventions>
    <interventions>Teenagers primigravidas with uterine artery diastolic notch at 20-24 weeks gestation were randomized to a control group received iron supplementation and a study group received iron supplementation plus 20 mg isosorbid mononitrate tablets once daily applied vaginally until delivery. Both groups were followed by routine antenatal care until delivery.   Adherence to treatment was monitored by drug tablet return.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control group received iron supplementation in the form of 50 mg elemental iron capsule  once daily starting from 20-24 weeks gestation until delivery. Adherence to treatment was monitored by drug tablet return and estimation of hemoglobin concentration every 2-4 weeks   </comparator>

    <summary>Teenagers primigravidas with uterine artery diastolic notch at 20-24 weeks gestation are considered at high risk for pre-eclampsia and were randomized to a control group received iron supplementation and a study group received iron supplementation plus 20 mg isosorbid mononitrate tablet vaginally once daily with the aim of decreasing the incidence and severity of pre-eclampsia. Both groups received treatment  until  delivery and were followed by antenatal care.  </summary>
