  <interventions>
    <interventions>The primary intervention is the use of a high fidelity human patient simulator to study a clinical question.

In this SIMULATOR BASED study the intervention is that used in a previous clinical study (ACTRN12608000068369), the Safer Sleep System. This is a multimodal integrated system for the safe administration of drugs and compilation of an accurate automated record during anaesthesia. 
This Systemis multifaceted and includes
novel equipment, consumables and procedures.
It was designed on the basis of lessons from empirical incident reporting, the psychological mechanisms underlying human error and the principles of system safety developed in the high-risk chemical, nuclear and aviation industries. It includes specialised trays (which support aseptic technique and promote a wellorganised
anaesthetic workspace), colour- and
bar-coded labelling of syringes (which facilitate the selection and tracking of drugs), pre-filled syringes for the most commonly used anaesthetic drugs (to remove a key error-prone step in drug administration and to save time),
and automatic visual and auditory verification of syringes using a computer and bar-codes just prior to each drug administration. The System
also compiles an automated anaesthetic record, with the intention of improving
comprehensiveness and accuracy, and of freeing the anaesthetist to spend more time caring for and monitoring the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator of primary interest is the previous similar trial undertaken in patients: ACTRN12608000068369. In this SIMULATOR BASED TRIAL The comparator studied will be conventional means of anaesthesia. In this arm no barcoding or prefilled syringes will be used, participants will make a record with pen and paper, and will use standard ampoules of drugs.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This will be a binary: the acceptance or rejection of the primary research hypothesis. Accepting or rejecting the hypothesis will depend on 
The rate of errors in intravenous (iv) drug administration and recording, assessed by observation and reconciliation of records with ampoule used and information obtained at debreifing.</outcome>
