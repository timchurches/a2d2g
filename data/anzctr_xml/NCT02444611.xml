  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neonatal morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases is of global concern. Childhood
      disease-specific immunisation is irrefutably linked to the decline in deaths from these
      targeted infections over the last century. However, neonatal immunisation is limited, in
      part, by the impaired adaptive immune function in this age group.

      There is now an expanding body of evidence for heterologous ('non-specific') effects of
      various vaccines used in childhood. This refers to the immunomodulatory capabilities of
      vaccines to influence immune outcomes beyond the vaccine's specific targeted disease. The
      underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for these effects are incompletely
      understood, but evidence is mounting that the innate immune system is central to these
      observed effects.

      This study is a randomised controlled trial designed to determine the influence of two
      commonly administered neonatal immunisations, BCG and Hepatitis B vaccine, given at birth, on
      the neonatal immune responses to non-specific antigens.

      The investigators will recruit 200 newborns at the Mercy Hospital for Women in Melbourne,
      Australia over a 1-year period. These babies will be allocated randomly to one of 4 groups,
      receiving these 2 vaccines in different combinations, at 2 set time points. (at birth and 1
      week post randomisation) A blood sample will be taken at 1-week post randomisation for in
      vitro immunological analyses.

      This study will improve current understanding of the influence of vaccines on neonatal
      immunity and will help develop strategies exploiting beneficial heterologous ('non-specific')
      effects to improve protection against infection in the very young.</summary>
