  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 arms to this study. Arm 1 and 2 are both group exercise and counseling interventions. Arm 3 is a control group. Arm 1 and 2: subjects participate in a baseline assessment in week 1, group exercise (1 hour, 3x/week) and group counseling (90 minutes, 1x/week) for 8 weeks, then a post-test assessment in week 10, as well as follow up at week 24. The format of exercise and counseling is identical between the arms. The only difference is exercise intensity. All exercise sessions will be supervised by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist and delivered by university students currently enrolled in the Exercise &amp; Sport Science and/or Physiotherapy degrees. All students working on the project will have been trained by the lead investigator on exercise delivery and monitoring. Arm 1 will participate in low to moderate intensity exercise. They will perform aerobic exercise at an intensity of 60-65% of peak aerobic capacity and resistance training at 50-65% of their maximum strength. Arm 2 will participate in moderate to high intensity exercise. They will perform aerobic exercise at an intensity of 75-80% of peak aerobic capacity and resistance training at 65-80% of their maximum strength. All group counselling sessions will be co-facilitated by one certified counsellor and one masters student of counselling. Each counselling session will have a new topic to focus the discussion on, but the counsellors will encourage the participants to steer the conversation to meet their interests and needs. Intervention groups will be formed when at least 6 participants sign up for the course. After baseline assessment, groups will be randomly assigned an arm of the intervention by computer generate random numbers, with even numbers being arm 1 and odd numbers being arm 2.  Possible side effects of the intervention include general muscular soreness from exercise and possible increase in swelling if lymphedema present</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group, will participate in the assessments at week 1 and 10 only, and in between will be asked to continue their normal routine.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to trial a theory based group exercise and counseling intervention that addresses questions related to the optimal characteristics of rehabilitation programs, focusing on intensity of exercise. This research will attempt to identify characteristics of both the intervention and participants that contribute to the success of such a program. This information will help Australian breast and prostate cancer survivors reach and maintain their fitness and well being goals and improve their quality of life. The literature so far has shown that exercise and counseling can help improve quality of life in breast and prostate cancer survivors, but there is a need to determine how intense exercise needs to be to make optimal improvements in quality of life. Who is it for? Patients aged 25-75 who have had confirmed stage I, II, or III breast or prostate cancer and also completed acute treatments (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) within the past 5 years will be eligible for this study. Patients who register their interest must have their physician complete a referral form to clear them for participation. Trial Details Participants will be allocated by the project manager to one of the 3 treatment arms of the study, based upon their availability and course openings. Arm 1 and 2 are both group exercise and counselling interventions, differing in exercise intensity (low to moderate in Arm 1, moderate to high in Arm 2) and lasting 8 weeks. Arm 3 is a control group that maintained their normal routine.</summary>
