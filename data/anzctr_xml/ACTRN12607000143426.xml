  <interventions>
    <interventions>sleep deprivation of 5.5 hrs per night for the intervention. The duration of the intervention is 6 weeks. The participants visit the study at baseline and 2 weeks and followed by telephone at the end of 6 weeks. Sleep deprivation is considered to be a cognitive behavioural technique although in this study it is without a cognitive restructuring aspect. If participants sleep improves they are encouraged to sleep for increasingly longer periods.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RCT of sleep deprivation versus sleep hygiene for primary insomnia in adults. Primary insomnia is a condition is a diagnosis of exclusion where there is poor sleep but no other reason for it. The theory behind this is that the "sleep clock" is malfunctioning and the intervention of sleep deprivation enables a resetting of the clock.</summary>
