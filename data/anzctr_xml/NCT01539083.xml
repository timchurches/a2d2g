  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Consolidation Phase: Percentage of Participants With Complete Response (CR) and Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) at Month 12 - CR as per IMWG criteria is defined as negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and disappearance of soft tissue plasmacytomas and less than (&lt;) 5 percent plasma cells in bone marrow. VGPR as per IMWG criteria is defined as serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90 percent or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level &lt;100 milligram (mg) per 24 hours.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Consolidation Phase: Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS, calculated as the time between randomization to disease progression or death (regardless of cause), whichever occurred first. Progressive disease as per IMWG criteria: increase of &gt;= 25 percent from lowest response level in Serum M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be &gt;=0.5 gram per deciliter [g/dL]) Urine M-component and/or (the absolute increase must be &gt;=200 mg/24 hour. Only in participants without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels: the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain levels. The absolute increase must be &gt;10 mg/dL. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage: the absolute percent must be &gt;=10 percent. Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if bortezomib when added to consolidation treatment
      with thalidomide and prednisolone leads to an improved response in patients with multiple
      myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplant and initial treatment with
      bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone.</summary>
