  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial compares a systematic, community-wide approach to reducing alcohol-related problems (including health, police, legal and education groups) in experimental communities, versus 'usual practice' in matched control communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The intervention will comprise a number of simultaneously implemented strategies over a three to four year period, including feedback of alcohol-related information via local media, high school education sessions, GP training in brief intervention, vocational programs targeting high-risk individuals and hospital-based alcohol interventions.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control communities will continue to implement their existing programs (treatment as usual), but will not recieve the strategic, community-wide approach.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the sudy is to reduce alcohol-related problems in selected rural communities in NSW by sytematically implementing a number of interventions across the whole community, involving numerous community groups, such as schools, police, health workers, GPs and road safety officers.  It is anticipated that the communities involved in this process will reduce their number of alcohol-related problems by more than similar communities that are not involved in this process.</summary>
