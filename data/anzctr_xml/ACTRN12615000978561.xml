    <statisticalmethods>The visual analogue scale has been validated to detect clinically significant differences in pain scores in patients with acute traumatic pain at 13mm (95% CI 10-17mm). Therefore, to detect a clinically significant difference in mean pain scores of 15 mm on the VAS assuming a standard deviation of 25 mm, we would require 44 patients in each group with 80% power with a significance of 0.05%. To allow for attrition and withdrawal we aim to recruit a total of 100 patients to be split evenly between trial groups.
Data will be entered into an excel sheet which would be available for access only to the investigators. Data will be stored in a safe and secure location. Data will be analysed using SPSS 22.0. Continues variables will be tested for normality. Based on the outcome of the test parametric students T test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test will be carried out to determine the differences in VAS scores. Categorical data will be analysed using the Chi-squared analysis. Bivariate analysis would be performed for determining the confounding factors contributing to ease of pain. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 
All data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. Patients who withdraw or are lost to follow up will be regarded as treatment failures for data analysis purposes and analysed with imputed data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is a common feature of major traumatic injuries. Little research has been done into the utilisation of low dose Ketamine for analgesia in the ED. Ketamine has the potential to be a highly effective method of analgesic management in haemodynamically unstable trauma patients who are unsuitable for large doses of opioid drugs but it is not utilised for this purpose due to a lack of supporting evidence and clinical concern about potential side effects. The clinical impact of this trial is in the development of an evidence base to support the use of Ketamine for analgesic purposes in the ED. Our hypothesis
is that low-dose Ketamine provides effective (statistically significant reduction in pain score), safe (low rates of emergence and adverse events) and tolerable (patient reported effects/willingness to use again) analgesia when used in sub-anaesthetic doses in patients with traumatic injuries. If proven this will have significant implications for the clinical care of patients and in pain management guidelines with traumatic injuries in the ED.
The proposed research design is a single blind randomised trial of low dose Ketamine in trauma patients. Participants will be randomised to receive a single dose of 'study drug' which will be either Ketamine (0.2mg/kg) or IV opiate (the dose determined by the clinician), this will be followed up by ongoing standard care for pain management (intravenous morphine or equivalent). Participants will record pain scores every 15 minutes for one hour post analgesic dose. Participants will also be clinically assessed every 15 minutes and have their vital signs and any side effects recorded. Additional 'rescue' analgesia will be available across both arms to ensure that patients are treated for ongoing pain.Rescue analgesia use will
also be recorded during the follow up period. Participants will be followed up 24-72hours after trial enrolment. Participants will have their vital signs recorded, will be assessed for adverse effects from the study drug and will be asked to complete a participant questionnaire. This short questionnaire will assess patient's satisfaction with pain management in the emergency department, their satisfaction with the 'study drug', any side effects experienced from the 'study drug' and their overall willingness to receive the 'study drug' again. Patients will be contacted at 6 and 12 months post enrolment to evaluate patient
satisfaction and long term safety of Ketamine as an analgesic.</summary>
