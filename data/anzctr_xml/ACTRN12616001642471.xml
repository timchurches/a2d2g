    <interventions>This randomized controlled double blind trial aims to investigate the effects of regular fat compared with reduced fat dairy intake on childrens adiposity, heart health and gut health. 
The three month intervention will involve fortnightly delivery of plain packaged dairy products (tailored to suit the childs normal intake) that will either be regular fat or reduced fat.  Assessments will be conducted at the start and end of the intervention period. 

For the intervention, participants will be provided with either regular or reduced fat dairy. For the purposes of this research, dairy can include milk, cheese, yoghurt, custard, cream, sour cream, dairy dessert, and butter. Products provided will be matched to what the child would normally eat, as determined by a dietitian administered diet history with the child's parent/caregiver. The diet history in conjunction with a 3 day weighed food record will also be used to assess baseline diet. Parents will be asked to use the study products provided in place of the normal products they would use in the home. If children are eating food supplied away from home the can still do this as usual, they do not need to avoid other dairy. 

Our team has previously tested a range of different dairy products with a convenience sample of 8 children to determine acceptability; only products deemed to have an acceptability score of 3 or more will be included in this study. Acceptability was tested using a Likert smiley face scale of 1-5, with 1 representing very yucky/unacceptable to 5 very yummy/acceptable. The information below outlines the types of dairy product that will be provided as part of the proposed study.  

The regular fat dairy group: Children will receive regular fat dairy products, in accordance with existing dietary guidelines and their own preferences, to consume as part of their normal diet. Fat values of these products will be approximately 4g/100ml for milk, 35g/100g for cheese, 9g/100 g for yoghurt, and 4g/100g for dairy dessert/custard. Caregivers will be instructed to replace existing dairy products with the products supplied. No dosages will be recommended, with dairy product consumption and other general dietary behaviours to occur as per usual. 

The reduced fat dairy group: Children will receive reduced fat dairy products, in accordance with existing dietary guidelines and their own preferences, to consume as part of their normal diet. Fat values of these products will be approximately 2g/100 ml for milk, 15g/100g for cheese, 2g/100 g for yoghurt, and 2g/100g for dairy dessert/custard. As with regular fat group, no dosages will be recommended, with dairy consumption, and other general dietary behaviours to continue as per usual. 

We will conduct fortnightly phone calls with parents/carers to assess compliance with the study protocols. This assessment will provide an opportunity to check if parents/carers are happy to remain in the study with their children, if they would like to change the type and/or amount of dairy currently being delivered and to note any issues arising in the preceding two weeks. If the child is deviating from their usual intake and not consuming at least one serve of dairy per day for the fortnight from sources provided, encouragement and support will be provided, including recipe ideas and changes to the types of products supplied if required. The family will be contacted on a weekly basis to monitor progress. If a child is not consuming at least 70% of their dairy from the products supplied for four weeks, this will be noted as non-compliant in our reporting data, and modelled according to intention-to-treat principles.

    <statisticalmethods>This two-tailed power analysis has been based on a total number of 40 children, although the total number we are aiming for is 55. This is because it is likely that some children will not participate in all aspects of the study (for example, it may not be possible to get a blood sample from some children). Assumptions about distribution of measurements have been based on previous research in children by Fields and Allison (2012) and Eisenmann, Heelan, and Welk (2004) (for body fat), and from Juhola et al. (2011) and Burke et al. (2005) (for LDL- and HDL-cholesterol). We estimate that this study will have the following power to detect differences between the change in the regular fat dairy group and the change in the reduced fat dairy group:

-Body fat: 80% power to detect a change of above or equal to 3.3%, or 50% power to detect above or equal to 2%.  
-LDL-cholesterol: 80% power to detect a change of above or equal to 0.73 mmol/L, or 50% power to detect above or equal to 0.51 mmol/L.
-HDL-cholesterol: 80% power to detect a change of above or equal to 0.27 mmol/L, or 50% power to detect a above or equal to 0.19 mmol/L.

These values are considered to be clinically relevant in this age group. As the study is a pilot test, and our objectives include to determine the feasibility of the methodology and to provide information for planning a full-scale trial, the study is modestly powered to detect the magnitude of change that would realistically be expected to occur over a 3-month period. However, it will provide sufficient data on which to base the study design for a full scale trial with high power to better detect change.

We will perform between group (regular fat dairy vs reduced fat dairy) comparisons for change in each of the main  study measures over the period of the study. Differences between the two groups will be tested using Student t-tests or the Mann-Whitney U test if data do not meet the assumptions for parametric tests and cannot be normalized by using a logarithmic or similar transformation. Values will be standardized where appropriate to allow for age-related changes. Where transformed variables have a normal distribution, repeated measures ANOVA will be used to test for between group differences adjusting for baseline values and age of child at baseline. A significance threshold of 0.05 will be used. The researchers will also use the R package vegan, a common ecological package, to measure similarity and dissimilarity between the samples (Oksanen et al., 2007).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a randomised controlled double-blind trial. It will involve recruiting 55 children aged 4-6 years, who normally consume dairy products on a regular basis. The three month intervention will involve fortnightly delivery of plain packaged dairy products, either reduced fat or regular fat, tailored to suit the childs normal intake.  Assessments conducted at the start and end of the intervention period will include body composition assessment using a BOD POD; blood analysis of lipids, insulin resistance, inflammation and fatty acid biomarkers; blood pressure; strength testing; diet assessment, and gut health using faecal samples. The project will also include a follow up collection point three months after the completion of the intervention. At this time point only a 3-day food record and set of faecal samples will be collected. This project will provide proof of concept for a similar project on a large scale. The study procedures have been informed by preceding focus group research in a convenience sample of parents of young children (manuscript in preparation).</summary>
