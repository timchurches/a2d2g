  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of the three drugs, the following dosages will be give:
Artesunate-amodiaquine: 4 mg/kg artesunate + 10mg/kg amodiaquine once daily for 3 consecutive days will be given.
Artemether-lumefantrine containing 20 mg artemether+ 120 mg lumefantrine in each tablet will be given twice daily for three days according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. The total target dose ranges are 5-24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29-144 mg/kg bw of lumefantrine.
All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The two drugs will be tested separately. The patient will be given artesunate+amodiaquine or artemether+lumefantrine and will be followed up for 28 days.

    <statisticalmethods>The treatment failure rate of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine in the area is assumed 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per district. 
WHO excel software programme will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28/42, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28/42, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria will be assessed in two districts.
It is single prospective study where artesunate+amodiaquine will be tested in one district and artemether+lumefantrine will tested in the other district.
Febrile patients aged 6 months and above with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled. A sample Size of 88 patients per drug per site per district. 
Patients will be treated with the WHO recommended standard doses of artesunate-amodiaquine (daily dose for 3 days) and artemether-lumefantrine (twice daily for 3 days).
Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.
Secondary endpoints: 
1. The frequency of adverse events.
2. Frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
