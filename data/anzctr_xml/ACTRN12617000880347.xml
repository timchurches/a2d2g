  <interventions>
    <interventions>Delivery of a program tailored to Australian schools that aims to foster proactive bystander responses to racism and racial bullying. This program will occur over 2 school terms. Teachers will attend a 1 day training workshop at beginning of the program and a 1x2hr workshop in 2nd term. During the first term there will be; teacher-led class-based lessons and activities (e.g. raising awareness of racism, self reflection, narrative development) 1x45min-1 hr lesson per week for 8 weeks and a student-led development of a class charter re. anti-racism and other materials such as posters and post-cards 1x40min session per fortnight for 12 weeks (facilitated by teachers). Posters and post-cards will be used to communicate to students' families and school community their learnings from the program.  The program has been designed specifically for the study and informed by the Kiva model and Paluck's Roots curriculum. In the second term there will be a program working with 'influencers' in the classroom to develop anti-racism and anti-bullying materials to help other students intervene in a conflict such as fact-sheets and online materials (1x40min session per fortnight for 12 weeks). Influencers will be chosen by their peers/classmates and receive instruction from teachers (1x40min meeting per fortnight for 12 weeks with teachers). Over the 2 terms there will be fortnightly meetings between teachers and researchers to discuss progress and issues (1x1hr session for 24 weeks) and an online discussion forum will be operating for teachers to connect with each other and researchers (ongoing over 2 terms). Intervention adherence or fidelity will be assessed by classroom observations and focus groups with teachers and students by researchers. Teachers delivering the classroom activities and materials will also be given a diary to record the date of each activity, duration and any other notes. Researchers will evaluate these diaries. The online discussion forums can also be used to monitor adherence and fidelity.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Racism and racial bullying are important issues in the lives of many Australian children and young people, especially at school. This project will substantially increase understandings of bystander responses (including their extent, nature, potential, merits, benefits, constraints) as a means of countering racism and racial bullying among Australian school students. This will be achieved through examining experiences of, attitudes towards, and responses to, racism and racial bullying among school students; identifying health, wellbeing, education and social outcomes of racism and racial bullying for individuals, schools and communities; exploring the enablers and obstacles associated with bystander responses to racism and racial bullying and by developing, piloting and evaluating a school-based program to foster proactive bystander responses to racism and racial bullying. </summary>
