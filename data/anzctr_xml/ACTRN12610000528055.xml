  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the changes in lung function caused by the use of continuous positive airway pressure compared to standard therapy in patients who have been diagnosed with a worsening of their heart failure.  Continuous positive airway pressure is a way of delivering pressure to the airway through a mask connected to a machine.  It is used routinely in the treatment of heart failure to improve outcomes but how it works on the lungs is not well understood.  By using a method of measuring lung function that can be done whilst on continuous positive airway pressure and that requires minimal active patient co-operation this trial hopes to provide insight into the mechanisms of this treatment.</summary>
