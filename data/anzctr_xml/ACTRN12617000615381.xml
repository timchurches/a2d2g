  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients randomized to the intervention group will have a detailed discussion (with a cardiology nurse and treating cardiologist) regarding their cardiovascular risk, based on their 5-year risk calculation (using the Australian Absolute Risk Calculator - cvdcheck.org).  This discussion will occur at the time of initial review at the Chest Pain Clinic, and is estimated to take around 40 minutes.  The treating cardiologist will then develop an individualised risk management strategy in consultation with the patient, and communicated with their General Practitioner.  The strategy will be based on the current recommendations of the National Heart Foundation Guidelines for management of cardiovascular risk.  This may include lifestyle advice (exercise, dietary), prescription of lipid or blood pressure therapy where indicated, referral to the hospital's smoking cessation clinic +/- prescription of nicotine replacement therapy.

Patients will be followed up via telephone (by a cardiology nurse) at 3, 6 and 9 month intervals, with in-person follow up at 12 months.  At 12 months and five years, participants' absolute risk profile will be reassessed.  Each contact point will provide an opportunity to monitor adherence to the agreed risk management strategy.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients referred to hospital chest pain clinics are often found to have non-cardiac (non threatening) symptoms, but have been found to have a high prevalence of risk factors (eg high cholesterol, smoking) for subsequent cardiovascular events (eg heart attack, stroke).  These risk factors are not often formally addressed within a traditional chest pain clinic or cardiology clinic.

The chest pain clinic provides an opportunity to identify patients at higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.  We hypothesize that initiating strategies to modify individual risk factors during this initial visit will assist patients to develop a more favourable cardiovascular risk profile.
