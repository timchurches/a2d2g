    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Shockwave Lithoplasty® Peripheral Lithoplasty System
Treatment: drugs - Medtronic IN.PACT (DCB)

Experimental: Lithoplasty System followed by DCB - Shockwave Lithoplasty® Peripheral Lithoplasty System is a lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilatation of calcified, stenotic peripheral arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. lithoplasty

Active Comparator: Medtronic IN.PACT (DCB) - Medronic IN.PACT Drug Coated Balloon (DBS) is indicated for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in patients with obstructive disease of peripheral arteries, including patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) and arteriovenous (AV) access to help maintain hemodialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease.


Treatment: devices: Shockwave Lithoplasty® Peripheral Lithoplasty System
The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is a proprietary lithotripsy-enhanced balloon catheter that is designed to be delivered through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the site of calcified stenosis. Activating the lithotripsy within the device will generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the target treatment site, disrupt calcium within the lesion and allow subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. The system consists of a balloon catheter with multiple integrated lithotripsy electrodes, and a generator.

Treatment: drugs: Medtronic IN.PACT (DCB)
The IN.PACT Admiral DCB is an over-the-wire (OTW) balloon catheter with a drug-coated balloon at the distal tip. The drug component, referred to as the FreePac drug coating, consists of the drug paclitaxel and the excipient urea. The device component physically dilates the vessel lumen by PTA, and the drug is intended to reduce the proliferative response that is associated with restenosis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shockwave Medical Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, multi-center, single blind,
      randomized (1:1) study of Lithoplasty treatment used in combination with DCB versus standard
      balloon angioplasty used in combination with DCB to treat moderate and severely calcified
      femoropopliteal arteries. Assuming that roughly 15% of the subjects will be
      lost-to-follow-up, a total of 334 subjects (167 per treatment arm) will be enrolled in the
      study.

      In addition to the randomized study, an observational study of subjects who do not meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for the randomized study will be conducted. The objective of the
      observational study is to assess the real-world acute performance of the Shockwave Medical
      Peripheral Lithoplasty System in the treatment of calcified, stenotic, peripheral arteries.

      The observational study is a prospective, multi-center, single arm observational study for
      subjects who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the randomized study.

      A maximum of 250 subjects at the same 50 sites will be enrolled in the observational study.</summary>
