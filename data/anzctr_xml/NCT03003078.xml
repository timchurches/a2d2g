  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety of an active implantable
      (radiological) medical device OncoSil, when implanted into patients with pancreatic cancer,
      in conjunction with Standard of Care (SOC)chemotherapy. OncoSil, is an experimental
      treatment and carries the active treatment "radioactive Phosphorous (32P)" inside inactive
      silicon particles. Once implanted, the OncoSil Microparticles will stay in the tumour
      permanently. The purpose of OncoSil, is to deliver the action of 32P directly into a
      targeted tumour to destroy cancer cells. Patients will be taking part in a single arm open
      label research study - which means that everyone in the research study will receive the
      investigational treatment OncoSil, plus their prescribed standard chemotherapy regimen which
      will be either; FOLFIRINOX (FOLFIRINOX is the name of a combination of chemotherapy drugs
      used to treat advanced cancer of the pancreas) or gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel
      (Abraxane).Participation in this research study involves a Screening Period, a Treatment
      Follow Up Period and a Long Term follow up period. At the first screening visit, every
      patient will be asked to sign a consent form to agree to the study procedures, before any
      assessments are performed for the study. The total number of visits patients will need to
      attend will depend on how long it takes for their disease to progress. The implantation of
      OncoSil will be completed in the endoscopy suite of the hospital under endoscopic
      ultrasound. This allows the specialist doctor to view the pancreas and enables them to
      implant the OncoSil Microparticles via a fine needle directly into the target tumour. After
      the procedure, there will be a 4 hour observation period to ensure that the patient is
      feeling fine and safe to go home. Implantation will only occur once during the treatment
      period, and once implanted, the device cannot be removed. After the patients target tumour
      shows progression on imaging, there will be an end of study visit and then the Long Term
      follow up period will be conducted. The Long Term Follow up does not require the patient to
      return to the research study site, it is done via review of the patient's medical records by
      site staff every 8 weeks for a maximum of up to 30 months.</summary>
