  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, single arm phase IIa trial in which patients with early breast cancer
      will receive pre-operatively two doses of denosumab 120mg subcutaneously one week apart
      (maximum 12 days) followed by surgery. Tumor, normal breast tissue and blood samples will be
      collected at baseline and at surgery. Post-operative treatment will be at the discretion of
      the investigator.

      Primary objective: to determine if a short course of RANKL inhibition with denosumab can
      induce a decrease in tumor proliferation rates as determined by Ki67 immunohistochemistry
      (IHC) in newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer in pre-menopausal women.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine the number of absolute Ki67 responders after a short course of denosumab
           (defined as &lt;2.7% IHC staining in the post treatment tumor biopsy).

        -  To determine the effects of a short course of denosumab on serum C-terminal telopeptide
           levels (CTX).

        -  To determine the effects of a short course of denosumab on RANK/RANKL gene expression
           and signaling as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA sequencing in the tumor.

        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on tumor apoptosis rates using
           IHC

        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on modulating the immature
           mammary epithelial cell populations in the tumor.

        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on estrogen signaling pathways in
           the tumor.

        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on various immune

        -  To determine effect of safety profile of denosumab</summary>
