  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two intervention groups in this study. Both groups receive 12x90 minute sessions of therapy over 12 weeks. Groups 1 and 2 both receive therapy for alcohol problems which consists of motivational therapy and cognitive behaviour therapy.  Motivational therapy consists of specific strategies designed to consolidate readiness and commitment to reduce or stop alcohol consumption. Cognitive behaviour therapy consists of strategies that assist participants to identify and redress cognitions and behaviours that impede effective coping. Group 1 also receives prolonged exposure for post-traumatic stress disorder. Prolonged exposure involves repeated recounting of distressing trauma memories. Group 2 receives supportive counselling for posttraumatic stress disorder. Group 1 receives 12x90 minute sessions of therapy for alcohol problems and exposure for post-traumatic stress disorder; Group 2 receives 12x90 minute sessions of treatment for alcohol problems and supportive counselling.</interventions>
    <comparator>Therapy consists of 12x90 minute weekly sessions of motivation enhancement therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy and supportive counselling. Motivation enhancement therapy consists of strategies that increase readiness and commitment for change. Cognitive bahaviour therapy teaches individuals to identify and change unhelpful beliefs and behaviour. Supportive counselling consists of empathic listening and practical problem solving.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is often associated with problematic alcohol consumption. Individuals with both problems are more likely to require specialist treatment, which at present is not readily available to the public. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the gold standard of treatment for PTSD, prolonged exposure, is acceptable to individuals who present with PTSD and alcohol use problems. Also, whether integrating treatment for these problems is more efficacious than treating alcohol problems alone. We expect that participants in both treatment conditions will show significant improvements in PTSD and alcohol problems. We hypothesise that integrated treatment will be associated with greater improvement than treatment for alcohol alone.</summary>
