  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individualised occupational therapy home programs. Participants are randomised to 2intervention groups. Group 1 receives a home program for 8 weeks. Group 2 receives a home program for 4 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A home program is a list of suggested exercises, environmental modifications and parent teaching strategies provided to the family as a treatment plan aimed at reaching the parent's goals for thier child's health. The parent can self-select how long they carry out the home program for and record this on a log book provided by the investigator. Ealier research shows that families typically choose between 5-40 minutes per day, with a mean of 13 minutes (Novak, Cusick &amp; Lowe, 2005).</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 3 is a control group and does not receive any intervention. They will be provided with a home program at the end of the 8 weeks of 'control period' so as to maintain their blinded allocation.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with cerebral palsy benefit from therapy that is goal-directed in their daily activities and environment. It is hypothesised that their parents contribution via home exercise programming is also important for goal achievement.  This hypothesis has not been tested in a randomised controlled trial, the appropriate research design for studying intervention effectiveness. Benefits of home programs have been shown in my earlier Masters pilot study, which lacked a controlled comparison group. When measuring children, any improvements observed may be due to maturation and therefore a control group is the preferable design. This study will address this gap</summary>
