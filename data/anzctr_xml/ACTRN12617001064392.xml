    <interventions>The aim of the study is to evaluates the efficacy and safety of artesunate+amodiaquine and artemether+lumefantrine with the following dosages:
Artesunate-amodiaquine: 4 mg/kg artesunate + 10mg/kg amodiaquine once daily for 3 consecutive days will be given.
Artemether-lumefantrine containing 20 mg artemether+ 120 mg lumefantrine in each tablet will be given twice daily for three days according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. The total target dose ranges are 5-24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29-144 mg/kg bw of lumefantrine.

All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The two drugs will be tested sequentially. The patient will be given artesunate+amodiaquine or artemether+lumefantrine and will be followed up for 28 days.
</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group.
The study is one arm cohort prospective assessment for each drug.
Patients in each site will be enrolled first to artesunate+amodiaquine untill a sample of 88 is reached. Then the subsequent patients will be recruited to the artemether+lumefantrine untill the target sample size of 88 is reached. </comparator>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
As the treatment failure rate to ASAQ and AL is assumed 5%.  At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients per drug per site must be enrolled in the study.  With an additional 20% to allow for lost to follow-up and withdrawal during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients per site should be enrolled in the study. 

Analysis of data
The WHO excel software programs will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of Artesunate +Amodiaquine and Artemether+Lumefatrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Saclepea-Mah Comprehensive Health Center (Saclepea-Mah District, Nimba County), Rennie Hospital (Kakata District, Margibi County) and Sinje Health Center (Garwula District, Cape Mount County) in Liberia.
Purpose: To assess the efficacy of the current first and/or second line treatment policy.
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of Artesunate +Amodiaquine and Artemether+Lumefatrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.
Study Sites: Saclepea-Mah District in Nimba County, Kakata District in Margibi County and Garwula District, Cape Mount County.
Study Period: September 2017 to June 2018 
Study Design: Two cohorts prospective study in sequential enrollments.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 to 59 months with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. 
Sample Size: 88 patients per site for each drug. 
Treatment(s) and follow-up: Artesunate+Amodiaquine (ASAQ) daily dose for three days and Artemether+Lumefatrine (AL) twice daily dose for three days will be administered. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events
Exploratory endpoint: to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for lumefantrine and artemisinin resistance.
