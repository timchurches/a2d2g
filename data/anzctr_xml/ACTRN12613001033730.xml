  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participating families will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control condition. Halfway through the trial, the Intervention group will receive an education booklet containing their own family health history pedigree with health history of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes highlighted. Information for the family health history pedigree is provided by the parent generation in each family  at baseline, each enrolled parent is encouraged to talk with family members and then complete a questionnaire to identify their first and second degree relatives, their age (if living) and to indicate if each of these family members has ever received a diagnosis for heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer or colorectal cancer (and if so, the age at diagnosis). This information is entered into Progeny software program, which produces a pedigree diagram of listed family members, with any disease status highlighted. Intervention families receive this information three months after baseline, control families receive the information after they have completed the study.

The family is sent the booklet in the post and participants identify themselves as being at either average or above average risk for a chronic disease. They are followed up a few days' later by phone call to discuss the information sent. The booklet also contains information about familial and environmental risk factors, and screening and prevention strategies.

The time between baseline and follow-up is six months. Therefore, for intervention families, the time between baseline and intervention is three months, and the time between intervention and follow-up is three months.

At follow-up, intervention families are asked, via questionnaire, if they could determine their disease risk using the booklet and pedigree sent to them. They are also asked if they shared this information with any other family members, and if so, with whom they shared the information. In addition, following the trial, a subsample of 18 intervention families will be interviewed to determine efficacy of the health information booklet and pedigree to encourage change to more healthful behaviours.</interventions>

      <outcome>Dietary choice</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and again at follow-up (six months after baseline), all participants are asked to report (via questionnaire) frequency of fruit, vegetable, fast food and snack intake over the past 7 days.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and again at follow-up (six months after baseline), all participants are asked to report (via questionnaire)  the time they spent doing vigorous and moderate exercise, time spent walking and time spent sitting over the past 7 days.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intentions to engage in healthy lifestyle and eating behaviours</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and again at follow-up (six months after baseline), all participants are invited to complete (via questionnaire) questions indicating their satisfaction of their own level of fruit &amp; veg, and fibre consumption, physical activity level alcohol consumption and smoking, as well as their intention to increase fruit &amp; veg, and fibre consumption, physical activity, and to decrease alcohol consumption nand smoking behaviour. For those behaviours that they intend to change, paticipants are also asked to indicate via likert scale, how confident they feel in achieving these intentions. In addition, at follow up, participants are asked if they have made any changes to these behaviours over the past 6 months.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sharing of health-related information within the family</outcome>
      <timepoint>At follow-up (six months post baseline), all adult participants in the intervention group are asked to indicate with whom in their family and social network they shared the intervention materials.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adopting a healthy diet is an effective way to reduce overweight and obesity and associated diseases, including some cancers. Dietary habits are primarily established and maintained in family environments, with influence potentially disseminating across generations and across diverse types of family relationships, although these processes may differ between ethnic groups. Additionally, genetic and environmental risk factors for overweight and disease cluster in families, making them an important target for dietary-focused disease prevention. The study will test the effectiveness of provision of family health history infromation as a motivator for diet and lifestyle improvement. This study will also assess how influence processes within family networks can best be harnessed to promote healthy dietary behaviour, across some of Australias largest ethnic groups.</summary>
