    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ACT-451840:
Other interventions - Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes:
Treatment: drugs - Artemether 20 mg and lumefantrine 120mg combination tablet:
Treatment: drugs - Primaquine:

Experimental: ACT-451840 500 mg - All the participants were infected with Plasmodium falciparum parasites (malaria) using malaria-infected human erythrocytes. When the parasitemia reached 1000 counts/mL, all the participants received 500 mg of ACT-451840 as a single oral dose. Compulsory commencement of treatment with Riamet® (artemether-lumefantrine) to ensure complete clearance of any gametocytes, occurred 16 days after ACT-451840 administration (or earlier if required) for all participants. Primaquine was to be administered as a single dose only in participants for whom gametocytes were still identified after administration of Riamet® rescue medication


Treatment: drugs: ACT-451840:
ACT-451840 500 mg was provided in 100 mL amber glass bottles formulated as a powder for oral suspension. The ACT-451840 suspension was prepared extemporaneously by addition of 25 mL of water and administered orally under fed condition.

Other interventions: Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes:
Each participant was inoculated on Day 0 with approximately 1,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously.

Treatment: drugs: Artemether 20 mg and lumefantrine 120mg combination tablet:
Rescue treatment to ensure clearance of Plasmodium falciparum comprising six doses of four tablets (total course of 24 tablets) given over a period of 60 hours. Each dose of tablets administered orally was immediately followed by food or drinks rich in fat (e.g., milk).

Treatment: drugs: Primaquine:
Rescue treatment to ensure clearance of Plasmodium falciparum, to be taken as a single oral 45 mg dose with food only if gametocytes were identified after administration of Riamet® rescue medication.
