  <interventions>
    <interventions>Teacher professional development intervention focusing on the use of a game centered approach for teaching primary Physical Education. 
Intervention involves: 
1- Teacher professional learning: 
A 2.5 hour theory based group professional learning seminar covering: i) Physical activity research findings and theoretical grounding for improving students skills, ii) Game Centered Approach (GCA) background, iii) GCA comparison to a direct instruction methodology and the connection of a GCA to the existing NSW PDHPE syllabus, iv) using a constraints led approach to guide a PE lesson, v) the use of questioning to assist student cognition, vi) concepts of quality PE teaching including Active Learning Time (ALT), classroom management for improved ALT and enhanced skills learning, and identification and use of Teachable Moments in PE classes. 
The professional learning component of the PLUNGE intervention is based on the training model of PD, in which content is delivered to teachers in a passive manner, with controlled, standardized content delivery.

2- Teacher mentoring:
Consultation regarding the presentation of researcher developed GCA curriculum across the 6 week delivery phase, and in-class scaffolding and feedback of curriculum delivery for the first 4 weeks of the program. 
Mentoring ensures the teachers involved understand the format and purpose of the designed lessons, and for teachers to observe, undertake, problem solve and trouble shoot more effective PE practice with an academic partner, in the authentic context of their own scheduled physical education lessons (4 x 1 hour). Mentoring begins the week following the professional learning group seminar (1 week between seminar and mentoring).</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment wait-list control group.
The control group undertake the standard physical education lessons that were planned across the intervention period. The wait-list control receive the professional development intervention with two mentoring sessions after the completion of follow-up assessments (8 weeks from baseline testing).</comparator>

Sample size:As this was the first intervention focused on improving FMS using GCA-based pedagogy, our power calculation was based on a previous FMS intervention targeting motivational climate in the primary school setting (Martin, Rudisill, and Hastie 2009). Martin and colleagues reported a moderate effect size for their intervention on object control motor skill proficiency using the Test of Gross Motor Development II (TGMD-2). Using an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%, it was determined that a sample size of approximately 104 was needed to detect a between group difference of 1 unit (SD = 1.8) for the TGMD-2 throw skill test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to report the effects of a Game Centered Approach professional development program for improving Teaching quality, active learning time, fundamental movement skills, physical self perception and student perceived motivational climate. 

The Professional Learning for Understanding Games Education (PLUNGE) program was developed to enhance the practical PE teaching skills of primary school teachers using a Game Centered Approach in an authentic teaching environment. We hypothesized that teachers in the PLUNGE intervention, compared to those in the control group, would display higher quality teaching and greater active learning time in classes, with students displaying more favorable changes in fundamental movement skills, physical self-perception and perceived motivational climate over the study period.</summary>
