  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part A (Dose-escalation, pre-specified cohorts 1 and 2):
Cohort 1: 2 mg GS-5801 (1 x 2 mg tablet) or placebo once daily (Days 1 to 7) - fasted
Cohort 2: 6 mg GS-5801 (3 x 2 mg tablet) or placebo once daily (Days 1 to 7) - fasted

Part B (Adaptive cohorts 3 - 6):
Cohort 3 - 6: 2 mg to 100 mg GS-5801 or placebo once daily (Days 1 to 7) - fasted
Dose selection will be based on safety, tolerability, PK and PD data from previously completed cohorts.

Fasted - no food or drinks except water, for at least 10 hours

The investigator will maintain an accurate inventory of all study drug(s). Each dose of the study drug(s) administered at the study center will be administered by qualified study center staff. The dose of study drug(s) administered to subjects in the clinic under the supervision of staff will be accurately recorded, which indicates the date and quantity of each dosage formulation dispensed to individual subjects.
Used and unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, are to be returned to the shipping facility from which it came for destruction following drug accountability and drug inventory reconciliation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo to match (PTM) GS 5801 tablets are identical in size, shape, color and appearance to the corresponding active strength GS 5801 tablets. The PTM GS-5801 tablet cores contain commonly used excipients including lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and magnesium stearate.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase 1 study entails administration of GS-5801 to subjects with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) for the first time with the objective of evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of GS 5801, and thereby determining the clinical pharmacology profile and antiviral activity of GS 5801 to evaluate if it is suitable for further clinical development as a treatment for CHB.  The results from this study will form the basis for further evaluation of GS 5801 and dose selection for upcoming studies in subjects with CHB. 

The study will proceed in two parts, with the first part (Part A) evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of GS-5801 administered once daily for 7 days  in the fasted state via a pre specified dose escalation through 2 cohorts. The second part (Part B) is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of GS-5801 with adaptive dose selection (up to 100 mg administered once daily for 7 days). The doses  evaluated in the adaptive cohorts (Part B) will be selected based on safety and available PK and PD data (up to day 14) from Part A (Cohorts 1-2) and available safety, PK and PD data from previously conducted cohorts from Study GS US 405 2064</summary>
