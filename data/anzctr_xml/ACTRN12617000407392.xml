  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1 - adult sibling stem cell transplant donors
Adult sibling stem cell transplant donors of planned allogeneic transplant recipients will complete three semi-structured interviews and provide three samples of saliva (as a measure of stress) at the following time points: 
(T1) Within 2 weeks before the stem cell mobilisation commences; 
(T2) Within 24 hours (pre- or post-donation) of the donors stem cell collection and; 
(T3) Within 2 weeks of the 30-day anniversary of the stem cell collection.      

Group 2 - Adult sibling lymphocyte infusion donors
Adult sibling lymphocyte donors of planned lymphocyte infusions recipients are included in this study to consider any potential effect granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) may have on salivary alpha-amylase levels. Sibling lymphocyte donors will provide three samples of saliva at the following time points: 
(T1) Within 2 weeks before the lymphocyte collection; 
(T2) Within 24 hours (pre- or post-donation) of the donors lymphocyte collection and; 
(T3) Within 2 weeks of the 30-day anniversary of the lymphocyte collection

Group 3 - Bone Marrow Transplant Coordinators
Bone Marrow Transplant Coordinators will complete one interview towards the end of the study. The interview will will explore the nature of their role, their perceptions of the psychosocial needs of donors and their role (if any) in responding to donor distress.

    <comparator>Adult sibling lymphocyte infusion donors are included in this study to consider any potential effect of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (GCSF) on salivary alpha-amylase levels.

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of historical sibling stem cell donors at Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital demonstrates that an estimated 25 sibling stem cell donors are recruited per year. Enrollment is expected to be completed within 20 months, providing a potential sample size of 41 donors. Up to 10 sibling stem cell donors will be recruited from the Westmead Hospital. Based on previous prospective studies of sibling donors, we expect a participation rate of 50%. As such, we expect that 51 sibling stem cell donors will be eligible to participate across the two sites and assume that 25 sibling stem cell donors will agree to participate.

A total of 3 Bone Marrow Transplant Coordinators will be recruited from the two sites. Up to 6 sibling lymphocyte infusion donors will be recruited from the two sites to pilot the effect of GCSF on saliva.

Therefore, the target sample size is comprised of 25 sibling stem cell donors, 6 sibling lymphocyte donors, and 3 BMT Coordinators, providing a total of 34 study participants. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: While World Marrow Donor Association Standards ensure consistency in the assessment and care of unrelated haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors, no such criteria exist for sibling HSC donors. Unlike unrelated donors, sibling donors are actively involved in the transplant process and witness first-hand the changes in their siblings health. Their lived experience is thus likely to be very different from that of unrelated donors and it is important to understand and address their needs.

Aim: The aim of this PhD project is to identify potential predictors of psychosocial distress and unmet needs of adult sibling HSC donors, to develop information resources for health
professionals and develop and pilot test an internet-based self-help program for donors.

Methods: Participants are adults undergoing HSC donation for a sibling recipient at the RBWH and Westmead Hospital, Sydney. Donors complete 3 interviews and provide 3 samples of saliva (as a measure of stress): (1) 2 weeks pre-HSC collection; (2) within 24hrs of HSC collection and; (3) 30 days post-HSC collection. An interview with BMT Coordinators will explore the nature of their role, their perceptions of the psychosocial needs of donors and their role (if any) in responding to donor distress.

Hypotheses: As research into adult sibling donors is limited, findings from research with younger sibling HSC donors and adult bone marrow donors were used to make the following predictions:
1. Donor perceptions of the closeness of the relationship with the recipient will be associated with post-donation reactions such as guilt, responsibility and stress.
2. Perceived adequacy of preparation and emotional support will correlate with post-donation reactions such as concern for own health, physical pain/discomfort, guilt and responsibility.
3. Donors with poorer self-evaluated health-related quality of life will report more negative
reactions throughout the process.
4. Donors of recipients who experience adverse clinical events (such as development of graft versus-host-disease) will experience increased distress and anxiety.
5. Donor reactions such as stress/physical pain will correlate with high salivary a-amylase
levels throughout the process.

Key indicators that identify risk of HSC donation-related distress will be used to develop an internet-based self-help program that seeks to reduce sibling HSC donor distress and may be appropriate for integration within the health system. We aim to assess acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy and inform the development of a large post-doctoral study which will be required to validate the tool.</summary>
