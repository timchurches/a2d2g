  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allergic diseases represent a major health issue worldwide. Mainstay treatment is allergen
      avoidance and pharmacotherapy for symptom relief. Allergen immunotherapy offers the
      advantages of specific treatment with long lasting efficacy, and can modify the course of
      disease. However, use of this treatment is restricted by the high risk of adverse events
      especially in asthmatics. Other, better tolerated, routes of allergen administration than the
      current conventional subcutaneous route (SCIT) have been investigated including sublingual
      (SLIT). However, the immune parameters of SLIT have not been examined. We propose conducting
      a randomised, placebo-controlled study of a commercially-available SLIT for house dust mite
      (HDM) allergy to investigate induction of relevant T cell regulatory immune mechanisms. The
      first year will be followed by an optional open label extension period. Immunoregulatory
      cytokine synthesis and T cell phenotype and function (real time PCR and flow cytometry) will
      be examined. This project will provide important fundamental knowledge on which to base
      improved and greater application of this potentially curative treatment for allergy. SLIT has
      the potential advantage of home administration and suitability for patients with asthma who
      are currently unable to access many of the allergen desensitising regimens.</summary>
