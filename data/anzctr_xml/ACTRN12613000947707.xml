    <interventions>Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS)
TBS is a type of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) where high frequency (30 to 50 Hz) of magnetic pulse is given to the superficial areas of the brain in a short period of time.

In the current study, in each session participants will receive a single stimulation course (of either active or sham) lasting 3 mins. Therefore, participants will attend for two sessions (one active and one sham) at least 72 hours apart. </interventions>
    <comparator>sham TBS.  Sham is achieved by administering the same stimulation parameters but by angling the coil away from the scalp. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a blinded study. The participant will not know what type of stimulation they recieve. The stimulation condition will be counterbalanced across participants. A spreadsheet containing an active or sham allocation for each  session randomised across participants is prepared by the chief investigator prior to recruitment commencing. Following the screening process and once the participant is enrolled in the study randomization takes place. At this time the Chief Investigator, who will be unblinded, will from this spreadsheet assign the order of the stimulation sessions (i.e. active then sham or sham then active).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to investigate whether brain stimulation techniques will lead to an improvement of working memory (working memory refers to the temporary storage and processing of information) in healthy volunteers. 

We are conducting a study to see whether TMS applied at the front of the brain can improve performance on tests of working memory.  The type of TMS we are using is called Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS). Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a type of TMS where the magnetic pulses are applied in very short bursts (three pulses at a time) at a high frequency (30-50 pulses a second).  </summary>
