  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Persistent airway inflammation with mucus retention in patients with chronic airway disorders such as COPD and bronchiectasis may lead to frequent exacerbations, reduced lung function and poor quality of life. This study investigates if long-term humidification therapy with high flow fully humidified air at 37 C through nasal cannulae can improve these clinical
outcomes in this group of patients.</summary>
