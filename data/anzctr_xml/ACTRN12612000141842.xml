  <interventions>
    <interventions>Young people (ages 13-16) attending alternative education schools will receive a 2 hour cooking session, weekly over a school term (10 weeks). Sessions are administered as a group and coordinated by culinary tutors. During the cooking sessions, students participate in the preparation of a healthy meal. Participants share the meal communally once prepared.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison schools will carry on as per usual; a delayed intervention will be offered to comparison schools upon completion of the initial schools.</comparator>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All community-based alternative education schools (n=7) within a consortium are invited to participate. One school agreed to participate in the feasibility study and will not be randomized. The remaining 6 schools are randomized to receive the intervention in either term 1  or term 2 of the school year. Allocation was not concealed. All schools will receive the intervention, the randomization specified at what time (e.g. in which school term).

The feasibility study was conducted in 2011 with one school. The feasibility study was conducted to determine the acceptability of the cooking sessions and foods prepared among students and staff. The feasibility study was not registered with ANZCTR.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation procedures were followed through a "draw of the hat" where schools were drawn from a hat to determine which term their intervention was scheduled for.</sequence>
