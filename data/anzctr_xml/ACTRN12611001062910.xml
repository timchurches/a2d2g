  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a non-comparator trial to test the safety and efficacy of corneal collagen crosslinking in cases of progressive keratoconus in the paediatric age group. Corneal collagen-crosslinking involves the use of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and UVA (ultraviolet A) light. Riboflavin 0.1% will be applied to the cornea every 1-3 minutes for 30 minutes, then for a further 30 minutes during UVA treatment. Corneal pachymetry will be performed every 10 minutes, and if the pachymetry is below 400um, isotonic riboflavin (10mg/2mL) will replace 0.1% riboflavin. The UV-X device (IROC, Switzerland) will be used to deliver UVA at 3mW/cm2 for 30 minutes. 

 
This is a single treatment, and participants will be followed up at intervals over a period of 10 years to assess for safety and efficacy.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of corneal collagen crosslinking in young persons aged 10-15 years and 11 months who have been diagnosed with progressive keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition that causes distortion of the cornea (the clear, front window of the eye) that results in reduced vision. In the early stages, vision can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses, but in the more advanced stages a cornean transplant may be required. Collagen cross-linking is a treatment involving the use of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and ultraviolet light that has been shown to slow the progression of keratoconus in adults with a low risk of complications. We would like to study the safety and effectiveness of crosslinking in children.</summary>
