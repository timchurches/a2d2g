  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this investigator-masked randomised crossover study, the tear film breakup time of participants will be assessed in triplicate, with and without sodium fluorescein instillation, in a randomised order, by two independent observers. A 30-minute interval between measurements will ensure subsidence of reflex tearing.

In the intervention arm, sodium fluorescein was applied to the bulbar conjunctiva from a fluorescein impregnated strip (Haag-Streit) wetted with 1 drop (10-20Âµl) of saline and shaken to remove excess fluid. Following fluorescein instillation, participants were then instructed to blink naturally over a 1 minute period to facilitate even distribution over the ocular surface. Tear film breakup time was then assessed in triplicate under blue light with a Wratten yellow filter.
</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control arm, tear film breakup time was measured using non-invasive automated Keratograph 5M (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany) without sodium fluroescein instillation.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The distributions of tear film breakup time measurements will be assessed using the DAgostino-Pearson omnibus normality test, and then undergo logarithmic transformation before further parametric analysis if necessary. Intra-group and inter-group comparisons of medians will be conducted with paired and unpaired t-tests, respectively, and variances analysed by F-tests. Pearson's correlation anlaysis between breakup time measurements and Ocular Surface Disease Index will be peformed and Bland-Altman analysis will be conducted between breakup time measurements. A receiver operative characteristic curve will be constructed to assess the diagnostic ability of the breakup time measurements in detecting whether subjects has dry eye disease. The area under the curve (C-statistic) and diagnostic accuracy values at the Youdens optimal diagnostic cut-off were then calculated. All tests will be two-tailed and p &lt; 0.05 considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares two commonly used clinical methods of tear film breakup time measurement. Participants from two age and gender matched groups, with and without dry eye disease, will be enrolled into a prospective, randomised, investigator-masked, crossover study. Two independent observers measured tear film breakup time in triplicate, respectively, in a randomised order, following fluorescein instillation under blue light, and using non-invasive automated Keratograph 5M readings. A 30-minute interval between measurements ensured subsidence of reflex tearing. The median and distribution of breakup time measurements will be compared, and Bland-Altman and Pearson correlation analysis will be conducted. A receiver operative characteristic curve will then be constructed to assess the diagnostic ability of the breakup time measurements in detecting whether subjects has dry eye disease.</summary>
