  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single application of strain-counterstrain an osteopathic technique.

The treatment lasted for about 5 minutes. The treatment was administered by a trained manual therapist with over 10 years experience using strain counterstrain.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single application of sham strain-counterstrain an osteopathic technique.
The practitioner placed the subjects arm in a position where no change in pain intensity was reported on palpation and no noticeable change in tissue tension was observed by palpation over the tenderpoint. The procedure lasted for about 5 minutes.

    <concealment>All subjects who met inclusion criteria were randomised to either the intervention group or the sham group. Allocation was concealed from research assistant and participant. Allocation concealed by use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Within-group differences assessed with paired t-tests. Between-group differences assessed with independent t-tests. Analysis of effect sizes by magnitude-based inferences.

Prior to the study, calculations showed that a sample size of 10 participants per group would be required to detect a change in VAS of an effect size of 1.2 assuming 80% statistical
power and alpha = 5%. An additional 2 participants per group was targeted to allow for possible withdrawals from the study.</statisticalmethods>
