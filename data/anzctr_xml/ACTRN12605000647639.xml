  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project is associated with a similar correspondence-based treatment for alcohol misuse. It is a randomised controlled trial in which participants are assigned to standard care by their GP or standard care plus correspondence-based treatment for either alcohol or alcohol and depression.  After three months, those in the standard care only group are randomly assigned to one of the two experimental groups.  The correspondence-based treatments are based on empirically supported cognitive behaviour therapy and comprise four weekly and four fortnightly letters.  The alcohol only treatment covers topics such as motivation enhancement, goal setting, dealing with urges, planning for high risk situations, problem solving and relapse prevention.  The alcohol and depression treatment group contains the same material on alcohol, but also addresses depression in each letter.</interventions>
