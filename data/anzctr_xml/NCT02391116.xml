    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of response (DOR) - DOR is defined as the time from the date of first observed overall response (CR or PR) until first subsequent disease progression (PD) or until death (if death occurs before progression is documented) caused by disease progression. Duration of response will be defined for responders only (i.e., patients with CR or PR).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
