  <interventions>
    <interventions>Compression through the use of different methods of application of cohesive bandage - 3M Coban - for the management of hand oedema
Group One - spiral Coban application to the fingers and to the hand
Group Two - spiral Coban application to the fingers and figure-of-eight application to the hand
Group Three - cylindrical pinch application to the fingers and spiral application to the hand
Group Four - cylindrical pinch application to the fingers and figure-of-eight application to the hand
Each application method will be applied for a 24 hour period prior to reassessment and change of dressings, and that method will be reapplied at the change of dressing. The compressive bandaging will be applied by the ward physiotherapists as per the allocated method. The compression bandaging will be assessed prior to the next removal of dressings to monitor adherence.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control - Norco Therapeutic compression glove
- Full finger glove that extends over the wrist.
- Made of Lycra and nylon
Participants allocated to the active control group will be required to wear a compression glove over the burns dressings. Participants will wear the glove for a 24 hour duration prior to re-assessment of oedema at the change of dressings, and then reapplied. The glove will be applied by the ward physiotherapists according to the participant allocation.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hand range of movement with compression in situ

      <timepoint>Upon initial application of the compression
- Reassessment prior to the removal of the compression 24 hours later</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Integrity of compression
- Burn wound exudate leakage from dressings may result in a loss of integrity of the cohesive bandage applied to manage oedema
- Photographic recording of compressive dressings to record wound leakage into dressings
- Recording of number of separations of the compressive bandaging</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 24 hours post application of the dressings, prior to change of dressings</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of intervention
- The time taken to apply each method of compression will be recorded, and calculated against the salary of the physiotherapist applying the compression as a measure of cost of time
- The cost of the materials used to apply the compression will be recorded</outcome>
      <timepoint>At initial intervention for oedema management</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient reported outcome
- The patient will complete the shortened version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (Quick-DASH) 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>- Quick-DASH will be recorded at baseline, and at each change of compression (ie 24 hours after application) </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure exerted by compression, as measured by pressure sensors placed beneath the cohesive bandage. 
Pressure will be assessed at rest, with active hand range of movement, and with passive range of movement</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pressure assessment upon initial application of compression, and prior to removal of compression at 24 hours post initial application</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parallel randomised controlled trial of different methods of application of cohesive bandage for the management of hand burn oedema, against a control method of an off the shelf compression glove. 
Primary outcome measures will be change in oedema as measured by Bioimpedance Spectroscopy and volumetry, which will also be a validation of BIS for the measure of hand oedema in a burns population, 
Secondary outcomes include hand range of movement, integrity of compression, pressure exerted by compression application technique, and patient self-reported hand function.
