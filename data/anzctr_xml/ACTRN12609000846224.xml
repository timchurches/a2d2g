  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Characterization of the pharmacokinetics (absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination) of the components of the antimalarial drugs Artequick and Coarsucam in healthy Vietnamese volunteers will provide important data for dose optimization and measurement of interindividual variability in plasma drug concentrations.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two groups of 22 healthy male Vietnamese volunteers will be recruited to receive 3-day courses of either Artequick or Coarsucam. Group 1 healthy volunteers (n=22) will be administered a daily dose of two tablets of Artequick (each tablet contains 62.5 mg artemisinin and 375 mg piperaquine) for 3 days. Group 2 healthy volunteers (n=22) will be administered a daily dose of two tablets of Coarsucam (each tablet contains 100 mg artesunate and 270 mg amodiaquine) for 3 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>The tolerability and safety of Artequick and Coarsucam in healthy subjects will be compared. Also the ex vivo pharmacodynamics of plasma artemisinin-piperaquine and artesunate-amodiaquine concentrations collected from the volunteers will be compared against the chloroquine-sensitive D6 and chloroquine-resistant K1 strains of Plasmodium falciparum, in vitro.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pharmacokinetics of the components of Artequick (artemisinin-piperaquine) and Coarsucam (artesunate-amodiaquine) will be derived from plasma concentration versus time curves generated from the analysis of plasma samples collected from healthy volunteers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For pharmacokinetic analysis plasma samples will be measured at day 0 (pre-dose), 1, 3, and 6 hours after the first and second day of Artequick or Coarsucam administration. Plasma sample will also be measured before the third dose (day 2) and then at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after the last dose. Additional plasma samples will be measured at days 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 after commencement of Artequick administration and at days 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 and 28 after starting Coarsucam administration.

Plasma concentrations of artemisinin, piperaquine, artesunate and its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin and amodiaquine and its active metabolite desethylamodiaquine will be measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental analysis will be used to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drugs.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The tolerability and safety of the two ACTs will be compared. Possible adverse events can be gastrointestinal disturbances such as vomiting, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Other adverse events can be abnormal biochemical and haematological indices.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be monitored before drug administration and at 24 hours after each dose.

Blood samples for biochemical and haematological analysis will be collected before drug administration and at day 7 after commencement of the 3-day course.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ex vivo antimalarial activivity will be carried out on plasma artemisinin-piperaquine and artesunate-amodiaquine concentrations collected from the volunteers against two Plasmodium falciparum isolates (D6 and K1).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for ex vivo antimalarial activity will be collected collected at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 3, and 6 hours after the first and second day of Artequick or Coarsucam administration.  Blood samples will also be collected immediately before the third day of drug administration and then at  1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 120, 288, 456 and 624 hours after the last dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The inhibitory concentration (IC90 for spiked drug samples) and inhibitory dilution (ID90 for patient plasma samples) will be determined using the in vitro tritiated-hypoxanthine assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>ID90 values will be determined on plasma samples at 0 (pre-dose), 1, 3, and 6 hours after the first and second day of Artequick or Coarsucam administration. Plasma samples will also be collected immediately before the third day of drug administration and then at  1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 120, 288, 456 and 624 hours after the last dose.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although Artequick (artemisinin-piperaquine) and Coarcusam (artesunate-amodiaquine) are currently being tested for efficacy in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria there is a paucity of information on the pharmacokinetics of the two artemisinin based combination therapies. The purpose of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics and ex vivo antimalarial activity of the fixed-dosed combinations of Artequick and Coarsucam in healthy Vietnamese volunteers. The pharmacokinetic data will be used for dose optimization and to measure the interindividual variability in plasma drug concentrations.  The ex vivo antimalarial assessment of the two ACTs will provide information on the relationship between blood drug concentrations and parasiticidal effect, in vitro, without the confounding factor of immunity.</summary>
