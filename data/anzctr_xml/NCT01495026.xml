          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

             by the following Australian guidelines:

        Males: An average weekly intake greater than 21 units or an average daily intake greater
        than 3 units. One unit is equivalent to 270 mL of full strength beer, 470 mL of light beer,
        30 mL of spirits and 100 mL of wine.

        Subjects must be able and willing to abstain from beverages and foods containing alcohol 24
        hours prior to and during the dosing day.

          -  Consumption of red wine, grapefruit juice, grapefruit and related hybrids from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an open-label, randomized, single dose, multi-stage, cross-over study in
      healthy male subjects of North East Asian ancestry. The aims are to:

        -  evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of several formulations of a fixed dose
           combination (FDC) capsule of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride (0.5 mg/0.2 mg)
           relative to co-administration of dutasteride 0.5 mg capsules and tamsulosin
           hydrochloride 0.2 mg tablets in the fasted state in order to define a formulation which
           is bioequivalent to a 0.2 mg orally disintegrating tamsulosin tablet, (Harnal-D Tablets)

        -  determine the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of tamsulosin in the FDC
           product which is assessed to be bioequivalent to Harnal-D Tablets in the fasted state

        -  assess the effect of water on the relative bioavailability of tamsulosin in Harnal-D
           Tablets in the fasted state

        -  assess the safety and tolerability of dosing with the different FDC capsule formulations
           Subjects will receive single oral doses in at least one treatment period; treatment
           periods will be separated by a 5-10 day washout period. Blood samples for
           pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken at regular intervals after dosing. Safety will be
           assessed by measurement of blood pressure, heart rate and review of adverse events. Each
           stage of the study will enrol 18 subjects to ensure 16 complete. Subjects may consent to
           participate in more than one stage.</summary>
