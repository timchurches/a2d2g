    <statisticalmethods>The total sample size for this study is 70 participants.  In either of the cohorts, an objective tumour response rate of 5% or lower would be of little interest whereas an objective tumour response rate of 20% or more would be considered worthy of further research.  Using a Simon's 2-stage minimax design with 90% power and 10% significance level requires 32 evaluable participants in each cohort.  An additional 3 participants per cohort will be recruited to allow for ineligible participants and missing data.
The study will be analysed by intention to treat including all registered participants for efficacy analyses and all participants who received at least one dose of study treatment for safety analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of durvalumab for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with advanced endometrial carcinoma which is suitable for chemotherapy. 

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive an intravenous dose of durvalumab once every 28 days until the cancer is seen to have progressed, or until treatment side effects become intolerable.  Participants will undergo continuous monitoring for side effects throughout treatment, as well as completing questionnaires and blood tests every four weeks, and CT scans every 8 to 12 weeks for the duration of treatment.

It is hoped that this trial will provide information on whether durvalumab is safe and effective for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer.</summary>
