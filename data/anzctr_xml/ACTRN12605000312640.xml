  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Palmar abduction of the carpometacarpal joint will be measured with a device specifically designed for the purpose which uses a wheel to apply a standardised torque to the carpometacarpal joint. The carpometacarpal angle will be measured with a goniometer, the centre of which was fixed to the centre of the wheel. Both thumbs will be measured
in all participants,</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured immediately before and after the study period to both experimental and control participants.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants' perceptions about treatment effectiveness was assessed using 5 questions. Questions 1-3 were measured on a 10-point visual analogue scale with 1 was not at all happy and 10 was extremely happy. Questions 4-5 required a yes/no response.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first three questions were administered immediately before and after the study period to both experimental and control participants. The last two questions were administered immediately after the intervention period to the experimental participants only.</timepoint>
