  <interventions>
    <interventions>8 modules of Self-Help Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy provided via a fully on-line automated program. Modules completed at pace of participant within a maximum time period of 2 months. Psychoeducation, behavioural experiments (exposure) and cognitive-restructring make up the intervention. Each module is a mixture of psychoeducation via written material and video vignettes along with interactive exercises and quizes to ensure concepts are learnt. Upon completion of each module an email is automatically generated back to the parent/guardian explaining the module completed and providing within the body of the email written information regarding helpful strategies to support the child in their treatment completion. </interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-esteem Scale: Self-esteem has been found to have strong relationships with levels of happiness and school achievement. This 10-item scale measures general self-esteem and has excellent reliability and validity (Rosenberg, 1979).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Strengths and Difficulties: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-S) (Goodman, 1999). The student version of the Extended Strengths &amp; Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-S) (Goodman, 1999) will measure child reports of internalising problems.  The SDQ-S, a 25-item scale measures internalizing &amp; externalising symptoms, &amp; the burden of these symptoms. It contains five 5-item subscales, hyperactivity, emotional symptoms (anxiety &amp; depression), conduct problems, peer problems, &amp; pro-social behaviour.  The impact section includes social impairment in home life, friendships, classroom learning &amp; leisure activities. Reliability has been established with internal consistency coefficients of .82 for the total scale &amp; .75 for the emotional problems subscale.  </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall goal of this project is to develop an online CBT based self-help program for children and adolescents with OCD which incorporates families and carers in the treatment plan. This will fill the current gap between psychoeducation only and high intensity face-to-face assessment and therapy. Consistent with the proposed actions of the research plan, this program will improve the support given to and build the resilience of families and carers of young people with OCD, expand community based youth mental health services, and provide an accessible and targeted treatment to those young people who do not require immediate high intensity intervention.  </summary>
