  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participating secondary schools will be randomly allocated to one of four groups. 

Group 1:
The Control condition: One group will serve as the control group and receive their usual school drug and mental health education. The following groups will receive one of the following three study interventions:

Group 2:
The Climate Schools-Substance Use (CS-SU) intervention aims to reduce the use of Australias most commonly used licit and illicit drugs: alcohol and cannabis, and prevent related harms. The program consists of twelve 40-minute lessons delivered as part of the Year 8 (Year 9 in QLD) Health and Physical Education syllabus. The first six lessons will be delivered in Term 1, 2014 during consecutive Health and Physical education classes (approximately 1 lesson per week). The remaining six lessons will be delivered in Term 3, 2014 in consecutive Health and Physical education classes (approximately 1 lesson per week).

The first part of each lesson is completed individually over the internet. During this part of the lesson students are engaged through cartoon story lines that impart information about the short and long term effects of alcohol and cannabis, normative alcohol and cannabis use, refusal skills, and first aid. The second part of each lesson is a group or class activity delivered by the teacher, and reinforces the information in the cartoons, while allowing interactive communication between students. Teachers are provided with a manual containing the activities, implementation guidelines, links to the education syllabus and summaries for each lesson. The first six lessons focus specifically on alcohol and are delivered approximately six months prior to the remaining six lessons which focus on cannabis.

Group 3:
The Climate Schools-Mental Health (CS-MH) intervention aims to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms, and to prevent the development of associated disorders later in life. The program consists of six 40-minute lessons delivered as part of the Year 9 (Year 10 in QLD) Health and Physical Education syllabus. The six lessons will be delivered in Term 1,2015 in consecutive Health and Physical education classes (approximately 1 lesson per week). The lessons are structured in the same way as the Climate Schools-Substance Use intervention. The content of the lessons focuses on identifying and effectively dealing with anxiety and depression symptoms. The six lessons are designed to be run consecutively within one school Term.

Group 4:
The Climate Schools Combined (CSC) Intervention will deliver both the Climate Schools-Substance Use and the Climate Schools-Mental Health interventions consecutively, as described above. The CSC intervention simultaneously targets mental health and substance use, as it is known that the two commonly co-occur and share common risk factors. 

For those groups receiving an intervention, teachers will be asked to complete a log book at the end of the intervention to document adherence to the intervention and record which activities they implemented in the classroom.  As students are required to log in to complete the study intervention online records will indicate student completion rates.

Regardless of group, teachers will be asked at the end of each year during the study period to record any other drug, alcohol or mental health education that was delivered to students participating in the trial, that was in addition to the Climate Schools courses.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Climate Schools Combined (CSC) Intervention will be compared to:

a) A "standard treatment" control group - Students will not receive the Climate Schools-Substance Use or Mental Health interventions. Participants will complete their standard Year 8 and Year 9 (Year 9 &amp; 10 in QLD) Health and Physical Education classes, delivered by their usual teacher.

b) The Climate Schools-Substance Use only intervention - Students will receive 12 x 40-minute lessons delivered as part of the Year 8 (Year 9 in QLD) Health and Physical Education syllabus. Each lesson consists of an interactive computer component and class activities from the program manual, administered by their usual teacher.

c) The Climate Schools-Mental Health only intervention - Students will receive 6 x 40-minute lessons delivered as part of the Year 9 (Year 10 in QLD) Health and Physical Education syllabus. Each lesson consists of computer lessons and activities from the program manual, to be administered by their usual teacher.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use and harmful use of alcohol and cannabis.

Students will be asked to rate the frequency and quantity of their alcohol consumption in standard drinks, frequency of drinking to excess (defined as having more than five standard drinks on a single occasion), and age of first alcohol consumption. These questions are were originally adapted from the School Health and Alcohol Harm Reduction Project (SHAHRP) Patterns of Alcohol index and trials of the Preventure program, and reflect those used in previous CLIMATE Schools trials. Cannabis and other drug use will be measured by questions based on the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDHS), 2010, and the Australian Secondary Students Alcohol and Drug Survey (ASSAD), 2011. This allows for comparison between use in the current sample and a large scale representative group of Australians.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size
To account for cluster randomisation, sample size calculations were based on recent sample size requirements developed by Heo &amp; Leon (Heo &amp; Leon, 2009) to detect intervention by time interactions in longitudinal cluster randomized clinical trials. The CSC trial will be powered to detect differences in the overall sample as well as across the three States of NSW, QLD and WA. To allow for comparisons in each State, six schools (with at least 100 students) in each of the four intervention groups are required per state, giving a total of 24 schools (with at least 2400 students) per State. This achieves 80 per cent power to detect a standardized between-group mean difference of 0.15 (p = 0.05) in outcomes at the end of the trial with seven measurement occasions. An effect size of 0.15 is comparable to previous school-based trials of universal mental health and substance use prevention programs (Cuijpers, van Straten, Smit, Mihalopoulos, &amp; Beekman, 2008; Teesson, Newton, &amp; Barrett, 2012; Vogl et al., 2009) and would have substantial benefits on a population level based on recent economic modelling (Nherera &amp; Jacklin, 2009). To account for school dropouts during the trial, which we expect to be approximately 10 per cent, we aim to recruit at least 28 schools (with at least 2800 students) in each State. This will result in an overall total of 8400 students from 84 schools at baseline to test the efficacy of the CS-C intervention in comparison to the other groups both nationally and state-wide. Based on previous research using the CLIMATE Schools programs, school participation rates for similar trials are approximately 30 per cent (Newton, Andrews, Teesson, &amp; Vogl, 2009; Vogl et al., 2009). Therefore, to recruit a total of 84 schools, approximately 270 schools will be approached to participate. 
Statistical Analysis
Baseline equivalence and attrition between groups will be examined using single-level analyses; one-way analyses of variance to examine normally distributed data, Chi-square to examine binominal data, and Mann-Whitney U-test to examine non-normally distributed data. To examine intervention by time interaction effects, mixed effects regression will be used due to the multi-level and hierarchical nature of the data. To account for intracluster variance within State or schools, intervention effects will primarily be examined using hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) for normally distributed data and hierarchical generalized linear modeling using a Poisson distribution for count data. Outcome variables will be entered at post-test to allow for comparisons between groups immediately after the intervention and growth terms will be analysed to determine the magnitude of the follow-up effects. Analyses will be conducted using the program HLM 6. If unconditional models reveal that less than 10% of systematic variance exists at the between-state or school level for any outcome variable, HLM will be abandoned and single-level analyses will be used. For these variables, ANCOVAs utilising the SPSS GLM procedure will be conducted to account for any baseline differences that might exist between groups. Bonferroni adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons. OR and 95% CI will also be calculated.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study will evaluate an integrative internet-based approach to prevent mental health and substance use problems in adolescence. The intervention is known as Climate Schools Combined (CSC), and comprises of a twelve-lesson substance use course, and a six-lesson mental health course. Together the CSC program simultaneously targets alcohol, cannabis, depressive and anxiety disorders with the aim of reducing substance use and decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms.

The study is being run in 71 schools across QLD, NSW and WA. The CSC intervention will be compared to the individual Climate Schools Substance Use intervention, the Climate Schools Mental Health intervention, and the control condition. The RCT will be conducted over three years, with the delivery of the Substance Use course in Year 8 (except QLD students whom will receive the course in Year 9) and the Mental Health course in Year 9 (Year 10 for QLD).

This study will be the first time such an intervention has been trialed, and is the first intervention designed to fit within the school syllabus to concurrently target substance use and mental health.</summary>
