  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved blood lipid and lipoprotein status as well as improved glucose and insulin sensitivity after the ingestion of the whey protein isolate</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting blood samples taken before liquid preload and then taken post meal (in minutes) - +15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved blood pressure after ingestion of the whey protein isolate.Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and resting heart rate were measured on the left arm of participants with an automated sphygmomanometer (Dinamap ProCare). Subjects rested in a supine position before and during measurements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood pressure taken before test meal &amp; liquid preload, and then taken post meal (in minutes) - +30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved vascular endothelial function via Sphygmocor pulse wave analysis (PWA) after the ingestion of the whey protein isolate</outcome>
      <timepoint>PWA readings before test meal &amp; liquid preload, then post meal (in minutes) - 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Greater satiety after ingesting the whey protein isolate relative to control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visual analogue scale (VAS) completed by subjects before test meal &amp; liquid preload, and then post meal (in minutes) - 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of overweight/obesity is currently exploding with over 60% of Australian adults in this category, leading to a rapid increase in diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increased dairy consumption has been demonstrated to significantly benefit weight loss. Initially, it was thought that diary calcium was the reason for these health benefits, but recent studies have shown that this is not the case. Attention is now focused to other dairy components, such as dairy proteins. Although there is no clinical evidence in humans to support this, exciting new research from animal studies have shown that dairy whey-protein isolate (WPI) can reduce body weight, lower plasma lipids, improve, blood pressure and insulin action. There is an urgent need to provide the scientific evidence to clarify whether the protein component is responsible for the observed association between dairy consumption and body weight. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate whether acute ingestion of WPI affects postprandial lipemia, insulin sensitivity and endothelial function in overweight/obese adults.</summary>
