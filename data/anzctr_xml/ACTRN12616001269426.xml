  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Recruitment  of participants
A consecutive sample of eligible patients will be recruited  for this feasibility study. Patients potentially suitable for the study (age &gt;18 yrs, currently receiving anti-cancer therapy expected to continue for at least 3 months, able to complete a written diary) will be identified upon review of the clinic list by the coordinating investigator, or researcher, and oncologist at the start of the clinic day.

2. Consent
Consent will be obtained by the coordinating investigator or researcher after the study has been introduced to the patient by the treating oncologist.

3. Initial questionnaire
For consenting patients, they will be provided with a questionnaire asking them details regarding their demographics, income level, insurance status etc. 
The treating oncologist will be required to complete details pertaining to the patients cancer diagnosis and treatment details.

4. Oncologists Estimates
The treating oncologist will be requested to complete a form asking to provide a figure of estimated monthly out-of-pocket expense for their patient for cancer-related therapy.

5. Cost Diary
Out-of-pocket costs
The costs diary will be provided on a monthly basis and will ask patients to provide details of:
1.	Cancer-related prescription medication (include out-of-pocket cost, reason, money back from insurance/PBS and prescriber)
2.	Cancer-related non-prescription medication including complementary and alternative medicines, over-the-counter medication 
3.	All medication (cancer-related or not, prescribed or over-the-counter) out-of-pocket costs
4.	Cancer-related imaging, pathology and doctors consultation fees (Medicare Benefits Schedule item number, fee, copayment, refund from health insurance)
5.	Travel costs
6.	Cancer-related miscellaneous costs including complementary and alternative therapy e.g. massage, aromatherapy, acupuncture etc.
Include out-of-pocket cost, reason, money back from insurance/PBS and prescriber/referrer.

Participants will be asked to complete the monthly cost diary for an overall duration of 3 months.


6. Financial distress/toxicity
Two surveys will be required to be completed by particpants : a financial toxicity COST-PROM survey and a cost-saving strategy survey. The surveys for assessing financial distress will be provided at the end of the three months of the study period.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of subjects completing and returning a questionnaire, out-of-pocket costs diary and surveys of financial toxicity and cost-saving strategies for three month period.
This outcome will be assessed based on the following criteria
- 60% of patients that find it easy to complete the cost diary;
- 50% of patients that bring back all 3 monthly out-of-pocket costs diaries;
- 75% of patients that bring back at least one diary.

Questionnaire used:
1.Financial toxicity - COST-PROM survey 
This is a non-validated survey that has been used in a previous study and is being developed as a possible tool to assess financial burden. It is currently undergoing validation testing in the Australian population in  a separate study currently recruiting participants.

2. Cost-saving strategy survey.
This is a tool used previously in a study conducted in the USA, however has not been used/validated in the Australian setting. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of out-of-pocket costs amongst different
-	Tumour types
-	Health insurance status
-	Location of treatment
-	Income levels
-	Work status
-	Comorbid illnesses

This will be assessed using the data collected from the initial questionnaire and cost diaries.
The tool used to collect out-of-pocket costs is a cost diary. This has been designed specifically for this study.
The initial questionnaire, used to collect details of the participant's income, health insurance, social status and cancer treatment, has also been designed specifically for this study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>
This study aims to collect out-of-pocket costs of treatment and management of cancer in patients in three centres in Sydney, Australia.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have a diagnosis of any cancer (early or advanced), are receiving at least one cancer-directed therapy which is expected to continue for at least 3 months, and are under the care of a Medical Oncologist at a centre participating in the study.

Study details
All participants will complete a questionnaire collecting basic details about their age, income status, sociodemographic details and those of their cancer and it's treatment. They will also complete up to 3 cost diaries which will collect information regarding out-of-pocket costs of their treatment, investigations, appointments, and travel. Participants will grade on a Likert scale how easy to how difficult it was to complete the diaries. Finally, participants will also be required to complete two questionnaires at the end of the three month study period, to evaluate financial distress/toxicity. 

The information that is collected will help to inform healthcare professionals, patients and government bodies of the costs of cancer treatment and the impact of these costs. </summary>
