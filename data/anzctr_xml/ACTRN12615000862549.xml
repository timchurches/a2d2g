  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study design is a prospective cohort study. Patients will receive standard treatment for their malignancy, this study does not involve a treatment intervention. Participants will be undergoing standard radiotherapy treatment. Each patient will have an MRI prior to treatment (planning MRI) and weekly MRIs during the course of treatment, to a maximum of 6 MRIs per patient. The weekly MRIs are additional to what is usually received as standard of care. Each MRI scan will take approximately 30 minutes.  
The additional MRI scans will be de-identified and study co-investigators will outline normal tissues and the tumour. This information will then be used to develop software that will facilitate the adaptive radiotherapy workflow which will potentially reduce radiation dose to surrounding normal tissues and allow dose escalation (increase in dose delivered to the tumour).

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study and the statistical considerations regarding the number of participants was decided based on relevant published literature and clinical input on expected patient recruitment and time frames.  
Statistical analyses of outcomes are as follows;
- A gold standard contour dataset will be generated with use of the STAPLE algorithm which generates a weighted average position of contours, to determine a consensus volume from all observers. 
- Variability between manual contours will be computed using several metrics, including DSC, Hausdorff distance, and average surface distance. Hypothesis 1 will be confirmed if the automatic contours are within the inter-rater variability of the expert contourers. A DSC greater than 0.7 is expected as a minimum performance from our previous studies and current literature. 
- The time taken to manually generate the contours (Aim 1) will be compared to the time taken to generate the auto-contours (Aim 2) in order to provide an estimation of the clinical time-saving impact the auto-contouring software would provide
- A conjugate CT(electron density)/MRI atlas set will be developed from the MRI and CT treatment planning images. After mapping of the MRI atlas developed for auto-contouring, the same transformation and deformation will be applied to the electron density atlas to generate a pseudo-CT.  DRRs will also be generated using standard radiotherapy treatment planning software for both the pseudo-CTs and the true CTs. 
- A chi analysis will be undertaken for the calculation error. The hypothesis that Radiotherapy dose calculations using Pseudo-CTs, generated from MRI, are similar to using actual CT will be considered accepted if this chi criteria is &gt;95% of voxels for all patients. 
- The optimisation error will also be assessed with dose and radiobiological metrics, utilising software developed by PI Holloway
- A database of advanced MRI sequences will be developed. The hypothesis that advanced MRI sequences provide superior anatomical and physiological information for radiotherapy planning will be considered proven if for at least one advanced MRI sequence the image quality score is higher than or the variability in expert contours is reduced from that of the diagnostic gold standard. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this project is to develop methods to allow adaptive radiotherapy for cervical and other gynaecological cancers. Adaptive radiotherapy refers to incorporating patient specific changes over time to tailor the delivery of radiotherapy throughout the course of treatment. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or older, and have been diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer for which you have been recommended radiotherapy to the pelvis. Study details Participants will undergo usual radiotherapy treatment, with additional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans taken just prior to beginning treatment, and weekly during radiotherapy treatment until a maximum of 6 scans have been taken. The results of these scans will not alter the treatment received by participants. Data will be used to aid development of new radiotherapy treatment protocols. It is hoped that the findings of this study will lead to the development of the technical requirements required to implement adaptive radiotherapy using MRI. The potential benefit of this is to improve outcomes for women with gynaecological cancers, and reduce the rates of side effects from treatment.</summary>
