  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 armed trial. All women received 400mg twice daily oral metronidazole for 7 days, and concurrently randomised to also receive either vaginal topical 2% clindamycin cream (1 applicator full once daily for 7 days); vaginal topical probiotic (L.acidophilus KS400)/0.03mg oestriol pessary (one pessary once daily for 12 days) or placebo pessary (one pessary once daily for 12 days).</interventions>
    <comparator>In addition to 400mg twice daily oral metronidazole for 7 days which all participants received, women in th eplacebo arm also received a vaginal placebo pessary (once daily for 12 nights). The placebo consisted of: Lactose DC, Dibasic sodium phosphate (anhydrous), Microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate (Type A), and magnesium stearate. The placebo pessary was indentical in appearance and composition to the active pessary with the exception of no active probioic organisms and no oestriol.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine if the addition of either topical clindamycin or a topical probiotic/oestrogen combination, reduces recurrent rates of bacterial vaginosis (BV), when added to the current recommended therapy of seven days of the oral antibiotic metronidazole.
Hypotheses
1.	Combination antibiotic therapy of oral metronidazole with vaginal clindamycin will be more effective than oral metronidazole alone in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
2.	Restoring normal vaginal acidity and healthy bacteria through replacement of Lactobacillus bacteria and topical oestrogen (in addition to oral metronidazole), will achieve higher rates of cure than current recommended therapy oral metronidazole alone.</summary>
