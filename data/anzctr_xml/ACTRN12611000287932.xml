  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention was placement of a LapBand in patients to folow them and see how much weight they lose. The LapBand procedure takes approximately 30 minutes. The control did not recieve a LapBand. Weight loss was measured by weight lost in kilograms and BMI lost, as well as blood measurements. This trial went for 12 months. 
An economic analysis of in terms of a cost-effectiveness analysis will be implemented in this phase. This will involve an estimation of costs associated with both groups (eg., Cost of the Lapband procedure etc)</interventions>
