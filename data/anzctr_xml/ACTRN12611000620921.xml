  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic illness places demands and challenges on the lives of children and their families. As a result, more intense and difficult emotions are experienced. A greater risk for mental health problems had also been documented in these children and their parents. Research has found that children often have better emotional, social, and physical functioning, as well as fewer behavioural difficulties when they have good emotional intelligence.  Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and control your emotions, as well as being able to communicate to others about how you feel. A childs emotional intelligence is influenced by parenting style.
This study aims to adapt and trial an emotion coaching group parenting program, "Tuning in to Kids", and assess the programs efficacy in improving the socio-emotional functioning as well as reducing risk factors for poor mental health in children with chronic illness and their parents.</summary>
