  <interventions>
    <interventions>After providing informed consent and completing the baseline survey, participants will be randomly directed to one of two different web-based physical activity programs. The web-based programs are the Walk 2.0 and MyPAA (My Physical Activity Advice) websites developed from previous research projects. Both websites consist of physical activity-related content (e.g., information about goal-setting, the benefits of physical activity). The homepages of both websites will include information about accessing counseling services for depression. The WALK2.0 website is more focused on delivering the material in an interactive manner (providing discussion forums, feedback on goal accomplishment, self-monitoring, etc.) whereas the MyPAA website is more focused on delivering the material with computer-tailoring features (e.g., provides information relevant for that specific person based on that person's behaviour, motivation, etc.). Participants will be able to access the websites as much as they want for as long as they want. Follow-up assessments will occur at 1 and 3 months after baseline.</interventions>

    <concealment>We will recruit participants using a Facebook advertisement. After clicking on the web-based advertisement, participants will be directed to the baseline survey. At the end of the survey, a link will direct them to one of two physical activity websites. The allocation concealment method is done via central randomsation by computer. All parties are blinded to this.</concealment>
    <sequence>The double-blind randomization will be conducted through a randomization system in the URLs that direct them from the survey to the web-based programs.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purposes of this study are to (1) identify the needs of adults (18 yr. and older) with depressive symptoms in relation to a web-based physical activity intervention, and (2) test the
feasibility of a web-based physical activity intervention for people with depressive symptoms.</summary>
