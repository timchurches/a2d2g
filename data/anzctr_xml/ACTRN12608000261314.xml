  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental group intervention: Participants in the experimental group will complete a 10-week progressive resistance strength training program. They will be taught three exercises for the major muscle groups of the upper body (lat pull down, seated chest press, seated row) and three exercises for the major anti-gravity support muscles of the lower body (seated leg press, knee extension, seated calf raise). All exercises will be completed on weight machines in the local gymnasium. The training details will be based on recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (2002) and will consist of 3 sets of 10-12 repetitions of each exercise, at a training intensity of 10-12RM. The weight lifted in each exercise will be increased when 3 sets of 12 repetitions of an exercise can be completed. Two-minute rest periods will be given between each exercise set. The program will be conducted twice weekly for 10 consecutive weeks. Participants will complete the program with a peer mentor (undergraduate physiotherapy student).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group: Participants in the control group will continue with their typical daily activities, which may include leisure and sporting activities, but will not include a progressive resistance strength training program.</comparator>
