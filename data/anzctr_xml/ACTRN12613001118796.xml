  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study was focused on the influence of high-carbohydrate, high fibre and low-fat diet on glycemic level, body weight, body mass index, lipid status and adipokines in obese subjects with impaired glycoregulation. The idea of this study was to compare the difference in the overall effect of foods rich dietary fibre with predefined resistant starch content (total fiber intake of 25-30 g/day of which resistant starch comprised 15 g; diet 1) and foods rich in total dietary fibre (total fiber intake of 25  35 g/daily, but the amount of resistant starch was not important; diet 2) on the above parameters.  
The subjects in both groups at the beginning  get instruction to include food rich in fibre such as vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and fruit, but also low-fat dairy products, low-fat meat such as poultry and fish. Participants who adhered to the dietary regimen 1 get  instruction to take following foods as sources of resistant starch: cooked rice, cooked potatoes, cooked beans, cooked peas, cooked lentils, cooked millet, pasta, palenta, rye and barley flakes, pumpkin pie, potato pie, pearl barley, sweet corn, sourdough bread, rye bread and green bananas. 
Participants of group 1 and  2 of this study should keep 12 months's recommended diet regime.
Dietary advices were gave on the participants by me and doctor-endocrinologist.
Once in a month all participants were educated about importance of the recommended diet. Also, an open forum discussions were organized where the participants had the opportunity to exchange their experiences and difficulties with practical advices how to overcome the problems. 
At the beginning and after 12 months, on all subjects were performed anthropometric measurements, blood pressure measurements, oral glucose tolerance test, and blood samples were taken for analysis of lipids and adipokines. Also, dietary intake was assessed using 3-day food records at the start and after 12 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The only difference in diets between the subjects from intervention and control group was in fibre type. Dietary regimen 1 (intervention group) was tailored to achieve total fiber intake of 25-30 g/day of which resistant starch comprised 15 g. Dietary regimen 2 (control group) favorized the same total fiber intake of 25  35 g/daily, but the amount of resistant starch was not important</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood samples  from subjects at the beginning and after 12 month were taken after a 12-hour fast between 8:30 AM and 10:30 AM, and serum was immediately frozen at -80 degrees Celsius for further biochemical analysis. Cholesterol level was determined from serum of routine automated methods using an OLYMPUS AU680</outcome>
