  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a pilot observational study only.  A blood sample (1mL, 0.2 teaspoon) will be taken from any paediatric patients with any indication who requires a routine blood transfusion with at least one paediatric sized red blood cell unit as standard of care treatment.  Since some patients will require multiple transfusions over the course of their treatment. The research samples will be taken before transfusion and during other routine standard of care samples that will be taken, this can mean samples will be taken every week or every few months depending on the clinical diagnosis of the patient.  It is expected that each patient may provided up to, but not limited to, 10 samples over the 18 month study period and up to 12 months post transfusion.</interventions>
    <comparator>A comparative group will be found in the retrospective study where patients who were first transfused 5-15 years ago will provide a single (1mL, 0.2 teaspoon) research sample for microchimerism testing.  If long-term donor white blood cell survival is found in these patients they can be compared with patients who are currently undergoing blood transfusion.  Patients who are current patients are vital to study in addition to the retrospective cohort as transfusion manufacturing processes have changed over time, there is also the introduction of new white blood cell filters which may or may not have an effect on the current incidence of microchimerism and also trying to determine when microchimerism establishes in a patient may be found.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if donor white blood cells survive in paediatric patients who are transfused with red blood cell units.  This will be achieved using a sensitive genetic real time polymerase chain reaction test on specific non-coding DNA sequences.  This outcome is relevant for both the retrospective and prospective patient cohort</outcome>
      <timepoint>For retrospective participants
a single research sample (1mL, 0.2 teaspoon volume) will be taken, this sample could be between 5-15 years since the commencement of their transfusion treatment. 

For prospective participants
Samples will be taken before transfusion (baseline)
and before each red blood cell transfusion is administered at the same time as other routine standard of care testing (these will be patient dependent timepoints with up to but not limited to 10 samples collected over 18 month recruitment period).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some adverse transfusion-related reactions are hypothesised to be primarily mediated by donor white blood cells (leucocytes) present in red blood cell (RBC) units.  Leucodepletion (removal of leucocytes via filtration) has successfully reduced transfusion related reactions, however current clinical data suggests that RBC transfusion can still result in poor patient outcomes.  One such undesirable outcome is the development of microchimerism, where genetically distinct donor leucocytes are detected within a transfused patient.  Transfusion-associated microchimerism has primarily been reported in trauma patients who receive multiple blood units and often have an underlying disruption of their immune response.  In Australia, we reported that despite the use of leucodepleted blood components 10% of trauma patients showed an incidence of microchimerism.  However, it is still unknown whether there is an incidence of microchimerism in other Australian transfusion recipients.
This study aims to gather preliminary data on the incidence of microchimerism in chronically transfused paediatric patients.  These patients were chosen since they receive multiple RBC units and may be immunosuppressed at the time of transfusion.
It is currently unknown whether chronic red blood cell treatment results in long term donor white cell survival (microchimerism) within this patient group and whether the use of gamma-irradiated blood components can affect any potential incidence found.   To test for the presence of surviving donor cells in chronically transfused paediatric cases both a retrospective (look-back) and prospective (current) study will be collected.  For the retrospective study, a single blood samples (1mL) will be analysed for an incidence of microchimerism.  These patients will have been transfused 5-15 years ago and will enable data to be gathered on whether there is a long-term donor cell survival.  For the prospective study, a blood sample (1mL) will be collected before transfusion, routinely before each red blood cell unit transfusion during the course of their treatment and at 12-18 months following treatment completion.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from the blood sample which will undergo a sensitive genetic test for a series of insertion/deletion sequences which are diagnostic for the presence of microchimerism.
