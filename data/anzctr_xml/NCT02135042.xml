  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) (Undetectable Plasma EBV DNA Cohort Phase III) - Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for each arm. Their distributions will be compared between treatment arms with a 1-sided log rank test. The confidence interval approach will be used for the final analysis of OS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 7 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival (PFS) (Detectable Plasma EBV DNA Cohort Phase II) - Estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for each arm. Their distributions will be compared between treatment arms with a 1-sided log rank test. A one-sided log rank test will be used to compare the PFS at a significance level of 0.1379.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 7 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in pure tone audiometry (Phase II and III) - Correlation between categorical measures will be summarized by odds ratios, chi-square tests, and associated measures. Adjusted correlation may be derived from analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models or derived directly using nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) models if normality assumption is violated. Correlations between HHIE-S PRO scores and PTA and FACT-NP hearing, and PTA will be compared as dependent statistics</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 1 year</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in QOL (hearing) as assessed by the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening version (HHIE-S) (Phase II and III) - QOL analysis including overall score and change from baseline will be summarized using mean and standard deviation at each time point for each arm. Overall and nasopharyngeal-specific QOL, hearing QOL (FACT-NP hearing domain, HHIE-S scores), peripheral neuropathy QOL over the short and long term and pure-tone audiometry (PTA) scores will be compared using a two sample independent t test and paired t test if the comparison is within the experimental arm between different time points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in QOL (peripheral neuropathy) as assessed by the FACT-Taxane (Phase II and III)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in quality of life (QOL) (general and physical well-being) assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Nasopharyngeal (NP) (Phase II and III) - Changes in patient reported outcome (PRO) scores will be correlated to clearance or non-clearance of EBV titers. Descriptive statistics derived from FACT-NP will be used to enrich the understanding of QOL as it pertains to the 2 phase III arms of observation versus additional adjuvant chemotherapy. Univariable and multivariable analysis will be performed using the Cox proportional hazards model for OS and distant metastasis. Pearson correlation will be estimated between general and physical well-being. QOL measures and change from baseline will be correlated to EBV DNA.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline to up to 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness as assessed by the health-related QOL (HRQOL) from the EuroQol (EQ-5D) instrument (Phase II and III) - Incremental cost effectiveness ratios will be compared to determine the probability of cost effectiveness of various interventions, with sensitivity analyses to identify model weaknesses. The expected value of perfect information will be determined to delimit the upper boundary for cost-effective future investment in this area of research.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of acute grade 3-5 adverse events (Phase II and III) - Rates of specific acute toxicity profiles and late toxicity profiles will be estimated using a binomial distribution along with their associated 95% confidence intervals and will be compared using Fisher's exact test between the 2 treatment arms.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are two study questions we are asking in this randomized phase II/III trial based on a
      blood biomarker, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for locoregionally
      advanced non-metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer. All patients will first undergo standard
      concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. When this standard treatment is completed, if
      there is no detectable EBV DNA in their plasma, then patients are randomized to either
      standard adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy or observation. If there is still
      detectable levels of plasma EBV DNA, patients will be randomized to standard cisplatin and
      fluorouracil chemotherapy versus gemcitabine and paclitaxel. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,
      fluorouracil, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether giving cisplatin and fluorouracil
      is more effective than gemcitabine hydrochloride and paclitaxel after radiation therapy in
      treating patients with nasopharyngeal cancer.</summary>
