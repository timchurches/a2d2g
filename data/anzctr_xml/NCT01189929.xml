Experimental: Gemcitabine and demcizumab With or Without Abraxane® - Gemcitabine and demcizumab With or Without Abraxane®


Treatment: drugs: Demcizumab
Up to 50 subjects will be enrolled at up to 8 centers in Australia, New Zealand, and Spain. Up to 28 days (4 weeks) prior to treatment you will undergo testing to determine your eligibility to take part in this study, and then if you are enrolled in the study you will receive intravenous (in the vein) infusions of the demcizumab administered once every 2 weeks, and gemcitabine and Abraxane® administered weekly for 3 weeks, out of every 4 weeks. After 9 weeks, you will undergo assessments to determine the status of your disease. If there is no evidence of progression of your disease or if your tumor is smaller, you will continue to receive one additional infusion of demcizumab, and you will continue to receive infusions of gemcitabine and Abraxane® once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks out of every 4 weeks until it has been shown that your cancer has progressed. You will undergo assessments every 8 weeks thereafter to determine the status of your disease.

Treatment: drugs: Abraxane®
Abraxane® which will be administered by IV infusion at a dose of 125 mg/m2 over 30 minutes once a week for 3 weeks in a row, followed by a week of rest.

Treatment: drugs: Gemcitabine
Gemcitabine will be administered intravenously over 30 minutes initially at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 once a week for 3 weeks in a row, followed by a week of rest. If you develop side effects during this time period, your physician may decide to hold or reduce the dose of gemcitabine.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new
      experimental drug, demcizumab (OMP-21M18), when given in combination with gemcitabine with or
      without (+/-) Abraxane®. Historically, single agent gemcitabine has been the standard
      treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, recent data suggests that gemcitabine plus
      Abraxane® may be superior to gemcitabine alone, thus this combination is emerging as the new
      standard therapy for pancreatic cancer. However, Abraxane® has not been approved for the
      treatment of pancreatic cancer at this time. Demcizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody
      and was developed to target cancer stem cells. This study is sponsored by OncoMed
      Pharmaceuticals, which is referred to as OncoMed or the Sponsor in this consent form. The
      study is designed to test the safety of demcizumab at different dose levels when given with
      gemcitabine +/- Abraxane® and the effects, both good and bad, that it has on participants.
      Demcizumab may block the growth of cancer stem cells, the remaining tumor cells, and it may
      also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow and spread. Although
      demcizumab has been administered with gemcitabine to cancer patients, it has not been given
      in combination with gemcitabine and Abraxane®; thus, it is not known if it will provide any
      benefit to participants and may cause harmful side effects.</summary>
