    <interventions>Title of app: 
'Instant survey' for the control group and 'Minimise' for treatment group A &amp; B. 

Aim:
The aim of the 'Minimise' app is to provide protective behavioural strategies to young adults, during episodes of drinking for a total of 30 days. These strategies are intended to minimise drinking quantity and drinking-related harm (e.g., violent behaviour). 
The aim of the 'Instant Survey' app is to monitor the behaviour of young adults for 30 days.

Proposed Research Design:
We intend to pilot the 'Minimise' app to establish its usability and possible effectiveness using an experimental design where 60 young adults are randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

*Please note - participants will be randomly assigned (through qualtrics) to either a baseline questionnaire that details the download of 'Instant Survey' or alternatively to 'Minimise'. Participants allocated to download 'Minimise' will then be randomly assigned to Treatment A or B through the app itself.

1. Control: these participants use a restricted version of the app, 'Instant Survey',  to self-monitor - which involves participants reporting their mood and drinking behaviour in the mobile phone application. The self monitoring element of the application should take no more than one minute to complete. These participants will be prompted twice a day (morning and afternoon) to complete their assessment.

2. Treatment A: Participants in Treatment A will self monitor and receive harm minimisation strategies during episodes of drinking (e.g., remind the participants to substitute a glass of water for each alcoholic beverage) tailored to their goals (e.g., reduce alcohol quantity) and behaviours (e.g., drinking alone).

3. Treatment B: Participants in Treatment B will self monitor, receive harm
minimisation strategies during episodes of drinking (e.g., remind the participants to substitute a glass of water for each alcoholic beverage) tailored to their goals (e.g., reduce alcohol quantity) and behaviours (e.g., drinking alone)  and, in addition, will get notification reminders to employ the strategy throughout the drinking occasion (in the form of a text message).

Design:

1. Control
For participants in the control group, they will self-monitor daily at 12:00pm and 8:00pm.

2. Treatment A - Participants in Treatment group A will receive;
a. Self-monitoring at 12:00pm and 8:00pm.
b. Protective Strategy will be provided to participants if they indicate intention to drink or are currently drinking

3. Treatment B - Participants in Treatment group B will receive;
a. Self-monitoring at 12:00pm and 8:00pm.
b. Protective Strategy will be provided to participants if they indicate intention to drink or are currently drinking
c. Reminder Participants in Treatment group B will also receive a prompting reminder (in the form of a text message) to encourage them to implement the protective strategy communicated in step b. This reminder prompt will be signaled once every two hours (until midnight) once the protective strategy has been communicated. .

After the completion of the EMA - participants in both the Control group and Treatment group will be send an email with a link to complete a post-questionnaire. This questionnaire will include the same items as the baseline questionnaire.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Change in alcohol consumption - This will be examined by comparing the participants' in all three groups score on the AUDIT sub-scales (total, depend, consumption and problems) in the baseline questionnaire compared to their scores on the AUDIT sub-scales in the post-study questionnaire.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The post-study questionnaire will be disseminated to all individuals immediately after the study is complete (i.e., after the 30 days of completing the mobile phone application). Participants will recieve via their email address, a link that takes them to the post-study questionnaire. The post-study questionnaire which will include the same items as the baseline questionnaire which will enable comparison within and between participants.
Employing post-questionnaires immediately after the study has been supported in a number of studies;

    <statisticalmethods>Referring to the literature that has conducted harm minimisation interventions upon young adults it is clear that approximately 20-40 participants is required for interventions delivered through a moible phone with a duration of  6-8 weeks 
(Dulin, Gonzalez, &amp; Campbell, 2014).

As our intervention is shorter in length (4 weeks) we believe that recruiting 60 participants would enable enough power to examine the effectiveness of the intervention. Moreover, it would provide enough power (as Hox, 2005, demonstrates) to implement hierachical analysis - such as multilevel modeling - in which we can examine how both the within and between-person factors influenced the effectiveness of the intervention upon drinking behaviour.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Attempts to promote safe alcohol use among young adults typically employ social-skills training and education about the consequences of use (Foxcroft et al., 1997). These approaches are somewhat successful although many individuals continue to engage in risky alcohol use post-intervention (Foxcroft et al., 2003). 

A key factor limiting effectiveness is lack of adherence to the treatment strategies; that is, even when young people are more aware of effective strategies to reduce harm associated with risky drinking, they may not employ them while drinking.

The aim of this project is to undertake a pilot evaluation of a smartphone-based
drinking-intervention that aims to address this limitation by offering: (i) tailored presentation of strategies found to be effective in past research, and (ii) prompts reminding participants to engage in protective behaviours during drinking episodes.

Proposed Research Design:

We intend to pilot the app to establish its usability and possible effectiveness using an
experimental design where 60 young adults are randomly assigned to one of three conditions.

1. Control: these participants use a restricted version of the app to self-monitor their drinking
behaviour and related variables (e.g., mood, behaviour of others, etc.).
2. Treatment (no prompts); in addition to self monitoring, these participants will receive harm
minimisation strategies tailored to their goals and behaviours
3. Treatment (prompts): these participants will engage in self monitoring, receive the strategies and, in addition, will get notification reminders to employ them while drinking.

The intervention is delivered through participants mobile-phone devices. Kypri and colleagues (2003) found young adults as more receptive to engage with mobile phone interventions in comparison to web-based or one-on-one counselling sessions, as such, this design should minimise attrition rates.</summary>
