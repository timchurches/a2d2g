    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>In each cohort of 8, 6 participants will receive gerilimzumab and 2 participants will receive placebo. Each participant will be randomly assigned according to the blinded randomization plan. 

The first 8 participants enrolled will be allocated to Cohort 1 and will be randomized to receive a single 1 mg subcutaneous dose of gerilimzumab or placebo. 

The second set of 8 participants enrolled will be allocated to Cohort 2 and will be randomized to receive a single 5 mg subcutaneous dose of gerilimzumab or placebo.

The third set 8 participants enrolled will be allocated to Cohort 3 and will be randomized to receive a single 15 mg subcutaneous dose of gerilimzumab or placebo.

The last set of 8 participants enrolled will be allocated to Cohort 4 and will be randomized to receive a single 20 mg subcutaneous dose of gerilimzumab or placebo.

A randomisation list will be generated by an Unblinded Statistician at CNS and will be transferred electronically to the Investigational Site at least 2 days prior to enrolment of participants for each cohort. 

Eligible subjects enrolled into the study will be assigned a randomisation number by the Nucleus Network Unblinded Pharmacist in accordance with the Randomization List generated by CNS.

The Randomisation List details the randomisation numbers and the associated treatment. 

Each subject will receive the treatment which corresponds to their randomisation number (as assigned in the Randomisation List). 

The Randomisation List will be available only to clinic pharmacy staff preparing the drug who are not involved in any other aspect of the study. The Randomisation List will not be made available to the Sponsor, subjects, or members of the staff responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of safety assessments (i.e. all blinded study members) until study completion and database lock, unless a full unblinding of the study is required.

The first two eligible participants will be dosed at least 24 hours before the remaining 6 in cohort 1 &amp; 2.
</concealment>
    <sequence>The generation of the Randomisation List for each cohort will be performed by a CNS Unblinded Biostatistician using the computer program SAS (registered trademark) v9.4 or later. </sequence>

The sample size chosen for this study was selected without statistical considerations. It has been determined adequate to meet the study objectives

No formal inferential statistics will be performed on safety assessments. Listings and summaries for all safety data will be presented using the Safety Population. 

Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) will be calculated for summaries of continuous safety data and frequency counts and percentages (where appropriate) will be calculated for summaries of discrete/categorical safety data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first in human trial testing the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity of gerilimzumab. Four doses (1 mg, 5 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg) will be tested in a sequential manner. After the completion of Day 7 at each dose level, a safety monitoring committee will meet and review blinded data to date. They will decide if the study should continue as planned. Only at that time will the next dose level be enrolled. 

This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study.</summary>
