    <interventions>High intensity interval training
Isocaloric exercise protocol to usual care
31 minutes exercise (including 3minute warm-up and 3 minute cool down)
- Following warm-up, 4 x 4minute high intensity intervals (85-95% VO2 peak) 
- Interspersed with 3minute intervals (3 in total) of moderate intensity intervals (60-70% VO2 peak)
Various aerobic exercise machines will be used, depending on preference and musculoskeletal limitations. These include treadmill, cycle ergometer, cross-trainer, or rowing ergometer. Training will be adapted for home-based exercise equipment or walking program.

Stage 1: Four weeks hospital program = 2 x supervised sessions and 1 home-based session per week. All supervised classes will be delivered by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist.
Stage 2: Eight weeks home-based program (3 sessions/week) with weekly telephone support These weekly 5-10 minute calls will be provided by a qualified health professional (e.g. nurse or exercise physiologist) to discuss adherence and other issues (e.g. symptoms).
Stage 3: Maintain home-based program (at least 3 sessions/week) for a further 9 months. Follow-up testing at 6 months and 12 months from baseline measures.

Adherence to exercise program will be monitored at supervised rehabilitation sessions (initial 4 weeks), home exercise log with weekly telephone follow-up (for subsequent 8 weeks), FitBit device data (for a sub-group of patients), and 7-day accelerometer data at each testing period (4 weeks, 13 weeks, 6 months, 12 months).

Compliance will be assessed as 70% adherence to recommended exercise program (intensity, type, time, and frequency)

Dietary control will also be monitored on 2 days at each testing period by a dietitian administered 24-hour recall.</interventions>
    <comparator>Moderate intensity continuous training (usual care)
40 minutes exercise (including 3 minute warm-up and 3 minute cool down)

Participants will be advised that they should report any spontaneous adverse events that may occur during the study, and will be provided with contact details for reporting. 
During Stage 1 and Stage 2 participants will be questioned weekly about adverse events at supervised sessions or by weekly telephone support. During Stage 3 participants will be questioned at the 6 month and 12 month follow-up. 
Participants will be encouraged to use the contact details for reporting adverse events at any time throughout the study period. The type, incidence, and severity of adverse events (Grade 1: Mild; Grade 2: Moderate; Grade 3: Severe; Grade 4: Life-threatening; and Grade 5: Death) will be noted. Examples of adverse effects would be musculoskeletal injury, angina, hypotension, myocardial infarction).

      <outcome>Exercise adherence will be assessed as 70% compliance to the prescribed type, frequency, intensity, and duration of  exercise sessions/week. 

A combination of physical attendence, self-reporting, and activity device data (accelerometer) will be used. The participant will be deemed compliant if they achieve 70% of the randomized exercise protocol targets each week. 

During Stage 1, exercise adherence will be recorded on the exercise data sheets at supervised exercise sessions. At each exercise session, participants will be asked if they have completed any home-based sessions since their previous supervised sessions, and the nature of this session. 
During Stage 2, exercise adherence will be self-reported by participants during their routine telephone support session. They will be asked how many sessions they have completed for the week, and the duration and intensity of those sessions. During the supervised sessions participants will be taught how to monitor their exercise intensity using heart rate and rating of perceived effort (RPE). They will be encouraged to keep an exercise log to track this data for their home-based sessions. For those participants using  Fit-Bits, uploaded data will also be used to assess compliance to the duration, frequency, and intensity of exercise sessions.
During Stage 3, exercise adherence will be self-reported by participants during their 6 month and 12 month follow-up sessions. Accelerometer data, captured for 7 days at each testing period, will also be used to assess compliance to the exercise protocol.

    <statisticalmethods>The calculation was conducted comparing the change in the two primary outcome measures (VO2peak and visceral adipose tissue) over the four week supervised phase of the
cardiac rehabilitation program. This timeframe was selected as it represents a standard cardiac rehabilitation program. Measurements post-stage two (13 weeks), and at 6-month follow-up and 12-month follow-up, will be secondary outcomes.

VO2peak: Based on data from our previous research, we estimate that the baseline fitness level of the participants will be 20 mL/kg/min and the MICT group will improve fitness by 10% (to 22mL/kg/min). We anticipate that HIIT will be twice as effective as MICT resulting in a 20% increase (to 24 mL/kg/min). This difference between groups would be clinically meaningful and is associated with an approximate 15% decreased risk in progression of CVD. The sample size calculation uses a SD of 3 mL/kg/min for the changes in VO2peak between groups (effect size = 0.67) and has been adjusted for potential confounders. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up, and with a power of 90% and a 5% level of significance we would need to recruit a total of 150 patients to provide us with 60 per group for the primary analysis. 

Visceral adipose tissue (VAT): Based on a conservative projected relative reduction in VAT over four weeks of 7% (comparison of change value between-groups) and using data from a our previous research in overweight/ obese non-diabetic adults, the sample size calculation used a total effect size = 0.90 and adjusted for potential confounders. Using the same assumptions for loss-to follow up, alpha and power as above (for VO2peak) we would need 21 in each group after 4 weeks. Therefore, the VO2peak outcome measure will drive the sample size required = 150 patients in total. This sample size will also give us very good statistical power (&gt;95%) for VAT and between 80-95% for the secondary outcome measures.

All statistical analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis unless otherwise stated. Continuous variables will be described using mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), while categorical variables will be described using frequencies (percentages). Though our design will randomly assign participants, we will assess any possible imbalances in baseline variables between HIIT and MICT groups that could potentially affect the impact of HIIT intervention on the outcomes. Pearsons Chi-square test or Fishers exact test will be applied to assess categorical variables. Depending on normality, students t-test or the MannWhitney U-test will be applied to assess continuous variables. Continuous outcomes including the primary outcomes of VO2peak and VAT will be analysed using random effects multivariable linear regression, while categorical outcomes will be analysed using random effects multivariable logistic regression. Conditional on the degree of dispersion, either mixed effects poisson or negative binomial regression will be used to model count data. Irrespective of modelling approach, correlation of observations within participants and over follow-up will be accounted for by the inclusion of random intercepts and slopes into the regression modelling. All models will treat intervention as a fixed effect and adjust for all possible measured confounders. To test whether intervention effect was modified by the presence of model covariates, all models will be extended to include the presence of interaction terms. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted testing model functional forms, the variables to be used, and the impact of influential outliers on estimates. In addition, per-protocol analyses will also be conducted to assess the robustness of our findings for various degrees of non-adherence and protocol violation. Where appropriate and under the assumption of missing at random, multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data, with results being compared to those produced by complete case analyses. All analyses will be conducted using SPSS version 21. The level of statistical significance will be set at 0.05 and all hypothesis tests will be two-sided.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to investigate if a high intensity interval training (HIIT) program offers greater improvements, than moderate intensity continuous exercise, for intra-abdominal fat, fitness, inflammation, cardiovascular risk factors, and exercise adherence. The project will also investigate whether HIIT can be successfully integrated into a hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation program as a practical and safe alternative to moderate intensity exercise. We expect high intensity interval training will be a safe and practical option. This will lead to the, development of a protocol to guide cardiac rehabilitation programs on how to incorporate HIIT as a standard exercise option for patients. </summary>
