  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to find out how achievable it is to find participants for a trial that involves cancer patients whom despite taking recommended pain relief medications continue to experience problems with pain management, and add either dexamethasone or placebo to their usual medications and evaluate the response. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged greater than 18 years and continue to experience pain related to cancer or its treatment, despite taking recommended pain relief medications. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive daily injections of a steroid medication known as dexamethasone for 5 days. The injection will either be administered intravenously (i.e. directly into the vein) or subcutaneously (i.e. into the skin). Participants in the other group will receive daily saline injections instead. Saline is an inactive (placebo) treatment. Participants will not know which group they are in until the end of the study. All participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires over a period of 14 days in order to evaluate their pain levels and quality of life. Total opioid dose received, overall survival and the occurrence of any adverse events will also be recorded. Data collected from this study will help us determine how achievable it is to proceed to conduct a larger trial.
