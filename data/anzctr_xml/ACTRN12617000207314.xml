  <interventions>
    <interventions>Addition of quercetin (600mg) bromelain (200mg) tablets (Quercetain) to current medication regimen in a placebo controlled double blind crossover trial.
Investigational product: Quercetain
Dose: 30mg/kg rounded to nearest whole capsule divided into 2 doses given morning and night. Quercetain is given twice a day for 60 days.
There is no washout period
Quercetain is added to the patient's existing regiment without any changes to the existing medications. All patients are inpatients and are administered their medications by nursing staff as normal ward procedure. Adherence will be monitored by the ward clinical pharmacist by chart review.
Total duration: 120 days
Crossover at 60 days</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is the placebo arm. Both the active and placebo will consist of overencapsulated tablets. The placebo tablets will consist of Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose tablets)</comparator>

Presence of a serious medical condition as defined as a disease that is likely to require an unplanned hospital admission for treatment in the period of the trial. 
Use of medications which are likely to interact significantly with quercetin including: Digoxin, Verapamil, Cyclosporin, Topotecan, Quinidine, Raitanovir, Methotrexate, Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban.

    <statisticalmethods>Anecdotal evidence based on case studies suggests a medium to large effect size (Cohens d &gt; 0.80) for the primary outcome measures (PANSS mean score). 
Using Gpower (version 3.1.0), statistical power was estimated for the proposed sample sizes (n=10 in each group) and an alpha level of 0.05, for an effect size of &gt;0.80 (Cohens d estimate). Calculations show that this study will possess a convincing capacity to detect medium to large effect size in key outcome measures with satisfactory statistical power.
Factorial repeated measures analysis of variance will be used to evaluate the change of psychopathology over time. The between group factor will be Quercetin versus Placebo and the within group factor will be the five assessments (baseline and four follow-up assessments). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis for this study is that a proportion of patients with schizophrenia may not respond to medication because the medication does not cross the blood brain barrier well enough. The blood brain barrier keeps substances out of the brain and is made up of several parts. One part is a group of proteins called efflux pumps or transporters which act to pump foreign substances out of the brain, back into the blood stream. We believe that some patients who do not respond to medications for schizophrenia have such fast and efficient efflux pumps that the medications cannot get into the brain effectively.
The speed and efficiency of these efflux pumps are determined by the genes for these pumps. The particular pumps that are of interest in this study are called P-glycoprotein (PgP) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP). 
This study will test the addition of a natural product, quercetin, to the patients regular medicine. Quercetin is known  to slow down these pumps. 
The aim of the study is:
To show that quercetin has beneficial effects when added to the usual medications used in in schizophrenia
Objectives:
-To figure out the how quercetin has a beneficial effect.
-To identify the symptoms of schizophrenia which responded best to quercetin use
-To see if there are groups of genes that indicate fast efflux pumps in patients with schizophrenia who do not improve with the usual medications.
