  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is investigating whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other diagnostic procedures in people at high risk of cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18-70 years, and are a known NF1 patient, OR a known cancer risk gene mutation carrier, OR have a family member at 50% risk of carrying a mutation. You will not be eligible if you have an active cancer diagnosis. Study details - All participants in this study will have an initial clinical review followed by annual diagnostic procedures for a period of 3 years. This may include annual whole body MRI scans, breast MRI (females only), fecal occult blood test and full blood count. Additional investigations including colonoscopy and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy may also be conducted at varying time points, as indicated by family history and clinical appropriateness. Participants will also be asked to complete psychosocial questionnaires and invited to participate in in-depth interviews. This study will provide estimates of the prevalence and incidence of investigable lesions, and the acceptability, safety, psychosocial impact, and cost-effectiveness of the screening protocol. This information will be used to design a large scale screening project.</summary>
