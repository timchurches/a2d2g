             *Patients with superficial or deep resection margin of &lt; 2 mm are eligible if surgery

             pectoralis fascia.

          -  Unifocal tumour measuring = 20 mm in maximum microscopic dimension.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must use adequate contraception during RT.

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients who fulfill any of the following criteria are not eligible for admission to study:

          -  Multifocal or multicentric tumours.

          -  Clinical or pathologic evidence of any of the following tumour features: extension to
             chest wall (excluding pectoralis muscle); oedema (including peau d'orange) or
             ulceration of skin; satellite skin nodules confined to the same breast; and
             inflammatory carcinoma.

          -  Presence of extensive intraductal component (ductal carcinoma in situ occupying &gt; 25%
             of the primary invasive tumour and present adjacent to the primary tumour).

          -  Node-positive breast cancer determined by sentinel node biopsy, axillary dissection,
             or in women &gt; 70 years of age, clinical examination.

          -  Inability to localise surgical cavity on CT scans with no evidence of a surgical
             cavity, seroma or surgical clips delineating the tumour bed.

          -  Treatment target volume estimated to occupy &gt; 25% of the ipsilateral whole breast
             volume.

          -  Synchronous or metachronous bilateral invasive or intraductal breast cancer.

          -  Locally recurrent breast cancer.

          -  Ipsilateral breast implant.

          -  Serious non-malignant disease that precludes definitive surgical or radiation
             treatment (e.g. scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus,
             cardiovascular/pulmonary/renal disease).

          -  Previous or concomitant malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in
             situ of the cervix, and invasive carcinoma of the colon, thyroid, cervix, or
             endometrium treated five years prior to study entry.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Psychiatric or addictive disorders that preclude obtaining informed consent or
             adherence to protocol</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis:

      In selected women with node-negative invasive breast cancer treated with breast conserving
      surgery, postoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) limited to the region of
      the tumour bed delivered by 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CRT) is technically
      feasible and reproducible with acceptable treatment toxicity, cosmetic outcome, and local
      control rate in a multicentre trial.</summary>
