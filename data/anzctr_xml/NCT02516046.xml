  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - 18F-AV-1451

Experimental: Autopsy Cohort - End-of-life subjects (life expectancy = 6 months) consenting to brain donation at autopsy.


Treatment: drugs: 18F-AV-1451
Subjects will receive a single IV bolus injection of 370 megabecquerel (MBq)(10 millicurie [mCi]) of 18F-AV-1451. Some subjects may receive a second injection after 6 months have passed since the first injection.
