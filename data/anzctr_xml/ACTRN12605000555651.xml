  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients consenting to the trial will have baseline and day 1 postoperative measurements of their endothelial functioning on one arm.

Preoperatively :  A blood pressure cuff is inflated on the upper arm and an ultrasound is taken of the blood vessels in the arm as the cuff is deflated.  Blood tests are taken for folate, homocysteine, arginine, citrulline, ADMA and nitrate.  

Intraoperatively : Patients will be randomly allocated to either 70% N2O in oxygen (FiO2 0.3) or oxygen with or without nitrogen (FiO2 0.8-1.0).

Postoperatively : Patients will have the ultrasound on the same arm as preoperatively and blood tests will be done again.   Half of the patients will have received nitrous oxide for a minimum of 2 hours and the other half only oxygen.</interventions>
