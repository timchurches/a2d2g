  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Perioperative fluid management has been historically dictated by outdated, contradictory
      concepts. Excessive or inadequate fluid administration around surgery is deleterious and
      hence goal-directed fluid therapy using Oesophageal Doppler-derived cardiac indices is
      preferable to optimize tissue perfusion. Previous studies in this area have been hampered by
      lack of standardization in other aspects of perioperative care and none have explored the
      impact of individualized fluid therapy on post-operative fatigue.The investigators proposed a
      study involving 80 patients having open/ laparoscopic colonic surgery to investigate the
      effect of Oesophageal Doppler guided fluid administration intraoperatively compared to
      current best practice of fluid restriction. The investigators have an optimized
      peri-operative care pathway established at the Manukau Surgical Centre (MSC), Middlemore
      Hospital. All patients will be cared for under the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS)
      multimodal care plan therefore ensuring that all other aspects of care besides intraoperative
      fluid administration remain homogenous. Outcomes will include post-operative recovery,
      clinical outcomes as well as physiological data with follow-up to 30 days.</summary>
