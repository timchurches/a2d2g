  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the impact of a home-based practical demonstration using food from the womens home with nutrition education during pregnancy on the birthweight of the infants. In this regard, a group of pregnant women will be counseled by BRAC's (Bangladesh Rural advancement Committee) community health workers called - 'Shasthya Kormi' about the quantity and quality food appropriate for healthy pregnancy outcome. Shasthya Kormis will visit all pregnant women once in each month and each of them will receive at four to seven sessions of individual counselling based on their availability during the day of home visits. Shasthya Kormis will fill up the antenatal registers during the visits and at the end of the study the numbers of visits will be calculated from the register records. They will practically demonstrate preparation of food plates containing balanced meal (qualitative and quantitatively) made up of readily available food at the household. The intervention will commence in the first trimester (ideally before 12 weeks of gestation) and will continue every month until birth. The sessions will last for ~30-45 minutes.

The primary outcome is the mean difference in birthweight of infants born to mothers in the intervention compared to control groups. All births will be notified within 24 hours and Shasthya Kormis will weigh the infants within 72 hours. Birthweight less than 2500g is considered as low birthweight. The secondary outcome is the maternal dietary behaviour, which includes daily caloric intake and dietary diversity score. Shasthya Kormis will conduct dietary assessments with a semi-structured questionnaire, which will capture detailed information about all foods, beverages and dietary supplements consumed in the past 24 hours with quantity. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard antenatal care from BRAC and other providers (Government and private) as per regular government protocol which includes advice on; a) taking extra food, b) consumption of meat, fish, liver, egg, milk/milk products, lentils, colorful vegetables, fruits and oil, c) supplementation of iron-folic acid (60 mg iron and 40mg folic acid) and calcium (500mg) tablets.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean birth weight would be the primary outcome of interest. BRAC field supervisory staff Program Organizers will weigh the baby in case of home deliveries. For hospital deliveries, hospital records will be collected. </outcome>
      <timepoint>within 72 hours of birth</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean daily energy intake would be the 1st secondary outcome. Maternal dietary intake will be measured using food frequency instrument (based on Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance II Project (FANTA-2)). 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at least once in - first trimester (1-3 months), second trimester (4-6 months) and third trimester (7-9 months). Shasthya Kormis collect data during regular antenatal visits, which is once in every month. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean dietary diversity score would be the 2nd secondary outcome of interest. Dietary diversity scores will be calculated by summing up the number of food groups consumed by the individual respondent over the 24-hour recall period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at least once in - first trimester (1-3 months), second trimester (4-6 months) and third trimester (7-9 months). Shasthya Kormis collect data during regular antenatal visits, which is once in every month.</timepoint>

    <sequence>In this randomised controlled design intervention will be allocated to the clusters of CHWs. In the study area BRAC has 135 CHWs (Shasthya Kormi), of them 36 has been selected random and proportionately from all five sub-districts. Treatment has been assigned randomly to half (18) of the selected CHWs. Each selected CHWs will enroll 25 pregnant women starting from the date of initiation of the project. Clusters were randomized is two stages by computerized random tables. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size and power for the trial was estimated with the following assumptions:
1. The expected mean birth weight in control clusters 2531g
2. The expected difference in mean birthweight between intervention and control groups 100 g (2631g in intervention)
3. The standard deviation 415g
4. Power 80% and 5% two-sided alpha
5. Intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.03 
6. The number of clusters 36 
Using the standard formulae the sample size required would be 720 from 36 clusters. 

Inflating the sample by 5% for non-response, 10% for pregnancy loss and 10% for delivery outside the study area (unpublished data, based on our experience of conducting a large community based trial in rural Bangladesh, we require a sample of 900 pregnant women to retain 720 live births.   

All of the women who are randomly assigned to either balanced plate or standard nutrition education will be analysed on an intention to treat basis. We will limit the birthweight data analysis to singleton live born infants. Dietary data will be analysed if we have at least two round of dietary assessment (baseline and follow-up) irrespective of pregnancy outcome. We will use multiple regression analysis to assess intervention effects holding other predictors constant; such as, gestational age, infant sex, parity, age, socioeconomic status education, number of visit and time of first visit after adjusting for cluster (37). To assess the treatment effect on dietary caloric intake and diversity over time, we will use data from each visit distributed across subjects. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed research aims to collect evidence whether nutrition counselling on balanced diet in pregnancy can improve birth weight of infants. With this regard a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial will be conducted in rural Bangladesh where a group of pregnant women in their first trimester will start receiving education and counseling on balanced diet. The community health workers of BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee), a large NGO
in Bangladesh, will visit pregnant women once in every month throughout the pregnancy till delivery and conduct education sessions. They will simulate to prepare balanced plate for each meal with readily available food. The plates will comprise of all seven varieties of food (rice/chapati, vegetables, lentil, fish/meat, egg, milk/milk products and fruits) in right proportions. The pregnant women will be followed up for dietary compliance. The impact of the education and counseling will be assessed on birthweight of infants. 

The primary hypothesis of the research would be; daily energy intake of 2,500 kcal with at least five varieties of food everyday starting from first trimester of pregnancy, and sustained for at least six months will increase birth weight by 100 g compared to the control. The secondary hypothesis would be; nutrition education with demonstration of balanced plate will increase daily energy consumption by at least 300 kcal and increase daily dietary diversity score to at least five varieties of food among pregnant women compared to the standard program.
