  <interventions>
    <interventions>The TC-PCC Intervention is a structured, person-centred approach aimed at facilitating a positive residential respite care experience for both people with dementia and their carers at each stage of the process of using residential respite care, from the preparation for respite care, through the respite experience and after the return home.  Intervention will commence 1-2 weeks prior to admission and continues throughout the length of the respite admission  (approximately 1-6 weeks) for a total duration ranging from 3-8 weeks depending on length  of admission. A core feature of the Intervention is a liaison nurse, who will be the pivotal point of connection between the dyad and Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) staff. The specific components of the Intervention include: A. Structured Person-Centred Communication (Respite Care Personal Profile; Pre-admission case conference between liaison nurse, care recipient and caregiver; up to daily call/email to care giver from liaison nurse to provide up to date feedback on care recipients status; exit interview from liaison nurse  to give hand over to caregiver); and B. Person-Centred preparation for respite experience: prepare simple memory book to aid transition; familiar items bag; and carer comfort review to establish what support the caregiver needs. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>To prevent cross contamination of intervention and control conditions, the facilities as a whole were allocated as either "intervention" or "control" through a randomisation process. This was done by an independent researcher before any participants were approached for enrolment. 4 participating units of a multi site residential aged care provider were randomised as control (n=2) or intervention (n=2). When carers make a booking for their family member with dementia to have residential respite at one of the 4 participating units, the admissions clerk (who is blind to group allocation) asks their permission to be contacted by the research team to participate in the study. Those who agree to participate receive the intervention or care as usual, dependent on which facility they are booked into.</concealment>
    <sequence>To prevent cross-contamination, stratified allocation by facility was employed.  The four participating facilities were randomly allocated as either "intervention" or "control" via computerised random sequence generation. The person responsible for randomisation was blinded to facility names.
Participants are subsequently allocated to intervention or control groups according to which facility they book into.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As this is a pilot study, formal sample size calculation was not conducted; however, we consulted with the RACF provider to estimate feasibility of sample size.
In order to determine whether the intervention achieves its aim, the change over time for all quantitative measures will be compared for the intervention and control groups.  For example, the change in the number of behavioural and psychological symptoms exhibited by the PWD between the baseline (before admission) and during conditions will be compared according to whether or not they were in the intervention group.  Similar comparisons will be made by looking at change between baseline, immediately after and three months after conditions in the various measures of behaviour, mood, quality of life, and sleep of the person with dementia and the quality of life, level of burden, carer experience, and sleep health of  the carer.  Statistical tests such as t-tests and ANCOVAs will be applied as warranted</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research design to be employed is a cluster randomized controlled trial of a multi-component intervention designed to improve the experience of Residential Respite Care (RRC) for people with dementia and their carers. Clustering will occur at the facility level with randomisation by necessity occurring at this level in order to prevent contamination of results due to changed processes during RRC admission required by the intervention. Thus, two facilities will be allocated as the intervention facilities and two as control facilities. Random allocation will occur via a random number generator.
The program will provide support and communication before, during and after residential respite admission in order to facilitate the transition to respite care.
Participants with dementia (PWD) and their carers will be interviewed face  to face and also complete self report instruments 2 weeks prior to moving into RRC.
Allocation of residents will occur to either intervention or control group and all will be assessed during RRC admission.
PWD and their carers will be interviewed face to face and asked to complete self report measures when transiting back to home care.
PWD and their carers will be interviewed via telephone and asked to complete self report measures three months following return to home care.</summary>
