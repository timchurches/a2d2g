  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention Arm:
Timeframe: Within 72 hours of ICU admission until ICU discharge

Program: In addition to standard care physiotherapy, individuals within the intervention arm of the trial will undergo up to one hour of supine cycling daily with the aim of training at least five times per week using a cycle ergometer (RT300 supine model Restorative Therapies, Ltd., Baltimore, United States) attached to a six channel stimulator (SAGE stimulator, Restorative Therapies Ltd., Baltimore, United States) and two additional RT50 wireless stimulator channels. 

Within the intervention arm it is a single legged design with one leg undergoing cycling alone without the electrodes turned on (sham) and the other leg undergoing cycling and muscle stimulation. Electrodes will be placed on all the major lower limb muscles. The intervention will be provided on an individual basis and supervised by a trained physiotherapist. 

Duration and Intensity: Up to 1 hour aiming for at least 5 times a week. The intensity of muscle stimulation will be delivered at a level able to cause visible muscle contractions in all muscle groups and will be confirmed by palpation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both groups will receive usual medical and nursing care in the ICU and ward. Both groups (control and intervention) will receive standard care physiotherapy including respiratory and rehabilitation with mobilisation activities such as sitting out of bed, marching on the spot, and mobility training. The standard care physiotherapy will be provided for up to 15 minutes in total per day.

A subgroup of 20 individuals (10 from the intervention arm and 10 from the control arm of the trial) will be involved in biomarker analyses. This will involve collection of muscle biopsy, blood and urine analyses at baseline and ICU discharge.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intensive care acquired weakness is a common problem following an ICU admission and leads to significant impairment in physical function and strength which is most prevalent in individuals affected with sepsis. Muscle mass reductions occur rapidly with up to 20% lost within the first week alone, this is accelerated in sepsis with greater muscle protein degradation. Whilst early rehabilitation commonly involving mobilisation has been shown to be both feasible and safe, it often is delayed in commencement as it relies on the individual being alert and able to participate in therapy. This trial involves the use of an intervention which can commence early in the ICU admission to try to minimise the muscle changes that occur without the direct need for patient participation and engagement. 

This trial will examine the effectiveness of functional electrical stimulation assisted cycling using a supine cycling machine and cycling alone compared to standard care in individuals with sepsis within the intensive care unit.

Within a subgroup of 20 individuals biomarker analyses will be performed to try to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the changes observed.</summary>
