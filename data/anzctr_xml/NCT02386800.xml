  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This roll-over protocol allows patients who are still receiving clinical benefit to continue
      to be treated from multiple protocols in one program spanning multiple indications during the
      completion of the parent study/(ies). The population for the roll-over study should be
      consistent with the population defined in the program parent study/(ies). The primary
      eligibility criteria for a patient to enter the roll-over protocol is the participation and
      completion of a Novartis OGD&amp;GMA/Incyte study with ruxolitinib. Efficacy parameters would not
      be measured; however safety data will be collected.

      Patients who have completed a prior study with ruxolitinib and who are assessed by the
      Investigator to continue to benefit from ongoing treatment with the investigational
      ruxolitinib will be eligible.</summary>
