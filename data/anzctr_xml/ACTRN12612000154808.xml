  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ocular health (by visual acuity measurements, autorefraction/subjective refraction, slitlamp examination of the anterior eye) and comfort (by subjective comfort questionnaires) of non spectacle and non contact lens wearers are assessed at the baseline, 2 hours, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the baseline over the course of the trial. The number of recruited participants may change to ensure the drop out number does not reduce the sample size to a level below what is required for the demonstration of statistical power and significance.</interventions>

Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.

Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participants ocular health / physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.  NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial

Previous corneal refractive surgery.
Currently enrolled in another clinical trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The results from this study will allow for further understanding of the ocular surface response and subjective comfort responses of the emmetropic population. The insight into the subjective comfort responses of this population can further enhance knowledge in the subjective comfort responses of the spectacle and contact lens wearing populations. The hypothesis of this study is that there will be no difference in ocular health and comfort in emmetropes over the course of three months.</summary>
