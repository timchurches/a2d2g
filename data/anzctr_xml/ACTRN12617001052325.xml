  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants who are randomized to the intervention group will be asked to use the "Managing Gout" app for two weeks. The Managing Gout app provides information about gout, its causes, identifies common triggers which may cause flares, lifestyle tips for preventing gout flares and treatment options. In addition, this app also includes a series of health trackers such as the serum uric acid tracker and gout flare tracker in which the user can enter their details and track changes across time. Furthermore, this app allows users to enter their doctor appointments, log questions for their healthcare providers, log their medications and supplements used to manage gout and other conditions and also links them to helpful online resources. Participants who are allocated to use this app can use whatever functions they find to be helpful and will be encouraged to use the app on a daily basis. They will also be sent two text message reminders (two times during the 2-week trial period) to remind them to use the app on a daily basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group will be the participants who are assigned to receive the "DASH Diet Plan" app. This app provides information about the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet eating plan which has been shown to be effective in managing various health conditions such as gout. The app educates users about the DASH diet, provides information to allow users to create a diet action plan and informs users what foods are beneficial and which should be avoided. This app also provides various recipes and meal ideas for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert and snacks. They will also receive the same text message reminders as the intervention group (two times during the two week period).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>User engagement; examined by using a modified version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) (Stoyanov, Hides, Kavanagh, Zelenko, Tjondronegoro &amp; Mani, 2015)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Upon completion of the 2-week intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Usability and acceptability of the apps will also be examined qualitatively by asking a subset of participants (n=10 from each group) to attend an interview and/or focus group about their experience using the apps.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Upon completion of the 2-week intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Illness perceptions: Illness perceptions will be measured using a gout-specific Brief Illness Perceptions Questionnaire (Brief IPQ). The B-IPQ has satisfactory reliability and validity across a range of chronic illnesses (Broadbent, Petrie, Main, &amp; Weinman, 2006).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at completion of the 2-week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gout self-care activities: Adherence and self-care activities will be assessed with a self-report questionnaire which covers exercise, medication and diet-related activities over the past seven days. These items were adapted from a diabetes-specific Multidimensional Diabetes Questionnaire (Talbot, Nouwen, Gingras, Gosselin, &amp; Audet, 1997) and have been used previously to assess self-care behaviours in gout (Dalbeth et al., 2012). This is a composite secondary outcome.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Individuals will be eligible for inclusion in the intervention if they meet the following criteria: (1) a diagnosis of gout as defined by the 2015 ACR-EULAR Gout Classification Criteria, (2) a current prescription for urate lowering therapy, (3) &gt; 18 years old, (4) ability to complete forms in English and provide informed consent, (5) own or have access to an iOS smartphone device capable of downloading apps.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>An independent samples t-test will be used to asses differences in user engagement between the two app groups. Means, standard deviations and confidence intervals will be presented with the analyses. 

Pearsons correlations will be used to explore the relationship between user engagement, secondary outcome measures, demographic characteristics, disease characteristics, and current treatments. Multiple linear regression will also be used to examine which of the variables predict higher user engagement. Content analysis will be used to analyse the focus groups and interviews.

Data analysis will be performed by SPSS</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to test user engagement of two commercially available gout apps and to examine the usability and acceptability of the apps for patients diagnosed with gout. As secondary outcomes, we are also assessing change in self-care behaviours and illness perceptions. 

Participants will be recruited through existing projects and studies already running at the School of Medicine, as well as through community advertising. The study will be conducted jointly in the Department of Psychological Medicine and the Department of Medicine, at the University of Auckland. 

Participants will trial the app for two weeks after which they will be asked to attend a focus group to examine the issues of usability and acceptability.</summary>
