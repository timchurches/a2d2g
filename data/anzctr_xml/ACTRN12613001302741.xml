  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will have cardiac MRI scan performed at baseline and also after six months. This scan takes approximately 40 minutes. Subjects randomised to AV fistula closure will undergo a small surgical procedure under local anaethesia or arm block, where an incision is made close to the AV fistula anastomoses. The venous limb is ligated and the wound is closed. This procedure will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The subjects in the control group will only need to undergo two cardiac MR scans, one at baseline and then 6 months later. There is no surgical procedure involved.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome will be assessed by looking at improvement in the left ventricular mass. A difference of more than 9.5 gram after 6 months has shown to be significant in previous studies. The LV mass will be measured by cardiac MR scan. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation will be done in the closed sealed envelope format. Patients will be allocated by 2 main investigators. The sealed envelopes will be put together in a box. At the time of randomisation an envelope is blindly picked up after shaking the box well. There are numbers in the sealed envelope that will be allocated to a particular patient at the time of randomisation. </concealment>
    <sequence>A sequence will be generated using a computer software (www.randomizer.org) to generate numbers in each arm. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on a pilot data, the sample size is estimated to 40 subjects in each group to give a statistical difference of 9.7% in LV mass with a power of 80%.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Arteriovenous fistulae continue to function in patients who have had a successful kidney transplant. This adds to the cardiovascular burden in this group of patients. Closure of these fistulae have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies. If this is demonstrated in a randomised controlled trial, this could help guide nephrologists to form definite opinion as practice varies widely among hospitals.</summary>
