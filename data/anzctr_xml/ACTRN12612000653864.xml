  <interventions>
    <interventions>A three stage study will be undertaken. Patients will be recruited to each stage in order of recruitment. Thus, the first 30 patients recruited will receive Stage 1 of the trial, the following 12 will receive Stage 2, and the final 100 will receive Stage 3. An additional 12 patients will be recruited to Stage 3 to account for potential loss to follow up. 

Stage 1: Ferric carboxymaltose administered intravenously at a dose of up to 1000mg diluted in Normal Saline, administered over 15 minutes, as currently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. 

Stage 2: Ferric carboxymaltose administered intravenously undiluted, in a bolus over 1 minute, at escalating doses in successive patients: 400mg (3 patients), 600mg (3 patients), 800mg (3 patients) and 1000mg (6 patients). 

Stage 3: Ferric carboxymaltose, administered intravenousl;y undiluted, in a bolus over 1 minute, at a dose of up to 1000mg as per patient requirements. 

All doses will be administered once in the study.</interventions>

    <concealment>Referral 
Patients will be referred by their treating physicians to the study investigator for consideration for enrolment. Referring practitioners will be informed about the study by letter and email as well as verbal communication to practitioners (i.e. gastroenterologists, obstetricians, anaesthetists and physicians and others) who frequently refer patients for intravenous iron infusions. Direct promotion of the study to patients will not occur. 

Screening visit
Referred patients will be asked to attend for a screening visit. At this visit, patients will be informed about the study and their eligibility for participations will be ascertained according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. If the patient is eligible and consents to enrolment, written informed consent will be obtained from a study medical practitioner. A blood sample will be taken for baseline blood tests.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency anaemia remains an important clinical problem. Although oral iron is usually an adequate treatment, intravenous iron is often indicated. However, currently available agents available for total dose intravenous iron replacement require prolonged administration with admission to day wards or hospital beds, consuming considerable staff and patient time and health care resources. Ferric carboxymaltose, a novel iron-carbohydrate, has been extensively trialed and has been approved by the TGA for administration of up to 1000mg of iron (diluted in saline) intravenously over 15 minutes. This promises to greatly accelerate the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. However, preliminary data suggest that high doses of undiluted ferric carboxymaltose may be safely administered even more quickly, by rapid bolus injection. Such an approach could revolutionize the treatment of iron deficiency as patients could receive total dose iron replacement in the clinic, without requiring a hospital bed or pharmacy. We propose a three stage, single arm study two determine the safety of rapid infusion of ferric carboxymaltose at doses of up to 1000mg. We plan to recruit patients with iron deficiency anaemia presenting to Southern Health into this three stage study. In Stage 1, 30 patients will be administered iron carboxymaltose as per the TGA approved approach (up to 1000mg diluted in saline and administered over 15 minutes). Subsequently, in Stage 2, 12 patients will be assigned to a dose escalation study to identify any dose limiting toxicities associated with rapid infusion. Finally, in Stage 3, 100 subjects will be administered a total dose (based on calculated iron deficit up to 1000mg, maximum dose of 20mg/kg) of ferric carboxymaltose. The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of adverse events related to rapid infusion.</summary>
