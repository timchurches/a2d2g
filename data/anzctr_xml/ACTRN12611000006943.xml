  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Upper respiratory tract illness. Subjects report on a range of symptoms (sore throat, sneezing, runny or blocked nose, cough) and indicated severity on a 3-point scale. The severity of symptoms were self-rated as mild, moderate or severe based on the impact of the symptoms on exercise training for that day, with mild symptoms resulting in no change to training, moderate symptoms necessitating a reduction in training volume and/or intensity, and severe symptoms leading to a total cessation of training on that day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily: subjects report symptoms (sore throat, coughing, sputum, sneezing, blocked/runny nose) daily for the 77 days of the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal illness. Subjects report on a range of symptoms and indicated severity on a 3-point scale. The severity of symptoms were self-rated as mild, moderate or severe based on the impact of the symptoms on exercise training for that day, with mild symptoms resulting in no change to training, moderate symptoms necessitating a reduction in training volume and/or intensity, and severe symptoms leading to a total cessation of training on that day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily: subjects report symptoms (diarrhoea, flatulance, rumbles) daily for the 77 days of the study</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cold and flu medication use</outcome>
      <timepoint>Daily: subjects report medications used daily for the duration of the study</timepoint>
