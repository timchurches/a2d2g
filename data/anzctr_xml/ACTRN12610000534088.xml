      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: improve balance in Elderly.The acquisition of the data of the balance was carried through by means of the force of platform mark AMTI (Force Measurement Systems, USA), model Accusway Plus. To clinical analysis of the seated balance, transferences of seated for the position in foot, stability in the deambulation and changes of the course of the march, it was used the Timed Get Up and Go test (TUG)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: to verify if the hippotherapy is able to produce alterations in the postural balance of elderly. Methods: A controlled experimental study was developed. The sample selected between elderly of the community, characterizing as a sample of convenience, composed of 17 aged ones, divided in experimental group (7 subjects) and a group controlled (10 subjects). The acquisition of the data of the stabilometry was carried through by means of the force of platform mark AMTI (Force Measurement Systems, USA), model Accusway Plus. To clinical analysis of the seated balance, transferences of seated for the position in foot, stability in the deambulation and changes of the course of the march, it was used the Timed Get Up and Go test (TUG). 16 sessions of hippotherapy in the Basic Center of Hippotherapy of the Institute Cavalo Solidario, located in the Agricultural Nucleus Alexander Gusmao, Mansion 3/465 - DF. Results: In the comparison of the averages between the groups through the test of Mann-Witney, there were not significant difference in the analyzed stabilometric parameters. Already in the comparison of the averages intra group through the test of Wilcoxon, it was verified significant increase on the variable COPy and Area (p = 0,02). The averages between the experimental and control groups through the test of Mann-Witney, for analysis of test TUG were verified significant effect (p = 0,04) of the hippotherapy. In the comparison of the averages intra group through the test of Wilcoxon, was verified significant effect (p = 0,04) on the variable TUG. Conclusion: The senescence tends to normalize the stabilometric measures, being insufficient with this number of hippotherapy sessions to point on differences to this intervention. However, this frequency of treatment was enough as preditor of lesser risk of falls in elderly since the TUG test showed significant reduction of time necessary to execute it.</summary>
