  <interventions>
    <interventions>A two-group randomised, controlled, repeated measure study design will compare the generic Arthritis Self-Management Program (ASMP) delivered by lay leaders with the disease specific knee osteoarthritis self-management program (OAK) delivered by health professionals.                                                                                                                                                                               Both the OAK program and the ASMP are self-management programs and are conducted over 8 weeks in a group setting.                                                                                                                The first week and the last week include assessment sessions, and the interim 6 weeks (one 2.5hour session per week) consists of the delivery of the two different self-management programs (OAK and ASMP).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All participants in both groups will continue to receive standard medical management as required.                                                                                                                                                                            The duration of both interventions is 6 weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The ASMP will be the "control" group against which the OAK group is compared.</interventions>
