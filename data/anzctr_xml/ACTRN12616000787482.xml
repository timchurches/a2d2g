  <interventions>
    <interventions>The investigational product MILGa is a chimeric MIL-38 monoclonal antibody targeting GPC-1, which has been chemically conjugated with the chelating agent DOTA and labeled with the radioisotope Gallium 67 (67Ga). MILGa is being developed for imaging metastases in prostate, pancreatic and bladder cancer patients. A total volume of 3-8ml (1mg of antibody at an activity of 250mBq) will be infused via slow IV push. The use of the chimeric MIL-38 monoclonal antibody conjugated to DOTA and labelled with 67Ga is safe and clinically useful for the detection of advanced prostate, bladder and pancreatic tumours. The addition of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA will aim to minimise binding of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga to non-tumour sites. The initial cohort of 3 patients will receive a 250 MBq imaging dose of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga. 
Cohort 1 (Patients 1, 2 and 3)
*Patient 1: inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 48 to 72 h
*Patient 2: Four weeks after patient 1, inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 24 to 48 h 
*Patient 3: Four weeks after patient 2, inpatient treatment with continuous monitoring for 24 to 48 h 

Cohort 2 (Patients 4, 5 and 6)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with 3.5 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga. Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

Cohort 3 (Patients 7, 8 and 9)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga.  Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

Cohort 4 (Patients 10, 11 and 12)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA one hour prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga.  Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart and images using planar whole body scans and SPECT/CT.

At end of each cohort: Safety assessment by DSMC and preliminary assessment of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga scan utility will be determined. Furthermore, the effect of the dose of un-labelled chMIL-38-DOTA used per cohort on tumour targeting will be reviewed at the end of each cohort to determine the unlabelled antibody dose for the subsequent cohort.

Targeting of MILGa to patients metastases will be assessed by planar gamma imaging and SPECT/CT and compared to known metastases identified by standard of care imaging. Standard of care scans will be taken on the day of screening (visit 1) up to 14 days prior to MILGa infusion. 
Planar whole body and SPECT/CT imaging studies are planned as follows:
*Transmission whole body scan with Cobalt-57 phantom prior to infusion with patient and without patient 
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T 30mins post infusion
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T6h post infusion
*Planar whole body imaging and SPECT/CT at T24h
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T48h
*Planar whole body imaging and, if required, SPECT/CT at T72h (Day 3) 
*Planar whole body imaging and SPECT/CT at T144h (Day6) 
*Planar whole body imaging at 2 weeks post infusion (if required)
Any potential metastatic lesion identified on MILGa scanning but not visible on routine scans may be followed by standard radiology and, if possible, be biopsied later.
Scan parameters:
*Whole Body scan step-and-shoot, tri window of 300keV, 184keV and 93 with a window of +/- of 13%, 10%, 10%; Medium Energy Collimators; 180 second per step/bed-length. Whole body acquisition at 6hours, 24hours, 48hours, 72hours with the potential for further scans if required.
*SPECT/CT: tri window of 300keV, 184keV and 93 with a window of +/- of 13%, 10%, 10% and a scatter correction window of 75 with a +/- window of 7%; Medium Energy Collimators; Step and Shoot 60/frames (or 6 degree intervals); 30second acquisition per step; Matrix 512x512; Attenuation Correction CT only; at 24hours and possibly 48hours.
*Transmission whole body scans with Cobalt-57 phantom prior to patient infusion. One scan will be conducted with the patient, followed by a second scan without the patient. Each scan is approximately 25 minutes. The transmission whole body scan will be carried out for attenuation correction for isodosing of tissue. A nuclear medicine physicist will measure this.</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group however standard of care scans and baseline scans will be taken for each patient prior to MILGa infusion. MILGa scans for each tumour type will be compared with a standard of care imaging scan which includes a technetium bone scan for prostate cancer and CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis for prostate, pancreas and urothelial cancers. this will be carried out up to 14 days prior to MILGa  infusion. Additionally,  before MILGa infusion a study radiologist will identify the metastatic lesions radiologically using standard of care scans (CT and bone scan) Whole body SPECT/CT scans will be taken post drug infusion at T30 minutes, T6 hours, T24 hours, T48 hours and T72 hours. Blood will also be collected for haematology and biochemistry analysis as well as tumour markers (CA-19.9/ CEA/ PSA).  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety/tolerability of MILGa during infusion and post infusion. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the following parameters: vital signs, 12-lead ECGs and blood draws, biomarker blood draws, urinalysis, haematology and biochemistry blood analysis and physical examination. Additional time points for safety tests such as vital signs, physical exams and laboratory safety tests may be added during the course of the study based on newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring. Prior to dose administration for all patients, higher dependency unit bed in ICU/CCU will be arranged for patient monitoring. Dose administration will be performed in an advanced life support equipped area with dedicated medical staff at hand. The first patient will be monitored as an inpatient for the first 48 h. Assuming a good safety profile for Patient 1, Patients 2-12 will be monitored as an inpatient for the first 24 h post infusion. All patients will be closely monitored post infusion to identify and manage immediate hypersensitivity organ reactions.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The number of participant (n=12) was determined based on previous first-in-human Phase 1 immunotherapeutic imaging trials. The primary focus of this study will be on determining the safety and tolerability of MILGa in patients with advanced cancer. Most analyses will be descriptive or exploratory.
All available data including adverse events, changes in laboratory values and other safety and efficacy parameters will be evaluated for each tumour stream. 
With respect to secondary objectives of evaluating the utility of MILGa as a diagnostic tool, we have allocated four patients per tumour stream estimating between two and fifteen lesions per patient with the hypothesis that the MILGa Ga67 scan will have a sensitivity/specificity of greater than 80% in identifying metastatic disease when compared to standard of care imaging.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to examine the safety and tolerability of a newly developed antibody, MIL-38/Gallium67 (MILGa) for imaging metastases in adults with prostate, bladder or pancreatic cancer. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 years or older, have been diagnosed with prostate, pancreatic or urothelial (bladder, ureter, urethra, renal pelvis) metastatic cancer, with between 2 and 15 metastases, with the cancer determined to be stable or progressing slowly. 
Study details:
Patients 4-12 will be given a single dose of unlabelled chMIL38-DOTA one hour prior to MILGa drug infusion. All participants in this study will be given a single dose of MILGa, followed by various scans and blood tests for the following 4 weeks. Scans will include a range of CT scans, and patients will also be monitored for adverse events. It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on the safety and tolerability of MILGa administration, and on the efficacy of the antibody for imaging metastases. 
Cohort 2 (Patients 4, 5 and 6)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with 3.5 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga. Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart. 
Cohort 3 (Patients 7, 8 and 9)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga and. Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart. 

Cohort 4 (Patients 10, 11 and 12)
Patients in this cohort will be infused with an incrementally higher dose within the range of 3.5 mg and 24 mg of unlabelled chMIL-38-DOTA prior to receiving 1 mg chMIL-38-DOTA labelled with 250 MBq 67Ga. Each patient in this cohort will be dosed 2 weeks apart. 

At end of each cohort: 
Safety assessment by DSMC and preliminary assessment of chMIL-38-DOTA-67Ga scan utility will be determined. Furthermore, the effect of the dose of un-labelled chMIL-38-DOTA used per cohort on tumour targeting will be reviewed at the end of each cohort to determine the cold antibody dose for the subsequent cohort.</summary>
