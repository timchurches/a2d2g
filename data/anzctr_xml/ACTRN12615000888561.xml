  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises two patient centred educational exchange sessions (based on social marketing/academic detailing principals) conducted by the research pharmacist; one session is conducted face to face before discharge and one by telephone approximately ten days after discharge. 
The first part of the sessions has structured questions from previously validated questionnaires to identify patients beliefs about their stroke in general (using the brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (brief- IPQ))  and medications in particular(using the Beliefs about Medicine questionnaire specific (BMQ-specific)  to identify necessity and concern beliefs. There is also an opportunity for the patient to self-report their previous medication taking behavior (using the Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ)) of the medications of interest. 
The identified concerns (which can be barriers) and necessities (which can be enablers) identified from the validated questionnaires are taken into account and can be referred to in a brief personalised conversation using a two sided single page document given to the participant (the detailing tool) to outline each of up to three (stroke prevention) medications the patient is taking and the delivery of four a-priori key messages. This expected to take a total of twenty to thirty minutes both for the face to face session and for the telephone follow-up session. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care
Usual care includes admission to a stroke specific ward, multidisciplinary care by the stroke team, education using National Stroke Foundation materials by the stroke nurse, clinical pharmacy services provided by the ward pharmacist and discharge advice provided by the medical staff. Usual care provided by the ward pharmacist includes medication history taking and reconciliation, medication review during the admission, discharge reconciliation, provision of a medication list at discharge and medication counselling at discharge.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size- The primary outcome is adherence measured by the proportion of days covered (PDC) over the three months after discharge, using prescription refill data for three classes of medications (antithrombotic, antihypertensive and lipid lowering medications).
The sample size calculation used the criterion for significance (alpha) set at 0.05 and the power (beta) at 80%. It is proposed that the intervention will result in a 7% improvement in adherence compared to standard care. This difference of 7% was selected as reasonable; because an effect of this magnitude has been shown with secondary prevention medications used for cardiovascular diseases  and has been linked to a clinical difference. An effect size of 0.54 (0.07/0.13) was selected using results from a study conducted with participants discharged on similar medications after a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.  A sample size of 55 in each arm is required for effect size of 0.54, We allowed for a slighter larger pooled standard deviation of 0.15 (effect size 0.7/.15= 0.47) requiring a sample size of 73 . Allowing the addition of 15% for using a nonparametric test due to skewed data and assuming attrition rates of approximately 10% we would need to enroll at least 92 participants for each group; we propose to include 100 participants in each arm. 

Data entry and analyses will be performed using Microsoft Excel 'Registered Trademark' and SPSS Statistics 22 'Registered Trademark'. Demographic data and baseline characteristics in the intervention and control groups will be compared using summary statistics.  Comparative analysis will be conducted to compare outcomes and changes in outcomes over baseline to 3 months and baseline to 12 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Medications recommended to reduce the risk of a subsequent stroke are prescribed after a stroke or Transient Ischemic event (TIA). To gain most benefit, patients need to be able to self-manage these medications. That is; to organize continued supply of these medications with their general practitioner and community pharmacy, to take them as agreed with the prescriber and to be able to communicate any unwanted effects they may experience.
The primary aim of this study is to determine if a patient centred educational exchange added to usual care improves adherence to prescribed medications for secondary prevention for stroke patients compared with usual care.
We have a number of secondary aims to investigate the further impact of this relationship based model of information exchange on sustaining adherence, self-reported medication taking behaviour, clinical outcomes, quality of life, changes in knowledge, beliefs towards medicines and illness and to determine the cost of the model.
Patients who have been admitted to the Stroke Unit, Princess Alexandra Hospital, with a diagnosis of stroke or TIA and who are being discharged back to their own home will be approached to participate in this study.
Participation in this project will involve completing a questionnaire on three or four occasions. 
The first will be before the participant is discharged from hospital, the second will take place over the telephone about 3 months after discharge and the third over telephone at 12 months after discharge. The questionnaire will take about fifteen minutes to complete. The questionnaire contains questions related to the participants quality of life, the participants views of stroke, the participants view and opinion of their medicines prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke and questions on the way the participant takes their stroke prevention medications. The telephone interviews will also ask questions about GP and Hospital visits, perceived medication related problems, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol results if known.   
About half of the participants in this study will be chosen (by randomisation) to have a longer interview with the researcher before discharge from hospital. This will be a conversation about the participants stroke medications. These participants will also be contacted by telephone approximately ten days after discharge from hospital. The telephone call will involve the same questionnaire, a conversation about their stroke medications and an opportunity to follow-up on any questions the participants may have about their medicines.
