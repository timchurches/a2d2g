  <interventions>
    <interventions>The effects of dietary supplementation of 2.0g of phytosterols (phytosterol-enriched margarine) with or without curcumin (capsules) each day. This randomised control trial is a 2x2 factorial placebo-controlled design.
Hypercholesterolaemic individuals will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms for 4 weeks:
Arm 1: Placebo: 25g Regular canola-based margarine spread plus placebo (2 x 500mg capsules) per day.
Arm 2: 25g Logicol margarine spread (i.e. 2g phytosterols) plus placebo (2 x 500mg capsules) per day.
Arm 3: 25g Regular canola-based margarine spread plus Curcumin (2 x 500mg capsules) per day.
Arm 4: 25g Logicol margarine spread (i.e. 2g phytosterols) and Curcumin (2x 500mg capsules) per day.

The margarine will be pre-weighed into individual containers containing the daily dosage and all of the daily dose of margarine (i.e. 25g) is to be consumed. Participants will be instructed on how to consume the margarine at their initial visit to the research clinic. The margarine is to be consumed as a regular margarine or butter spread would normally be used (i.e. spread on bread, crackers, muffins etc) however, not used for cooking or melted on top of vegetables.

To assess compliance:
1. Participants will be asked to record their daily consumption of the two intervention products in a standardised log provided to them. 
2. Participants will be asked to return all margarine containers and capsule bottles at the end of the trial for record and weighing of any remaining products. </interventions>

    <concealment>Interested subjects will contact the study investigator who will then assess the subject's eligibility to participate over the phone. If the participant is deemed eligible, the participant will be sent a consent form, participant information statement and will be enrolled in the study. They will also be sent a series of self-administered questionnaires (medical history, physical activity, 3-day food record) along with instructions. All forms will need to be completed and returned upon baseline visit. 
Allocation to treatments will be based on the computer generated block randomization method to ensure well-balanced groups. The allocation concealment will be conducted using sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size determination:
Twenty participants in a 2x2 factorial study design will give 80% power to detect a 10% drop in total cholesterol levels at alpha = 0.05. We will recruit 4x20 = 80 participants according to the inclusion criteria.

Baseline data:
Baseline measures will be used as covariates. Gender, age and other potentially confounding variables such as anthropometrics, physical activity levels, and duration of hypercholesterolaemia may be added as covariates if they are significantly correlated with the outcome measures.

Treatment effects:
All the data relating the significant effects of phytosterols and/or curcumin will be expressed as mean+/- SEM. The effect of interventions on blood lipids and pro-inflammatory markers between groups will be estimated using two-way ANOVA with post-hoc comparisons (Tukeys significant difference). Significance (P-value set at 0.05) indicates the changes from the baseline values. Changes from baseline will be determined using non-parametric analysis (Wilcoxons signed ranked test). This statistical analysis will help to determine whether there will be a significant main effect for each independent variable by testing for between subject effects. The statistical analysis by this method will be performed to evaluate the synergistic effects between Phytosterols and Curcumin.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide.Two major risk factors for CVD are high levels of blood cholesterol and inflammation. It is well known that dietary supplementation with foods enriched with plant sterols lower cholesterol levels by 10% in 3 weeks. It is also known that curcumin (found in tumeric) has anti-inflammatory properties. This project aims to investigate if combined dietary supplementation with plant sterols and curcumin reduces blood cholesterol and inflammation to a larger extent than either of the treatments alone.It is expected that participants will have improved levels of blood cholesterol, fatty acids and markers of inflammation as well as an overall reduced 10-year risk of developing CVD. The findings of this research could translate to wider public health benefits through the development of a single functional food that combines both phytosterols and curcumin (e.g. margarine spread or reduced-fat milk). This could be easily incorporated into the regular diet of the general Australian adult population in order to minimise the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. </summary>
