  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Oventus O2Vent is an oral appliance similar in appearance to a mouth guard. It is a modification to the Oventus Clearway, designed to treat snoring and sleep apnoea. It is made up of two parts. The main structure which forms the breathing port at the front leading to the airways on each side to the rear of the appliance, is made from polished medical grade titanium with a polymer insert. The lower portion is made from dual laminate and is positioned in an advanced position to bring the jaw forward. Further adjustment of the jaw position is much easier with a screw mechanism.

The device will be delivered by a dentist in a dedicated dental clinic. Eligibility for a dental appliance will have been confirmed on a visit prior to enrollment into the trial.  The appliance is custom made and has a built in airway to allow airflow through the device. The device will be fitted by the dentist with either the built in airway open (Treatment 1) or closed (Treatment 2). During the dental fitting, the dentist will check the fit of the appliance and provide instructions on use and cleaning. The device will be worn every night during sleep and removed on waking for the duration of the study. During an acclimatization phase of 2-8 weeks, ongoing symptoms, side effects, comfort and usage will be assessed via questionnaires every 2 weeks and device adjusted to achieve optimal lower jaw advancement. When treatment has been optimized, efficacy may be confirmed using a level 3 home sleep study to inform clinical opinion that treatment is optimized. Comfort and compliance will then be assessed using a questionnaire and sleep diary over a 2 week period with efficacy established on a level 1 in laboratory sleep study at the end of the 2 weeks.. Participants will then cross over into the other Treatment group and comfort, compliance and efficacy assessed over a 2 week period as described.. In the interest of not withdrawing treatment, there is no washout period between the 2 treatment arms.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comfort and compliance with the airway open (Treatment 1) will be compared to comfort and compliance with the airway closed (Treatment 2). Airway closed will be considered as the control.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Compliance (Nightly Usage): Prior data indicate that nightly use of the first generation Oventus appliance was average 7 hours with SD of 2. For a 10% reduction in usage with airway closed, we expect a difference of 0.7, and using SD of differences of 1, we will need to study 29 subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with probability (power) 0.95.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. Paired t tests will be used to compare Treatment 1 and Treatment 2 compliance. 

A total of 40 subjects will be recruited to allow for 25% drop out rate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Like other oral appliances to treat snoring and sleep apnoea, the O2Vent brings the jaw forward to reduce airway collapse. However, it also has a built in airway to allow breathing through the device. This may make it suitable for use by patients who find it difficult to breathe exclusively through the nose. A recent pilot study showed that original design, the Oventus Clearway, was safe, effective and well tolerated with a 62% reduction in the number of times patients stopped or reduced their breathing during sleep.  No difference in response rate was observed in patients with or without subjective symptoms of nasal congestion. 

The new generation Oventus device, the O2Vent, has the built in airway of the original design, however it is 2 parts, an upper and lower part. This makes it much easier to adjust and find the optimal jaw position.. 

The aims of the present study are to:
1. To demonstrate safety and efficacy of O2Vent oral appliance
2.  To demonstrate that the incorporation of an enclosed airway into the O2Vent improves comfort and compliance
3. To confirm the equivalent response rate in subjects with nasal congestion using rhinomanometry as an objective measure of nasal congestion

The above aims will be addressed using a randomized crossover study design with patients in one arm using the O2Vent with the built in airway open and in the other arm using the device with the built in airway closed.
