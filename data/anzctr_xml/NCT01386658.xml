  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic (PK) Profile after a single SC injection (in prepubertal children with an acute attack of HAE and pubertal/postpubertal children with or without an acute attack of HAE) - PK parameter estimates will include, where appropriate: actual icatibant and metabolite concentrations at each sampling time, time to peak concentration (Tmax), actual peak (Cmax) and minimum (Cmin) concentrations, clearance (CL/F), actual area under the plasma concentration-time-curve (AUC0-last and AUC0-inf), mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) and elimination half-life (t1/2).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Administration through 6 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of a single SC dose of icatibant - Safety and tolerability will be assessed by standard criteria including injection site reactions, adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters (serum chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, urinalysis), reproductive hormone levels, and immunogenicity (presence of anti-icatibant antibodies).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment through day 90</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to onset of relief of symptoms and time to minimal symptoms, as measured byinvestigator- and subject-reported outcomes (only for subjects treated with icatibant during a HAE attack) -  For subjects 2 to less than 18 years of age: investigator assessment and scoring of cutaneous, abdominal and laryngeal symptoms of acute HAE attacks by an investigator-rated symptom score. For subjects 4 years of age and older only: subject self-assessment of HAE related pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). For subjects less than 4 years of age only: investigator assessment of HAE-related pain (cutaneous, abdominal and laryngeal) using a validated pain scale (Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability [FLACC]).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment through 8 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of subjects with worsened intensity of clinical HAE symptoms between 2 and 4 hours after treatment with icatibant for subjects who have experienced HAE attack only</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment through 4 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of rescue medication use for subjects who have experienced HAE attack only - Rescue medications are only monitored through the current attack and not through 90 days</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment through day 90</timepoint>
