    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptom reduction during the objective nutrient challenge test (participants will be asked to drink 200 ml of a liquid meal consisting of 3.8 g protein, 13.8 g carbohydrate, 3.4 g fat/100 ml every five minutes and report symptoms after a total of 600 ml).

    <concealment>Subjects qualifying for the study (n= 70) will be randomized to one of two treatment arms using random blocks by computer. Concealed allocation will be assured by central allocation through the JHH, PAH, Nepean Hospital and Gosford Hospital pharmacies. Recruited patients will undergo a washout period of 2 weeks and eligible patients will attend an appointment at the outpatient clinic to formally consent to the study, complete baseline assessments and collect medication. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis plan: Randomized groups will be compared in terms of potentially confounding variables. If any baseline differences between groups are found that may affect the outcome variables these will be included as covariates in a covariance model including group and covariate terms. If the assumption of normality is not met formal inference will employ the nonparametric bootstrap. A sample of n=32 per study group will provide statistical power &gt;0.9 at the 0.01 (two-tailed) level of statistical significance if the improvement in mean eosinophil count is 50% from a base of mean 33, SD=19 among treated individuals but only 15% among controls. N=32 per group will also provide statistical power of 0.9 at the 0.01 level of statistical significance for a Cohen d effect size of 1.0 for comparisons of symptom reduction.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional dyspepsia affects a considerable proportion of Australians and results in significant personal and economic cost. There is as yet no cure for this condition and current treatments are generally not effective for the majority of people with functional dyspepsia. 

New research into the causes of functional dyspepsia have found that the numbers of a type of immune cell, the eosinophil, are increased in the top of the small bowel in patients with dyspepsia.

A treatment called Budesonide has been shown to lower the amount of the eosinophils in the top of the small bowel. Budesonide  is already an effective treatment in the management of other diseases including coeliac disease, collagenous sprue, oesophagitis and bronchitis. It is suspected that Budesonide will also be a promising treatment for functional dyspepsia but this needs to be properly tested.

In this study we aim to test the effectiveness of Budesonide in people with functional dyspepsia in a randomised placebo controlled, double blind study. </summary>
