  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a decision aid to assist women aged 70 years and over to make an informed choice about whether to continue screening mammography, as part of the monitoring and evaluation program of BreastScreen NSW. 

Women who are due their FIRST screening mammogram over the age of 70 will be randomly allocated into one of two groups, to receive either (a) Decision Aid -a paper based workbook and personal worksheet containing balanced information on the outcomes of screening mammography for women aged 70 years and older, steps to decision making and a values clarification exercise, or (b) standard BreastScreen NSW information material. Three weeks later, women in both groups will be followed up to find out if those who received the decision aid had better knowledge and more realistic expectations of the potential benefits and harms involved in screening mammography, and reduced decisional conflict about whether or not to continue screening mammograms. The impact of the decision aid on rates of participation in screening mammography among women aged 70 years and older will be followed up after three months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcomes of the study are to assess the impact of the decision aid on (1) the proportion of women who make an informed choice about whether to continue or stop having screening mammograms.
The trial consists of 3 surveys: (1) Baseline computer-assited telephone interview (CATI) survey for women recruited into the trial (taking approximately 15 minutes to complete); (2) Postal questionnaire (20 minutes to complete)- measuring decisional conflict, anxiety and knowledge. At this stage, women will be sent either the decision aid or standard care information;  (3) CATI Survey (10 minutes to complete).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks after receiving the questionnaire/decision aid or usual care material, participants will be telephoned and asked questions about their decision or intentions regarding screening mammograms.  The responses will be cross checked with BreastScreen NSW records to validate participation in screening.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>To ensure allocation concealment, the mailing lists will only be seen by persons not involved in data collection. Dynamic allocation means no one knows beforehand which ID's will be allocated to a particular intervention. Interviewers for the pre-questionnaire telephone surveys do not know which intervention a particular respondent will receive.</concealment>
    <sequence>The dynamic (adaptive) random allocation method will be used for sequence generation. Participants are allocated to a treatment group by checking the allocation of similar participants already randomised, and allocating the next treatment group</sequence>
