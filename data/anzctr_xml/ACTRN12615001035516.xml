  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 weeks supplementation of TENDOFORTE [Trademark] P (containing 5g of highly bioactive collagen peptides) in drink form  in combination with eccentric exercise therapy.

Participants will be asked to consume the treatment twice per day with each dose containing 2.5g of highly bioactive collagen peptides or placebo. Participants will consume either TENDOFORTE or placebo for 12 weeks followed by another 12 weeks of the opposite treatment (placebo or TENDOFORTE) without any washout period in between.  Participants will be asked to bring back unused packets of the investigational product.

The eccentric calf muscle exercises will be performed  with straight knee and with bent knee as described by Alfredson et al. Participants will be instructed to perform 90 repetition, twice a day, for a duration of 2 times 12 weeks without any washout period in between. Participants will be asked to begin the eccentric exercise program on the first day without a period of gradual increase. Participants will be instructed that these exercises commonly cause pain and that they should ignore this pain. They will also be  instructed to increase the load when the exercises could be performed without any discomfort. Increasing load will be done using a backpack, with added weights, or a weight machine. When pain during or after exercises is unbearable or disabling, the patient will be advised to contact the clinician. The patients will be informed that they could expect muscle soreness, besides experiencing pain. All patients will be instructed to avoid weight-bearing sporting activities for the first 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, gradual return to sports activities will be encouraged if the pain allowed.

In a one-on-one instructional session, a physiotherapist will explain and demonstrate the exercise programme and participants will also be shown a video of the exercises. Furthermore, the participants will be asked to perform a series of supervised eccentric drops, until the technique is correct. 

In order to monitor adherence to the intervention, a research assistant will contact  participants through e-mail on a weekly basis and ask them to fill out the number of successful eccentric exercises each day of the week. If the participant does not reply to this e-mail, he/she will be contacted by phone. 

After 4, 12 and 24 weeks a face-to-face appointment with a physiotherapist will be scheduled to discuss the progress and check whether the correct technique is still being used.

      <outcome>Ultrasonographic Tissue Characterization (UTC)
"Real-time consecutive transverse ultrasound images will be taken of the Achillles tendon allowing the tendon to be evaluated in 3 "planes of view" and the stability of the ultrasound pattern can be quantified.
Measurements made by the UTC that are carried out: 1. maximum AP diameter 2. distance of the lesion from insertion 3. lesion type (I-IV) 4. percentage intact collagen bundles. 
A composite of these imaging measurements forms the primary outcome

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot research project is to perform a case control study with a cross-over design to explore the potential clinical benefits of 2 times 12 weeks (twice daily) supplementation of TENDOFORTE [Trademark] P (containing 2.5g of highly bioactive collagen peptides) or PLACEBO in chronic midportion Achilles tendinopathy patients as an add-on therapy to 24 weeks of eccentric exercise therapy.
To improve our understanding of the in vivo working mechanism of this nutraceutical, we aim to investigate the ultrastructural and microvascular changes of the Achilles tendon using contrast enhanced ultrasonography, ultrasonographic tissue characterization as well as bicomponent analysis of Achilles tendon volumes ultrashort echo spin (UTE) on a 3T MRI.</summary>
