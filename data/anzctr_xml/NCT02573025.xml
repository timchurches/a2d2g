Treatment: drugs - PEG-IFN alfa-2a market formulation (Reference)

Experimental: Test Followed by Reference - Participants will receive PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation (Test) in Period 1, followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a market formulation (Reference) in Period 2 on Day 1 of each period with a washout period of 14 to 21 days.

Experimental: Reference Followed by Test - Participants will receive PEG-IFN alfa-2a market formulation (Reference) in Period 1, followed by PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation (Test) in Period 2 on Day 1 of each period with a washout period of 14 to 21 days.


Treatment: drugs: PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation (Test)
Participants will receive single injection of 180 micrograms (mcg) of PEG-IFN alfa-2a BA-free formulation, subcutaneously via prefilled syringe in either period 1 and 2 (each period having 35 days).
