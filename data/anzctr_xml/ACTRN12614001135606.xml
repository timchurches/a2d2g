  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy will be randomly assigned, to receive either general anesthesia or lumbar epidural anesthesia supplemented by general anesthesia. In general anesthesia group, following preoxygenation and an intravenous induction sequence consisting of propofol (2.5 mg/kg), lidocaine (1-1.5 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 microg/kg) and cis-atracurium (0.2 mg/kg), laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation will be performed. 
In lumbar epidural anesthesia with supplemental general anesthesia group, an epidural catheter will be placed through the intervertebral space between T12 and L1 or L1 and L2 before induction of anesthesia.  Then, a bolus dose of ropivacaine 10% (15 +/- 2 ml) will be injected while epidural anesthesia will be considered as adequate when sensory blockade reaches the T4 level. Induction of anesthesia will be identical to the one previously described for general anesthesia group.
In both groups, blood samples for resting plasma concentrations of cortisol, human growth hormone, prolactin, glucose and C-reactive protein determination, will be collected at 9 AM on the day prior to surgery, intraoperatively (just before termination of pneumoperitoneum) and on the first postoperative day.
Furthermore, intraoperative hemodynamic data will be recorded on seven predefined time points: following anesthesia induction, during institution of CO2 pneumoperitoneum, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and termination of pneumoperitoneum and end of surgical procedure. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be the performance of laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia, which will be tested against to the combination of general plus epidural anesthesia.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical stress response. 
Blood samples for stress hormones determination, will be kept on ice (4 degrees Celsious), until centrifugation at 1000 g for 15 minutes within 30 minutes of collection and thereafter, the serum will be separated and stored at -30 degrees Celcius until further analyzed with radioanosometric method. PRL and GH will be analyzed by a solid-phase, two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay with a detection limit of 1.9 to 25 ng/ml and 0.06 to 5 ng/ml, respectively. Solid-phase, competitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay will be used for detection of COR with morning normal values range between 5 to 20 microg/dL. Plasma glucose levels will be determined by a glucose oxydase method, while serum concentration of CRP will be measured by an immunoprecipitation method.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for resting plasma concentrations of cortisol, human growth hormone, prolactin, glucose and C-reactive protein determination, will be collected at 9 AM on the day prior to surgery (baseline), intraoperatively (just before termination of pneumoperitoneum) and on the first
postoperative day.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemodynamic variables such as heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure will also be recorded intraoperatively. Heart rate will be assessed by ECG recording and mean arterial pressure will be recorded by direct arterial pressure monitoring.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intraoperative hemodynamic data including heart rate and mean arterial pressure, will also be recorded on seven predefined time points: following anesthesia induction (time point 1), during institution of CO2 pneumoperitoneum, 15 minutes, 22 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and termination of pneumoperitoneum (time points 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) and end of surgical procedure (time point 7).
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative analgesic efficacy will be graded with a 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visual Analogue Scale will be assessed at rest on postoperative hours 1, 6 and 24.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 22 subjects in each group was estimated for a type 1 error of 0.05 (a= 0.05) and a power of 80%. The power was increased to 90% with eight patients in each group. Ultimately, 31 patients were selected in each group to minimize the impact of potential independent variables on stress-hormones release or to compensate for possible drop-outs. An estimated &gt; 25% difference in stress hormones plasma levels between groups was defined as the primary end-point. 
Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements with Greenhouse-Geisser correction, was conducted to analyze continuous variables over time. Normality of data was assessed by KolmogorovSmirnov test. Students t-test or Mann Whitney U test were used for comparison of means between two groups, as appropriate. Subgroup comparisons of categorical variables were assessed by a chi-square or Fishers exact test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to investigate the impact of general anesthesia alone or supplemented with epidural anesthesia on the perioperative response to surgical stress. Thus, we will study the comparable changes in hemodynamics, stress hormones (cortisol, human growth hormone and prolactin), glucose levels and C-reactive protein levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedures. We would like to test the hypothesis that general anesthesia supplemented with epidural anesthesia exerts a favourable impact on surgical stress hormone compared to general anesthesia alone.</summary>
