          -  No prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy is allowed; patients should only have had a
             biopsy of the primary tumor without an attempt at complete or partial resection;

               -  Are lesions which are discontinuous from the primary tumor, are not regional
                  lymph nodes and do not share a body cavity with the primary tumor; if there is
                  any doubt whether lesions are metastatic, a biopsy of those lesions should be
                  taken

             malignancy

          -  Pregnant women will not be entered on this study; pregnancy tests must be obtained in
             female patients who are post-menarchal; lactating females may not participate unless
             they have agreed not to breastfeed their infants; males or females of reproductive
             potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective
             contraceptive method for the duration of the study treatment

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy to see how well it works
      compared to combination chemotherapy with topotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with
      non-metastatic extracranial Ewing sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine
      sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, etoposide, and topotecan
      hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy
      is more effective with topotecan hydrochloride in treating Ewing sarcoma.</summary>
