  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Melatonin: People allocated to the melatonin intervention will be provided with melatonin which will be sourced from compounding pharmacies. We will provide a low dose (3mg), non-sustained release preparation. Participants will be asked to take the melatonin one hour before the desired bedtime with a small amount of water. Melatonin will be taken daily for 8 weeks. 
Arm 2: Behavioural intervention: Participants receiving the behavioural intervention will receive four consultations with an occupational therapist. The occupational therapist will problem solve with the carer to develop a management plan incorporating sleep hygiene advice. The four consultations lasting up to one hour will be provided over a maximum of a 4 week period. The first consultation will take place in the home and remaining consultations may take place in the home or over the phone depending on client needs. Treatment records written by the occupational therapist will be used to examine adherence to the intervention protocol and to describe the intervention provided. Additional fidelity checks will not be undertaken.   </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: Usual care. Usual care means that the person will continue with existing arrangements for their health care. There are no restrictions in terms of the care that they access during the study period. </comparator>
