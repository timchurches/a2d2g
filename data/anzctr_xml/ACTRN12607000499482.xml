  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using a 0.25 x 30mm needle, acupuncture will be applied to the points LR14 in the sixth intercostal space, PC6 on the forearm and LR3 on the foot as a standard treatment protocol.  There will be another additional point added for three variations to the standard "Liver qi" pattern.  For subjects with "Liver qi stasis" alone, the point GB34 on the knee will be added.  Where subjects exhibit "Liver qi statis with heat" the point LR8 on the knee will be added.  If the subject exhibits "Liver qi invading earth", the point SP6 near the ankle will be added.  Consequnelty there will be four points used for any one of three presenting Liver patterns.  Once placed, a "de qi" sensation shall be obtained and the needles left in situ for 20 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disease version 4 (DSM IV) is used to measure the extent of depression (mild, moderate, severe under the DSM IV classification of major depression) and exclude other mental illnesses eg. bi-polar, psychotic episodes etc that would otherwise exclude the subject from the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The initial interview using the DSM IV is undertaken as part of the recruitment (ie prior to intervention). If a subject is accepted into the trial, they complete the series of questionaries and intervention begins within 1 week. Subjects are also measured against DSM IV criteria post intervention immediately after their last treatment and again 8 weeks later at a follow up interview.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are self identifying/selecting.  An initial interview is undertaken using the DSM IV to determine if the subject qualifies as suffering from major depression and does not exhibit any conditions relating to the exclusion criteria.  Subjects are screened to ensure they are taking the correct drugs (SSRIs) and fit the Chinese medical pattern diagnosis of "liver qi stagnation". If the subject qualifies they are randomly allocated to either a treatment or wait-list control group by selecting a coloured bead from an opaque jar.  Allocation is concealed as the interviewer is unaware as to which group the subject will be allocated until after the subject qualifies for the study.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Individuals intially assigned to the wait-list are not informed that they have been wait-listed.  They are tested at the intial interview and again 8 weeks later prior to commencement of the treatment.  They are informed of their allocation to the wait-list at the conclusion of the trial.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to develop and test a rigorous acupuncture study design that will determine if acupuncture has a significant therapeutic effect in the treatment of depression. This will increase the understanding of how acupuncture can be effectively used as an adjunct therapy to treat depression and may lead to reduced drug dependency and side effects for patients.  Subjects will need to be medically diagnosed as having major depression and be taking serotonin uptake inhibitors (prescribed medication). They will also be screened for the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnostic pattern of liver qi stagnation. Subjects will be treated with acupuncture and the outcomes of the treatment assessed using standard questionnaire/assessment tools.</summary>
