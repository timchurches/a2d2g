    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - DEVINE vancomycin regimen

Experimental: DEVINE vancomycin regimen - This is the intervention arm and will be the pharmacokinetically derived vancomycin dosing regimen.


Treatment: drugs: DEVINE vancomycin regimen
The dosing regimen varies by weight and height and by initial or ongoing dose prescribed. The loading dose is based on actual volume of distribution of vancomycin whilst the ongoing doses are based on creatinine clearance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current Australian guidelines for vancomycin commonly underdoses individuals particularly in
      the first 48 hours.

      The aim of the trial is to compare two dosing regimens; the current Australian guidelines
      versus a more appropriately modeled pharmacokinetic based regimen with the overall aim of
      developing a new vancomycin dosing strategy that will enable patients to have more
      individualised and therapeutically efficacious treatment.

      The hypothesis is that dosing vancomycin according to a pharmacokinetically modeled regimen
      increases the likelihood of achieving therapeutic trough levels of vancomycin within the
      first 48 hours (or at steady state, whichever is sooner) compared to dosing vancomycin
      according to the current Antibiotic guidelines.</summary>
