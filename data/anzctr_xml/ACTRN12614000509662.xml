  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a multi-modal exercise programme adapted from the exercise therapy protocol used in the Management of Osteoarthritis Trial (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12608000130369). The programme includes lower limb strengthening (with additional specific exercises that target the hip abductor muscles) and stretching exercises, neuromuscular retraining (focusing on balance) and core stability exercises. The exercises will be delivered in a group setting (lead by a physiotherapist), but will be individually-tailored according to the abilities and impairments of each patient. 

The group sessions for each cohort of participants in the Intervention Group (6 in each, 12 in total) will be held twice a week in an exercise laboratory at the School of Physiotherapy, University of Otago. These will run over an 8-week period, and each session will last for approximately an hour. A log will be kept of attendance/completion of the prescribed group exercise sessions. 

Participants in the intervention group will also receive an individualised home exercise programme to do on the days they do not attend class, which will take approximately 30 minutes. Participants will also be provided with a calendar log to document adherence to the home exercise programme, use of analgesics and any adverse treatment responses (e.g. such as an increase in hip pain). Any adverse reactions occurring during the exercise classes will also be documented. Those assigned to the Control Group will not receive the intervention but continue with usual care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group (n=12), matched to the Intervention Group for sex and where possible age. Participants will continue to receive usual care offered by healthcare providers (which may include visits to general practitioners, physiotherapists, osteopaths) and will not receive the exercise programme (prehabilitation).</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from the waiting list of the Orthopaedic Department, Dunedin Public Hospital. After patients reach a priority threshold for hip joint replacement surgery, they are contacted by a Clinical Nurse Specialist (CNS) to commence screening procedures prior to surgery. On successful completion of screening and associated management, patients are then given certainty their surgery will be performed within the next 4-5 months. If the patient agrees the CNS will pass the contact details of the patient onto one of the investigators who will then post out the information sheet. After receiving the information and having had time to consider participation, each patient will be telephoned to ask if she/he would like to take part and meets the eligibility criteria (verbal consent). If she/he agrees, an appointment time will be made whereby written informed consent will be obtained prior to undertaking the functional assessment and imaging. Following surgery, information regarding the surgical approach used for each participant will be provided to the researchers. Participants in the Intervention Group will be recruited first, followed by those in the Control Group (matched for age and sex where possible).</concealment>
    <sequence>No randomisation. Participants in the Control Group will be matched where possible for age and sex to those participants in the Intervention Group</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The outcome assessor will be blinded to progress with the intervention, but will be aware of who is assigned to the Intervention and Control groups due to the design of the study.

Potential participants on the waiting list for hip joint replacement surgery will be consecutively assigned to the Intervention Group if eligible. Participants in the Control Group will be matched where possible for age and sex to those in the Intervention Group, and recruited consecutively from the waiting list. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: Case control study involving 24 participants (intervention group, n=12; control group, n=12). We have consulted with Mr Andrew Gray, Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago regarding study design, sample size and statistical analyses. In determining the sample size of this pilot study we have considered factors such as cost (MRI and ultrasound scanning), and the timely performance of the clinical assessments before and after completing the 8-week
group exercise programme and post-operatively.

One-way repeated measures ANOVA will be used to compare group means for WOMAC, functional test scores and muscle strength at each time point. The estimate of variance will be used to calculate the required sample size for a future RCT. Additionally a student t-test will be used to compare muscle strength of the symptomatic hip with the contralateral side. 

Muscle volumes will be compared for each imaging method, pre- and post-intervention as previously described (Flack et al 2012, Surg Radiol Anat 34: 847-55). Volumes obtained from MRI and ultrasound will also be compared using a one-way ANOVA. The reliability of ultrasound will also be established using a subset of patients (n=4) who will come twice (within a few days of each other) for a repeat examination.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis of the hip is a common chronic condition that affects the health and wellbeing of New Zealanders with approximately 7000 people undergoing hip joint replacement per year. This pilot study will examine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an exercise programme for patients awaiting hip replacement (prehabilitation). It will also investigate whether ultrasound can be used as a reliable tool to assess hip muscle volume, a modifiable parameter with potential as an outcome measure.</summary>
