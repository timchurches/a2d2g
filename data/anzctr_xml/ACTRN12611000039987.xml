  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention implemented by undergraduate students of physiotherapy trained and supervised by a physiotherapist teacher applied in two sessions of 40 minutes with a one week break in between the two sessions: manual therapy that were applied in the cervical region consisted of manual traction of the neck , extending the bilateral upper trapezius, scalene, sternocleidomastoid and levator scapula and massage in the region of the upper trapezius and neck applied only to the Epley maneuver, which was performed according to the affected semicircular canal and is composed of a series of head movements to direct the particles into the utricle, and then recommendations were passed as sleeping or sitting with the trunk elevated 45 degrees, recliner, wedges, or use two pillows for 48 hours after the maneuver for seven days and avoid sudden movements and those that do not cause dizziness, no sleep on the affected ear, and looking up or down. It was based also required that patients had their daily activities, with great variability in head movement remain neck collar to prevent head movements.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients showed improvement in physical appearance in the short term with 15 points after the second session representing short-term improvement and 10 points after 6 months at long-term improvement, being that the closer to zero the better the effect of vestibular rehabilitation on the dizzy when assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 02 sessions and six months after the second intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients get scores in the emotional aspect maintained in the short term, with five points after the second session and after six months, and the closer to zero the better the effect of vestibular rehabilitation on the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo when evaluated by Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 02 sessions and six months after the second intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The patients had scores in the emotional aspect in the short term, with eight points after the second session and 11 points after six months, and the closer to zero the better the effect of vestibular rehabilitation on the patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo when assessed by the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), demonstrated that the framework of the patients worsened in this respect</outcome>
