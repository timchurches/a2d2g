  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A difference of 7mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. This is measured using 24hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring where the device records blood pressure every 30minutes over a 24hour period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At six months postpartum</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Edinburgh Depression Scale score of &gt;12</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health and development of child. The health of the child is assessed by a paediatrician at six months of age and again at two years of age. The development of the child is assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire at six months (completed by the parent/caregiver) and a Bayley-III at two years of age done by a Child Developmental Psychologist.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The study is powered to show a clinically significant difference of 7mmHg in diastolic blood pressure. The sample size is calculated at 88 (44 per group) at 90% power and significance level at 0.05. It is likely that the sample size required to show statistically significant differences using the psychological measure of depression (320, 160 per group) may be impractical. However, the prevalence of depression will be reported and a post hoc analysis will be performed to determine the power for the psychological sub-study. 
Potentially confounding variables will be sociodemographic variables such as ethnicity, social class and education level. We will test for interaction between psychological state and results of 24hr blood pressure monitoring. Descriptive analysis of the two groups and a comparison between the two groups will be made.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the physical and mental health of mothers, and the health and development of their babies, in women who had high blood pressure in their pregnancy and women who had normal blood pressure. Specific aims are to:
1. establish normal ranges in our local population in the first two years after birth
2. Identify significant differences from normal in women who had high blood pressure
3. Identify women and/or infants who may be at increaed risk of physical, mental or developmental problems in the long term
The primary hypothesis is that women who had high blood pressure in their pregnancy will have abnormal physical parameters eg higher blood pressure, more frequent depressive symptoms and their babies are more likely to have health and/or developmental problems at six months and two years of age.</summary>
