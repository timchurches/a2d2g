      <outcome>Mean change from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 (ACQ-7) total score at Week 24 - The 7-item ACQ is a participant-reported questionnaire assessing asthma symptoms (night-time waking, symptoms on waking, activity limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing) and daily rescue bronchodilator use. Participants will be asked to recall how their asthma had been during the previous week. Questions will be weighted equally and scored from 0 (totally controlled) to 6 (severely uncontrolled). The mean ACQ score is the mean of the responses. Mean scores of =&lt;0.75 indicate well-controlled asthma, scores between 0.76 and &lt;1.5 indicate partly controlled asthma, and a score &gt;=1.5 indicates uncontrolled asthma. Individual changes of at least 0.5 are considered to be clinically meaningful.</outcome>

             or reproductive potential as follows:

        A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant (as confirmed by a
        negative serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test), not lactating, is not planning on
        becoming pregnant during the study and at least one of the following conditions applies:
        Non-reproductive potential defined as pre-menopausal females with documented tubal ligation
        or documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure with follow-up confirmation of
        bilateral tubal occlusion or hysterectomy or documented bilateral oophorectomy;
        Postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical
        profile (e.g., age appropriate, &gt;45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy).

        stimulating hormone and estradiol falling into the central laboratory's postmenopausal
        reference range is confirmatory. Females under 60 years of age, who are on hormone
        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt, are required to use a
        highly effective method to avoid pregnancy if they wish to continue their HRT during the
        study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status
        prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between
        the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
        of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, subjects can resume use of

             Global Lung Function Initiative

          -  Liver function tests at Visit 1: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;2 x upper limit of
             normal (ULN); alkaline phosphatase &lt;=1.5xULN; bilirubin &lt;=1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%)

          -  Compliance with completion of the Daily eDiary reporting defined as completion of all
             questions/assessments on &gt;=4 of the last 7 days during the run-in period.

          -  Respiratory Infection: Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or
             viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during
             the run-in period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the subject's
             ability to participate in the study.

          -  Severe asthma exacerbation: Evidence of a severe exacerbation during screening or the
             run-in period, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an
             in-patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required
             systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Asthma medication: Changes in asthma medication (excluding run-in medication and
             albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provided at Visit 1).

          -  Laboratory test abnormalities: Evidence of clinically significant abnormal laboratory
             tests during screening or run-in which are still abnormal upon repeat analysis and are
             not believed to be due to disease(s) present. Each Investigator will use his/her own

        Exclusion Criteria for Randomization

          -  Respiratory Infection: Occurrence of a culture-documented or suspected bacterial or
             viral infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract, sinus or middle ear during
             the stabilization period that led to a change in asthma management or, in the opinion
             of the Investigator, is expected to affect the subject's asthma status or the
             subject's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Severe asthma exacerbation: Evidence of a severe exacerbation during enrolment or the
             stabilization period, defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic
             corticosteroids (tablets, suspension, or injection) for at least 3 days or an
             inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required
             systemic corticosteroids.

          -  Asthma medication: Changes in asthma medication (excluding stabilization period
             medication provided at Visit 2 and albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provided at

    <summary>A once-daily 'closed' triple FDC therapy of FF/UMEC/VI via a single ELLIPTA® dry powder
      inhaler (DPI) is being developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) with the aim of providing a new
      treatment option for the management of asthma by improving lung function, health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL) and symptom control over established combination therapies. This is a
      phase III, multi-center, active-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of the FDC of FF/UMEC/VI with the FDC of FF/VI. This study
      has 5 phases: Pre-Screening (Visit 0), Screening/Run-in, Enrolment/Stabilization,
      Randomization/Treatment, and Follow up. At Visit 1 (Screening), subjects meeting all protocol
      defined inclusion/exclusion criteria will enter a 3-week run-in period and will receive fixed
      dose inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist (ICS/LABA) (fluticasone/salmeterol,
      250/50 micrograms (mcg), via the DISKUS® DPI) one inhalation twice a day. At Visit 2
      (Enrolment), eligible subjects will be enrolled into the 2-week stabilization period to
      receive FF/VI (100/25 mcg via the ELLIPTA DPI once a day, in the morning). At the conclusion
      of the stabilization period (Visit 3), all subjects who meet the pre-defined randomization
      criteria will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1:1 during the treatment period to receive either
      FF/UMEC/VI (100/62.5/25 mcg; 200/62.5/25 mcg; 100/31.25/25 mcg; 200/31.25/25 mcg) or FF/VI
      (100/25 mcg; 200/25 mcg) via the ELLIPTA DPI once daily in the morning. The duration of the
      treatment period is variable but will be a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks.
      Subjects will have up to 6 on-treatment clinic visits scheduled at Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and
      8/End of Study (EOS) (Weeks 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 52, respectively). A follow-up visit will be
      conducted approximately 7 days after the end of treatment period or, if applicable, after the
      early withdrawal visit. Subjects will be provided with short acting albuterol/salbutamol to
      be used on an as-needed basis (rescue medication) throughout the study. Approximately 2250
      subjects will be randomized, with approximately 375 subjects randomized to each of the 6
      double-blind treatment arms to ensure approximately 337 evaluable subjects per treatment arm.
