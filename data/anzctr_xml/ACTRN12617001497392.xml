  <interventions>
    <interventions>A quality improvement program for all patients undergoing colorectal resections at the Karolinska University Hospital (Section of coloproctology). The program contains three key elements and was implemented in January 2010. The post implementation study period was January 2010-December 2013.
1. Exclusion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs peri-operatively from 5 days before surgery to 7 days after surgery..
2. Introduction of intra-operative goal-directed fluid therapy. This was managed by stroke volume optimization using esphageal Doppler (CardioQ-ODM, Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK).
3. Avoidance of primary anastomoses in emergency resections. Surgeons were instructed to avoid emergency oncological resections of obstructing cancers by instead performing temporary defunctioning ostomies or avoid primary anastomosis if emergency resection was unavoidable (i.e. bowel perforation or severe bleeding).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is the cohort of patients that were operated with colorectal resections at the Karolinska University Hospital (Section of coloproctology) during the last four years before the implementation of the quality improvement program i.e. January 2006-December 2009.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculation shows that with a power of 80% for the detection of a decrease in anastomotic leakage rate from 10% to 5% the number of participants in each group must be at least 435. The study period is set accordingly. The assumption is based on data from our local quality data base and other similar studies.
Groups are compared with non-parametric tests and Fishers exact tests. Univariable logistic regression is used to assess the crude effect of study period and other predictors on anastomotic leakage. Potential confounders are assessed with multivariable logistic regression analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Failure of healing bowel joints after surgery constitutes a serious clinical problem. The purpose of this study is to assess if a quality improvement program at the Karolinska University Hospital can reduce the risk for complications after bowel surgery. The hypothesis is that structured changes in clinical practice can reduce the risk of leakage in surgically constructed bowel joints. The different components that constitutes the program have been suggested to improve surgical outcomes in previous studies. The outcomes for patients operated before and after the implementation of the quality improvement program will be compared.</summary>

    <publicnotes>The study was initiated before the ethics approval date. This is due to the fact that the trial is retrospective and observational and based on data from a local prospective quality registry. This type of audit and assessment does normally not require an ethics approval in Sweden but was applied for when publication of the results was intended.  </publicnotes>
