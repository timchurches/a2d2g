    <interventions>Brief name: ENTICE Intervention

Materials and mode of delivery: Telehealth coaching delivered using mobile phones, and a workbook to be provided to all participants. Workbook content is based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines for Adults and contains self-monitoring checklists for salt and food groups serves each day. Workbooks also contain sections to record goals and progress towards those goals. 

Procedure: Telehealth coaching aimed at supporting a dietary pattern that includes reduced dietary sodium intake and adheres to Australian Dietary Guidelines. Using a patient-centred approach, intervention delivery is based on empirical evidence that supports a focus on self-management; repeated support and two-way feedback and monitoring and underpinned by Social Cognitive Theory. Each call is anticipated to last 30-45 minutes. 

Mode of delivery and number of contacts:  Phase 1, Week 0-12: Telehealth coaching (fortnightly coaching calls with text messages scheduled twice per fortnight between calls); Phase 2, Week 12-24: Tailored text messages (2 x 10 minute tailoring phone calls to determine the number, frequency and content of text messages to be provided based on participants goals and perceived barriers, educational tips, and reinforcement). 

Who and Location: Coaches will be accredited practicing dietitians with training in renal nutrition and will deliver the intervention from a central calling centre within the local health service.

Personalisation: Educational content will be personalised to the participants goal for dietary change and associated co-morbidities, which will be continuously assessed at baseline and at each coaching call. 

Fidelity: standardised training to coaches in behaviour change, motivational interviewing and renal nutrition and standard call content checklists. Regular peer-review of counselling and fortnightly case discussions with the lead investigator will support counselors in intervention delivery and standardisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control:  Usual care with delayed contact beginning at week 12. Participants randomised to usual care will receive the study workbook, without individualised telehealth coaching. Usual care includes a referral to a nephrologist and may or may not include referral to a dietitian over the 12 week period. Delayed contact will be undertaken at week 12 to 24, including 1-4 text messages sent per week (at the discretion of the participant) to support adherence to a dietary pattern consistent with Australian Dietary Guidelines and lowered dietary sodium intake.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diet and lifestyle have been identified as the leading modifiable risk factors in chronic disease, of particular relevance considering the cardiovascular burden in chronic kidney disease (CKD). People with CKD identify diet and lifestyle programs for preventing deteriorating kidney function as their highest ranked research priorities.

However, dietary change can be considered complex for patients with CKD. Patients are frequently advised on the manipulation of single nutrients, which often conflicts with associated co-morbidities and advice from other health professionals.  Evidence from our recent systematic reviews have indicated:  healthy eating patterns in CKD are associated with lower risk of mortality; current evidence from clinical trials to support dietary change  in CKD are limited. CKD patients prefer a repeated, coaching approach with frequent feedback to support dietary change; and telehealth strategies enhance adherence to dietary change compared with traditional models.

This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the feasibility, patient acceptance, and clinical impact of telephone-based contact with additional or standalone tailored text messages compared with usual care to support dietary adherence among patients with chronic kidney disease.</summary>
