  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - SBCV
Other interventions - Saline

Experimental: SBCV - SBCV is administered to the site immediately post balloon dilation.

Placebo Comparator: Control - Saline is used as a control and is delivered immediately post balloon dilation.


Other interventions: SBCV
SBCV is a single use, sterile product that acts as a localized physical barrier at the vascular wall.

Other interventions: Saline
Saline is used as a control.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events - The composite of no all-cause perioperative (=30 day) mortality and none of the following events at 24 weeks following treatment:
Index limb amputation (above or below the ankle)
Index limb re-intervention
Index-limb-related death</outcome>
