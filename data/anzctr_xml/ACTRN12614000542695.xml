  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Methodology	Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Multi-Centre trial of aggregated N-of-1 Trials compared to parallel group RCT on the Effects of melatonin on SOL in children and adolescents with ADHD who are receiving stimulant medication.
Study Duration	6 weeks (3 pairs over a six week period) for each individual participant
Objectives	Hypotheses:
1) Melatonin is effective for alleviating initial insomnia in ADHD children who are receiving stimulant medication; and 
2) N-of-1 trials provide a similar estimate of treatment effect with less uncertainty than a parallel group RCT. 

Objectives:
1) To determine the efficacy of melatonin in shortening sleep latency times in children with ADHD treated with stimulants

2) To determine whether n-of-1 trials provide similar estimate of treatment effect with less uncertainty than a parallel group RCT 
Number of Participants	300 participants (children), 300 parent/guardians from Queensland and Canada
