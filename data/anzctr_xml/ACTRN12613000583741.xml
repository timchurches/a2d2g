  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised controlled trial - 12 weeks
Arm 1: moderate-intensity (50% VO2R), high-volume (16 kcal/kg/wk) aerobic (treadmill and cycle ergometer) exercise programme. 
Arm 2: moderate-intensity (50% VO2R), low-volume (8 kcal/kg/wk) aerobic (treadmill and cycle ergometer) exercise programme.
Arm 3: vigorous-intensity (80% VO2R), high-volume (16 kcal/kg/wk) aerobic (treadmill and cycle ergometer) exercise programme. 

Notes:
1. Frequency and duration of individual exercise sessions will vary across participants in order to meet specific arm exposures for exercise intensity (i.e., %VO2R) and exercise volume (i.e., kcal/kg/wk).  
2. All individual exercise sessions will be supervised by an exercise physiologist.
3.  Attendance records and participant logs will be used to monitor exercise programme adherence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed trial is a randomised controlled clinical trial designed to study the effects of exercise training programmes differing in exercise volume (kcal/kg/wk) and/or exercise intensity (relative to maximal oxygen uptake reserve  VO2R) on cardiovascular disease risk factors in a cohort with existing risk factors for CVD.  It has been recommended that additional studies be undertaken to assess the doses (volume and exercise intensity) of exercise required to elicit beneficial effects on established CVD risk factors and overall cardiovascular health.  Identification of the specific amount and intensity of exercise for achieving specific outcomes will advance exercise prescription guidelines for future primary prevention programmes.  Understanding these dose response relationships will ultimately result in enhanced evidence-based practice.  

Aims and hypotheses:
1. To determine if there will be greater CVD risk factor reduction following participation in a moderate-intensity (50% VO2R), high-volume (16 kcal/kg/wk) exercise programme compared to a moderate-intensity (50% VO2R), low-volume (8 kcal/kg/wk) exercise programme.  It is hypothesized that in a dose-response manner, there will be greater CVD risk factor improvements in the moderate-intensity, high-volume exercise group.   

2. To determine if there will be greater CVD risk factor reduction following participation in a vigorous-intensity (80% VO2R), high-volume (16 kcal/kg/wk) exercise programme compared to a moderate-intensity (50% VO2R), high-volume (16 kcal/kg/wk) exercise programme.  It is hypothesized that in a dose-response manner, there will be greater CVD risk factor improvements in the vigorous-intensity, high-volume exercise group.
