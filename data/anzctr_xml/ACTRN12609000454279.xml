  <interventions>
    <interventions>non-mechanised [belovac] dressing.
Jelonet, dry sterile foam with belovac drain, occlusive dressing are placed on the wound at the time of surgery and remain in situ for 5/6 days post-op.  Negative pressure via the belovac drain is apllied for the entire duration.  Dressing is then taken down by member of research team, photograph taken and reviewed by blinded team member.</interventions>
    <comparator>Commercial KCI vaccum dressings with commercial vaccuum pump  placed on the wound at the time of surgery and remain in situ for 5/6 days post-op with continuous pressure of 125mmHg.  Dressing is then taken down by member of research team, photograph taken and reviewed by blinded team member.</comparator>
