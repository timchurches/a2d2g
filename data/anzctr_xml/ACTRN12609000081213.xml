  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention: Encapsulated magnesium sulfate.  Capsules containing dried magnesium sulfate, an osmotic laxative which draws water into the bowel making it easy to pass stool.  Individual dosage will vary according to need, but will range between 5-45 capsules, and average between 10-20 capsules.  Each capsule contains 950mg of magnesium sulfate.  The dosage will be taken orally, once weekly for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will be their own comparator group, comparing constipation symptoms and laxative use prior to enrolling on the study, with their symptoms and laxative use (other than Investigational Product) while on the study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the efficacy of magnesium sulfate at variable dosages (up to 65 capsules, 61.75mg) as an ongoing weekly treatment for chronic constipation, measured by an improvement in constipation symptoms.  Constipation symptoms will include frequency of opening bowels, time spent on toilet, degree of straining, unsuccessful trips to the toilet, incomplete evacuation, the urge to open the bowels, use of aperients and a range of quality of life questions.  All symptoms will be assessed using a patient-completed questionnaires, provided at the initial visit, then repeated at 6 and 12 weeks.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the acceptability of magnesium sulfate to patients as an ongoing weekly treatment for constipation (palatability, tolerability, compliance, ease of use).  Palatability and ease of use will be measured using patient completed questionnaires, with 5-point scales. Compliance is assessed by the trial staff checking the remaining capsules in the bottles, and tolerability will be assessed by measuring the frequency and severity of side effects, which may include headache, bloating, soreness of back passage, and nausea.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess patient satisfaction with their bowel habits during the trial period compared to their previous habits. Satisfaction will be a composite measure based on change over time for a number of measures including constipation symptoms and quality of life; also a reduction in anxiety and physical discomfort levels; and the reoccurance of spontaneous bowel actions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine how well a once-weekly dose of Colocap Balance (magnesium sulfate) works in the treatment of chronic constipation.  The study hypothesis is that a single, weekly dose of capsules, sufficient to create a strong urge to open the bowel and empty the bowel, will lead to an improvement in constipation symptoms, allow for a reduction in laxative use, and encourage the bowel to start working spontaneously between doses.</summary>
