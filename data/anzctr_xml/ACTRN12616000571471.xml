  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To examine the effects of daily almond intake over a period of 8 weeks in overweight and obese individuals with increased risk of metabolic disease on a comprehensive array of novel markers of metabolic health that share complex interrelationships including:
1. Blood glucose regulation throughout the day/night
2. Liver fat concentration and composition
3. Abdominal (including visceral) fat volume
4. Liver function
5. Gut bacteria profile and functionality
7. Body weight and composition
8. Cardiovascular Disease Risk Markers
9. Systemic Inflammatory Markers
The primary hypothesis is that daily almond consumption (56g  consumed as 2 between meal snacks) for 8 weeks will reduce diurnal PPG and GV and hepatic lipid content to a greater extent than an isocaloric control snack.
Secondary hypotheses are that daily almond consumption (56g  consumed as 2 between meal snacks) for 8 weeks will improve measures of liver function, gut microbiome and permeability, systemic inflammation and traditional metabolic health markers (i.e. fasting insulin and glucose, HbA1c and lipids including cholesterol and triglyceride) to a greater extent than an isocaloric control snack.
