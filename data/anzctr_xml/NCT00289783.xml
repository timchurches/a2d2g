    <summary>This study evaluates the immunogenicity and consistency of 3 Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine lots and
      the safety and immunogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to a control group receiving
      licensed Hib conjugate vaccine, when each are co-administered with Pediarix® to healthy
      infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age. The study will also evaluate the safety and
      immunogenicity of Hib-MenCY-TT vaccine compared to a control group receiving licensed Hib
      conjugate vaccine, when each are co-administered with M-M-R® II and Varivax® at 12 to 15
