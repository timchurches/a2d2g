Experimental: Treatment (combination chemotherapy) - INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute or infused via minibag on days 1, 15, and 29; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3; methotrexate IV over 24 hours on days 15 and 29; etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 43-45; and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 43-45. Treatment repeats every 63 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute or infused via minibag on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 21-23, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 21-23. Treatment repeats every 42 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating younger
      patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic desmoplastic medulloblastoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.</summary>
