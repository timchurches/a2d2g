    <studytitle>A trial determining whether injections of local anaesthetic in front and behind the hip can make arthroscopic hip surgery less painful</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients having arthroscopic hip surgery are ultrasound guided anterior and posterior pericapsular injections of local anaesthetic as good as or better than injections of saline alone for relief of pain following surgery</scientifictitle>

    <concealment>A research assitant will determine suitable candidtaes from a surgical list. Patients would then be contacted by phione and sent study material by mail or electronically. 

Consenting patients will be randomised in equal numbers to either the pericapsular local anaesthetic or the pericapsular saline groups. Randomization will result in a set of sealed randomization envelopes.  Each successive patient will be assigned a unique identification number.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated by computer.  The sequence will include stratification for center and will be arranged within permuted blocks.  The statistician will maintain a confidential schedule of patient numbers and procedure allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients find hip arthroscopy surgery to be very painful in the first few hours following the operation. We think this may be due to the swelling of the hip joint capsule that occurs during this type of surgery. The purpose of this study is to determine whether injecting local anaesthetic medication on both the front and the back of the hip joint, at the start of the operation, will make this surgery less painful.</summary>
