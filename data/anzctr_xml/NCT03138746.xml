  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a recent series of studies performed by our group, we have shown that exposure to
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) leads to an increase in insulin sensitivity in male subjects with
      type-2 diabetes (T2DM) and in obese and overweight men without diabetes. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the relationship between pressure and oxygen in producing this
      effect, specifically, is this effect measurable in hyperbaric air or is some higher pressure
      of oxygen required?

      Aims:

        1. To determine whether the insulin sensitising effect of HBO is apparent in hyperbaric air
           at the same pressure as HBO.

        2. To examine mechanisms underpinning the increase in insulin sensitivity following HBO.</summary>
