  <interventions>
    <interventions>This cross-sectional study explores key factors in the decision to move into residential care for patients who have been admitted to hospital from home. The study uses short, semi-structured interviews to examine the issues from the perspective of the patient, primary carer and relevant ward staff. This is an observational rather than an interventional trial. The duration of the study is 6 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This observational trial addresses 3 key questions: 1) What has changed as a result of the injury or illness that led to your hospitalisation?; 2) who requested the Aged Care Assessment (ACAT) and what decision has been made regarding future accommodation and care needs?; and 3) what were the key factors in the decision to move from hospital to residential aged care?</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interviews will be conducted subsequent to ACAT approval for permanent residential aged care and prior to relocation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome is to document patient, carer and social work perceptions of the process of moving from hospital to residential aged care and how the process might be improved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interviews will be conducted subsequent to ACAT approval for permanent residential aged care and prior to relocation.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Decisions about admission to residential care are being made in the acute hospital and at a time of crisis due to a sudden deterioration in the older persons ability to self-care and/or the informal care support system becoming overwhelmed. 
Decisions involving the transition from home to nursing home or hostel accommodation are complex due to the involvement of the patient, their next of kin or family and medical and allied health professionals. There are many factors that contribute to the decision to move and the importance of these factors may differ for each person.

This study seeks to explore the issues and tensions around movement into residential care and identify the key factors in the decision, from the perspective of older people admitted to the RGH and their carers. This will be achieved through short, semi-structured interviews with patients, carers and ward staff.</summary>
