  <interventions>
    <interventions>Restricting time in bed to time actually spent asleep according to sleep diary information. Initially subjects will be instructed to adjust their bed times and waking times (keeping waking time consistent) so that time in bed (TIB) is reduced by 50% of excess wakefulness. This is calculated using the average of 2 weeks of sleep diary information. That is, average time in bed - average sleep time = average wake time. Participants are initially instructed to subtract half the average amount of time spent awake from their average time in bed, giving their bedtime allowance. Bedtime is adjusted, morning arising is kept constant. E.g. If sleep diary information shows: 9h (average time in bed) - 6h (average sleep time) = 3h (average wake time) then 9h (average time in bed) -1.5h (half average wake time)= 7.5h (time allowed in bed) so bedtime would be adjusted to 1.5h later than usual. This regimen is followed for two weeks during which time a sleep diary is kept. The average sleep and wake times are then reviewed at an appointment with the researcher at the two week mark - if sleep efficiency has not improved to the point where the sleep efficiency falls between the desired range of 85-90%, time allowed in bed is further restricted so that average time in bed = average time spent asleep. If sleep is &gt;90% efficient or daytime sleepiness is worse, 30 minutes is added to the time allowed in bed. The new instructions are given which the participant is instructed to follow nightly for two weeks before making a self-assessment and adjustment of their sleep. No further sleep diaries/actigraphy are required until outcome measures at 6 months. Participants are given a handout with the sleep self-adjustment algorithm which they use to adjust their sleep themselves every fortnight. This algorithm does not require calculations but requires a self assessment of sleep and daytime functioning. The algorithm adjusts bedtimes by +30 minutes, -30minutes or no change. Fortnightly readjustment of sleep by the participant continues until completion of the intervention at 6 months, at which time 2 weeks of sleep diary/actigraphy are recorded and outcomes assessed. This group also receives the handout of modified sleep hygiene instructions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Modified sleep hygiene instructions are used as an active control so that time spent with the investigator and receiving instructions is matched to that given to the intervention group. Sleep hygiene is not thought to be an effective treatment for insomnia as a single treatment. The instructions are made more benign by avoiding giving any instructions about naps or consistent sleep schedules. Participants have already been screened for the exclusion criteria of 'insomnia due to inadequate sleep hygiene' to make this comparison intervention as inactive as possible. The instructions are as follows:
1) limit use of caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes
2) avoid vigorous exercise in the 3-4 hours before bedtime
3) minimise excessive noise, light temperature in the bedroom. Ensure bed is not too hard or soft
4) Avoid heavy meals or spicy foods at night
5) Taking a warm bath or having a hot drink (milk) can aid with sleep
6) Use the bedroom only for sleep and intimacy. Do not work in the bedroom
7) Use a bedtime ritual to get you in a relaxed mode for bedtime.
These instructions are given as a handout and verbally explained by the investigator at randomisation. The participants are instructed to follow this advice nightly. A sleep diary is recorded for two weeks prior to randomisation and for the first two weeks of the trial. After two weeks of following the instructions nightly, the participants are reviewed and the instructions are reiterated. Thereafter, participants are asked to continue to follow the instructions on a nightly basis until they are seen at the conclusion of the trial at 6 months. Two weeks of sleep dairy and actigraphy recording are made at this point, and outcome measures recorded. The time spent with the investigator and the timing of these contacts are matched between the intervention and control groups. Contact time between participant and investigator during these contact time is recorded using a stopwatch to allow verification of this matching.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are limited options for treating primary insomnia in the primary care (general practice/family medicine) setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a multicomponent treatment has shown to be effective. However, there is limited access to this treatment as trained practitioners are often scarce, acceptability is often problematic as it involves 1-2hours sessions for a number of weeks, and cost poses a real financial barrier. Added to this, the family doctor is unable to treat their patient at the point of care. Sleep restriction is one of the components of the multicomponent CBT. Our hypothesis is that this is the most effective component. This study will be testing if sleep restriction is effective as a stand-alone treatment for primary insomnia in the primary care setting.</summary>
