  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to help determine whether chemotherapy doses can be better adjusted for different body sizes and compositions. Chemotherapy doses are normally adjusted to match a patients size. There is concern It is thought that when dosing larger people in this way, they might experience more side effects from chemotherapy because of the bigger chemotherapy doses. Therefore many doctors around the world, including those at this institution, will keep chemotherapy doses below a certain maximum threshold. However some international studies have shown no increased side effects from giving larger people bigger doses of chemotherapy.  This study will try to determine if there is any difference in side effects for patients of different body size when dosed in the usual manner with a maximum dose threshold in place.</summary>
