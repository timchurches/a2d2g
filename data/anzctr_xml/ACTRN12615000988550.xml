  <interventions>
    <interventions>36 participants will be recruited for this study. There will be 3 experimental groups to which participants will be randomly and equally assigned: 

Group 1: Control Trial
The control group will be administered a constant infusion of saline (400 mL 0.9% saline) for 4 hours prior to consuming a 500 mL (total) of a protein beverage (~30 g of whey protein).

Group 2: Lipid (Fat) Emulsion Trial
The lipid emulsion group will be administered a constant infusion of lipid (fat) emulsion (400 mL 20% intralipid) for 4 hours prior to consuming a 500 mL (total) of a protein beverage (~30 g of whey protein).

Group 3: Exercise Trial 
Participants in the exercise trial will be administered a constant infusion of lipid (fat) emulsion (400 mL 20% intralipid) for 4 hours. During the first hour of this infusion, participants will undertake a non-strenuous exercise session consisting of 30 minutes cycling at 50% of aerobic capacity. Participants will then complete a resistance exercise session consisting of an appropriate warm-up and then 6 sets of 10 repetitions at 75% of pre-determined maximum strength level of leg extension. At the end of the 4 hour infusion, participants will consume a 500 mL (total) protein beverage (~30 g whey protein) exactly the same as in the control trial. 

Participants in each of the three groups will then rest throughout a 4 h recovery period during which additional skeletal muscle biopsies will be obtained at 2 hours and 4 hours following the ingestion of the protein drink.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1: Control Trial
The control group will be administered a constant infusion of saline for 4 hours prior to consuming a 500 mL (total) of a protein beverage. The proteins to be ingested are found in whole foods of a normal diet, and have been shown previously to increase muscle growth.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured, via the infusion of a stable (non-radioactive) isotopic amino acid tracer, upon termination of the intralipid infusion and 2 and 4 hours following the ingestion of protein in all trials. Determination of MPS requires muscle biopsy sampling at the aforementioned time points; hence, 4 h after the intralipid  (or saline) infusion commences and 2 and 4 h following the ingestion of the protein drink. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Circulating free fatty acids</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured in plasma at rest, 1 h following the start of the intralipd (or saline) infusion and every 20 min until the first muscle biopsy and subsequent ingestion of protein. Plasma will then be acquired every 15 min for the first our following protein ingestion and every 30 min thereafter until 4 h post-protein ingestion. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cell signaling protein expression determined by initial processing (i.e., homogenization in appropriate buffers) of skeletal muscle (~30 mg) samples and subsequent Western blot analysis. In brief, homogenized samples will be boiled in Laemlli's sample buffer and then run, by electrophoresis, on pre-cast (Bio-Rad) criterion gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and proteins  immunodetected by probing a target antigen with the corresponding, commercially available (e.g., Abcam, Cell Signaling) antibody. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Determination of cell signaling protein expression requires muscle biopsy sampling which are to be collected at the end of the 4 h intralipid (or saline) infusion and then 2 and 4 h following the ingestion of the protein drink. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gene expression will be determined by reverse-transcribing RNA extracted from skeletal muscle (~15 mg) samples, generation of a cDNA template and measurement of gene expression (i.e., mRNA transcript abundance) by the PCR technique. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Determination of gene expression requires muscle biopsy sampling which are to be collected at the end of the 4 h intralipid (or saline) infusion and then 2 and 4 h following the ingestion of the protein drink. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <sequence>The randomization will be initially stratified by age (35-39, 40-45, 46-49, 50-55). Subsequently, simple randomisation by roll of dice within the stratified segregation will be used to allocate individuals to each of the 3 groups. This will ensure that an equal number of subjects from each category of age will be allocated to a treatment group</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ingestion of excess energy, particularly fat, is largely responsible for the current epidemic of lifestyle-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes and sarcopenia (the progressive loss of muscle mass with increasing age). The development of sarcopenia is exacerbated by low levels of physical activity and also in overweight or obese individuals through an increase in body fat and concomitant decrease in muscle mass. However, performing resistance and aerobic exercise in combination with the ingestion of high-quality protein sources (e.g., dairy-based protein) has been shown to enhance and/or maintain muscle mass. This has important health implications for reducing the risk of developing sarcopenia, obesity or other debilitating health conditions such as diabetes. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to investigate whether high fat levels decreases the muscle growth response following resistance and endurance exercise and protein ingestion. </summary>
