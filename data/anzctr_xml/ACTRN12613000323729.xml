  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot trial is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multi-centre trial which will investigate the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing lower-limb arthroplasty.

Tranexamic acid has been approved for use in lower limb arthroplasty in Australia. Although there is evidence to support its efficacy in reducing bleeding, trials examining the incidence of uncommon but serious thrombotic complications in patients receiving TXA for arthroplasty procedures have been small and heterogeneous. A large randomised controlled trial is required, and this pilot study is designed to enable the refining of trial methodology and to determine the feasibility of conducting trial procedures in a smaller group.
