  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study requires 4 study visits, seperated by at least 3 days. Prior to each of the 4 study days, subjects will be provided with a McCains meat lasagne (400g, frozen) to consume for dinner the night before the study. Subjects will be asked to fast after this until arriving in the department. 

 On study days 1 and 2, subjects will recieve, in randomised, double-blinded fashion, a single 60 minute intraduodenal infusion at 4mL/min of either: 
a) 3.0 kcal/min (Whey Protein Hydrolysate)
b) 3.0 kcal/min (10% Intralipid)

Appetite sensation questionnaires in the form of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be administered and blood samples taken at t=-10 (prior to commencement of infusion- baseline), 0 (beginning of infusion) and throughout the infusion at t=15,30,45 and 60 min.

A buffet meal will be provided at the end of infusion. The participant has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions mayonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and a 14g milky way chocolate bar. At t=90 min a final blood sample will be taken. 

Each volunteer will receive one of the two infusion solutions on two of four study days. Each infusion visit will be separated by no less than 3 days. Each infusion visit will last approximately 3-6 hours.

On the remaining two study days (study visits 3 and 4) the volunteer will complete an oral sensitivity visit to establish at threshold concentrations at which oral cavity taste receptors are sensitive to:
a) Oleic acid (fat)
b) Mono-sodium glutamate (protein)

Each oral sensitivity study day consists of an oral detection threshold task and a taste preference task, with the protein day also including a discrimination task. Each oral sensitivity visit will last approximately 2-3 hours. Subjects will be provided a meal at completion of the visit, which will not be assessed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Lipid (infusion visit of 10% intralipid and oral sensitivity visit of oleic acid) will be used as an active control as the relationship between oral sensitivity and small intestinal sensitivity to lipid has previously been established.</comparator>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a 30 minute screening visit. A screening questionnaire and three factor eating questionnaire are answered by the volunteer, and a blood sample taken for determination of ferritin levels. Eligibility is determined based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A signed informed consent form is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each infusion study visit and each oral sensitivity visit using a randomisation table created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involves contacting the holder of the randomisation table (study assistant) to inform them of the subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution for infusion on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been designed to investigate how isocaloric loads of protein (whey protein hydolysate), or fat (intralipid (10%)) differentially affect gastrointestinal motility, gastrointestinal hormone release, and appetite sensations in male individuals with a range of BMI (between 18-35 kg/m2). Further, the sensitivity of these individuals to the presence of protein or fat in the oral cavity will be measured and related to their gastrointestinal responsiveness to protein and fat, respectively. Relationships between BMI, gastrointestinal and oral sensitivities and habitual macronutrient and energy intake will also be assessed.

Thus, the specific aims of this study are to determine:

the effects of small intestinal lipid and protein, infused at a rate comparable to that of average gastric emptying, on antropyloroduodenal motility, gut hormone release, appetite and energy intake across a range of BMI

oral fatty acid, and glutamate, sensitivity across a range of BMI

And to assess the relationships between: 
oral sensitivity to oleic acid and glutamate and gastrointestinal responsiveness to fat and protein, respectively

energy intake with oral taste sensitivity and/or gastrointestinal responsiveness, to fat and protein

 BMI with oral taste thresholds, and gastrointestinal sensitivity, to fat and protein

 habitual intake, BMI and oral and/or gastrointestinal sensitivity to fat and protein.</summary>
