    <studytitle>A system of perioperative assessment and management - a new Model of Care</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For patients requiring preoperative assessment by medical and allied health staff prior to elective surgery, can a phone-based computer-assisted questionnaire, as compared to a hospital outpatient visit, in theory, provide sufficient information to obviate the need for a face to face preoperative assessment in the future?

  <interventions>
    <interventions>A phone questionnaire is conducted to assess current medical conditions.  

A phone call is made to a patient scheduled for upcoming elective surgery.  A phone operator takes the patient through a series of questions and (largely tick box) answer options.  The questions are generated by a computer-based smart questionnaire.  It takes around 15-20 minutes.  

The responses are then reviewed by an anaesthetist, and a follow up phone call is then made, if there are residual queries.  

In this trial, patients undergo both telephone and face to face assessment.  Face to face outpatient assessment occurs within one month of conduct of the quesionnaire.

If successful, face to face outpatient assessment may be unnecessary for some patients, but this is beyond the scope of this trial.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Conventional face to face outpatient preoperative assessment is conducted according to current practice by anaesthetists and nursing staff rostered to the clinics.  These outpatient sessions currently take between 3 and 4 hours, excluding travel time.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome is assessed by reviewing eletronic and outpatient summaries together.

1. Clinicians treating the patient on the day of surgery providing comment on any missing or incomplete data in the electornic summary compared to the face to face assessment.

2. A panel of anaesthetists will also provide a similar assessment, using a 3 point 'importance' scale for missing/incorrect data - see Grant et al., 2012</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 month of questionnaire </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The anaesthetist treating the patient on the day of surgery is asked if the electronic summary would have sufficed for anaesthesa to proceed that day - Yes/No</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, patients are required to attend outpatient clinics for face to face assessment of medical conditions by clinical staff prior to elective surgery.

It is hypothesised that a computer-assisted smart questionnaire, delivered by phone, will provide information of sufficient quality to allow patients to be assessed by clinicians on the day of surgery, rather than at a separate preoperative hospital visit.   

A three phase approach to piloting this new process for preoperative assessment is proposed as follows:

Phase 1: Phone screening in parallel with standard outpatients visits at LMHS and TQEH.  Call centre data marked but not used for patient treatment.

Phase 2: Prospective trial of a total of 1,000 patients at TQEH and the RAH.  All patients will attend  a streamlined outpatient clinic after phone pre-screening

Phase 3: A further 1,000 patients at TQEH and the RAH will be screened by telephone and then triaged to either a streamlined outpatient review or bypass out patinet review and assessed by the anaesthetist on day of surgery.

In all cases treating anaesthetists will be asked to mark the pre-assessements for errors or omissions.</summary>
