  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention for young prisoners who self-harm will be the modified dialectical behaviour therapy by Mission Australias Triple Care Farm. The group intervention is a 12-week, biweekly group-skills session conducted by two clinical psychologists who are DBT-trained. The modules included will be on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness.  1. Sessions will be in a group therapy format with up to 10 participants per group (Triple Care Farm, 2015). DBT is a structured, skills-based program which will teach participants skills such as mindfulness (i.e. to encourage teaching in the 'here and now' and focus on the present), distress tolerance (i.e. coping skills whenever participants are in a crisis), interpersonal effectiveness (i.e. how to behave in relationships and to maintain respect at the same time) and emotion regulation (i.e. how to identify emotions and manage emotions that are unhelpful or unjustified). Besides teaching skills, participants will also be given a treatment workbook where they can fill in their own notes during sessions.

2. Duration of sessions will be 2-hours

3. Strategies to monitor adherence: Register of attendance at the beginning of each session and a diary-card, where participants will need to tick which skill they used outside therapy times and any reasons why some skills are difficult than others and this will be reviewed at the beginning of every session

4. Biweekly means two sessions a week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as Usual: Participants in this group will receive leaflets on self-harm and alternative coping strategies and will be required to meet with the prison doctor for further monitoring. No other therapy will be provided to this group of participants throughout the 12-week period. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Using the sample size calculation method via the G*Power program, in order to produce a medium-to-large effect size with the power of approximately 80% for an independent t-test (to see the differences between two groups), one group should have 64 participants. Consequently, two groups would yield 128 participants. However, this number would just be estimates as determining a sample size for a randomised controlled trial is highly unpredictable (i.e. many variables would affect the final sample size). 

Similar randomised controlled trials such as cognitive behaviour therapy intervention for self-harm (Slee et al., 2008); DBT for women with borderline personality disorder (Verheul et al., 2003); DBT with suicidal and self-harming adolescents (TÃ¸rmoen et al., 2014); DBT for adolescents with repeated suicidal and self-harm behaviour (Mehlum et al., 2016) among other studies included between 27 to 90 participants in their RCTs. 

Therefore, 128 participants in our study would be ideal and might just be more than enough.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has had positive outcomes in correctional settings, especially with adolescents, female inmates and those with Borderline Personality Disorder. Similarly, DBT has also been implemented specifically to reduce self-harming. However, no randomised controlled trials on DBT have been conducted to reduce self-harm in the prison setting among young adults. The purpose of this study is therefore to examine the efficacy of Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) informed treatment (as compared to treatment as usual, TAU) on young adult prisoners who self-harm or have associated borderline personality disorder symptoms. Specifically, the study aims:
1) To examine efficacy of DBT among prisoners who self-harm
2) To examine if the frequency of self-harming behaviour, thoughts and symptoms would decrease after the implementation of DBT
