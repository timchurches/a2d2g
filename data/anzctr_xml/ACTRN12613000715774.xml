  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will participate in the CONNECT programme which is a focused e-health strategy to assist with the management and prevention of CVD. Programme components focus on cardiovascular risk assessment, medication adherence, lifestyle change and seamless patient-provider communication. The CONNECT programme builds on a large program of work to develop a clinical decision support system for use in CVD risk management in primary care. We have previously built an electronic patient care system termed HealthTracker. This system is integrated with the primary health care electronic health record and provides: (1) point of care decision support related to CVD prevention and management; (2) a computerised audit tool that provides rapid snapshots on health service performance combined with a recall and reminder system; and (3) access to a quality improvement web-based portal where health services can view monthly peer-ranked performance and access tools and resources to support quality care. CONNECT is essentially a consumer focussed e-health companion HealthTracker. CONNECT will be available to participants for up to 12 months and they will be free to use the programme at their discretion. Participants will be asked to keep a diary of their usage and we will monitor usage monthly via analytic software (eg, number and frequency of logins, duration of interaction and system components utilised). CONNECT was systematically developed through an iterative process and using user-centred design approach [Fogg 2003]. This process includes collaborative design workshops (including journey mapping and persona building), sketching and iterative validation by consumers. The portal will be accessible via the internet and also via a downloadable application for use on a mobile device. Within the portal, users will be able to interact with four key features: (1) their personal health record summary (e.g. diagnoses, current medications, , latest blood pressure, weight, cholesterol results); (2) interactive tools and resources (eg. the HealthTracker heart age calculator that visually plots CVD risk projections and allows people to perform what if scenarios to explore the relative risk reductions from various CVD risk factors); (3) motivational message prompts depending on their health profile (e.g. smokers wanting to quit will be able to receive a series of random messages over a 6 month period to assist with cessation); and (4) goal setting with virtual positive reinforcement.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will participate in standard care and will not have access to the CONNECT consumer portal, however, at the end of study (after an average of 12 months) all participants (control and intervention) will be offered portal access for a minimum of 12 months. Standard care will include any strategies initiated and implemented by the participants primary care physician during the course of the study. We will capture information about participation in preventive care strategies at the final assessment as part of our process analysis.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analyses will be unadjusted, following an intention to treat principle and conducted blind to treatment allocation. If necessary, multivariate analyses will be performed to adjust for any significant differences between each study arm. Mean risk factor levels will be compared between groups in terms of relative risks, 95% CIs and two-sided p values. Characteristics will be compared between groups using independent t tests for continuous or chi-squared tests for categorical variables. Mann-Whitney U tests will be used where data are not normally distributed. All statistical analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation. For the primary outcome measure, sample size considerations have been determined from TORPEDO data for 10,181 routinely attending patients at moderate to high CVD risk. Calculations assume that 25% of people are meeting guideline recommended BP and LDL targets (as defined above), a mean systolic BP 136mmHg (SD 17.2) and mean LDL cholesterol 2.5mmol (SD 0.70). A total sample size of 2000 participants, allowing for a 20% loss to follow-up would have 90% power to detect an absolute improvement of at least 7.5% in the proportion of people meeting recommended targets using two-sided tests, with p values of less than 0.05 judged as significant. For secondary outcomes this translates to a 2.8mmHg absolute difference in systolic BP and a 0.11mmol/L absolute difference in LDL cholesterol.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Less than half of all people at highest risk of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event are receiving and adhering to best practice recommendations to lower their risk. In this project we examine the role of an e-health assisted consumer strategy as a means of overcoming such health system inefficiencies. With the implementation of the Personally Controlled E-Health Record (PCEHR) for all Australians in 2012, consumer focussed e-health is set to become a key component of the health system. Despite the scale of this initiative, few people even know of its existence and there is little research on the factors that will support its uptake. Innovative strategies that are practical to implement and support negotiation of care between consumers and care providers are therefore urgently needed.</summary>
