  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm with coils and stents requires procedural anticoagulation, most commonly with unfractionated intravenous heparin (UFH). Where the risk of thromboembolic complications is high (eg post stenting) heparinisation is continued for 24-48hrs post treatment. Post-procedural anticoagulation regimes aim for therapeutic range based on repeated laboratory testing of sampled blood. In practice this can be difficult to achieve with consistency using UFH. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) offers some theoretical advantages over UFH but there is no published data on its use in neurointervention.

We propose to compare post-procedural anticoagulation using UFH with LMWH (enoxaparin) in patients treated electively for intracranial aneurysms. Patients who meet entry criteria will be randomised to one of three regimes: 
a) UFH - continuous IV infusion, titrated by APTT test results (current standard of care)
b) LMWH given as a single dose of 1.5mg/kg by subcutaneous injection at the end of the procedure 
c) LMWH given 1.0mg/kg by subcutaneous injection at the end of the procedure and at 12hours.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator group:
1) Unfractionated Heparin (UFH)

Comparisons will be made between the above and these additional groups of anticoagulants

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients admitted for elective endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysm are eligible for inclusion.
Participants should understand the project and provide voluntary consent

Eligible patients will be admitted to the study if at the end of the endovascular procedure the operator determines that a period of post procedural anticoagulation is clinically indicated. The 3 most common reasons for this are:
1) Placement of an indwelling endovascular device, such as a stent
2) Presence of procedural platelet aggregation
3) Perceived increased risk of thromboembolic events due to 
(3a) large area of coil exposure at aneurysm neck 
(3b) loop protrusion into parent artery

    <statisticalmethods>This will be done in conjunction with the QIMR Berghofer Statistics Unit.
The primary endpoint will be to compare the proportion of therapeutic anticoagulation across all three arms. We will further determine whether there are differences between arms with respect to symptomatic or asymptomatic arterial thromboembolic events in unruptured intracranial aneurysms and whether there are differences in the immediate post-operative period after intracranial endovascular aneurysm coiling and/or stenting with respect to reduction in cerebral microbleeds. We will test for balance between arms and tabulate the variables listed above using chi-squared tests for factor variables and appropriate tests of means, either parametric or nonparametric tests. The remainder of the analyses will be descriptive, which will motivate the design of a larger randomized trial

Results from 2016 suggest between 50-100 patients per year adhering to the criteria
The initial patient aim will be 75 patients, 25 per arm. This is partially a sample size of convenience, This study will have limited utility in detecting non-inferiority between the two experimental arms and unfractionated heparin with respect to the proportion of patients achieving therapeutic anticoagulation, but it is intended that the cohort will be expanded if this initial pilot study is successful. With N = 25 per arm and assuming a 25% non-inferiority bound around the difference between the proportion of patients on two equally-allocated treatment arms, achieving 90% therapeutic anticoagulation each, we will have 80% power to conclude non-inferiority at an alpha of 0.05.

The primary outcome will be achievement of therapeutic range as assessed by APTT (UFH) or anti Xa (LMWH) testing.
The secondary outcome will be development of a clinically evident thromboembolic event (CETE) or a clinically silent lesion, either ischaemic (CSIL) or hemorrhagic (CSHL), assessed by neurological examination at 24 hours and MRI at 48hrs.
