  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following an overnight fast, each subject will receive the following four treatments, separated by at least 7 days, in a double-blind, randomised fashion: 
(1) intrajejunal infusion of saline (+ i.v. saline)
(2) intrajejunal infusion of taurocholic acid (TCA) (+ i.v. saline)
(3) intrajejunal infusion of saline (+ i.v. exendin (9-39))
(4) intrajejunal infusion of TCA (+ i.v. exendin (9-39))
An intravenous infusion of exendin (9-39) (Bachem, Clinalfa products, L?ufelfingen, Switzerland) at 600 pmol/kg/min (a rate known to be well tolerated and to block &gt;95% of the actions of endogenous GLP-1 in humans), or 0.9% saline, will be commenced at T = -60 min, and maintained until T = 120 min. Intrajejunal infusion of either TCA (4g TCA dissolved in 240 mL 0.9% saline), or 0.9% saline, will be commenced at the rate of 240 mL/hour during T -30-0 min, and reduced to the rate of 60 mL/hour during T = 0-120 min. At T = 0 min, subjects will also receive a small intestinal infusion consisting of 60 g glucose with 5 g 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) dissolved in water to a total volume of 240 mL, infused over 120 minutes (2 mL/min, and 2 kcal/min). </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>
The proposed study is designed to determine, in patients with type 2 diabetes, (i) whether blood glucose, incretin hormone (ie. glucagon­like peptide­1 (GLP­1) and glucose­dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)), insulin, glucagon, and fibroblast growth factor­19 (FGF­19) concentrations in response to a small intestinal glucose infusion (2 kcal/min) are modified by intrajejunal infusion of taurocholic acid (TCA), (ii) the effect of TCA on small intestinal glucose absorption, and (iii) the relative contribution of the actions of GLP­1 to the lowering of glycaemia by TCA, using the specific antagonist, exendin (9­39). Additionally, changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) blood flow in response to intrajejunal glucose infusion will be evaluated, in the presence and absence of intrajejunal TCA and intravenous exendin (9­39).</summary>
