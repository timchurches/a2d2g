  <interventions>
    <interventions>An observational study to determine whether changes in anaesthetic agent delivery, using End-Tidal control (ETc), can be used as an indicator of cardiac output changes.  We are monitoring changes in inspired concentration to determine whether these changes may provide an accurate  indicator of cardiac output changes, before, during and immediately following periods of cardiac manipulation during OPCAB.  We are particularly interested to see if monitoring the inspired concentration can detect cardiac output (CO) changes greater than 25%; that is, is there a given percentage fall in inspired sevoflurane that corresponds to a 25% drop in CO?  This level of change is about the level of sensitivity of CO estimations using a pulmonary artery catheter and is frequently taken as the standard to which less invasive monitors should perform.
Since we are comparing time periods within single patient treatments, participants are their own control.</interventions>

      <outcome>To determine whether changes in anaesthetic agent delivery can be used as an indicator of cardiac output change during surgery.

Off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with abrupt changes in cardiac output (CO) as the heart is manipulated.  We have observed that with end-tidal control, a feature of the Aisys anaesthetic machine, the target end-tidal level is well maintained but that there are significant changes in the rate of delivery seen with changes in CO.  In particular, the inspired concentration now rises and falls in parallel with the end-tidal CO2.  We are interested in determining whether there is a given percentage fall in inspired sevoflurane concentration that corresponds to a 25% drop in CO%. We will assess this by observing the Aisys monitor display and the Vigileo CO monitor display; by extracting and examining the data for each case from these machines and by comparing both sets of data against the relevant time periods.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Movement of gases (such as carbon dioxide or inhaled anaesthetic agents) that dissolve in the blood, in and out of the lungs, can indicate blood flow through the lungs.  Because lung blood flow changes in parallel with cardiac output, we can measure the levels of these gases in the lungs to obtain information about cardiac output.  It is already well known that expired CO2 levels change as cardiac output changes.

Our newest anaesthetic machines allow the user to set an expired concentration.  The machine then adjusts delivery of the agent to maintain this expired level, with delivery increasing as uptake (&amp; hence lung blood flow) increases and vice versa. We speculate that this system offers a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between inhaled anaesthetic uptake and cardiac output.

During off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (OPCAB), manipulation of the heart to access the various graft sites causes abrupt changes in cardiac output.  These changes occur frequently during OPCAB surgery and produce visible changes in CO2 and anaesthetic agents levels.  We monitor cardiac output during OPCAB with a device that provides a continuous measure of cardiac output based on the shape of the pulse waveform. 

The combination of frequent large changes in cardiac output, a continuous measure of cardiac output and a new way to follow anaesthetic agent uptake gives us the opportunity to explore these relationships.</summary>
