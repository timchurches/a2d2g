  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a 6 Week Exercise Program which will be offered as 1 hour sessions twice a week for 6 weeks.
The Exercise sessions include:
1. 10 minutes of warm-up using the large muscle groups in arms &amp; legs on a treadmill, bike or rowing machine (mild paced and customized to individual capability)
2. 30 minutes of resistance exercise against own body weight or the weight of an object using arms and legs (customized to individual capability)
3. The last 10 minutes is for stretching exercises.

The exercise sessions will be conducted at the Specialist Sports and Spinal Physiotherapy, Nedlands, WA 6009. It will conducted under supervision of an experienced physiotherapist and will be either individual sessions or a group session of not more than 4 participants.

The study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the exercise program will be offered to approx. 8 eligible patients over a 6-week duration, where the primary endpoint will be to assess feasibility and overall safety. If 80% of the exercise program is completed in greater than or equal to 75% of recruited patients (i.e. at least 6 of 8 patients) without occurrence of a serious adverse event occurring during the exercise program (as assessed by the study physiotherapist and treating clinician), the exercise program will be deemed as being feasible and safe to move into Part 2 of the study. 
In the event that a serious adverse event occurs during the exercise program, a modified exercise program will be evaluated in a further group of 8 patients. If 80% of the exercise program is completed in greater than or equal to 75% of recruited patients (i.e. at least 6 of 8 patients) without occurrence of a serious adverse event occurring during the modified exercise program (as assessed by the study physiotherapist and treating clinician), the exercise program will be deemed as being feasible.

In Part 2, the 6 Week program will be offered to a larger group of patients to evaluate for an improvement in levels of fatigue experienced by patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer.

Overall compliance with 6-week program will be assessed by measurement of the amount of time spent in the exercise program with the study investigator.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse effects. Assessment of adverse events will be done during the entire study - Participants will complete the study questionnaires - HADS, Visual Analogue Scale (Pain), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), FACIT - F. They will also have a review with a study nurse every week. 
Participants will also be given a Participant Diary to record any adverse events/symptoms they experience during the week and also any medications taken for those symptoms/adverse events.
A previous study where Prostate cancer patients with Bone metastases participated in a supervised exercise program - reported nil adverse events during the exercise sessions. Also nil changes in use of pain medication during the study was reported.
To date, from published studies in this area, there are no other known/possible adverse events that are known of related to the exercises being used in this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be assessed every week.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will assess the feasibility of a specified exercise program in patients with advanced breast cancer and its impact on improving fatigue. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female with metastatic breast cancer aged between 18-80 years, and are being managed at Breast Cancer Research Centre- WA. Eligible women will also have experienced subjective fatigue in the past several weeks as a persistent symptom. 

Study details 
This study will be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, eligible patients will be offered a 6 week exercise program, where the primary endpoint will be to assess feasibility and overall safety. If the program is deemed as being feasible and safe, Part 2 of the study will commence. In Part 2, participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will be offered the 6 week exercise program, whilst participants in the other group will not participate in the exercise program. 
On completion of the program, participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires to assess their levels of fatigue, depression and pain. They will also be asked to conduct a brief walking test to assess any changes in aerobic fitness.
