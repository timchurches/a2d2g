  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive an initial mobilisation and education session with a physiotherapist on the first available occasion within the first two post-operative days.  Once allocated to the intervention group, patients will receive respiratory exercise sessions coached by the Physiotherapist on post-operative days one and two. Enhanced physiotherapy rehabilitation sessions will then occur each day for the first five post-operative days. Each session will be a minimum of 30 minutes and will comprise of ambulation and an additional functional exercise program. The functional exercise program will consist of progressive lower and upper limb exercises prescribed by the treating physiotherapist based on the individual patients requirements and functional ability. The treating physiotherapist will carry a stopwatch to ensure the length of each treatment session equals or exceeds 30 minutes.

The exercises are to be attempted in sequence, starting with attempting to mobilise the patient in accordance with the ambulation protocol. If the patient can ambulate they do this for as long as able. If that time is less than 30 minutes they will then attempt lower limb exercises for the remaining time. If they are unable to ambulate they attempt the lower limb exercises for as long as able, if that time is less than 30 minutes then they attempt upper limb exercises for as long as able. This process continues, attempting each exercise type in sequence until a total treatment time of 30 minutes has been reached. Sedated and ventilated patients will be passively mobilised for a minimum of 30 minutes if they are unable to perform any respiratory or bed exercises. The decision regarding the initial exercise type appropriate for each patient will be made by the treating physiotherapist and will be dependent on the patients status.

Sessions will also include a daily reminder to continue with respiratory exercises including a check to ensure they are being performed as initially instructed.

Patients will be treated by a Physiotherapist twice daily on post-operative days one and two (rehabilitation and respiratory), then once daily (rehabilitation) until at least post-operative day 5. After then, daily treatment will continue until discharge from Physiotherapy as determined with a standardised tool, or discharge from hospital, whichever occurs first. If the patient fulfils the physiotherapy discharge criteria before post-operative day 5, daily treatment will continue until then but cease thereafter.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group patients will be treated as per standard ward care of once daily physiotherapist directed/assisted mobilisation, provision of a walking aid to facilitate ambulation and one respiratory exercise and education session until the patient is discharged from Physiotherapy or hospital, whichever occurs first.

Treatment sessions will be approximately 15 minutes of ambulation, with no additional functional exercises and no additional respiratory exercise sessions on post-operative days one and two.

Time to discharge from physiotherapy or hospital depends on individual patient characteristics, type of surgery, age and other details that influence recovery, all of which will be collected by investigators.</comparator>

    <concealment>Surgical ward and ICU admissions and the theatre list from the previous day will be screened daily to identify eligible patients. Following their first physiotherapy session which will occur at the earliest possible occasion within the first 2 days following surgery, all eligible patients will be approached by the Principle or associate investigator with written information about the clinical trial and a consent form. If the patient is unable to consent the next of kin will be contacted either face to face or by phone.
Allocation: Patients will be randomly allocated by the recruiting physiotherapist by opening a pre-prepared sealed opaque envelope containing a card with the nominated group allocation. After allocation patient details will be written on envelope once opened to ensure that patients were randomised in the same order as they were recruited.</concealment>
    <sequence>An administration assistant (who will then take no further part in the study) will prepare sequentially numbered opaque envelopes.

    <statisticalmethods>PPC rates previously reported following emergency abdominal surgery are between 30-40%. This rate was in context of the patients receiving once daily chest Physiotherapy and early ambulation6,7. Based on preliminary analysis of retrospective audit data the PPC rate at the LGH for this patient population is around 20%. There are no publications to date discussing what the minimum absolute risk reduction (ARR) should be to achieve clinical significance or cost benefit ratio to expense of intervention. We have preliminarily hypothesised that an ARR of 12% would be clinically significant in this population i.e 20% down to 8%.

The sample size for the study was calculated using Inference for Proportions, comparing two independent samples method (Type 1 error (A) 0.05, power (B) 80%, one sided, PPC rate 20%, ARR 12%).

A total sample size of 262 participants (131 per group) was calculated as being required to measure a significant difference between groups. This number is further increased to compensate for a potential 10% drop out/withdrawal rate. Recruitment of a total of 288 participants is required.

The rate of PPCs between groups will be measured using Fishers exact test. ARR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary outcome of PPCs will be calculated. Nominal and interval data from the patient profiles will be analysed using the chi-square test, MannWhitney U test, Fishers exact test and independent samples t-test. The CI for the difference between two means used the method that assumes equal variances for the two populations. The Wilson score method without continuity correction will be used to calculate a CI for a proportion. Postoperative LOS data if not normally distributed will be analysed using a MannWhitney U test. The associations between the incidence of PPCs and preoperative risk factors will be analysed using Fishers exact test. The associations of risk factors with the number of PPC criteria met will be analysed using ordinal logistic regression. Analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rate of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPC) following emergency and high risk elective upper abdominal surgery (UAS) is 30-40%. PPCs are the major cause of morbidity and mortality following non-cardiac surgery. Physiotherapy directed early ambulation and deep breathing and coughing exercises are traditionally provided post-operatively as prophylaxis against a PPC following elective surgery. Respiratory exercises have been shown to be ineffective in reducing PPC's following elective surgery though, despite the higher rate of respiratory complications, it has not been tested in the emergency surgery population. There is some observational evidence that delayed ambulation following elective and emergency UAS leads to a three-fold increase in PPCs though the true effect of early ambulation is yet to be investigated in a well designed controlled trial. The proposed study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomised controlled trial in emergency UAS. It will investigate the effect of an enhanced Physiotherapy directed rehabilitation program consisting of ambulation, exercise sessions and deep breathing and coughing exercises over and above standard ward care of physiotherapy ambulation session. All patients who undergo emergency UAS will receive standard Physiotherapist directed early ambulation on the first post-operative day. Following this session patients will be invited to participate in the study and consent gained. Participants will be randomly allocated via concealed envelope into either the Intervention (Additional Physiotherapy) or Control (Standard ward card) group. The Control group will receive ongoing standard ward care and assistance to ambulate with a Physiotherapist or a trained Physiotherapy Assistant. The Intervention group will receive Physiotherapist directed protocol based ambulation, respiratory exercises and upper or lower limb exercise sessions for a minimum of 30 minutes each day for the first five post-operative days as well as another respiratory exercise session for the first two postoperative days. Each patient will be monitored daily by an independent blinded assessor for the primary outcome of a PPC using a standardised diagnostic tool. Secondary outcomes are incidence of other post-operative complications, hospital length of stay, hand grip strength, functional status, incidence of post-operative ileus, health care utilisation and medium term recovery. </summary>
