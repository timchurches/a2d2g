    <interventions>Intervention group: The intervention group will receive the a questionnaire about falls (type, location, time and injury) and their circumstances that will be sent by email each month (TASeFALL).   The responses and number of reminder emails sent will be automatically recorded in a database.  Reminder emails will be sent every 3 days.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control (Usual approach) group: The control group will be sent a paper-based falls questionnaire (modified version of the falls questionnaire in Lord et al Fall in Older People Cambridge Press 2004) each month asking the same questions as the email questionnaire. They will post this back each month with the daily falls calendar.  Participants will be telephoned if they do not return the questionnaire or daily falls calendar. This will occur 2 weeks after the questionnaire has been sent.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The main outcomes of this study relate to feasibility of TASeFALL.  This will be achieved by reporting the response proportion and numbers and reasons that participants were ineligible .  For each group descriptive data will be used to describe participant characteristics, number of reminders required to obtain falls data, costs and participant acceptability of each method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over 40% of older people living in the community fall each year. In clinical practice, recent guidelines recommend that older people be regularly asked about falls and their circumstances.  Ascertaining falls is also important to measure the success of any intervention.  
In research settings previous studies have found that asking about falls 3- or 12-monthly results in under reporting of falls compared with a daily calendar returned monthly with telephone or paper-based questionnaire follow-up to determine the circumstances of falls. This method of a daily falls calendar and monthly follow-up by questionnaire or telephone call has been well validated and is now considered to be the gold standard in falls ascertainment.  
However, this method is labour and cost intensive as every month there are postage costs, need to manually check that the calendar has been returned (previous studies have reported 30% need follow-up), telephoning to determine circumstances of falls and data or medical file entry by a research assistant or clinician. Therefore there is an important need to improve the way falls ascertainment is conducted. We aim to undertake the world first testing of a novel emailed electronic falls ascertainment tool (TASeFALL) that reminds participants to complete the electronic questionnaire, with responses automatically fed into a database or clinicians email.
