  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two arms in intervention group:
Arm 1: Group exercise
Arm 2: Individual exercise
Both arms will be subjected to identical exercise interventions which
is Moderate to vigorous physical Activity (MVPA); 60 minutes of MVPA, 3 days per week until completion of radiation treatment but no more than eight (8) months. 


They will start the exercise program within a month of hormone injection.
Aerobic training target will be 60-85% maximum heart rate and will be calculated for each participant from estimated maximum heart rate minus age. Resistance training intensity will be manipulated from 6-12 RM, using 1-4 sets per exercise to support strength gains.

Exercise sessions involve aerobic/light impact activity and resistance/light impact activity. The program will alternate each week.

Week 1: 	
*2 sessions of aerobic/light impact activity
*1 session of resistance/light impact activity

Week 2:	
*1 session of aerobic/light impact activity
*2 sessions of resistance/light impact activity

The exercise sessions will be performed and supervised by an accredited Exercise physiologist for both arms. 

In arm 1 (group) will have 2-10 participants.

The exercise physiologist will monitor adherence by registering attendance for each session.

    <statisticalmethods>Basic descriptive statistics will be performed using Statistics Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Version 22) to provide an overview of all results.  Physiological parameters pre and post assessment are predominantly continuous numerical data and be analysed using repeated measures ANOVA. The primary outcome measure will be analysed using the program provided with the SF-36, version 2 by the distributor.

A qualitative content analysis of the interview transcripts will be performed. After collecting the data from interviews which will be recorded, transcribed and then analysed using Thematic analysis.  The coding and theme development will be directed by the content of the data.

Sample size calculation using the mental component summary (MCS) score of the SF-36

Using the results of Moinpour et al (2012) for the standard deviation of 12.91 and anticipating a relevant difference of 10% between the groups:

Analysis: comparison of difference between the mean MCS of the groups using an independent t-test at 5% significance

N = 2 x K (sd/difference in means)2
N = 39 per arm

Sample size method of Trent RDSU Ref (Wharrad, H et al 2007)

 To account for attrition of patients during the study additional patients will be recruited until the final sample size for analysis in each arm is 39 patients. Based on previous exercise studies we anticipate an attrition rate of up to 20% (Cormie, P et al (2014) and Cormie, P et al (2015).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this exercise study (in collaboration with JCU) is to investigate if regular physical activity in a group or individually improves the psychological effects whilst on hormone and radiation treatment. We aim to recruit 117 patients. The exercise program will be conducted by the exercise physiologists at the JCU clinic.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you have been recently diagnosed with localised  prostate cancer,  for which you have been scheduled to begin a combination of radiotherapy and Eligard hormone treatment. You must not have commenced Eligard hormone treatment more than one month previously.

Study details:
Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of three groups. 
*The first group involves completing a group exercise program. 
*Participants allocated to the second group will complete an individual exercise program. 
*Participants allocated to the third group will not complete any exercise program, but will simply continue with their cancer treatment as normal.

Participants allocated to either of the first two groups, i.e. the exercise program groups, will complete a 60 minute training session either as part of a group or on their own, three times per week for the duration of their hormone and radiotherapy treatment, or for a maximum of eight months. 

Exercise sessions involve aerobic/light impact activity and resistance/light impact activity. The program will alternate each week.

Week 1: 	
*2 sessions of aerobic/light impact activity
*1 session of resistance/light impact activity

Week 2:	
*1 session of aerobic/light impact activity
*2 sessions of resistance/light impact activity

Researchers will assess the efficacy of the exercise programs using questionnaires, s fitness test before starting the program and after finishing the program, and through a brief  15 minute interview with participants at the end of their radiation treatment.  It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide further information on the benefits of exercise during treatment for prostate cancer, and on which format of exercise is preferable and most beneficial for patients.
