  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be randomly allocated to receive a single dose of each of the following three treatments, as oral tablets, in a balanced, three-ways cross-over sequence:
Treatment A: 975 mg acetaminophen + 292,5 mg ibuprofen
Treatment B: 650 mg acetaminophen + 75 mg tramadol hydrochloride
Treatment C: 800 mg ibuprofen
All treatments will be administered as oral tablets with a full glass of water. The administration of the doses will be supervised on site, Participants will be required to fast overnight at least 10 hours before dosing and four hours thereafter, The washout period between periods is 3 days, The dose frequency is single dose. All participants complete all three periods treatment A-C in a cross-over fashion.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine and compare dose-normalized acetaminophen and ibuprofen related pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC(0-t), AUC(0-inf), Tmax and t1/2 of acetaminophen and ibuprofen</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single dose study measuring plasma concentrations measured pre-dose and at 10, 20, 30, 45 minutes and 1, 1.25, 1.50, 2,2.5, 3,4,6,8,10 and 12 hours after the study drug administration.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be evaluated during each study period and for 7 days following study drug administration.
An acute safety evaluation will be performed during each study period by recording spontaneously reported adverse events and by clinical assessments. At the end of each study period an additional blood sample will be taken for hematology and biochemistry assessment. Known NSAID adverse effects (i.e. gastrointestinal(GI) ulceration, indigestion, stomach pain, GI bleeding, bronchospasm, water retention, renal failure, skin reactions and thromboembolic events). Known acetaminophen adverse events(i.e. clinical evidence of hepatotoxicity) will be summarized by treatment groups. Adverse events will continue to be assessed up to 7 days after the last dose of the study medication by spontaneous reporting  and a final follow-up call</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety will be evaluated during each study period (from administration to 12 hours post administration) at Days 1, 4, 7 and 14  days following study administration</timepoint>
