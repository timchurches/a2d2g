    <statisticalmethods>To investigate whether mindfulness practice improves the MCI participants outcome measures at the 3 time points (pre-intervention, T1; post-intervention, T2; one-year follow-up, T3), one-way repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to measure the effects of mindfulness practices on each of the dependent variables. Post-hoc tests using Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment were used to establish which pair of time points was significantly different for each dependent variable for which the ANOVA yielded a significant effect.
 
To examine whether the degree to which any improvement in the outcome measures varies with the duration/level of formal and informal mindfulness practices, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient analyses were used to investigate any relationship between the score improvement in each of these outcome measures with the average weekly length of mindfulness meditation (in minutes), and with the average weekly informal mindfulness practice rating at T1, T2 and T3. 

Additionally, Mann-Whitney U tests were used to examine differences between MCI participants who practised below and above the average weekly length of mindfulness meditation (formal practice), as well as between those who rated below and above the average weekly informal mindfulness level.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate whether mindfulness practice can improve the cognitive function, psychological health, mindfulness level and functional abilities in activities of daily living of persons with MCI over time. 

Furthermore, it will address the issues about the way in which the MCI participants and familiar support persons engage with the mindfulness training program, the nature of group interactions during the program, their program experience and expectations about mindfulness practice, the perceived effects of mindfulness on them, and the MCI participants challenges in practising mindfulness.</summary>
