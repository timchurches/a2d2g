    <interventions>The Phase I study aims to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous (i.v) romidespin when delivered in combination with 50mg oral lenalidomide daily on days 8-28. Romidepsin will be delivered on days 1,8 and 15 at either 8, 10, 12 or 14mg/m^2, or on days 1 and 15 at 8mg/m^2. The actual dose administered depends on which dose cohort is currently open- for more information see 'other design features'. Cycles are 6 weeks and are continuous unless toxicity warrants withholding dose. Provided drug is tolerated and a response is seen at 2 cycles, treatment should continue for at least 6-12 cycles, and beyond 12 cycles at the discretion of the study Principal Investigator (PI). A Phase II study follows on from the Phase I but patients enrolled in the Phase I will not participate in the Phase II study. Details for the Phase II study can be found here: https://www.anzctr.org.au/registry/trial_review.aspx?ID=362223</interventions>

    <designfeatures>If 1/3 patients in a particular dose cohort have a dose limiting toxicity (DLT), the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If &gt; 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT, the previous dose will be the MTD. If less than or equal to 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT in a particular dose cohort, the next highest dose cohort will be opened to accrual.
If the initial dose cohort results in &gt; 1/3 or 1/6 patients having a DLT, deescalation of dose cohorts will occur. If, in the descalated dose cohort, less than or equal to 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT, this will be the MTD. If &gt; 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT in the descalated dose cohort, the enxt lowest dose cohort will open to accrual.
The MTD will not be determined from this study if &gt; 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT in the lowest dose cohort, or less than or equal to 1/3 or 1/6 patients have a DLT in the highest dose cohort. In either of these two instances, the linked Phase II study will proceed as a comparison between azacitidine and lenaliomide and lenalidomide only.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The outcome in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) who fail to respond to treatment or relapse after treatment is extremely poor. There is no standard treatment for these patients. This study aims to investigate the appropriate dose of the drug romidepsin (a type of chemotherapy) delivered with high dose lenalidomide (a type of chemotherapy) in the treatment of advanced AML. The study plans to treat up to 18 patients in a number of sites throughout Australia. The primary aim of this initial study is to find a safe dose of romidepsin when delivered with high dose lenalidomide. This initial stage of the study will flow into a larger study comparing 3 different treatments in advanced AML, however if you participate in this Phase I study, you will not then be eligible for the following Phase II study. 
Trial details: In this study you will receive the drug romidespin delivered intravenously (i.v) on days 1,8 and 15 of a 6-week treatment cycle at a dose of either 8, 10, 12 or 14mg/m^2, or on days 1 and 15 at 8mg/m^2. The actual dose will depend on what stage of the trial is currently open. At the same time as the romidespin treatment, you will also receive 50mg oral lenalidomide on a daily basis on days 8-28. The strength of the drug and your tolerance of it will be assessed after 2 cycles, and overall, your treatment should continue for at least 6-12 cycles. Beyond this time, the decision as to whether or not your treatment continues will be at the discretion of the study's Principal Investigator (PI). 
Who is it for? This study is open to male or female patients aged 18-80 with either a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) and failing previous therapy, either primary refractory or relapsed after no more than 3 previous lines of chemotherapy OR a diagnosis of Myelodysplasia transformed to AML after previous treatment. The full details of this studys inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the relevant sections within this record.</summary>
