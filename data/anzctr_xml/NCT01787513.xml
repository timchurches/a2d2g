Experimental: CBM Version A + iCBT - CBM Version A is an Internet-based intervention taking place over 1 week followed by iCBT, an Internet-based treatment for depression taking place over 10 weeks.

Placebo Comparator: CBM Version B (Control) + iCBT - CBM Version B (Control) is an Internet-based intervention taking place over 1 week (identical to CBM Version A without the putative active components) followed by iCBT, an Internet-based treatment for depression taking place over 10 weeks.


Other interventions: CBM
CBM is an Internet-based intervention comprised of delivery of auditory scenarios taking place over 1 week.

Other interventions: iCBT
iCBT is a validated online CBT treatment program for depression delivered in 6 lessons over 10 weeks.
