  <interventions>
    <interventions>Assessing response to the specialised temperature bars in patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers. Participants will be subjected to two different types of thermal stimuli, the specialised temperature bars and cold and heat pain thresholds on both the left and right side calf, palm and face. Participants fill in visual analogue scales rating any pain, heat, unpleasntness etc experienced from the specialised. Participants will be investigated over the course of 2 hours and 45 minutes</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate whether the response to the specialised temperature bars differs between patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1x time after each specialised temperature bars test (18 thermal grill tests in one day)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	To investigate whether heat and cold pain thresholds differ between patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers. Heat and cold pain threshold will be determined using a TSA-II neurosensory analyser, Medoc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3x per body site. 6x body sites tested. This will be tested at one time point only, prior to testing response to the specialised temperature bars.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate whether the response to the specialised temperature bars differs between patients with unilateral sciatica affected body region and unaffected body regions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1x time after each specialised temperature bars test (18 thermal grill tests in one day)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3.	To investigate whether heat and cold pain thresholds differ between patients with unilateral sciatica affected body region and unaffected body regions. Heat and cold pain threshold will be determined using a TSA-II neurosensory analyser, Medoc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3x per body site, 6x body sites tested. This will be tested at one time point only, prior to testing response to the specialised temperature bars.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate whether the response to the specialised temperature bars differs between patients with unilateral sciatica on opioids and not on opioids</outcome>
      <timepoint>1x time each after each specialised temperature bars test (18 thermal grill tests in one day)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5.	To investigate whether heat and cold pain thresholds differ between patients with unilateral sciatica on opioids and not on opioids. Heat and cold pain threshold will be determined using a TSA-II neurosensory analyser, Medoc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3x per body site, 6x body sites tested. This will be tested at one time point only, prior to testing response to the specialised temperature bars.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6.	To investigate the response of pro-inflammatory cytokine release after ex vivo TLR agonists and (+)-naloxone stimulation in white cell harvest obtained from patients with unilateral sciatica on opioids and those not on opioids and pain-free volunteers</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be investigated once blood has been collected from the participant. Blood is collected at the beginning of the study visit.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>7.	To investigate the influence of genetic polymorphisms on variation in pain perception and tolerance. Associations between genetic polymorphisms (using genotyping) and pain perception will be investigated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>DNA will be extracted in batches up to a year after collection. Genotyping will be performed in batches up to 25 years after collection as new genetic polymorphisms arise.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate whether depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II) in both patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers correlate with thermal pain thresholds or responses to the specialised temperature bars and to investigate whether depressive symptoms differ between patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers</outcome>
      <timepoint>1x before any testing begins</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate whether early morning salivary cortisol levels in both patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers correlate with depressive symptoms (as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory-II), thermal pain thresholds or responses to the specialised temperature bars and to investigate whether early morning salivary cortisol levels differs between patients with unilateral sciatica and pain-free volunteers. participants will be required to salivate into a test tube. The sample will be processed at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Sciences. Cortisol levels and measures of depression will be tested in the statistical modelling. Statistical software used will likely be SAS or R.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2x early morning salivary cortisol. 1x on awakening and 1x 30 mins post awakening</timepoint>
