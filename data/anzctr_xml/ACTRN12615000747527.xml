  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective observational study of a novel whole-blood immune function biomarker, the QuantiFERON-Monitor (QFM) and the QuantiFERON-CMV (QFN-CMV) test in the post lung transplantation population.  
The QFM test measures interferon-gamma production in plasma after stimulation to provide an overall marker of the recipients immune state.  
The QFN-CMV test measure interferon-gamma production directly related to CMV immunity to provide a marker of the recipients immune response to CMV.
QFM &amp; QFN-CMV will be measured pre-transplant, and then at five timepoints post transplant (2 &amp; 6 weeks and 3, 6 &amp; 12mths).  
Immune monitoring results will be correlated to clinical outcome at these timepoints, including bronchoscopic findings, lung function, infection, rejection and current immunosupressive medication regime.
Participants will be followed till 12months post lung transplant.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluation of immune monitoring with the QFN-Monitor assay in patients undergoing lung transplantation.
The QFN-Monitor test results will be observationally compared to patients clinical immune state, including routine IgG levels.
This outcome is to evaluate if a relationship is present between the clinical immune status of a lung transplant receipient and the QFN-Monitor results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of immune state, including the QFM and QFN-CMV tests, will occur pre-transplant, and at 5 time points in the first 12 months post transplant.  These being 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 , 12 months post transplant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the relationship between QFN-Monitor results and immunosuppressive drug levels and doses.
Observational assessment of this outcome will occur.  
QFN-Monitor results will be collected, along with immunosuppressive drug levels, ie Tacrolimus Level or Everolimus Levels, (retrieved from Medical Records provided by a NATA approved Pathology Service) and drug doses (as documented in medical records) during the first 12mths post lung transplant and statistically evaluated for any relationship.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of immune state, including the QFM and QFN-CMV tests, will occur pre-transplant, and at 5 time points in the first 12 months post transplant.  These being 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 , 12 months post transplant.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the relationship between QFN-Monitor and QFN-CMV results and the incidence of allograft rejection.
Allograft rejection will be identifed through Biopsy results according to the ISHLT gradings, or as documented as clinically likely by a Lung Transplant Physician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of immune state, including the QFM and QFN-CMV tests, will occur pre-transplant, and at 5 time points in the first 12 months post transplant.  These being 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 , 12 months post transplant.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the relationship between QFN-Monitor and QFN-CMV results and the incidence of clinical infection. 
Clinical Infection will be identified through postive culture, viral results and clinically indicators, including hopsital admission.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of immune state, including the QFM and QFN-CMV tests, will occur pre-transplant, and at 5 time points in the first 12 months post transplant.  These being 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 , 12 months post transplant.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the relationship between QFN-Monitor and QFN-CMV results and the incidence of CMV reactivation. 
CMV reactivation will be identified through positive CMV viral load in blood or BAL and clinically indicators such as cmv gastritis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of immune state, including the QFM and QFN-CMV tests, will occur pre-transplant, and at 5 time points in the first 12 months post transplant.  These being 2 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 , 12 months post transplant.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After lung transplantation patients are prescribed drugs, called immunosuppression medication, to control the immune system to stop them from rejecting the new lung(s).  
Managing immunosuppression medication is lifelong post-transplant, and the Lung Transplant Physicians take many factors into consideration when dosing medications.  
The purpose of this project is to determine if the blood tests, QuantiFERON-Monitor (QFM), which measures immunity and QuantiFERON-CMV (QFN-CMV), which measures immunity to a virus, could provide extra information for the Lung Transplant Physicians to help in their decisions about immunosuppression medications.
The aim of this study is to observe if there is any relationship between both the QFM and QFN-CMV Test results and immunosuppression drug levels and doses, and any occurrence of rejection and infection after transplantation.
This study will be observational, immunosupression drug managment will be managed by the Lung Transplant Physicians as per standard practice.  The QFN-Monitor and QFN-CMV tests will be collected for comparsion at the end of the study, but will not alter patient care. </summary>
