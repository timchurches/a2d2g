  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness and safety of a single dose of PAT-SM6 in treating people with melanoma of the skin. 
Who is it for? 
You may be able to join this study if you have locally recurring cutaneous (skin) melanoma. You must not have received chemotherapy or therapeutic radiotherapy in the previous 28 days. You will be required to have a biopsy sample of the melanoma prior to receiving study medication. 
Trial details: 
Participants will all receive a single dose of human anti-GRP78 IgM monoclonal antibody PAT-SM6 via intravenous infusion over 60 minutes, at varying doses. They will return to the site on day 4 for another biopsy of the melanoma/surgery. Patients will remain on study for 5 weeks. The study aims to monitor the safety and effectiveness of treatment. 
What is PAT-SM6? 
PAT-SM6 is different to other antibodies on the market for cancer because it a naturally-occurring human molecule. It fights tumours by fixing on to specific targets on cancerous cells and killing them.</summary>
