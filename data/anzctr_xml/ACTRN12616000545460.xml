  <interventions>
    <interventions>Commercial lid scrub (Sterilid by Theratears - Company Serial 78459728)
As per manufacturers instructions, one pump as foam applied by participant to closed eyelids with fingertips, twice daily (in the morning and at night) for 4 weeks, at participant's home.

The product will be stripped of packaging and brand and labelled with "R" for right eye or "L" for left eye.

Returned product at the end of the trial will be weighed as a measure of compliance</interventions>
    <comparator>Diluted 1:10 Baby Shampoo (Johnson's Baby - Company serial 74458492)
One pump as foam applied by participant to closed eyelids with fingertips, twice daily (in the morning and at night) for 4 weeks, at participant's home.

The product will be stripped of packaging and brand and labelled with "R" for right eye or "L" for left eye. Participants and those collecting clinical data will be masked as to the randomisation of the product to right and left eyes.

The effect of the products will further be compared between participants with signs of blepharitis and individuals with normal eyes, to determine whether a difference in baseline inflammation makes a difference to the outcomes.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants are given unique ID numbers and given identical foam applicators with no branding or labelling, marked as L for left eye, and R for right eye. 
Each participant is randomly allocated baby shampoo or commercial lid cleanser for their left eye, and the other is given to the right eye. This allocation is concealed to both the investigator collecting clinical data and the participant, by having numbered containers (1 or 2). All containers of the same number have the same contents and are numbered by an independent third party. They are then marked as L or R in alternating order so there are L and R markings on both 1 and 2 containers.

</concealment>
    <sequence>Random.org is used which generates truly random numbers using atmospheric noise. Either 1 or 2 is generated for the left eye. The appropriately marked container is selected and the other eye is given the other number.

Eg. If "1" is generated by random.org for the participant's left eye, the container labelled "L" from the "1" group is given. It is unknown if the 1 group is baby shampoo or commercial cleanser. The right eye is then given the container labelled "R" from the "2" group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Blepharitis (eyelid inflammation) is a common chronic eyelid condition associated with inflamed eyelid margins and it leads to symptoms of persistent eye irritation and visual disturbance in affected individuals.  Eyelid cleansing to free the eyelashes and eyelid margins from crusts, debris and significant bacterial load, is considered fundamental in the management of blepharitis to minimise eyelid inflammation. Modern, sterile, commercial products, designed specifically for use in this condition are available, but the traditional therapy of baby shampoo continues to be recommended in some centres, despite suggestions in the literature of its potentially pro-inflammatory nature around the delicate structures of the eye, the ocular surface and the preocular tear film.  Using a sensitive technique by which ocular surface inflammation can be quantified from impression cytology samples collected in the clinic specific inflammatory marker levels will be quantified, to determine whether the clinician recommended therapies affect the level of ocular surface inflammation.</summary>
