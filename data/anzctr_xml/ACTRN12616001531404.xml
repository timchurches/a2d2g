  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this randomised crossover design, adult women will complete three experimental days at the CSIRO Cognitive Laboratory in Adelaide, South Australia. Two days will utilise a Caloric Restriction Condition protocol. In both of these conditions, participants will consume a total of ~500 kcal throughout the testing. Two different patterns of delivery will permit the investigation of overall caloric restriction as well as meal timing on the relevant outcomes.  In addition to their energy kcal allowance, participants are provided with ~100 kcal of caloric-neutral vegetable snacks (cucumber, celery &amp; capsicum) for ad-lib consumption and to assist with any intestinal discomfort. The washout between each testing day is 1 week (7-days).

Bulking - Participants will consume a total allowance of ~500 kcal in the form of two liquid meal replacement shakes delivered at 9am and 11am respectively. Participants may only consume water throughout the day.

Extended Distribution - Participants will consume a total allowance of ~500 kcal in the form of one Liquid Meal Replacement at 9am, and two snack bars consumed at 12pm and 3pm respectively. Participants may only consume water throughout the day.</interventions>
    <comparator>Fasting - Participants will not be permitted to consume any kcal other than the ~100 kcal of caloric-neutral vegetable snacks (cucumber, celery &amp; capsicum) for ad-lib consumption to assist with any intestinal discomfort.  Participants may only consume water throughout the day.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fasting may have benefits for weight loss, the acute effects of this on cognitive function and mental fatigue throughout fasting days are not well understood. Some studies have shown negative impacts of fasting including slower psychomotor speed, slower reaction times, reduced memory capacity, reduced working memory function, and poorer inhibition and reasoning skills. These deficits have the potential to impact negatively on activities including driving, and functioning within the workforce more generally.  Ultimately these negative effects may impact on retention in these weight loss programs due to potentially unwanted side-effects, thus moderating their impact on health outcomes resulting from sustained weight loss.

A current trend in weight loss programs is to avoid true fasting days and instead, incorporate extreme Caloric Restriction days. One current approach, known as the 5:2 intermittent fasting method, recommends a total caloric intake allowance of ~2100kj/day (500 kcal) for women, and ~2500kj/day (600kcal) for men on two days out of every seven (i.e., two days per week).  Despite suggestions in the literature that intermittent fasting (including caloric restriction) improves metabolic markers in young women and in those with diabetes, to date, little is known about the impact of caloric restriction on cognitive function, fatigue and satiety. In particular, there has been limited exploration about how best to distribute the permissible restricted calories across the day. The timing of energy consumption is likely an important factor that could alter any potentially negative effects of caloric restriction on cognitive function and fatigue, particularly in the context of carbohydrates.  

This study will explore the impact of different nutrient intake timing during caloric restriction days on cognitive performance, fatigue, satiety and blood glucose.  

In light of literature showing negative effects of fasting on cognitive function, our hypotheses are as follows:
1) Fasting will result in poorer cognitive function and enhanced fatigue compared to both of the caloric restriction arms (Bulking and Extended Distribution)
2) Extended Distribution of calories will result in less fatigue throughout the afternoon assessments compared to Bulking
3) Fasting will lead to significantly higher subjective ratings of fatigue and satiety compared to both caloric restriction conditions
4) Fasting will result in significantly lower blood glucose readings compared to both caloric restriction conditions</summary>
