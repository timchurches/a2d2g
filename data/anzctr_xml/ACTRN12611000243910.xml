  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be randomised to either a nasal or an oronasal mask with the alternate mask style to be used on the second night. A chin strap will be used in conjunction with nasal mask. 

Mask interfaces for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep cover the patient's nose (nasal mask) or nose and mouth (oronasal mask).  The chin strap gently supports the jaw so the mouth is closed when using a nasal mask.

Continuous positive air pressure (CPAP) was automatically titrated by an autotitrating CPAP machine on both nights for the total sleep time of the patient</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects will be randomised to either a nasal or oro-nasal mask with the alternate mask used on the second night.  A chin strap will also be used on the nasal night to reduce the occurence of mouth leak.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When patients are established on CPAP treatment they must first undergo a titration study of some description which determines the pressure required to hold the upper airway open.  Titration studies are commonly performed using a nasal mask but some patients may prefer a full-face or oronasal mask. This study looks at therpeutic pressures for full-face and nasal masks and patient preferences.</summary>
