  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will undergo a multidimensional assessment and individualised management (MDAIM) which aims to provide evidence based care through a case management approach, to people with severe persistent asthma. Assessment and treatment will be targeted to co-morbidities, inflammatory and other immunological biomarkers through a multidisciplinary case management approach and using inflammometry. The multidimensional assessment will involve 2 baseline assessments each of approximately 2.5 hours duration. The tailored interventions will be standardised according to best available evidence and will include: optimal medical management including tailoring pharmacotherapy according to airway and systemic inflammation and guiding the exacerbation plan, individualised smoking cessation counselling and pharmacotherapy, management of anxiety and depression, management of mucous hypersecretion, exacerbation management, management of dysfunctional breathing, correction of nutritional and metabolic disorders, implementation of domiciliary oxygen, self management education and support, management of airflow obstruction and co-morbidities, correction of adherence, exercise training,  treatment of infection, management of dyspnea, symptoms and patient identified problems.  
The intervention will be standardised and include 3 key features, a comprehensive assessment to determine the clinical problems and a tailored care plan and follow up.  Whilst each participants care plan will differ the recommended interventions will be standardised. The frequency of clinical contact a participant will have may differ depending on the intervention received, however may range between once weekly to once monthly. Participants may be seen by more than one clinician in one week, however the appointments will occur in the same day, one after the other for participant convenience. The duration of the study will be 16 weeks and therefore intervention duration will be 16 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Following the baseline visit the asthma usual care control group will be treated according to best available evidence in the John Hunter Hospital severe asthma clinic. Usual care will be delivered in the severe asthma clinic which will include medical assessment by a respiratory physician.  The participants usual specialist physician will provide a medical assessment, a review of co-morbidities, an assessment of lung function and oxygen saturation by spirometry and pulse oximetry, and a diagnosis. The treating physician will schedule follow up appointments as they deem appropriate. Patient will also be reviewed by a nurse specialist to assess and address asthma management knowledge and skills.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a multidimensional assessment and individualised management approach in older people with obstructive airways disease, showing that such a programme leads to significant improvement in health outcomes. The current study aims to continue this new model of management in a different population of people with severe persistent asthma.

People with severe persistent asthma continue to suffer a significantly high burden of disease despite maximal pharmacotherapy. Despite this, few trials seeking to improve management of severe asthma, have been performed. The current study aims to improve the management and outcomes for people severe persistent asthma, with the goal of reducing morbidity, improving health status and informing clinical guidelines. 


This study will aim to test a novel model of management in severe asthma using multidimensional assessment and individualised management (MDAIM) including inflammometry and case management. We hypothesize that treatment of severe asthma that is targeted to co-morbidities, inflammatory and other immunological biomarkers delivered using a case management approach will improve severe asthma outcomes specifically asthma control, exacerbations,  medication use and health related quality of life.</summary>
