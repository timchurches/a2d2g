  <interventions>
    <interventions>Techniques for freezing embryos produced in the laboratory using assisted reproductive technology are constantly being modified and improved. Vitrification, a rapid cooling method, has overtaken the slow freezing technique for preserving embryos for use in frozen cycles, and one of the latest major advances has been artificial shrinkage of the blastocoele cavity.
Following an IVF/ICSI cycle with remaining embryos deemed worthy of vitrification and storage, each couple will be randomly allocated to Assisted Collapse Vitrification or Standard Vitrification  group. Assisted Collapse Vitrification embryos will undergo zona drilling with a Zilos TK Laser to assist the embryo's collapse prior to standard vitrification in Vitrolife, RapidVit medium.
Upon patients request for frozen embryo transfer (FET), (embryo transfer refers to a step in the process of assisted reproduction in which embryos are placed into the uterus of a female with the intent to establish a pregnancy) single embryos will be thawed and cryopresevation outcomes assessed. Following embryo transfer, clinical outcomes will be assessed.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In many cases, an IVF cycle can result in many embryos of good quality. In Australia, Single Embryo Transfer (SET) is preferred and therefore remaining embryos are either discarded or undergo vitrification, which is a process of rapidly cooling embryos, and stored at -196Â°C. The embryo vitrification protocol causes rapid changes in temperature which can cause instability in some embryos and result in a failure to survive the thaw process, with approximately 1 in 10 embryos failing doing so. It is proposed that in order for an embryo to survive vitrification, it needs to collapse from its expanded state, to a compact group of cells. In its collapsed state the embryo is thought to be protected.

Around the world, fertility clinics are changing vitrification protocols to include assisted or artificial collapse of the embryo prior to vitrification. This has resulted in many clinics demonstrating significant improvements in both the number of embryos surviving vitrification and pregnancy outcomes. We plan to compare our normal vitrification protocol with this new method of artificial collapse prior to of normal vitrification protocol, to see if we can improve both embryo survival and pregnancy outcomes.
