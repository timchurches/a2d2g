    <interventions>Effect of mechanical stimulation on laryngeal sensitivity.Effect of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) on Laryngeal sensitivity

Patients and Controls will undergo nasoendoscopy and have mechanosensitivity assessed by determing the threshold of air pressure required (in mmHg) to elicit the laryngeal adductor reflex. Air pressure will be delivered via a specific channel in the nasoendoscope, and is generated by the Pentax AP4000 air pressure generator.

Laryngeal sensitivity will be determined by visualisng a swallow or vocal cord response to the instillation of normal saline and 0.1N HCl (hydrochloric acid).

This procedure will be performed on 2 occasions (1 week apart) in patients and control subjects, with subjects being their own controls. Saline and HCl will be administered on separate occasions.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are 2 sets of controls used in this study.

The first are subjects without gastro-oesophgeal reflux disease(GORD). These subjects will undergo 2 nasoendoscopy procedures, identical to patients with GORD 

In addition historical controls (1999-2005) with retrospective patients data will be used for some parameters including the normal range of thresholds for the laryngeal adductor response.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have observed that patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) have an increased incidence of upper and lower respiratory infections. In addition GORD is strongly associated with bronchial asthma. This study seeks to identify whether patients with GORD have impaired mechano or chemo laryngeal sensitivity which may reduced airway protective mechanisms and lead to an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric acid.

This study therefore aims to determine the mechano and chemo senitivity of laryngeal protective mechanisms in patients with GORD and healthy controls</summary>
