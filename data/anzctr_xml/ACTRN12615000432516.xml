  <interventions>
    <interventions>Permethrin insecticide-treated (ITC) and non-treated clothing (NTC) will be trialled and assessed for their acceptability among a randomly selected sample of rubber tappers in Mon State, Myanmar. 

The ITC and NTC both consist of a long-sleeved cotton shirt and long cotton pants purchased from a local market vendor in Myanmar. The ITC has been treated with a long-lasting permethrin formulation using a factory proprietary method in China. The NTC is untreated but otherwise identical to the ITC. The clothing is intended to be worn by the rubber tappers during their nighttime work, for approximately 10-12 hours per day. The clothing is washable and all enrolled participants will receive care instructions and a calendar on which to record the days they wash the clothing. 

Randomly selected rubber tappers will be cluster randomized to one of the two assessment groups  Arms 1 and 2. Each arm will be assigned ITC and NTC in a crossover design to trial. 

Each rubber tapper will trial the two different clothing types assigned to their group for approximately 14 days each. Then, the second clothing type trialled will be continued for a further 6 weeks, that is- participants in Arms 1 and 2 will continue with NTC and ITC, respectively, for six weeks after four weeks of wearing both types of clothing. 

As this is an acceptability and preference study, no wash-out period was deemed necessary.

    <sequence>The study population consists of heads of households and/or full-time rubber tappers. Two stage sampling was used to select the study population. In the first stage, plantations in 2 catchment areas in Mon state, Myanmar, were purposively selected from a list of plantations (with a population &lt;60 people). In the second stage, the selected plantations were cluster randomized to one of the two clothing assessment groups. Finally, natural clusters of households within each selected plantation (at least 8 households per cluster) were identified, with one or more clusters randomly selected within each plantation invited to participate in the study, for a total of 16 clusters (8 per arm). Rubber tappers were randomly selected from a population list using an Excel generated random numbering system.</sequence>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>The number of participants per cluster was determined using probability proportionate to size (PPS) sampling but also maintained a minimum of 6 clusters per arm containing at least 12 participants (in order to have &gt;80% power to reject a null hypothesis assuming intra class correlation coefficient due to clustering of individuals is 0.002 and an alpha of 0.05). 

A statistical model will be used to analyze the acceptability and preference of the clothing trialed with appropriate adjustment for a cross-over design using STATA. Quantitative analysis will include current and past ITC use and acceptability.

Qualitative analysis of FGD transcripts will be performed manually using content analysis to identify overarching themes and issues relating to preferences and acceptability of the distributed clothing. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability and preference of permethrin-treated and non-treated clothing in rubber plantations in Myanmar.  The information obtained from this assessment will assist policy makers to determine which type of clothing is most appropriate for prevention of outdoor transmission of malaria.  Information on clothing durability, washing, colour, texture, size, fabric and size preference, willingness to pay will be collected. Feedback provided by participants will guide future promotional and educational messages that accompany clothing distribution. </summary>
