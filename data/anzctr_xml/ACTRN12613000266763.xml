  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>General Practitioners (GP) have a key role to play in the care of dying patients. General practice is defined by the continuity of care and trusting long-term doctor-patient relationships. This means that general practitioners are well placed to provide quality end of life care to patients. 

This research explores the feasibility and acceptability of a general practice based case-finding approach to care planning of patients nearing the end of life. General practices will be recruited to test the accuracy of GPs clinical acumen in predicting which of their patients will die in the next 6 months. A number of practices will make use of a clinical prediction tool in addition to the GPs clinical acumen to see whether this improves the accuracy of prognostication.

The findings of the project will help to determine the best way of identifying patients who are in need of end of life care planning.

Our aim is to use the data gathered from this study as a springboard into developing a solid evidence-based intervention that could be used in general practice to identify and plan the care of patients who are nearing the end of life. </summary>
