  <interventions>
    <interventions>To determine if daily (morning) replacement of contact lenses during extended wear reduces contact lens related adverse events compared to adverse event rates in historical control trials. Worn lenses are to be removed and discarded within 1 hour of waking each day and new lenses inserted immediately afterwards, for the duration of the study (i.e. 1 month).</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical control trials. Participants wore lenses on a 30 night, 31 day continuous wear schedule.  At the end of this schedule lenses were disposed (i.e. monthly disposal) and new lenses inserted. The duration of the study was 6 months. Only the ocular adverse events that arose in the first 1 month of the study will be used for comparative purposes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if daily (morning) replacement of contact lenses during extended wear reduces contact lens related adverse events compared to adverse event rates in historical control trials.  Examples of contact lens (CL) related ocular adverse events (AE) include infections (microbial keratitis [MK]), inflammation of the cornea (contact lens induced peripheral and non-infectious corneal ulcer [CLPU]), contact lens induced acute red eye (CLARE), infiltrative keratitis (IK), inflammation of the conjunctiva (contact lens induced papillary conjunctivitis [CLPC]), corneal erosion, superior epithelial arcuate lesion (SEAL).  Adverse events will be assessed with a slit-lamp biomicroscope (including corneal and conjunctival staining with fluorescein).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The duration of the study will be 1 month.  Participants may be assessed for adverse events at both scheduled and unscheduled visits.  Scheduled visits refer to the following visits - Baseline [BL], 1 week of daily wear [DW] (i.e. 1 week after BL), 1 week of extended wear [EW] (i.e. 2 weeks after BL) and 1 month of EW (i.e. 5 weeks afte BL).  Unscheduled visits refer to all other visits during the study (e.g unexpected or follow-up visits for adverse events).  EW means lenses are worn during waking and sleeping hours.  DW means lenses are worn during waking hours only.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the trial is to reduce the incidence of microbial keratitis and other ocular adverse responses related to extended contact lens wear.  The hypothesis is that regular lens replacement during extended wear exposes the eye to a clean lens surface thereby reducing bacterial build-up on the lens surface resulting in less bacterially-driven ocular adverse events.</summary>
