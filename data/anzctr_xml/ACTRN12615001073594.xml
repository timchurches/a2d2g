  <interventions>
    <interventions>UBWELL is a smart-phone application (i.e. app) that delivers a series of health related questions (mood, anxiety, energy, sleep, alcohol use, functional engagement, social interaction, technology use) at multiple time points throughout the day (up to 4). The information collected throughout the day (and over time) are presented back to the users on dynamic graphs that provide users with the opportunity to see how these analytics relate to each other and vary over time. The overall duration of the intervention is 6 weeks, and adherence to the intervention will be assessed at the end of 6 week trial using a self report questionnaire.</interventions>
    <comparator>Two other smart-phone based apps have been employed as comparators. The first comparator is 'Recharge' which is an app-based intervention targeting the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. The second comparator is Ozhealth, which is an app that provides health information only.</comparator>

    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation). Randomisation will also be stratified by age (16 to 24 years; 25 to 30 years), gender (males, females) and location (metropolitan, regional, rural/ remote).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary outcome measures include percentage change in participant perception of overall health, overall physical health and overall mental health during the course of the study. 

Primary statistical analysis will be conducted with all participants
who complete randomisation. Mixed models repeated measures ANOVA, with measurement occasion as a within groups factor and intervention condition as a between groups factor will be used to examine primary measures of outcome. Planned contrasts will be used to compare intervention and control groups immediately post intervention and at 3-months, 6-months (and 12-month) follow-up. Logistic and linear regressions will be used to examine differences between conditions on baseline variables, and logistic regressions will be used to assess the effect of the intervention on participant dropout as well as to investigate predictors of missingness (completers/ non-completers) post intervention and at followup.

Power analysis
A power analysis indicated that a total sample of 159 people would be needed to detect medium to large effects (eta squared = 0.25), with 80% power and alpha at .05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>UBWELL is a smart-phone app-based continuous, real-time data tracker which can link to current available wearable technology (i.e. Fitbit) and other smart software systems (i.e. HealthKit, Google Fit and Project Synergy) to collect physiological and experiential measures and then monitor, analyse and report these results. Currently, UBWELL can measure physical activity, sleep, mood, anxiety, energy, substance use (alcohol, tobacco), functional engagement (relationships, work, study), healthy eating and weight. This data can be used by an individual to help maintain good health and wellbeing; as well as by health professionals to more effectively plan, implement and monitor treatment to patients, thus providing enhanced, personalised healthcare.

The use of this innovative technology has the potential to empower young people to actively engage in their general health and wellbeing (including mental health) by reliably tracking the metrics that are important to them. Unfortunately, the majority of apps for mental health that are currently available lack scientific evidence about their efficacy, and few (if any) have the capacity for the continuous comprehensive integrated assessment that UBWELL offers. This project aims to evaluate the engagement, efficacy and effectiveness of UBWELL (as compared to Recharge and OzHealth) among the Australian general population to improve general health and wellbeing outcomes.</summary>
