  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients receiving abraxane chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer or ovarian cancer will be recruited into the study to document the natural history of Abraxane-induced neurotoxicity through cross-sectional and prospective clinical and neurophysiological assessment. Examples of neurotoxicity seen with abraxane therapy include sensory dysasthesia including numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.

Patients will be assessed monthly from the commencement of treatment until cessation, with 3-monthly follow up 6-12 months following cessation of treatment, to a maximum period of 2 years following enrolment.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The major focus of the study is to assess various key aspects of Abraxane-related neurotoxicity in cancer patients, including neurophysiological assessment to ascertain the prevalence and severity of neuropathy and careful assessment of the extent of functional impairment. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18-75 years and are scheduled to undergo chemotherapy with either one of the following drugs; abraxane, oxaliplatin or paclitaxel for the treatment of your cancer.

Trial details
In this study, the decision to commence abraxane treatment will be made by the treating oncologist rather than by the investigators. Measures of neuropathy severity, nerve function, quality of life and physical function will be obtained in all subjects at monthly intervals from the commencement of treatment until cessation, with 3-monthly follow up 6-12 months following cessation of treatment.

This study will provide information regarding the prevalence and functional impact of neuropathy as well as providing insights into the potential mechanisms of neurotoxicity due to Abraxane. Comparative testing in a cohort of patients treated with oxaliplatin and paclitaxel will provide information regarding the severity of neurotoxicity in abraxane-treated patients.</summary>
