  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment of bifurcation lesions with a drug-eluting Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) balloon. The drug-eluting balloon is coated with 3 micrograms of paclitaxel per mm^2 of balloon surface. The balloon is inserted into the femoral artery and advanced into the coronary arteries. Once the target lesion is identified using X-ray and a dye (angiogram), the balloon is advanced to the narrowed portion of the vessel and inflated for about 30 seconds thus releasing the drug (paclitaxel) into the surrounding tissue. The balloon is removed immediately after deflation. Another angiogram is performed to confirm restoration of blood flow. This is a one-off procedure and takes about 45 minutes.</interventions>

    <summary>The study is intended to assess the feasibility and safety of the BIOTRONIK drug-eluting balloon Pantera Lux for the treatment of narrowing cardiac arteries where those arteries branch out into side arms. The study will assess both immediate success of this treatment as well as whether those arteries remain open after 9 months.</summary>
