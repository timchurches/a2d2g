  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Daily Pain Score at Week 2 - Change from baseline in the daily-average-pain score at week 2. This was measured using a 11-point (0 to 10) scale where 0 represented no pain and 10 represented worst pain. Due to the low number of patients completing the treatment period of the study no analyses were performed</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 2</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Subject Global Impression of Change Score at Week 2 - Change from baseline in Subject Global Impression of Change score at week 2. The Subject Global Impression of Change is a self-evaluation by the subject of their overall change in relief of neuropathic pain since the beginning of the study rated on a 7-point scale (1=very much improved to 7=very much worse). Due to low number of patients completing the treatment period of the study no analyses were performed.</outcome>
