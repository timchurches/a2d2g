  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project is designed to determine the efficacy of using a non-invasive, easy to use, cost effective system in the control of urinary incontinence in women who are ageing.  This project is a double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT) of magnetic stimulation of the pelvic area.  The system is based on the use of non-invasive magnetic stimulation and consists of an undergarment with 15 in-built magnets placed anterior, posterior and inferior to the pelvis.  The undergarment is worn over the participant's usual underwear for a period of at least 6 hours during the day and at least 6 hours during the night.

The discs in the treatment garment are magnetic.  The trial duration is 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will wear the same designed undergarment as participants in the treatment group, with the same number of in-built discs in the same anatomical positions.  However, the metal discs in the placebo garment are inert and have no magnetic properties.  The undergarment is worn over the participant's usual underwear for a period of at least 6 hours during the day and at least 6 hours during the night.  The trial duration is 12 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for this study is cessation of episodes of urinary incontinence within a twelve week time period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, four weeks and twelve weeks using a 24-hour pad test, 48-hour bladder diary and the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Scored form questionnaire.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in frequency of incontinence episodes and volume of urine lost involuntarily as measured by 24-hour pad test, 48-hour bladder diary and the Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Scored form questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, four weeks and twelve weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants were included based on the following criteria: Suffering urinary incontinence; Living independently in the community; English speaking and sufficient reading and writing ability.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>60</inclusiveminage>

    <exclusivecriteria>People who met the inclusion criteria were excluded if they: had impaired physical functioning; had cognitive/intellectual impairment; had a cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, infusion pump or any other implanted electronic equipment; were receiving non-conservative treatment; or suffered symptomatic urinary tract infections and/or a positive MSU.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Sequentially numbered sealed envelopes</concealment>
    <sequence>Random allocation followed a permuted blocks within strata design.  Stratification was by recruiting centre as there were multiple recruitment sites.  Blocks per centre were used to ensure the allocation to treatment and placebo groups were equal at each recruitment site.  The sequence per block was generated by randomly selecting different combinations of treatment allocation sequence from a container.</sequence>
