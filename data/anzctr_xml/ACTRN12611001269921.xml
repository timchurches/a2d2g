  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this sudy, it is intended to observe the incidence of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the severity of CINV, the effectiveness of additional measures for inadequate control of CINV e.g. the use of rescue therapy and the use of aprepitant in subsequent cycles, and the major side-effects likely to be related to anti-emetics. 

The duration of this observational study will be approximately 18 months from the start of accrual to the end of treatment, with no follow-up.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a standardised 5HT3 antagonist-containing regimen as anti-emetic control in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients following initiation of (R)-CHOP chemotherapy. 

Effectiveness will be measured by the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (defined as no vomiting and no use of rescue medication) throughout the acute phase (day 1; 0 - 24 hours) and the proportion of patients achieving a complete response  throughout the delayed phase (Days 2 (&gt;24 hours) to 11) of the first cycle of chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study; two years from registration</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate incidence and severity of CINV in the acute and delayed phases patients receiving  (R)-CHOP for non-Hodgkin lymphoma across all cycles chemotherapy.

The incidence and severity of nausea and the incidence of vomiting and use of rescue therapy in the acute and delayed phases will be monitored using a patient self-assessment CINV diary that requires the patient to record their experience of CINV.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On-going, for the duration of the trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the frequency of use of aprepitant as secondary prophylaxis after the first chemotherapy cycle and to evaluate its effectiveness in controlling CINV when added to a standard anti-emetic regimen following failure to control CINV.

Failure of standard anti-emetic prophylaxis in any one cycle of chemotherapy requiring aprepitant as secondary prophylaxis in subsequent cycles. Failure will be defined as the occurrence of any of the following either during or beyond cycle day 1:

One or more episodes of vomiting or dry retching  

One or more episodes of nausea requiring the use of 1 or more doses of breakthrough anti-emetics

An episode of nausea requiring the use of breakthrough anti-emetics across multiple days

An episode of nausea measuring &gt; 2.5cm on a 0 - 10cm VAS

Nausea and/or vomiting that in the clinicians opinion requires use of aprepitant in future cycles.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on-going, for the duration of the trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate and identify patient, disease and chemotherapy scheduling characteristics as prognostic factors for CINV control in the acute and delayed phases of the first cycle of R-CHOP chemotherapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on-going, for the duration of the trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To collect and summarise information on institutional standard of care.</outcome>
      <timepoint>on-going, for the duration of the trial</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify frequency and severity of common side effects of anti-emetics.

The side effects  (all grades) of the anti-emetic regimen will be monitored in each cycle of R-CHOP chemotherapy</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy for in non-Hodgkins lymphoma is not well documented. The contribution of prednisolone to CINV control in the R-CHOP regimen is also unclear. 

This study aims to evaluate the overall effectiveness of antiemetic control using a standardised 5HT3 antagonist-containing regimen (e.g. ondansetron) in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving R-CHOP chemotherapy.</summary>
