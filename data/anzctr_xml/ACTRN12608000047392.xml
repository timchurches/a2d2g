  <interventions>
    <interventions>Goat milk infant formula as the sole source of nutrient from enrollment until at least 4 months of age, thereafter with other complementary food up to 12 months of age. The study infant formula will be supplied in cans with appropriate sized scoops to measure the quantity of powder required to make up each feed (12.65g of goat milk powder per 100 ml of formula). The volume and frequency of formula feeding will be specfied by the infants' primary care provider according to the standardised infant feeding guidelines.</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Cow milk infant formula as the sole source of nutrient from enrollment until at least 4 months of age, thereafter with other complementary food up to 12 months of age. The cow milk infant formula will be supplied in cans with appropriate sized scoops to measure the quantity of powder required to make up each feed (12.65g of cow milk powder per 100 ml of formula). The volume and frequency of formula feeding will be specfied by the infants' primary care provider according to the standardised infant feeding guidelines

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will compare the growth rates and nutritional status of infants who are exclusively fed formulae either based on goat milk or cow milk. Growth will be assessed regularly (2 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 months). Blood biochemical profile of infants, including plasma amino acids, will be assessed at 4 months.  Formula tolerance and stool frequency will be assessed through to 4 months of age and stool microbiota will be assessed through to 2 months of age. A gold standard reference group of breastfed infants will also be included.</summary>
