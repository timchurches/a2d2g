  <interventions>
    <interventions>a 16 week program of structured exercise twice/week and multidiscipinary information and support sessions (five) aimed at improving participant's weight management habits
The structured exercise includes a total of 20 supervised sessions (2 per week) of one hour of planned aerobic exercise and resistance training supervised by expert cardiac rehabilitation staff. The home-based exercise program is tailored by an exercise physiologist at program admission and updated over the first 4 months to include 30-60 minutes of physical activity, including pedometer-recorded steps for the remaining 5 days of the week. 
The group information and support sessions consist of 4, 90-minute sessions delivered in weeks 1, 2, 4 and 8 of the program. These sessions will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a nutritionist, clinical psychologist, exercise physiologist and cardiac rehabilitation clinical nurse consultant. Session content will include information about nutrition and exercise aimed at weight reduction and modified for diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease; the health implications of being overweight; behavioural change, potential barriers and strategies for self management. Session processes will be interactive, teaching participants how to use food and exercise diaries, with subsequent sessions using these diaries to help develop the capacity to problem-solve, foster motivation and gain a sense of mastery. All content and processes will be based on behavioural and cognitive behavioural therapy tenets and guided by Social Learning Theory and the Transtheoretical Model of Change. 
Phase 2 of the program is designed to support participants continued weight loss behaviours and strategies and will include a one-hour session at 16 weeks (following the assessment schedule) and telephone follow-by one team member on three occasions between 4 and 12 months. The group session will focus on problem-solving and motivation using similar content and processes to the Phase 1 program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: Phase III cardiac rehabilitation or diabetes education service, standard services offered by the North Shore Cardiovascular Education Centre (NSCEC) and Diabetes Education Centre (DEC). Therefore people with cardiac disease on the wait-list may choose to attend the regular six week cardiac rehabilitation program which includes six group-based sessions of one-hour duration on cardiac disease, exercise, nutrition, stress and medications; as well as two structured exercise sessions per week. People with diabetes may choose to attend the Diabetes Education Centre program of two group-based sessions of four hours length on diabetes, diet, exercise and monitoring. The control group will be offered the intervention following the 16 week data collection.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Readiness to change to achieve weight loss will be assessed using the Stages of change for weight loss questionnaire (SOCWLQ), which is a modification of a tool developed by Sutton et al 32 with the addition of one item from Macqueen et al 33 (Appendix F). The questionnaire consists of 2 parts, with the first containing 5 items addressing weight loss behaviours for exercise and nutrition. Participants respond using a 6-point scale that corresponds with the different stages of change expressed in Prochaska and Diclementes? Transtheoretical Model of Change. Part 2 has one item that reflects the participants? current state and participants respond by choosing one of 6 items from the model. Therefore scoring of items will occur so that every response from 3-5 indicates an active stage and therefore gains a score of 1, whereas any response of 1, 2 or 6 is an inactive stage and therefore has a score of 0. Scores will then be totaled for a potential score from 0 (not actively changing) to 5 (actively changing). This questionnaire was also pilot-tested on 18 patients attending the DEC, demonstrating ease of use, a diverse range of scores. Reliability could not be tested as responses are not interval scale.</outcome>

      <outcome>Meters walked in 6 minutes .  The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a submaximal test of aerobic capacity and exercise endurance by measuring the maximum distance a person can walk in 6 minutes. The 6MWT is commonly used to assess function in cardiovascular patients and is recommended because of its similarity to people?s normal activity and ease of administration. The 6MWT has been demonstrated to have good test-retest reliability and construct validity in older patients.29 In this study the 6MWT will be conducted using the standardized method suggested by Steffen et al 29 of 2 trials with an intervening rest period</outcome>

      <outcome>Self-efficacy for weight loss (Self-efficacy for Weight Loss Questionnaire) which is a modification of a tool developed by Linde et al 30 and Clark et al 31. Modifications to the tool were to ensure consistency with Australian dietary and physical guidelines and Australian vernacular (Appendix  E). The questionnaire consists of 12 items related to confidence for several aspects of weight loss including exercise, nutrition and the effects of different contexts. Participants respond using a 5-point scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 5 (very confident). Responses from the 12 items are totaled for a score from 12 to 60, with higher scores reflecting more confidence. This questionnaire was pilot-tested on 18 patients attending the DEC, demonstrating high internal reliability (Cronbach?s Alpha .88), a diverse range of scores and ease of use.</outcome>

      <outcome>Waist circumference loss. Waist circumference will be measured using a single measuring tape supplied by the World Heart Federation (WHF) for the purpose. Following WHF recommendations, waist circumference will be measured by positioning the tape halfway between the top of the iliac crest and rib 10. Participants will be asked to relax their abdomen and breathe out softly. A secondary measure will be taken using a set distance from the sternal notch for the first 3 groups and the most consistent measure used for the remainder of the trial. All measures will be taken twice and a mean calculated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research outlined in this proposal will trial an innovative multidisciplinary program demonstrated to achieve weight loss in overweight people with cardiac disease and diabetes. The program was developed because obesity is a major health problem in NSW and globally, and even more so in people with heart disease and diabetes. The pilot program resulted in weight loss of 4-5% sustained at 12 months. This weight loss is demonstrated to result in improved risk factors, decreased progression of of disease and improved quality of life.</summary>
