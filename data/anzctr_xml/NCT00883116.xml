    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ixabepilone
Treatment: drugs - Doxorubicin
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel

Experimental: Ixabepilone, 40 mg/m^2, intravenously (IV) - Participants received ixabepilone, 40 mg/m^2, given IV over 3 hours every 21 days until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression

Active Comparator: Control chemotherapy (Paclitaxel or Doxorubicin) - Participants received either paclitaxel, 175 mg/m^2 given IV over 3 hours, or per institutional guidelines but not exceeding 3 hours, every 21 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or doxorubicin, 60 mg/m^2 given IV per institutional guidelines every 21 days, depending on the prior therapy received, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or cumulative dose of 500 mg/m^2.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of death. If the patient did not die, OS was censored on the last date he or she was known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization to date of death or last date censored to up to approximately 26 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival - Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to the date of documented disease progression. Patients who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Those who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Participants who did not have any on-study tumor assessments were censored on the date they were randomized. Measurable disease was present if the patient had 1 or more measurable lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization to date of disease progression or death (or date of last tumor assessment for those who did not die or progress) up to approximately 22 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best Overall Response Rate - Best overall response rate was defined as the number of participants whose best response was either partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) divided by the number of participants in the treatment group. Overall tumor response was based on an integration of the evaluation of target, nontarget, and new lesions. CR=Disappearance of all clinical and radiologic evidence of target lesions. PR=At least 30% reduction in the sum of diameters of all target lesions; taking as reference the baseline study measurement. Changes in tumor measurements need not be confirmed by repeat measurements performed after the criteria for response were first met.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization and every 6 weeks to end of treatment (9 cycles, or approximately Day 189)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), an SAE Related to Study Drug, Death as Outcome, a Peripheral Neuropathy Adverse Event (AE), a Grade 3 or Higher AE, and an AE Related to Study Drug - AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Related to study drug=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug. Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Day 1 (first dose) to 30 days past last dose (up to Day 219); 9 cycles, or 189 days + 30 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Key Inclusion Criteria

          -  Women aged 18 years and older

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma

          -  Evidence that the cancer is advanced, recurrent, or metastatic and not curable by
             local measures, such as surgery or radiation.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;=70

          -  Measurable or nonmeasurable disease that has progressed since last treatment.

               -  If only disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature must be
                  confirmed by histology or cytology.

               -  Disease in a previously irradiated field is acceptable as the only site of
                  measurable disease only if there has been clear progression since completion of
                  radiotherapy.

          -  All therapy directed at endometrial cancer must be discontinued 21 days prior to start
             of treatment, except for hormonal therapy which must be discontinued at least 1 week
             prior to start of study treatment. Concurrent administration of hormone replacement
             therapy is allowed.

          -  Prior therapy: Participants must have failed 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic
             regimen for endometrial cancer. May have received 2 prior chemotherapy regimens if 1
             regimen was given for stage I or II disease. May have received any number of prior
             non-cytotoxic regimens such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, signal transduction
             inhibitors, or hormonal therapy. Previous radiation therapy is allowed.

    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether administration of ixabepilone
      results in superior outcome as assessed by overall survival compared with that achieved with
      standard chemotherapy (paclitaxel or doxorubicin) in women with advanced endometrial cancer
      that has progressed following first-line chemotherapy.</summary>
