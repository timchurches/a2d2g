    <interventions>The proposed project will involve a two-armed, randomized, double-blind RCT with a 2 (treatment conditions) x 4 (assessment points) factorial design, conducted amongst Chin, Kachin, and Rohingyas in Malaysia. Persons of refugee background agreeing to participate will be recruited from the epidemiological study (PUIRBHC0130) at that site and randomly allocated to either Integrated ADAPT Therapy (IAT) or Problem Management Plus (PM+).

Novel studies published by Alvin Tay based on these inquiries (Tay, Rees, Chan, Kareth, &amp;amp; Silove, 2015; Tay, Rees, Chen, Kareth, Lahe, et al., 2015) show that the disruptions of the psychosocial systems underpinning the ADAPT model play an important role in shaping mental health and adaptation outcomes and contribute (in concert with past trauma and adversity) not only to a wide array of comorbid mental disorders (CMDs) but also to difficulties in functioning and capacity to adapt to the new environment. Drawing on established Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and problem-solving principles and techniques, IAT is based on the psychosocial domains of the ADAPT model (safety/security, bonds/networks, access to justice, roles/identities, and existential meaning) and designed to be grounded in the culture and context of displacement of individual refugee groups given their appropriateness, ease-of-delivery, flexibility, and effectiveness.

A manualized protocol of IAT developed by Dr Tay will be adapted to the history, culture, language, terminology, context of each refugee group. The manual describes in detail the rationale underlying IAT, the steps involved in applying IAT, the use of psychotherapeutic approaches in addressing adaptive issues faced by refugees, clinical vignettes and scenarios, sample exercises and homework. 

Procedure: 
Recruitment: Dr Tay has conducted extensive consultations with academic partners, community leaders and members of the Chin, Kachin, and Rohingya communities to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed project since 2013.  Based on consensus from refugee communities, we intend to use a systematic informant-driven sampling method applying the following sequence: 1. community personnel who have received training will provide specific information about the nature of the project at weekly community meetings at community centers (attended by a large portion of refugees).   Individual attendees who seek out additional information about voluntarily at the end of the meeting will be provided with as much detail as possible.  2. In addition, in their routine visits to all households (based on the comprehensive record of all residents), community leaders will include information about the project in discussions with residents, answering all questions and queries. 3. Those who consent to further contact will be phoned or visited by team workers who will explain the details of the study further and seek consent for potential participants to complete the tablet-based screening measures. Persons who wish further time to consider consent, will be given ample opportunity to do so. 4. Those who meet criteria for the intervention will be followed up by phone or home visits (depending on participant preference) to clarify further questions, concerns and expectations, and to consent if they so wish. If participants appeared ambivalent, they will be given sufficient time to consider their participation and our workers will follow up and re-approach if necessary. Our workers are trained specifically to ensure that there is no perceived duress in relation to participation at each step of the process, the emphasis being on respect for privacy and autonomy. At all times, participants will be assured by the community worker that their their decision and right to withdraw at any time will not have any adverse impact on their status, their asylum application, or the services to which they are entitled as refugees. In addition, participants are granted the full right to withdraw from the study at any point over the course of the intervention without any adverse consequence. 5. As indicated, one randomized, participants will attend the interventions at established NGO community centres where they are used to attending, places of safety given the provision of Malaysian law affording designated NGOs legal immunity against government interference. 

Training in delivery of intervention: The therapy will be administered individually by trained counsellors trained and supervised by psychologists. Pre-treatment assessments: will be conducted by an assessment team blind to the treatment condition. Research team will apply a stringent procedure to ensure that participants and counsellors are concealed from the study objectives. 

Treatment: IAT: individuals assigned to IAT will receive 6x1 hour sessions provided on a weekly basis. The sessions involve: (1) overview of the ADAPT model and refugee adaptation; (2) safety and security; (3) disrupted bonds and networks; (4) access to justice; (5) transition to new roles and identities; (6) living a meaningful life; (7) commitment to living a valued life. 

Resources: Our team will include research assistants (recent medical graduates), certified healthcare professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists) and Malaysian academics in psychology, psychiatry, and behavioral science, all of whom are based in Malaysia with extensive knowledge of the local culture and customs of the Malaysian society, research sites, and relevant provisions. Our team will be based at Perdana University where we will have access to basic office equipment, facilities, and clinical services. We have engaged certified mental health professionals who are practicing psychologists and psychiatrists on a retainer contract who in addition to their clinical duties will assist in providing psychiatric care and psychotherapy if necessary. However, we anticipate the number of clients in need of such services will be in the minority with the majority being more likely prone to mild-moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety and will therefore be amenable to resilience building, directed coaching, CBT-based early intervention, services will be provided by trained coaches/counsellors. Training workshops will be organized prior to launching the platform to orient all persons involved to all aspects of the research including research protocol, recruitment procedure, methodology and other responsibilities.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group will involve provision of World Health Organization Problem Management Plus (PM+). Individuals assigned to PM+ will receive 6x1 hour sessions on a weekly basis in which the core modules of PM-Plus will be implemented to help participants apply problem solving and other behavioral intervention strategies. The PM-Plus manual comprises 6 core modules: psycho-education, managing stress, behavioral activation, strengthening social support, stabilization and contingency planning. 

The therapy will be administered individually by trained counselors and supervised by clinical psychologists. The sessions will take place at the respective community centers. There will be handouts, homework, and a mobile application to track treatment progress from session to session.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Promoting the mental health and psychosocial wellbeing of refugees is a global public health priority. Yet questions remain about the cultural and contextual relevance and effectiveness of psychotherapies applied for specific mental health problems encountered amongst this population.  First, the range of mental health problems is wide encompassing co-morbid disorders and forms of distress, yet most interventions focus on the limited outcome of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Second, western derived methods of intervention draw heavily on cognitive behavioural techniques which on their own may be culturally and contextually alien and more broadly, are not directly congruent with the experiences of refugees. Third, recruitment to studies rarely reflects a systematic approach to identifying persons in need in the community.  Finally, interventions tend to be focused on psychopathology (symptoms of distress) rather than on building the capacity for positive adaptation based on an understanding of the psychosocial disruptions that refugees continue to confront following exposure to conflict and displacement. This RCT intervention is innovative in allowing all eligible refugees from a defined catchment area to participate and on focusing specifically on building adaptive capacity based on an established psychosocial model (ADAPT) amongst Burmese refugees (members of the Chin, Kachin, and Rohingya communities) in Malaysia. Specifically, the study will test the efficacy of Integrated ADAPT therapy (IAT), a novel approach that is grounded in the refugee experience rather than on a set of "imported" cognitive behavioural techniques applied to treat traumatic stress in western settings.  Our team has spent the past two years in intensive engagement with the communities and relevant stakeholders, using extensive community consultation to ensure the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the project, as well as its contextual and cultural relevance.  We have built a strong consensus amongst all stakeholders concerning the value and acceptability of the project. The procedure has has been fully manualized, and preliminary training of potential therapists has been very well received. The comparison group will receive PM+ as outlined hereunder.  Integral to the study is a process for immediate translation and dissemination based on a policy and practice protocol (TPPP), a process that will be greatly facilitated by the extensive engagement, consultation and interaction process that has taken place over the preceding two years with all stakeholders relevant to the communities in which the study will be implemented. </summary>
