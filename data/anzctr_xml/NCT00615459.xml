Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Sequence 1: Placebo,Tiotropium, Indacaterol 150 µg - In period I, placebo to indacaterol (150 or 300 µg) delivered via SDDPI. The placebo for blinding tiotropium was delivered via the tiotropium inhalation device. In period II, tiotropium (18 µg) once daily delivered via inhalation device and matching placebo to indacaterol delivered once daily via single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI). In period III, indacaterol 150 µg once daily delivered via SDDPI and placebo to tiotropium was delivered once daily via the tiotropium inhalation device. Daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy (where applicable) was provided to remain stable throughout study. The Short acting (beta) ß2-agonist (SABA) was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Experimental: Sequence 2: Indacaterol 300 µg, Indacaterol 150 µg, Tiotropium - In period I,indacaterol 300 µg once daily delivered via single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI)and matching placebo to tiotropium delivered once daily via tiotropium inhalation device. In period II, indacaterol 150 µg once daily delivered via SDDPI and matching placebo to tiotropium delivered once daily via tiotropium inhalation device. In period III, tiotropium (18 µg) once daily delivered via inhalation device and matching placebo to indacaterol delivered once daily via SDDPI. Daily ICS monotherapy (where applicable) was provided to remain stable throughout study. The SABA was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Experimental: Sequence 3: Indacaterol 150 µg, Indacaterol 300 µg, Placebo - In period I, indacaterol 150 µg once daily delivered via SDDPI and matching placebo to tiotropium delivered once daily via tiotropium inhalation device. In period II, indacaterol 300 µg once daily delivered via SDDPI and matching placebo to tiotropium delivered once daily via tiotropium inhalation device. In period III, placebo to indacaterol (150 or 300 µg) delivered via SDDPI. The placebo for blinding tiotropium was delivered via the tiotropium inhalation device. Daily ICS monotherapy (where applicable) was provided to remain stable throughout study. The SABA was available for rescue use throughout the study.

Experimental: Sequence 4: Tiotropium, Placebo, Indacaterol 300 µg - In period I, tiotropium (18 µg) once daily delivered via inhalation device and matching placebo to indacaterol delivered once daily via SDDPI. In period II, placebo to indacaterol (150 or 300 µg) delivered via SDDPI. The placebo for blinding tiotropium was delivered via the tiotropium inhalation device. In period III, indacaterol 300 µg once daily delivered via SDDPI and matching placebo to tiotropium delivered once daily via tiotropium inhalation device. Daily ICS monotherapy (where applicable) was provided to remain stable throughout study. The SABA was available for rescue use throughout the study.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>24-hour Post-dose Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) After 14 Days of Treatment - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the mean of FEV1 measurements at 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post Day 14 dose measured on the morning of Day 15 in each treatment period. The model used for analysis contained the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose on Day 15 of each treatment period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak FEV1 During 4 Hours Post Morning Dose on Day 1 - FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. The peak effect on Day 1 was defined as the maximum FEV1 during the first 4 hour on that day. FEV1 measurements taken within 6 hour of rescue use were set to missing before the peak FEV1 (0-4 hour) was calculated. The model used for analysis contained the (period) baseline FEV1 as covariate. The (period) baseline FEV1 was defined as the value measured before the study drug administration in that treatment period.</outcome>
