  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vascular Function - Vascular function will be assessed non-invasively (at baseline, Week 6, and Week 12) with measurement of arterial compliance (elasticity) by pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity. Measurement of arterial vasodilation will be done non-invasively to evaluate endothelial cells which line the blood vessels that regulate blood flow. Blood samples will be taken to assess markers of vascular function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (Australian Site only) - Cerebral blood flow velocity will be assessed (baseline , Week 6, Week 12) by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. This will serve as an index of arterial vasodilator responsiveness in the cerebral circulation. This will be performed by the Australian site only.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive Function - A selection of cognitive tests will be administered (baseline, Week 6, and Week 12) by a qualified member of the study team to assess varying aspects of the participant's level of functioning cognition.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Canadian population, as is the case in most developed countries, is ageing and becoming
      increasingly overweight and/or obese. Both ageing and obesity are associated with reduced
      cognitive performance which can impact adversely on the ability to undertake daily activities
      and increases the risk of loss of independent living and reduced quality of life. The
      investigators predict that consumption of ½ cup of pulses per day for 12 weeks will improve
      cognitive function in older overweight/obese adults and thus decrease the rate of cognitive
      decline that occurs in this at-risk population.</summary>
