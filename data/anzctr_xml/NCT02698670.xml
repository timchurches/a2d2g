    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute Procedural Success - Primary endpoint is the acute procedural success for the primary arrhythmia in the whole cohort of ablation procedures. A procedure will be defined successful if all the following conditions will occur during the case: 1) ability to map, 2) completion of the necessary ablation applications, 3) primary arrhythmia termination (when applicable), and 4) validation of ablation through appropriate technique(s).</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects who are eligible for an ablation procedure with the Rhythmia 3D mapping
             system and IntellaMap Orion mapping catheter according to current international and
             local guidelines (and future revisions) and per physician discretion;

          -  Subjects who are willing and capable of providing informed consent;

          -  Subjects who are willing and capable of participating in all testing associated with
             this clinical investigation at an approved clinical investigational center;

          -  Subjects whose age is 20 years or above, or of legal age to give informed consent
             specific to state and national law.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects requiring de novo ablation of atrial fibrillation;

          -  Subjects who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly interfere with the current study, except when the subject is
             participating in a mandatory governmental registry, or a purely observational registry
             with no associated treatments; each instance must be brought to the attention of the
             sponsor to determine eligibility*;

          -  The subject is unable or not willing to complete follow-up visits and examination for
             the duration of the study;

          -  Subjects who have undergone a previous cardiac ablation within 30 days prior to
             enrollment;

          -  Unrecovered/unresolved Adverse Events from any previous invasive procedure;

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are, or plan to become, pregnant during the time
