  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An abdominal distribution of fat is associated with the greatest heart disease risk, because
      commonly, several risk factors of metabolic origin cluster in these individuals. When this
      occurs the condition is called the 'metabolic syndrome'.

      Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system resulting in enhanced release of the
      stress hormone 'noradrenaline', may be one mechanism by which adverse cardiovascular and
      metabolic sequela of the metabolic syndrome might be mediated. Impaired insulin action may be
      one factor contributing to increased noradrenaline release.

      The aim of this Study is to determine whether treatment with a drug called pioglitazone which
      is known to improve insulin action, results in reduced sympathetic nervous system activity
      and stress hormone release when compared to treatment with a dummy drug (placebo).</summary>
