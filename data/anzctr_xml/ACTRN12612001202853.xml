  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will retrospectively review patients who suffered from hamstring problems and try and correlate these with FAI. We suspect these two entities are commonly being confused by 
mistake.

The duration of the observation is approximately 6-12 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the validated scoring clinical tools of the WOMAC hip score, Mahorn Hip Outcome Tool (MHOT) and the Non-arthritic hip score will provide functional quantitative data.  Total assessment of clinical signs and symptoms will also be analysed.  This will allow for a greater proportion of qualitative analysis, combined with the quantitative data collected via the validated questionnaires.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hamstring avulsion is a common misdiagnosis for FAI and there appears to be a relationship between these two diagnoses. This relationship has never been studied.  This study could contribute significantly to the global understanding of this hard to treat entity.</summary>
