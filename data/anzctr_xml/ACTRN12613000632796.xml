  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lip muscle training. 
Participants will undergo lip muscle training for 3 minutes twice daily, 4 times per week for 8 weeks. All measures will be assessed at baseline, and at 4 &amp; 8 weeks post-lip muscle training. A training log is used to monitor participant compliance.
The Patakara (registered trade mark) (DENTAL YOUME, Tokyo Japan)(http://www.liptrainer.com/main/specifications.htm) Lip Trainer (mouth piece) contains both flexible plastic and rubber, and uses the resilience of these materials to directly condition the oral muscles to increase their strength. The device is placed between the upper and lower lips. The user closes the lips firmly onto the device and maintains this state for three minutes. The notches come together at this time and the teeth do not make contact.
</interventions>
    <comparator>SHAM control - A paediatric Lip Trainer is used. This mouth piece offers minimal conditioning effect and has been shown to produce minimal effect on muscle strength gain.

    <concealment>Telephone screening regarding general health status, followed by sleep apnea screening. 
Healthy volunteers recruited for this study will undergo a screening test to identify those with or without sleep apnea. Individuals with sleep apnea will have an Apneic Hypopneic index (AHI &gt; 5). Both groups will then be randomly allocated to either the control arm (SHAM resistance lip muscle training) or the intervention group (with resistance lip muscle training) in a 2x2 study design. Randomisation by sealed opaque envelope.

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We estimate that n=22 per group will allow us to observe differences in the lip closure force following lip muscle training. The estimation was based on an effect size of 1.1 (at alpha=0.05 and beta=0.8) for a mean LCF difference of 2.09 +/- 1.9 N (pilot study).

A two-way repeated measures ANOVA will be applied to test the differences in normally distributed sleep variables between groups. For skewed data, the Mann-Whitney U Test will be used. A Pearsons correlation test will be used to explore the relationship between observed variables.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study proposes that lip muscle strength training using the Lip Trainer, The Patakara 'Registered Trademark' (DENTAL YOUME , Tokyo Japan), will improve labial closure force through strengthening of the orbicularis oris (lip muscle), and will reduce snoring and sleep apnea resulting in improved sleep quality.</summary>
