Blood samples: In the plasma/serum; we wish to test for changes in the levels of certain inflammatory markers like C-Reactive PRotein (CRP). Haemaglobin (Hb) &amp;  Mean Cell Volume (MCV) will be monitered.  We will also test for micro Ribonucleic acid (micro-RNAs) in plasma as preliminary evidence suggests that some micro-RNAs act as biomarker for Colorectal Cancer (CRC).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to ascertain the effects on  bowel health of resistant starch (StarPlus (trademark)) when given to participants who are ingesting a high red meat diet. Also to determine if the consumption of this high protein diet causes changes in certain markers for bowel cancer and if adding RS, ( StarPlus (trademark)) to the diet can improve these effects.</summary>
