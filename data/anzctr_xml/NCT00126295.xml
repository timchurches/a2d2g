  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the randomised controlled trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      tailored written education package (What you need to know about stroke") on the outcomes of:

        -  Knowledge about stroke, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, perceived health status,
           satisfaction with the content and presentation of the information received, and desire
           for additional information for patients following stroke and

        -  Knowledge about stroke, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, satisfaction with the
           content and presentation of the information received, and desire for additional
           information for their carers.

      A secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of written information on the outcomes of
      knowledge about stroke, self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, and perceived health status of
      patients following stroke and on knowledge about stroke, self-efficacy, anxiety, and
      depression of their carers.</summary>
