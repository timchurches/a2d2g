  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Potential subjects attended a screening clinic where they were assessed by the principal investigators.  Those included were photographed (full face and left and right profile) and the film and frame numbers recorded in the subjectÃ¿Â¢Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â¿s records.  The study nurse, who was blinded throughout the study by the wearing of a rhino clip, then applied the active and placebo treatments to opposite sides of the face and forehead.  Fresh gloves were worn during the application of each separate treatment.  

In subsequent clinics a study nurse washed and dried the subjectÃ¿Â¢Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â¿s face with a mild dermatological soap and recorded subjective opinions of perceived changes in acne.  Four photographs were taken of each subjectÃ¿Â¢Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â¿s face representing the upper and lower parts of each of the treated and placebo sides.  Active and placebo treatments were applied as described above.  

Subjects were photographed using a Minolta Dynax 600si camera with a Sigma 105mL macro lens, multi-directional studio flash lighting with soft boxes and Fuji Reala film.  This film was used because it has high acutance and extended tunnel range.  Colour was standardised against 18% grey card to ensure reproducibility.  The camera was fixed to a tripod and the position marked on the floor to maintain consistency in future photography.  

Subjects were collected and returned to their homes by a University car to maximise compliance.</summary>
