  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following consent participants will be randomised to the control (CHO 142g/L; 1.28kcal/mL), or the intervention, which is a low carbohydrate, low glycaemic index diabetes-specific formula (CHO 75g/L; 1kcal/mL), Once treatment allocation has occurred, participants will remain on treatment as long as tube feeding continues in ICU or as per the treating physician. All investigators and the participant will be blinded to treatment allocation. Nutritional requirements will be calculated by providing an average of 100-125kJ/kg body weight or adjusted ideal body weight (BW / AIBW) and 1.2-1.5g protein/kg BW/AIBW as per current practice. 
For the purpose of a biomarker sub-study, a second intervention arm using a different low glycaemic index diabetes specific formula will be used (CHO 113g/L; 1kcal/mL). Randomisation to this arm will be ceased once blood and urine samples are available for the first 10-12 participants in each group.  These samples will be collected from all patients at randomisation and 48 hours later. Once this has been achieved, randomisation will revert to control and intervention groups only. Collection of urine and blood samples for biomarker assay will also be discontinued at this point. </interventions>

    <concealment>This is a prospective randomised control trial of a minimum of 54 ICU patients. Randomisation between three arms will be performed initially by a computer generated sequence which will then be put into sequentially numbered envelopes. Block randomisation will be used. Envelopes will be prepared by a non-investigator to include the treatment arm (denoted as Feed A, Feed B or Feed C). Once 10 patients have been recruited to the second intervention arm (CHO 113g/L; 1kcal/mL), further recruitment to this treatment will cease, and the trial continue with the remaining interventional arm (74g/L; 1kcal/mL), and the control arm (142 g/L; 1.28kcal/mL)</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocations to groups will be generated through a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. simple randomisation, computerised sequence generation). Group allocations will be allocated and concealed sequentially by a non-instigator independent of the study.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Two arms - a control and interventional arm form the primary study with ~21 patients per arm. A third arm (2nd interventional) of ~12 patients will be recruited as part of a nested cohort study.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Nineteen patients per study arm (two arms) are required to detect a statistically significant difference (alpha 0.05) with a power of 80%. This is based on a median difference of 21.5 units of insulin per day and standard deviation of 22.5 units (Mesejo (2003). Additionally, 10 patients will be randomised to a third arm for a sub-study investigating relevant biomarkers. A 10% buffer of two patients per arm has been added to the estimated sample size to account for patients lost to follow up or retracted consent. 

Analysis will be performed using R commander software or equivalent. Descriptive statistics  such as frequency, means and standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges and full ranges will be calculated for demographic and baseline variables as well as for trial endpoints. Linear and logistic analyses will be performed using relevant data, returning point estimates of effect with associated 95% confidence intervals.  Cross sectional analyses in cohort study data with equal follow-up time per subject will be analysed with linear (for continuous outcomes) or logistic models (for categorical outcomes). 
Linear regression analyses will be used to analyse results from the nested cohort study to determine the contribution of AGE intake, AGE output and insulin dose on sRAGE levels.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, blinded, randomised controlled feasibility trial of critically ill tube fed ICU patients looking at the effectiveness of diabetes specific nutritional formula in managing stress hyperglycaemia. The primary aim of this study is to determine whether the administration of a diabetes specific formula, when compared to standard enteral formula, reduces insulin use over a 48 hour period. Secondary outcomes include both clinical endpoints and assessment of the feasibility of study processes to inform a potential multi-site RCT.

A sub-study will also be incorporated to determine if altered carbohydrate, is associated with a change in oxidative stress markers, as well acute and chronic inflammatory biomarkers.
