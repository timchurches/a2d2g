  <interventions>
    <interventions>A tailored exercise program to suit your individual fitness level and needs. Your exercise class will be on two days per week with no more than 10 other patients with hip or knee arthritis in the group to physiotherapist. The session will last for 60 minutes held twice a week for 6 weeks and a physiotherapist/physiotherapy assistant will help you with your program. 
Partipants will also receive advice and management regarding their weight from a dietician in a group setting. This will occur twice over the 6 week exercise period for a maximum period of 45 minutes.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee is a common cause of pain and disability for many people. The symptoms may be progressive and may ultimately require joint replacement surgery. However, we know that some non-surgical treatment options in particular, exercise and weight loss, can alleviate the symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease but we dont know to what extent this can occur. There are no studies that report whether the effect is ever sufficient to influence a patients need for surgery. 
In this study we will identify patients with non-urgent hip or knee arthritis and invite them to participate in an intensive 6 week exercise and weight loss program at Frankston hospital. We will score their priority for surgery (using the MAPT tool which is validated for use in OA), record their self rated need for surgery and measure their body weight, pain, muscle strength, physical function and quality of life before and after the 6 week program.  Data regarding priority for surgery, self rated need for surgery, and body weight will be collected at 3 and 12 months. We will also investigate any association between a number of patient related factors and the outcomes obtained. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an intensive program of exercise and weight loss for persons with hip or knee arthritis awaiting consideration of joint replacement surgery, on the pain and disability associated with hip or knee arthritis and priority for surgery.</summary>
