  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In the feasibility study, the primary objective is to determine the technical feasibility based on number of patients consented to molecular profiling, number of patients eligible and screened for the trial, number of patients eligible, recruitment, ability to deliver personalised treatment per protocol, safety and the ability to address any potential practical issues that may arise through the conduct of this trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 10 patients have been recruited to the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective tumour response rate (OTRR) - partial (PR) or complete response (CR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour evaluation will follow the RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines and be used to determine response status (i.e. complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease) at each assessment time point. The OTRR will be calculated by summing the number of patients assessed as having a complete or partial response and dividing this by the total number of patients evaluable for response (according to RECIST Version 1.1). Confirmation of a complete or partial response will be undertaken based on the results of the next scan performed (i.e. no additional scans to those presented in the Schedule of Assessments are required).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival (OS) (death from any cause)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival time is defined as the time from the date of registration to the date of death due to any cause. Overall survival time will be censored at the date of the last follow-up visit for patients who are still alive.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety (rates of adverse events)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events after each treatment cycle. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life (QoL)(scores from patient-completed questionnaires)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Health-related Quality of Life assessment will be performed at baseline, then 4 weekly until disease progression.
The core EORTC QoL Questionnaire, QLQ-C30, will be used. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical benefit at 4 months - complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour evaluation will follow the RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines and be used to determine response status (i.e. complete response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease) at each assessment time point. The clinical benefit rate will be calculated by summing the number of patients assessed at 4 months as having a complete response, partial response, or stable disease and dividing this by the total number of patients evaluable for response at 4 months (according to RECIST Version 1.1). Confirmation of a complete or partial response will be undertaken based on the results of the next scan performed (i.e. no additional scans to those presented in the Schedule of Assessments are required).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <inclusivecriteria>1. Adult males or females 18 years or over with histologically confirmed primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who have cytological confirmation of recurrent or metastatic disease
2. Are currently enrolled in APGI and have consented through APGI to notify them if something of significance in regards to their cancer is found.  
3. One of the following specified three molecular signatures: 
*HER2 positive (HER2/neu over expression) subgroup; assessed using detailed DNA sequencing and RNA expression analysis and confirmed by HER2 ISH testing (using standard gastric cancer protocols).

Patients with brain metastases that have been treated, and are asymptomatic, and have been stable for 3 or more months after treatment are allowed. A baseline CT brain or MRI is only required if there is clinical suspicion of central nervous system involvement;

Patients with a past history of adequately treated carcinoma-in-situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ or non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are eligible. Patients with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for at least 5 years after definitive primary treatment;
6. Any significant active infection, including chronic active hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Testing for these is not mandatory unless clinically indicated. Patients with known Hepatitis B/C infection will be allowed to participate providing evidence of viral suppression has been documented and the patient remains on appropriate anti-viral therapy;
7. Serious medical or psychiatric conditions that might limit the ability of the patient to comply with the protocol;
8. Pregnancy, lactation, or inadequate contraception. Women must be post menopausal, infertile, or use a reliable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 14 days prior to registration. Men must have been surgically sterilised or use a (double if required) barrier method of contraception.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the feasibility of a personalised treatment strategy, on the basis of a tumour molecular signature via genomic sequencing and protein expression, in patients with advanced recurrent or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, with histologically confirmed primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, and have one of the following three molecular signatures: 1. HER2 positive (HER2/neu amplification) subgroup 2. Homologous recombinant defects (BRCA1/BRCA2 or PALB2 mutation) subgroup 3. antiEGFR responsive sub-group (KRAS wildtype or KRAS codon13 mutation) Study details Ten patients will be enrolled in a feasibility stage to determine the technical feasibility of enrolling patients to a personalised treatment approach (including the logistics of recruitment, delivery of personalised treatment and general trial conduct). Recruitment to the HER2 positive subgroup will be reviewed after 1 patient has received personalised treatment. Personalised treatment based on genetic signature will comprise of the following: 1. HER2 positive sub-group - gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given intravenously on days 1, 8 &amp; 15 every 28 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity plus trastuzumab 4mg/kg intravenously day 1 only, followed by trastuzumab 2mg/kg given intravenously day 8, then weekly every subsequent week until progression or unacceptable toxicity or a total of 6 months treatment is completed. 2. Homologous recombinant defects subgroup - gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 over 30 minutes, given intravenously on days 1, 8 &amp; 15 every 28 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity plus cisplatin 50 mg/m2 given intravenously over 60 minutes on days 1&amp; 15 every 28 days until progression or unacceptable toxicity 3. antiEGFR responsive sub-group - gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 given intravenously days 1,8 &amp; 15 each 28 day cycle until progression or unacceptable toxicity plus erlotinib 100mg orally daily continuously until progression or unacceptable toxicity Note: Patients may have received up to one cycle of standard gemcitabine treatment or gemcitabine in combination with abraxane prior to personalised treatment Patients will be evaluated at least 4 weekly to see how they are responding to treatment until progression, unacceptable toxicity or a total of 6 months treatment is completed.
