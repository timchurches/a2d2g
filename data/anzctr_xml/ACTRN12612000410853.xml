  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oxygen administered via the Airvo device at the setting of 25 Litres per minute, titrated to achieve a target participant oxygen saturation of 96%, over a period of 30 minutes. This will be followed by a 15 minute washout period.

Oxygen administered via the Airvo device at the setting of 45 Litres per minute, titrated to achieve a target participant oxygen saturation of 96%, over a period of 30 minutes. This will be followed by a 15 minute washout period.

Note prior to the above, tolerability to the Airvo will be tested at 25 Litres per minute for 15 minutes, followed by 45 Litres per minute. This will be done on room air. 

Note oxygen saturations will be measured via a TOSCA.</interventions>
    <comparator>Oxygen administered via nasal prongs with the oxygen flow starting at 1.5L per minute and then titrated to achieve a target participant oxygen saturation of 96%, over a period of 30 minutes. This will be followed by a 15 minute washout period.

Note oxygen saturations will be measured via a TOSCA.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Airvo device has been developed to provide oxygen at high flow rates with positive airway pressure. It is not known, however, how this method of delivery influences carbon dioxide levels in patients at risk of oxygen induced hypercapnia, such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 

To understand clinical utility and safety, it is crucial to determine how supplementary oxygen administered by the Airvo device influences the carbon dioxide and compare this with similar oxygen concentrations delivered by low flow nasal cannulae.</summary>
