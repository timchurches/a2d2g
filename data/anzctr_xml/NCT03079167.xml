  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Double-blind, placebo controlled Phase III trial of erythropoietin for hypoxic ischaemic
      encephalopathy in infants receiving hypothermia. The study aim is to determine whether Epo in
      conjunction with hypothermia in infants with moderate/severe HIE will improve
      neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age, without significant adverse effects, when
      compared to hypothermia alone.</summary>
