    <interventions>Planned Doses as follows:
Dose Level 1 (1st cohort) : single capsule containing 3 mg noribogaine or methylcellulose placebo
Dose Level 2 (2nd cohort):single capsule containing 10 mg noribogaine or methylcellulose placebo
Dose Level 3 (3rd cohort): single capsule containing 30 mg noribogaine or methylcellulose placebo
Dose Level 4 (4th cohort): single capsule containing 60 mg noribogaine or methylcellulose placebo</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of noribogaine in a healthy normal participant population. This will be assessed by observations including physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests and ECGs</outcome>
      <timepoint>These  will be assessed frequently over 72 hours then periodically duing  the next 6 days following a single dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the tolerability of noribogaine in a healthy normal participant population. This will be assessed by clinical observation and adverse event reporting. 

Expected adverse events are not known with certainty but may include events commonly seen with serotonergic medications such as certain antidepressants and opioids. Adverse events include participant reports and clinically significant abnormalities of observations defined in the protocol. All adverse events will be assessed by the principal investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be assessed frequently over 72 hours then periodically during the next 6 days following a single dose</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of noribogaine in the study participants. This will be assessed using blood samples that will be analyzed for noribogaine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Samples will be obtained frequently over 72 hours, then periodically over the next 6 days following a single dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the pharmacodynamic profile of noribogaine in the study participants. This will be measured by physiological assessments of analgesic and mu opioid agonist activity</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed frequently over 72 hours then periodically over the next 6 days following a single dose.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>a) Evidence from medical history, physical or laboratory examinations of significant neurologic, psychiatric, cardiac, respiratory, renal, hepatic, endocrine, gastrointestinal, immunological condition or any other diagnosed conditions that might interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the drug, interfere with the ability to accurately record study measurements (e.g., cataracts) or which may potentiate or predispose to undesired effects. 
b) Any history of seizure or convulsion, including febrile convulsion in childhood. 
c) A history of alcohol or drug abuse or dependency 
d) History of mental illness requiring medication or treatment by a physician.
e) Any participant for whom the investigator believes, for any reason, inclusion would not be an acceptable risk.</exclusivecriteria>
