    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - cognitive assessment
Treatment: surgery - fatigue assessment and management
Treatment: surgery - psychologic distress
Treatment: surgery - quality-of-life assessment

Experimental: Tamoxifen for 5 years - Patients treated with tamoxifen for 5 years after randomization.

Experimental: Letrozole for 5 years - Patients treated with letrozole for 5 years after randomization.

Experimental: Tamoxifen 2 years plus letrozole 3 years - Patients treated with tamoxifen for 2 years and afterwards with letrozole for 3 years.

Experimental: Letrozole for 2 years plus tamoxifen for 3 years - Patients treated with letrozole for 2 years and afterwards with tamoxifen for 3 years.


Treatment: surgery: cognitive assessment
Cognitive function will be assessed using the CogState battery and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire.

Treatment: surgery: fatigue assessment and management
Fatigue will be evaluated using the Brief Fatigue Inventory.

Treatment: surgery: psychologic distress
Psychologic distress will be evaluated using the General Health Questionnaire after cognitive testing.

Treatment: surgery: quality-of-life assessment
Quality of life will be assessed using global linear analogue self-assessment (LASA) indicators for physical well-being, mood, coping effort (PACIS), perceived social support and subjective health estimation.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Studying cognitive function, such as thinking, attention, concentration, and
      memory, in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy for breast cancer may help improve
      quality of life and the ability to plan treatment for cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying cognitive function in postmenopausal women with
      breast cancer receiving hormone therapy on clinical trial IBCSG-1-98.</summary>
