  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of false positive responses during the picture recognition task of the CDR Computerized Cognitive Assessment System - The CDR Computerized Cognitive Assessment System will be used to measure the cognitive effects of the treatments. The battery is sensitive to bidirectional cognitive change including trials in MCI, dementia and SMI. There is strong converging evidence that one particular aspect of performance, namely the number of false positive responses during a picture recognition task, is particularly sensitive to hippocampal integrity (based on activation of the dentate gyrus during the task, and specific decrements in conditions associated with poorer hippocampal function). This will form the primary outcome in this study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a dearth of research which takes a multi-compound approach to dietary interventions,
      in humans, aimed at improving outcome measures of cognition. Animal research in particular
      points towards fatty acids and flavonoids having a potentiating effect on each other, and
      possibly even being synergistic. Thus, study products will be administered in the present
      trial comprising both of these compounds, with a view to investigating their potential
      effects on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective
      memory impairment (SMI).</summary>
