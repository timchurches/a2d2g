  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
TMS will be performed on each participant at each 6 month reveiw period. This will include measures of intracortical inhibition and facilitation, resting motor thresholds and motor evoked potentials before and after theta burst stimulation. The TMS protocol is expected to take 2-3 hours each session, and will be conducted on 5 occasions for each participant, separated by 6 months each time, for a total study duration of 2 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants will have Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. Participants will be recruited in 4 groups, thus: Progressive supranuclear Palsy; Multiple System Atrophy; Parkinson's Disease; and Normal controls without neurological disease. Inclusion criteria for each group will be absed on published clinical diagnostic criteria. Comparisons between the included groups will be conducted of short interval cortical inhibition and motor evoked potential resposes to theta burst stimulation between patients in different diagnostic entities.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is an idiopathic, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease for which there is currently no diagnostic test or any disease modifying treatment. It is caused by an accumulation of mictotubule associated tau protein in the basal ganglia, midbrain and cortical regions. There is selective loss of inhibitory interneurones and corticocortical projections leading to frontal atrophy which may correlate with the motor and cognitive disabilities. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is capable of inducing action potentials in cortical neurones, and provides the capacity to measure cortical neuronal excitabilityand interneuronal function. Preliminary data shows this may be a method for measuring neuronal function in PSP, which may enable its use as a biomarker. The intention of this study is to determine if these measure ments are able to distinguish PSP from other parkinsonian syndromes with similar clinical features, and if these measurements correlate with advancing clinical features over time.</summary>
