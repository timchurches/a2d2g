  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Continued opioid use - Subjects will be recruited to the study from October 2015 to March 2016, prior to their elective surgical procedure. All subjects will be contacted by investigators at 90 days post-surgery. At this point, they will be asked questions regarding their current analgesic use. This will enable us to calculate the prevalence of continued opioid use at =90 days post-surgery. Data collection will be complete by June 2016.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days post-surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain scores (score/10) - Subjects will be recruited to the study from October 2015 to March 2016, prior to their elective surgical procedure. All subjects will be contacted by investigators at 90 days post-surgery. At this point, they will be asked questions regarding their current pain scores out of 10. Data collection will be complete by June 2016.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days post-surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of pre-operative potential predictors of delayed opioid cessation - Subjects will be recruited to the study from October 2015 to March 2016, prior to their elective surgical procedure. Subjects will complete a single questionnaire prior to surgery which will collect data including their age, sex, operation type, pre-operative opioid use, depression traits, anxiety traits, addictive traits, perceived susceptibility to addiction, average hours of sleep per night, history of chronic pain, and perceived general health.
The investigators will compare subjects with and without delayed opioid cessation to see which questionnaire items were able to independently predict continued opioid use &gt;90 days post-surgery. Data collection will be complete by June 2016.</outcome>

    <summary>Post-surgical opioid prescribing intended for the short-term management of acute pain may
      lead to long-term opioid use, and its associated harms. This study was undertaken to
      determine the prevalence of prolonged post-surgical opioid use, and patient-related factors
      associated with prolonged post-surgical opioid use.</summary>
