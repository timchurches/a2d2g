  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomized trial of 6 lessons of Internet based education for people who meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for social phobia.  One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days (each lesson will involve homework, an online discussion forum assignment, email contact with clinicians, and an online reading assignment, requiring up to 4 hours/week) vs wait-list control.  Study questionnaires will be administered at application, beginning of the first lesson, 1-week poststudy, and 6 months follow-up.  The educational materials are based on the Clinical Management and Treatment Education (CLIMATE) Social Phobia Course, which applies cognitive behavioural techniques.  Once Education Group participants have completed the 6 lessons the Wait-List group participants will begin the lessons.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will examine the efficacy of an Internet based education program for improving the mental health of people with social phobia.  Participants will be recruited via a website developed for this Program (www.shyness.tv), and a structured diagnostic interview via telephone.  Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to an active Education Group, or Wait-List Control Group.  Participants will complete six lessons of CBT based education delivered via the Internet and weekly emails from a clinician, weekly homework, and weekly contact with other participants via an online discussion board.  Participants will be assessed at application, prestudy, one week poststudy, and 6 months poststudy.  Once the Education Group have completed the lessons the Control Group will be given access to the lessons.</summary>
