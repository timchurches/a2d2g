  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of combination treatment with
      VX-222 and telaprevir administered for 12 weeks with and without peginterferon-alfa-2a and/or
      ribavirin. The subjects enrolled in this study are chronically infected with hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) genotype 1 and will not have previously received treatment for their HCV
      infection.

      This study will include an Investigational Phase and Extension Phase. These phases will
      contain a Treatment Period and a Follow-up Period. All subjects will be enrolled in the
      Investigational Phase of this study. Subjects who fail treatment during the Investigational
      Phase will have the option to enter the Extension Phase at which point they will be eligible
      to receive peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for a total of 48 weeks.

      Based on an evaluation of on-treatment safety, pharmacokinetic and antiviral data from
      patients in each arm of the trial, Vertex may elect to enroll up to two additional treatment
      arms (Treatment Arm E and Treatment Arm F) that will evaluate telaprevir/VX-222-based
      combination therapy. The components of the treatment regimens of these arms will be selected
      based on clinical data that emerges from the four initially-studied regimens. If enacted, up
      to 25 patients are expected to enroll in each additional treatment arm.

      If Treatment Arm E or Treatment Arm F is discontinued subjects meeting certain criteria will
      have the option to enter a telaprevir-containing Rollover Phase. Subjects who do not meet the
      eligibility criteria to enter the Rollover Phase may elect to enter the Extension Phase.</summary>
