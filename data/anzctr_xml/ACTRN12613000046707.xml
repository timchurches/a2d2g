  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve inflammation based pharmacotherapy targeted to markers of airway and systemic inflammation. The treatment decisions will be informed using a treatment decision algorithm. Both groups will be treated for 6 months. In the intervention group, neutrophilic inflammation (sputum neutrophils &gt;age correlated absolute) will be treated with oral tablet of azithromycin 250mg daily for 6 months. Systemic inflammation (hs-CRP&gt;3mg/l or WCC&gt;9x10 (9)/L) will be treated with oral tablet of rosuvastatin 20mg nocte for 6 months. Eosinophilic inflammation will be treated with daily oral tablet of Prednisolone 15mg for 4 weeks and then 5mg for 20 weeks. In the case of a combination of inflammatory processes, participants will be prescribed a combination of treatments according to the algorithm. If the inflammatory process is not detected, the targeted active treatment will be substituted with a matching placebo. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care defined by the GOLD treatment recommendations and matching placebo 1 twice daily (bd).  A random selection of 25% of participants in the control group will also receive a placebo tablet to match the Oral Corticosteroid (OCS) in the intervention group, in addition to their 1 bd placebo tablets. This proportion is determined based on our stable estimates of the prevalence of sputum eosinophilia in this population.  With this treatment regimen, participants in both groups will receive 1 tablet each morning and night and 1 in 4 participants will receive an additional tablet each morning. Placebo tablets will be of identical appearance to the active medications, and formulated by an approved compounding chemist.  The comparison will be the package of targeted treatment compared to control, not individual treatment comparisons.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using two-sided tests with p values &lt;0.05 considered significant.  The proportion experiencing a clinically important difference will be compared using the Chi square test at the end of treatment.  Analysis of covariance will be conducted on end of treatment quality of life variables with adjustment for baseline values.  Continuous variables will be analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) with a random intercept for individuals to account for the repeated measurements on individuals. The difference in exacerbation rate between the two groups will be compared using a Poisson regression model. The time to first asthma exacerbation will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier plots and a log-rank test, with analysis of instantaneous risk described using a Cox proportional hazards model. The proportion of participants with one or more exacerbations will be compared using a Chi square test. The institutes statistician will supervise these analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In previous research, we have shown that patients with COPD continue to suffer multiple clinical problems despite tertiary based care.  Both airway inflammation (swelling in the airways) (74%), and general body inflammation (60%) are common problems and can lead to other diseases. We have also demonstrated that quality of life impairment escalates as the number of clinical problems increases and that reducing these problems, including airway and general body inflammation, significantly improves health status.  We have now developed a novel integrated treatment algorithm that addresses the inflammatory components of the disease. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of this treatment decision algorithm in the management of COPD on the outcomes of quality of life and exacerbations. We will compare this approach to placebo treatment.

We hypothesise, in patients with COPD, that individualised anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy will significantly improve quality of life and lengthen the time to COPD exacerbation.

We will also examine whether a panel of protein biomarkers are associated with treatment response and airway inflammation.</summary>
