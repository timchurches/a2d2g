  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mirena use for 4 to 6 years. The Mirena intrauterine device (IUD) is a long acting contraceptive, an effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding and is approved for use with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to provide endometrial protection. This T-shaped plastic device is placed within the uterus and releases the progestagen levonorgestrel into the uterine cavity with some absorption of levonorgestrel into the systemic circulation. Each device is registered for use as a contraceptive for up to 5 years and for control of menstrual bleeding it can be used for as long as it is effective. It can be replaced at the end of that time. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation: Given a baseline value of 800 mg/cm2, an additional 0.5% decrease per year over four years of Mirena® use would be represented by a 16 mg/cm2 difference between the two groups.  The standard deviation of BMD is estimated to be 47 mg/cm2, but around 75% of the variation in BMD is expected to be explainable by factors that we would be able to match on or adjust for, including age, smoking, BMI, parity, caffeine and calcium intake, contraceptive history, history of previous fracture, family history of osteoporosis (18). With this matching, 34 participants per group would be sufficient to provide 80% power to detect a 16 mg/cm2 difference in mean BMD with two-sided p&lt;0.05 indicating statistical significance. 
Statistical Analysis:
Matched demographics, health characteristics, behaviours, and dietary measures were described and then compared between groups using exact symmetry tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests as appropriate.
Linear mixed models were used to compare groups in terms of BMD and z-score outcomes incorporating the matching at the individual level through a random effect for matched pairs. The adjusted models each included all variables with p&lt;0.25 or that altered the effect size of interest by 15% or more from models otherwise only including group.  These potential (residual) confounders were selected from: 
age, BMI, smoking history, parity, total activity, and dietary measures (milk, bread, hard cheese and yoghurt). Subgroup analyses were undertaken for those pairs whose duration of Mirena® use was 4-6 years (removing 5 pairs) and a sensitivity analysis was performed restricted to only those pairs using the same DEXA scanner (removing 4 pairs).

    <summary>Objective: To determine if the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system Mirena® affects bone mineral density (BMD).     
Design: Cross-sectional study 
Setting: Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago
Patients: BMD was compared between women aged 30 to 47 who had a current Mirena® inserted for 4 to 6 years and matched (age, BMI, smoking, and ethnicity) controls who had not been exposed to exogenous hormones or pregnancy for the previous 5 years.
Interventions: BMD was measured by double xray absorptiometry (DEXA) of the lumbar spine and proximal femur.  
Main outcome measures: BMD of the lumbar spine and proximal femur. BMD z-scores were also recorded. Mixed models were used to estimate effects of Mirena® use with a random pair effect to accommodate the clustered design.  Potential confounders were parity, gravidity, physical activity as well as matching variables that altered the effect by 15% or more.
