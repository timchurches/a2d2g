      <outcome>Clinical complaint of urine loss  was assessed by  a voiding diary of 24 hours and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). To assess the  satisfaction with treatment  it was used subjective evaluation for clinical complaints and satisfaction with treatment, in which the patient reported to be cured, or better and  satisfied with treatment (not requiring other therapy), or better although not satisfied with the treatment (seeking alternative therapy), or unchanged.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study was to compare the effects of the treatment with intravaginal electro stimulation and with posterior tibial nerve electro stimulation in the life quality and complaints of urinary loss in women with overactive bladder. Method: It was constituted a sample that included 42 patients with overactive bladder or mixed urinary incontinence for treatment either by intravaginal electro stimulation or by the posterior tibial nerve electro stimulation. To assess the quality of life (QOL) questionnaire was used a generic quality life, the SF-36, and a questionnaire of quality specific to IU, the I-QOL. The reports of urinary loss and incommodious caused by the same respectively were evaluated by the voiding of 24 hours daily, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The treatment was carried out once a week, totalling twelve weeks. Result: The group that received posterior tibial nerve electro stimulation had significant improvement in three domains of the I-QOL, in VAS (p = 0.03), and four aspects of the miccional diary. For the group of intravaginal electro stimulation there was significant improvement in two domains of the SF-36, three domains of the I-QOL, in VAS (p &lt;0.01) and four aspects of the miccional diary. The comparison of the two groups, after treatment didnt reveal significant difference in any of the variables. Conclusion: There was improvements of the life quality by the use of the two treatment types, as well as a decrease of the complaints of urinary loss, however the group that received intravaginal electro stimulation obtained improvement in the scores in two domains of the generic questionnaire of life quality after the treatment, what didn't happen with the other group treatment.</summary>
