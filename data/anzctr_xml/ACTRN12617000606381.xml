    <interventions>The primary aim of the study is to describe and quantify the multi-faceted inter-relationship between a diverse manifestation of impaired sleep and individual variations in physical activity, daytime cognitive function, emotional well-being and other lifestyle characteristics following 'adjunctive' treatments for sleep quality and sleep rhythm maintenance.  For the study's purpose, adjunctive treatments refer to a broad range of environmental modification, physical activity, sedatives, exogenous hormonal replacements, dietary supplements and/or emerging trend of adjunctive Complementary Medicine modalities in addition to conventional medical treatments.

The study is a prospective multi-centre community-based survey of selected Eastern Australian rural and urban centres using stratified sampling to implement matched case-control study over a period of five-years.  The source population includes the major rural centres of the Northern NSW (inclusive of Lismore and its outlying districts such as Byron Bay, Lennox Head and Ballina), the Central East Coast NSW (inclusive of Grafton and Maclean), and the urban centres of metropolitan Brisbane and Sydney.

Participants will be enrolled over a period of two years then stratified according to impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s) and studied via confidential de-identified questionnaire-based survey supplemented by physician assessment of general health and phone interviews over a five-year period.   Each participant will be assessed for their exposure to risk factors of impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s), pattern of health care utilisation, pattern and quality of sleep, persistence and/or development of bodily symptom(s) such as pain, tiredness and fatigability in addition to task-specific cognitive impairment and emotional well-being at 0, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of the study participation.

At each data collection period, specific case report forms (CRF) will be completed and data recorded for statistical analysis. These include demographics and medical history review, measurement of blood pressure, weight, height and lung function including gas transfer DLCO using the gasless MiniBox system, assessment of current cognitive ability including Clock-Drawing Test (CDT), Sleep Timing Questionnaire (STQ), ESS (Epworth Sleepiness Score), ISI (Insomnia Severity Index), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire, Short form McGill Pain Score (SF-MPQ), Short form SF-12 Questionnaire (SF-12), Generalised Anxiety Depression (GAD7), State-Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and narrative description of self-reported symptoms of impaired sleep and well-being.

Participants are free to participate and/or withdraw at any time of the study.  There will be no adverse effect on the quality of their medical care whether they are actively participating in the research study.  The study participation is completely voluntary and no payments will be made to the participants. There is a negligible risk to participate in the research study as there is no intervention involving any additional medication, counselling or adjunctive medical therapy.  All relevant clinical information is de-identified to protect confidentiality and privacy then securely stored for population-based statistical analysis.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation and statistical assumptions:
The estimated prevalence of insomnia is between 13 to 33% of the adult population in Australia, although actual prevalence would be higher given the current epidemiological trend in increasing body adiposity, advanced age and chronic diseases.  By contrast, chronic bodily pain (CBP) affects up to one in five adults and a higher prevalence of one in third for those aged 65 or greater. The estimated prevalence of insomnia or excessive sleepiness associated with CBP and/or chronic disease is yet undefined in regional Australia.

Relevant to the exposure to adjunctive treatment to impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s) is ill-defined in the published literature.  However, it is estimated that up to 85% of primary care population have either used or using some form of Complementary Medicine modalities for a broad range of health issues.  Therefore, the possibility of selection bias from disproportionately low prevalence of exposure to adjunctive treatment is negligible for the study.  

Given the published prevalence of insomnia or sleepiness and CBP in the unexposed group of 33% and a lower minimum prevalence in the exposed of 13% with ratio of sample size in unexposed to exposed of 1, the minimum sample size needed for each group to demonstrate statistically significant differences between the exposed versus unexposed group ranges from 68 (Fleiss) to 77 (Fleiss with continuity correction) individuals per group.  This assumes the confidence interval at 0.05, power of 0.80 and a minimum odds ratio of 0.3.  If a greater odds ratio of 2 or more is expected, then each group sample size will range from 137 (Fleiss) to 149 (Fleiss with continuity correction).

For the prospective population-based study, a representative sample up to 1,000 people will be interviewed and studied over a five-year period: 200 participants from the Lismore Health Services District, 200 participants from the Clarence Valley Health Services District, 200 participants from metropolitan Sydney, 200 participants from metropolitan Brisbane, and 200 participants from the Northern Rivers-Brisbane-Sydney study base population with regular exposure to adjunctive treatment for impaired sleep and/or chronic bodily symptom(s).  The recruitment of study participants will adjust for the potential loss of follow up with a response rate of at least 85% which is a reasonable estimated rate of a dedicated community-based survey using stratified sampling methodology.  Potential loss of follow up is minimised through direct face-to-face interview with informed consent, simplified questionnaire design and phone follow up.  Non-responders will be analysed to outline the differences between responders and non-responders within the study duration.

Overview of Statistical Analysis:
Descriptive statistics will summarise the quantitative descriptions of the study population for the longitudinal observational cohort study.  Univariate analysis will examine each of the important symptom variables of pain, sleep and physiological sleep data for the observed differences in the distribution, central tendency and dispersion. Descriptive statistics will summarise the quantitative descriptions of the study population according to the predictors of interest (POI) in the group of individuals exposed to diverse treatment modalities versus those individuals unexposed to diverse treatment modalities. 

Confounding variables include the effect of age, gender and medical comorbidity, which are adjusted in participant stratification at the commencement of the study.  Accordingly, group matching and analysis according to age, gender and exposure to adjunctive treatment will be performed to minimise the effects of confounding. In addition to identifying predictors of clinically important outcomes, estimated case prevalence, disease interrelationships and adjusted odds ratio will be calculated using the traditional case-control study design technique.  Herein, the prevalent case refers to those participants who are exposed to either medical treatments alone or adjunctive treatment in addition to medical treatment for impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s).

It is possible that either of the exposed or unexposed group to adjunctive treatments for impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s) will cross-over to another group over the five-year period of the prospective population study. Based on the two-group post-test randomised experimental model, the measured differences between the means of the specific measured outcomes will be analysed via unpaired T-test or one-way ANOVA assuming the two crossover treatment sequences with a two-sided significance level (1-alpha) of 95%, power (1-beta, % chance of detecting) of 80%, a minimum drop-out threshold rate of 10%, 1:1 ratio of sample size between unexposed and exposed, percentage of unexposed with outcome at 5% and percentage of exposed with outcome at 33%. 

Inferential statistics will be utilised to derive objective conclusion of the entire study population using multivariate analysis and general linear model: t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and weighted Cox proportional hazards regression model.  Multivariate analysis using unpaired logistic regression will be used if a specific subgroup is matched, or paired logistic regression if the subgroup is unmatched according to age, gender and exposure to adjunctive treatment.  The true effect size (t-value) will be calculated for the study population from the ratio of the differences between the group means and the variability of groups and applied to inferential statistics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increasingly recognised within the clinical disciplines of Medicine and Public Heath over the past four decades, dysfunctional sleep continues to impose incremental costs to the community due to declining quality of life and vocational productivity.  The adverse effects of sleepiness and sleeplessness are confounded by the associated burden of co-existing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as chronic pain, obesity, diabetes, obstructive sleep apnoea and obstructive coronary artery disease. 

The primary aim of the Eastern Australian Sleep and Health Livingness Study is to describe and quantify the multi-faceted interrelationship between the diverse manifestation of impaired sleep and individual variations in physical activity, daytime cognitive function, emotional well-being and other lifestyle characteristics following adjunctive treatments for sleep rhythm maintenance.  Adjunctive treatments include a broad range of environmental modification, physical activity, sedatives, exogenous hormonal replacements, dietary supplements and/or emerging trend of adjunctive Complementary Medicine modalities in addition to conventional medical treatments.

The study is a prospective observational cohort study of adults in Eastern Australian rural and urban centres who report of impaired sleep with or without chronic bodily symptom(s).  Interviewer-assisted survey and stratified sampling over a five-year period will stratified participants into case-control study for their exposure to important risk factors of impaired sleep and/or chronic bodily symptoms, pattern of health care utilisation, pattern and quality of sleep, persistence and/or development of bodily symptoms such as pain(s), tiredness and fatigability in addition to task-specific cognitive impairment and emotional well-being.

The matched case-control study design of comparison of participants living in rural and urban centres offers an efficient method of testing the study hypotheses within a relatively shorter period of follow up time.  It also allows testing of multiple study outcomes, different case-control scenario such as patterns of health care utilisation, calculation of time-dependent or exposure-dependent risk and minimise selection bias as compared to a large-scale population study which is most costly to implement. The currently available estimated prevalence of impaired sleep, chronic bodily symptom(s) and adjunctive treatment is significant to reduce potential bias of risk factor exposure.  

Given the etiological importance of regular physical activity and adverse lifestyle factors, the study will confirm supportive sleep rhythm(s) is/are represented by a consistent pattern(s) of livingness which is readily identifiable and reproducible.  The implication of the study proposes the reorientation of our Public Health policy in practical lifestyle modification which are necessary in improving productivity and preventing the long-term complications of sleep-related disorders. </summary>
