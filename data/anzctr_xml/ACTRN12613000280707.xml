  <interventions>
    <interventions>Preterm Group
Infants will be assessed at 4 time-points:
1.	At 30 weeks of age, while the infant is still in the nursery we will carry out the following:
-clinical and medical information will be collected from the infant's chart
-A General Movements Assessment (GMs) which involves video of spontaneous movements in their incubator or cot (up to 1 hour of video; no handling of the baby)   
-A neurological/neurobehavioural assessment (15-20 minutes; involves a small amount of handling)
-A brain scan (MRI) using MRI compatible incubator which takes about an hour (20 minutes preparation and 40 minutes in the scanner). Infant is fed, wrapped and asleep during the scan, with no sedation used.

2.	At 40 weeks which is term equivalent age; if the infant has returned home the family will be asked to visit the hospital. We will complete:
- A General Movements Assessment (GMs) which involves video of spontaneous movements (up to 1 hour of video; no handling of the baby)  
-Movement assessments and a neurological assessment (30-40 minutes)
-Assessment of their visual functions (5 minutes)
-A brain scan (MRI) using MRI compatible incubator which takes about an hour (20 minutes preparation and 40 minutes in the scanner). Infant is fed, wrapped and asleep during the scan, with no sedation used.
-A recording of their brains electrical activity (EEG; 30 minutes preparation and 30 minutes recording).

3.	At 12 weeks corrected age (3 months after term); the research team will visit the family at home and:
- GMs assessment (video the babys spontaneous movements for 5-15 minutes)
- Perform a movement assessment (40 minutes)
- Assess their visual function (5 minutes)

4.	At 12 months corrected age; we will ask the family to visit the hospital:
- A paediatrician will assess the babys general development (30 minutes)
- We will perform movement assessments (1 1/2 hours)</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Prechtl's method on the qualitative assessment of general movements.
The flow and spontaneity of movement from the infant will be correlated with neurological health scores from the EEG, MRI and Dubowitz neurological assessment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The General Movement's Assessment will be performed by scoring video recordings of the infant's spontaneous movements at 30 weeks PMA, 40 weeks PMA, and 3 months CA.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Electrophysiology.
EEG recordings will be obtained from all infants. A quantitative assessment of the EEG will be performed, including coherence analysis and spectral analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The EEG will be performed at term equivalent age (40 weeks post menstrual age) in both the preterm and term reference groups.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Neurological assessment
The Dubowitz neurological assessment assesses posture and tone, reflexes, movements and neurobehavioural responses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Dubowitz assessment will be performed at 30 and 40 weeks PMA in the preterm group, and at term in the reference group.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale (NNNS) is designed to provide information relating to an infants development, behavioural maturation, central nervous system integrity and stress responses (Lester and Tronick 2004).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The NNNS will be performed at 30 and 40 weeks PMA in the preterm group, and at term in the reference group.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP)
The test assesses the postural and selective control of movement needed for functional motor performance in early infancy.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Medical Assessment
Infants in this study will be independently assessed by a paediatrician experienced in infant development.   The purpose of this assessment is to discriminate which infants are developing typically from those who are not, and to confirm diagnoses of CP or not CP (Badawi 1998).   In cases of CP, motor type and distribution will be recorded, and severity established through classification with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).   Any additional medical diagnoses that have been made by this stage will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infants in the preterm group will undergo this medical assessment at 12 months corrected age.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of Motor and neurodevelopmental outcome:
1. Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III (Bayley III- a discriminative tool designed to assess cognitive, language and motor development).
2. Neurosensory Motor Developmental Assessment (NSMDA- examines gross and fine motor performance, neurological status, posture, balance and response to sensory input).
3. Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS- tests gross motor skills through the components of weight bearing, posture and anti-gravity movements).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Infants in the preterm group will have these assessments at 12 months corrected age.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infants born prematurely (&lt; 30 weeks gestational age) have a higher risk of developing cerebral palsy than infants born at term, due to immaturity of the developing brain at birth, and potential brain injuries that can occur in the neonatal period. Cerebral palsy is frequently not diagnosed till the second year of life, delaying the start of early intervention treatments which may be of benefit in minimising functional limitations and providing key family supports. To date magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term equivalent age and general movement assessment provide the most accurate prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome at 12 months corrected age.

This project aims to investigate the relationship between earlier brain MRI and neuromotor/neurobehavioural assessments at 30 weeks gestational age, and their ability to predict outcomes of cerebral palsy and motor difficulties at 3 and 12 months corrected age.

We aim to achieve this in a longitudinal prospective cohort study of 80 infants born at less than 30 weeks gestational age, at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital. Infants will undergo a brain MRI scan at 30 and 40 weeks gestational age to develop our understanding of very early brain structure at 30 weeks; and maturation that occurs between 30 and 40 weeks gestational age. A combination of neurological (Dubowitz neurological assessment), neuromotor (General Movements, Test of Infant Motor Performance, visual functions) and neurobehavioural assessments (the NICU Network Neurobehavioural Scale) will be performed at 30 and 40 weeks GA to understand the relationship between brain structure and function. These data will be compared to motor assessments at 12 weeks post term and 12 months corrected age. These data will be compared to outcomes at 12 months CA including a developmental assessment by a paediatrician (Bayley scales of Infant and Toddler Development), motor assessments (Alberta Infant Motor Scale, Neurosensory Motor Developmental Assessment) to differentiate atypical development (including cerebral palsy and/or motor delay). 

At a time of increasing demand on health care resources, reliable ways of predicting neurodevelopmental outcome in premature infants is desirable to determine those that may benefit most from early intervention.</summary>
