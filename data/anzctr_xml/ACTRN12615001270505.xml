  <interventions>
    <interventions>One group will receive spine and general physical conditioning exercise (including muscle strengthening, improving endurance, improving posture control and balance) over the course of 6 months.
Brief description of each component of the intervention:
a) what it involves
This protocol includes:
1) progressive resistance training
2) proprioceptive training
3) imagery/visualisations of pain provoking activities and/or movements
4) stretching exercises

b) how it is administered
Individual and/or small group sessions with clinical exercise physiologist and/or student

c) the frequency and duration of sessions
Week 1-12: Two supervised sessions per week, 1 hour duration
Week 13-26: One to two supervised sessions per week, 1 hour duration

d) any strategies used to monitor adherence to the intervention if applicable
Exercise diary for home exercises

e) home exercise program
In the first two weeks of the program, the Exercise Physiologist will determine the appropriate intensity of the home exercise protocol. From the third week onwards up until the end of the 6 month intervention period, the home exercise program will consist of:
1) aerobic exercise for 20 minutes, progressing to 40 minutes at 65-85% HRmax by the end of the program. Up to three occasions per week.
2) imagery rehearsal of tasks practiced with the trainer during the supervised exercise training sessions. The participant will be expected to do this once daily.
</interventions>
    <comparator>One group will receive manual therapy (physiotherapists do this to reduce pain and muscle spasm) and muscle control treatment (training of the stomach and back muscles) at a physiotherapy centre over the course of 6 months. 
a) what it involves
Manual therapy and motor control training.

The motor control program will include a number of components.  Specific muscle activation of transverses abdominis, lumbar multifidus and the pelvic floor will aim to facilitate maintenance of a tonic and automatic contraction at less than 30% of maximum voluntary contraction in daily activities. In most cases, this will require initial training in non-weight bearing positions (e.g. side lying) progressing to functional activities (e.g. walking, lifting).  In addition there will be strength training of the global muscles of the spine integrated with specific muscle activation.  Functional retraining of normal lumbo-pelvic kinematics will also be used during functional exercise.

Manual therapy will utilise a clinical reasoning process summarised as generation of preliminary hypotheses regarding the nature of the low back problem, provision of manual therapy individualised to this problem, reassessment of key assessment findings following manual therapy and re-evaluation of hypotheses.  Manual therapy techniques will include posterior-anterior, transverse and rotation mobilisation as well as rotation manipulation.

b) how it is administered
Individual sessions with a physiotherapist

c) the frequency and duration of sessions
12 half hour treatment sessions over 6 months with a home exercise program

d) any strategies used to monitor adherence if applicable.
Exercise diary for home exercises

Home exercise program: All exercise will be conducted outside of the clinic and checked by the treating physiotherapist for compliance and technique at each treatment sessions.  A range of specific muscle activation strategies will be used including lower abdominal drawing in manoeuvre, lifting of the pelvic floor muscles or swelling of lumbar multifidus.  Specific muscle activation will commence in non-weight bearing positions with a dosage of 4/day, 5 x 5 seconds (depending on level of specific muscle activation control) progressing to 5 x 10 seconds.  This dosage will be continued from non-weight bearing into standing.  The first functional progression will be to walking 4/day for 2 minutes with 10 seconds on/off of specific muscle activation progressing to tonic activation.  Functional exercise will then progress dependent on the functional goals of of the patient.</comparator>

      <outcome>trunk extensor endurance time. 
Trunk extensor endurance test: the subject lies on their stomach (prone position) and the Hart Sport cushion is placed under their lower stomach such that the belly button is below the top border of the cushion. The subject should be able to balance on the cushion with their legs and trunk off the ground. Arms on the side (not touching ground).  The subject then raises their chest (sternum) and legs off the floor. Subject to lift their chest as high off the ground as possible. The subject is to keep their neck bent forward (flexion). Every 30 seconds feedback is given on how long the position has been held for. Every 30 seconds also, the operator checks subject body alignment and asks the subject to reposition if necessary. The time to fatigue (in seconds) is recorded.</outcome>

      <outcome>VO2 max.
Protocol: Peak aerobic power will be assessed using a symptom limited graded exercise test on a motorised treadmill. Participants warm-up at a comfortable walking pace at 0% gradient and speed adjusted gradually until Ratings of Perceived Exertion (6-20 Borg point scale; RPE) of 8 / 20 is achieved. The gradient will be increased by 2% per minute until the participant subjectively reports a 17/20 (very hard) on the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (RPEpeak = 17). Expired respiratory gases will be collected through a breath by breath pneumotach system. Pulse oximetry will be recorded each minute. Pre exercise and post exercise blood pressure will be taken.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study to gain initial data for understanding how treatments of chronic pain in the lower back work. Subjects will be randomised to one of two treatment groups. One group will receive manual therapy (physiotherapists do this to reduce pain and muscle spasm) and muscle control treatment (training of the stomach and back muscles to activate when they should) at a physiotherapy centre (Advance Healthcare) over the course of 6 months. Another group will receive spine and general physical conditioning exercise (including muscle strengthening, improving endurance, improving posture control and balance) at Deakin University over the course of 6 months. To assess the response to the different treatment protocols, magnetic resonance imaging scanning, tests of muscle strength, performance and endurance, dual x-ray absorptiometry scan of the lumbar spine and whole body composition, a series of questionnaires, and the assessment of how muscle activation occurs in the brain will be performed. Each of these tests will be done three times: at the start of the study before randomisation, then after 3 months and then at the end of the study at 6 months. Subjects will also complete a short questionnaire every two weeks to monitor their progress.</summary>
