  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to determine the degree to which maternal diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTap) vaccine in pregnancy affects Australian infants humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to routine immunisations given at 6 weeks, 4, 6, 12 and 18 months of age.

We will document whether the mother has had the Pertussis vaccine in pregnancy and the date this occurred but we will not be giving this vaccine as part of this study.

All routine childhood vaccinations will be administered to the infant by immunisation certified nurses during the course of this study. 

Blood samples will be taken as follows: maternal blood at visit 1 (6 to =10 weeks post-partum) and visit 2 (18 to &lt;19 months post-partum).  Infant blood at visit 1 (6 to =10 weeks of age), visit 4 (28 to 42 days post-visit 3), visit 6 (18 to &lt;19 months) and visit 7 (28 to 42 days post-visit 6).  Nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected from infants at visit 4 (28 to 42 days post-visit 3), visit 5 (12 to &lt;14 months) and visit 7 (28 to 42 days post-visit 6). 

 In addition, with parental consent a sample from the infant participants newborn screening blood test (also known as the Guthrie Test) will be requested from the local newborn screening program laboratories and will be used to measure pertussis IgG levels at birth.</interventions>
    <comparator>We will enrol a cohort of infants whose mothers have either received no vaccination or their first dTap vaccine or subsequent dTap boosters during pregnancy and compare their infants antibody responses, pneumococcal carriage as a marker of vaccine efficacy, persistence of antibody and cell-mediated immunity, and frequency of local reactions following their routine immunisations at 6 weeks, 4, 6, 12 and 18 months of age.

    <statisticalmethods>In order to have 80% power to detect (at p&lt;0.05) a reduction of 20% in post-vaccination pertussis toxin GMC from 47.9 µg/ml (previously observed where there was no maternal immunisation), a sample size of 96 per group is required (please note there will be 4 groups of mother and infant pairs). This assumes a log antibody concentration standard deviation of 0.55 µg/ml, which was observed in the previous study.  Reductions associated with maternal immunisation of &gt;25% in pertussis antigen GMCs were observed previously, so a group size of N=96 in the current study will be more than adequately powered to detect effects of a similar size. To allow for participant drop-outs, we will recruit 100 subjects /group.   Overall, as we are recruiting 4 groups, there will be 400 healthy term infants and their mothers enrolled in the study.

Antibody titres will be log transformed and Geometric mean concentrations/ titres calculated with 95% confidence intervals. The principal analyses of immunogenicity will be based on t-tests (GMCs/GMTs) and chi-square tests (% seroprotected; % large local reactions) where appropriate between maternally vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. Further analyses examining the association of different factors such as type of vaccine, site, maternal gestation at time of vaccination, parity, gender, age with antibody responses will use multiple regression methods: linear when IgG response, logistic model when proportions of infants with protective titres is the response. Maternal antibody responses will be correlated with infant antibody responses using Spearmans rank correlation co-efficient.

The analysis of safety data will be primarily descriptive in nature.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bordetella pertussis is bacteria infecting the respiratory tract and leading to a range of symptoms from mild cough, to clinically typical whooping cough, to death. Antibiotic treatment is ineffective after the cough develops, so prevention by effective vaccines is essential to protect the most vulnerable.
  
 Maternal pertussis (whooping cough) immunisation is an effective way of reducing severe disease in young infants. In Australia, vaccinating pregnant mothers with adult formulation diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (dTap) is recommended for every pregnancy with ~50% uptake.  However, dTap is not licensed for use in pregnancy and in a number of countries it has been found that infants whose mothers received pertussis immunisation during pregnancy had lower antibody responses to their infant vaccinations, although they remain protected.  It is not known how long maternal immunity lasts after immunisation in pregnancy or if repeated doses have any effect on infant vaccine responses.
  
 This study involving 400 mothers and babies (mother and infant pairs) will be conducted in Western Australian and New South Wales.  It will evaluate maternal immunity and the effect of pertussis vaccination in pregnancy on infant antibody responses to the routine vaccinations given at 6 weeks and 4, 6, 12 and 18 months of age.
  
 Infants will have a blood sample at 6 to10 weeks of age prior to their routine infant vaccines, Infanrix-hexa (DTaP-IPB-HBV/Hib), Prevenar13 (PCV13) and rotavirus vaccine with subsequent doses at 4 and 6 months of age. Blood samples will also be taken at 7 months, 18 months and 19 months of age to measure antibody responses to pertussis antigens, diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV13.  Responses will be compared between children whose mothers received a pertussis vaccine during pregnancy with those whose mothers were not vaccinated.   We will also evaluate the frequency of local and generalised reactions to vaccination and the development of allergies, eczema and asthma.
  Infant participants will have a swab collected from the inside of their nose (nasal swab) at 7, 12 and 19 months of age

 Mothers will have their blood collected to measure their antibody levels 6 weeks and 18 months after giving birth.  Responses will be compared between mothers who received a pertussis vaccine during pregnancy with who were not vaccinated.  We will also compare antibody responses between mothers who received their first pertussis immunisation during pregnancy with those who received their second or subsequent dose.
  
 This study will provide important information to inform providers, parents and national policy and will be relevant to other countries using maternal pertussis immunisation and potentially future vaccine development. </summary>
