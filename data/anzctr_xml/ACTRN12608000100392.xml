    <concealment>Subjects were recruited when they attended a two week post-operative follow-up clinic.  They were recruited by a research assistant who gave out a patient information sheet and consent form as approved by the Sydney South West Area Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee.  Consenting patients then underwent the initial assessment.  Following this assessment they were randomly allocated to either a land or water-based exercise program by means of consecutively numbered concealed envelopes.</concealment>
