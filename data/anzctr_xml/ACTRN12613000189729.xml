    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will have access to the usual care and will be asked not to change their nutritional or exercise habits during the 8-wk period. Participants in the intervention group will participate in a 8-week whole body vibration (WBV)-based program on an vertical  platform consisting of three sessions per week with at least one day between sessions. Each exercise session will have a duration of 10 to 15 minutes with a frequency (load) of the vibrating platform of 20Hz initially and progressing throughout the program up to 35 Hz and the amplitude will be of 4 mm in all sessions. Participants will stand on the platform in a semi-squat position in all exercises. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objective: To test the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of a 8-wk whole body vibration (WBV) intervention on balance and mobility among older adults with reduced mobility in a nursing home context.
Methods: Fifty older adults will be randomized 1:1 to an intervention group that, in addition to standard care, received a 8-wk WBV intervention, and a control group receiving only standard care . Outcomes, including balance, mobility and strenght or quality of life will be assessed after intervention
