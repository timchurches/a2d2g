  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) is to maintain
      suppression of viral replication to prevent the emergence of complications, which requires
      long-term therapy. Durable suppression of viral replication is achieved in the treatment of
      chronic viral diseases by preventing of the emergence of drug-resistant mutations. The
      clinical guidelines for the management of lamivudine resistant patients are variable. Some
      recommend switching to another agent without cross-resistance, while others recommend adding
      on another agent without cross-resistance. Limited clinical data exists to demonstrate
      whether tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tenofovir DF; TDF) is an effective monotherapy for
      lamivudine resistant patients or if it should be used as part of a combination therapy
      regimen.

      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of tenofovir
      DF monotherapy versus emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir DF combination therapy in participants
      with chronic HBV with lamivudine resistance (presence of the rtM204I/V mutation with or
      without the rtL180M mutation) over a 240-week period. Participants in this study must be
      receiving lamivudine treatment at the time of enrollment.</summary>
