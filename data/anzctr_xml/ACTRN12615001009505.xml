  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants will continue their NOAC during dental extractions. There is currently no standard of care and no practice guidelines regarding NOAC management around dental extractions. It is up to the individual dentist to decide whether to stop the NOAC or not.   </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether there is a difference in the blood loss following dental extractions between patients continuing NOACs and patients continuing warfarin. Bleeding amount will be defined by:
1. Weight difference of gauze required to achieve haemostasis.
2. Number of gauze required post procedure to achieve haemostasis. 
3. Time to stable blood clot formation.  
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Amount of bleeding will be assessed immediately post-extraction (Patients will be monitored for at least 1 hour post-extraction, or until bleeding stops). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether there is a difference in the rate of significant bleeding post-dental extraction between patients continuing NOACs and patients continuing warfarin. Significant bleeding will be defined as the following: 
(a) Major bleeding as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
a. Fatal bleeding, and/or
b. Bleeding that is symptomatic and occurs in a critical area or organ. For dental procedures, bleeding that threatens the airway, and/or
c. Bleeding causing a fall in haemoglobin level of 20 g/L or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of red cells, with temporal association within 24-48 h to the bleeding, and/or 
d. Surgical site bleeding that requires a second surgical intervention and results in hospitalisation, and/or
e. Surgical site bleeding that is unexpected and prolonged and/or sufficiently large to cause hemodynamic instability, as assessed by the surgeon, with an associated fall in haemoglobin level of at least 20 g/L, or transfusion of at least two units of red cells, indicated by the bleeding, with temporal association within 24 h to the bleeding. 
(b) Clinically relevant non-major bleeding
a. Bleeding that requires medical intervention by health care provider, including oral anticoagulant (OAC) discontinuation, and/or 
b. Bleeding that leads to hospitalisation or increased level of care, without requiring surgical intervention, and/or 
c. Bleeding that leads to face to face evaluation.

Participants will be contacted by phone 48 hours after dental extraction and questioned about any bleeding. If the dentist has any concerns, a face-to-face review will be arranged. Participants will be asked to inform their study dentist of any bleeding after 48 hours and within 7 days of extraction. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Data on major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding up to 7 days post-extraction will be collected.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between pre-procedure NOAC drug levels and bleeding outcomes (i.e. amount of bleeding, rates of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>NOAC drug levels will be measured on blood sample collected on the day of procedure, prior to the procedure. Amount of bleeding will be assessed immediately post-extraction. Data on major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding up to 7 days post-extraction will be collected.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether there is a safe lower limit and/or upper limit of the NOAC drug level for which dental extractions may be safely performed, by correlating pre-procedure NOAC drug levels with bleeding outcomes (i.e. amount of bleeding, rates of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding).</outcome>
      <timepoint>NOAC drug levels will be measured on blood sample collected on the day of procedure, prior to the procedure. Amount of bleeding will be assessed immediately post-extraction.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between use of chlorhexidine mouth wash prior to dental extraction and bleeding outcomes. 

Participants will be advised to use chlorhexidine mouth wash at initial appointment. Participants will be questioned about compliance with use of chlorhexidine mouth wash between initial appointment and day of extraction. This information will be correlated with bleeding outcomes (i.e. amount of bleeding, rates of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Amount of bleeding will be assessed immediately post-extraction. Data on major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding up to 7 days post-extraction will be collected.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between pre-procedure creatinine clearance and bleeding outcomes. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Creatinine level will be measured on blood sample collected on the day of procedure, prior to the procedure.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For patients on warfarin, the safety of having dental extractions while continuing to take the drug has been well established. Bleeding rates are not significantly different between patients who continue warfarin and those who temporarily discontinue warfarin for their dental extractions. Warfarin interruption for dental extractions has been associated with a 1% risk of blood clots, which can be fatal. International and local guidelines therefore recommend warfarin be continued for simple dental extractions.

There are currently no published studies to guide the management of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs, i.e. dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) around dental extractions. We hypothesise that the amount of bleeding post-extraction will be similar between patients who continue NOACs and patients who continue warfarin. By providing evidence that NOAC therapy can be safely continued for dental extractions, we believe that fewer patients will be exposed to the undue risk of developing blood clots by unnecessary interruption of anticoagulant therapy.
