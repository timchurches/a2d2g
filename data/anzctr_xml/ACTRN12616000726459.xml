Krill oil is a very safe medication, with few known side effects.  
1. Krill oil may reduce insulin sensitivity by a small amount, although whether this would be large enough to make a difference to blood sugar control in people with diabetes is not clear.  However, if the participant has diabetes, they will be advised to discuss this with the study doctor and their GP before starting the study. We will be collecting the fasting blood glucose levels at baseline and 12 weeks and any incident diagnosis will be recorded in the medications and safety questionnaire forms.

2. Krill oil is not suitable for people who already use anticoagulants (eg warfarin), high dose aspirin or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  If they are already using these medications, they will be excluded. Incident medical conditions and the use of these medications will be recorded in the medications and safety questionnaire forms.

3. Krill oil is not suitable for people who have allergies to seafood, and they will be excluded. Any incident allergic reaction will be recorded as new symptoms using the medications and safety questionnaire forms.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Visual Analog Scale knee pain scores and WOMAC scores will be analyzed using a repeated-measures mixed model with terms for age, sex, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), treatment, week, and trial center. The correlation within the repeated measures will be addressed by using an individual participant identification as a random effect. The effect of treatment will be  evaluated by the month × treatment interaction. 

Linear regression will be used to compare changes in maximal effusion size and function in univariate and multivariable modelling (if groups are not well matched at baseline) between groups using intention to treat analysis for all outcomes. Per protocol analyses will be completed for study participants consuming &gt;=80% of capsules. Significance will be p &lt; 0.05 (two tailed). Missing data will be accounted for by using propensity weighting, as appropriate.

Based on inhouse data, assuming 10mm difference between krill oil and placebo on the VAS pain scale (reduction in VAS pain scores in the placebo group by -15.5 +/- 25.5 mm over 12 weeks), 90% power, and 5% probability of type 1 error (alpha=0.05), we will need 234 participants. Adjusting for 10% loss to follow up, we need 260 participants (130 in each arm). Based on data from Tasmanian Older Adult Cohort (TASOAC) and Vitamin D Effects on Osteoarthritis (VIDEO) trial , this will give us 96% power to detect a difference in effusion size of 20% (mean 2.24cm2, SD of change 1.35). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a significant and increasing cause of pain and disability in the Australian population. So far, interventions aimed at structural modification have been disappointing. OA affects the whole joint, and inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis and joint fluid) is now recognised as a key part of OA.

Animal studies suggest that krill oil is antiinflammatory. Pilot data in humans shows that krill oil reduces knee pain and systemic inflammation after 30 days, suggesting that an approach targeted at specific mechanisms of disease may be effective for OA. However, this study was of short duration, did not collect any data on structural factors, and included patients with a variety of disorders.  Longer, larger follow up studies are required.

Aim: To compare, using a randomised, placebocontrolled doubleblind design over six months,  the efficacy of krill oil vs identical placebo to treat knee osteoarthritis (OA) (both pain and structure) in 260 patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain and effusion on imaging.

Primary hypothesis:
1) Krill oil decreases pain (assessed by 100mm VAS) by 10mm more than identical placebo over 24 weeks in patients with clinical knee OA, significant knee pain and effusions.
2) Krill oil decreases effusion size by 20% over 24 weeks in patients with symptomatic OA of the knee and knee effusion.

Significance and Innovation: If krill oil can both improve symptoms and decrease effusion in OA it has the potential to slow progression to joint replacement. The proposed study represents an innovative approach to this and lends itself to easy implementation as krill oil is already available overthecounter in Australian pharmacies.
