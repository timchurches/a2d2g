  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two study groups in this clinical study. Participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized to either the test group or the comparator group (1:1).
For the test group the participant will receive donepezil in the form of a transdermal patch (the test drug IPI-301) which will be attached to the participants back. The participant will also take a placebo comparator Aricept (donepezil) tablet. 
For the comparator group the participant will take Aricept (donepezil) tablets. The participant will also attach a placebo transdermal patch to their back. 
Participants who have been on stable treatment with oral donepezil 5mg or 10mg will be prescribed the same dose of either the test drug or the comparator during the study period.
- Participants who have been on oral donepezil 5mg before will receive a transdermal patch IPI-301 (87.5mg/25cm2) or Aricept tablet 5mg and matching placebos. 
- Participants who have been on oral donepezil 10mg will receive a transdermal patch IPI-301 (175mg/50cm2) or Aricept tablet 10mg and matching placebos. 
Participants who have not been treated with donepezil previously will receive the lower dose of investigational product (i.e., either IPI-301 (87.5mg/25cm2) or Aricept tablet 5mg and matching placebo) for 6 weeks, and then will be increased to the higher dose (i.e., IPI-301 (175mg/50cm2) or Aricept tablet 10mg and matching placebo) if they have not experienced any severe side effects. 
The whole study period lasts about 30 weeks. There will be a screening period of up to 2 weeks, treatment period of  24 weeks. During the treatment period, study visits will be performed every 6 weeks, with the end-of-treatment visit on Week 24 of treatment and one safety follow-up visit on week 28. The transdermal patch test drug or its placebo will be attached to an area on the back. The patch has to be replaced twice a week (at an interval of 3 or 4 days) before going to bed. When replacing a patch the previously attached patch has to be removed. Under circumstances where application before going to bed is not feasible, it can be done at a suitable time which then should be followed at every application of the patch. 

The participant must have a reliable caregiver who regularly contacts the participant and is available to accompany the participant for on-site visits. The caregiver must be able to oversee the participant's compliance with the study treatment, help the participant to attach and remove the patch from their back and to report on the participant's status.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator will be 5mg or 10mg Aricept (Donepezil) film-coated, round tablets or its matching placebo taken orally once daily before going to bed for 24 weeks.
