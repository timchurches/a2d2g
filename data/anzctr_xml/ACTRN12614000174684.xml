    <statisticalmethods>The length of hospital stay, reliance on oxygen and ventilatory support post recruitment will be analysed using a repeat measures one-way ANOVA, including the baseline value as a covariate. For the primary analysis the treatment effect will be considered constant over time, secondary analyses will examine the possibility of a trend over time. Plots of mean score over time will be shown for clarification. 

Initially, the treatment effect will be assumed to be constant over time, but if time by treatment interaction is shown to be important by including this parameter in the model (the conventional level of p=0.05 will be used here) then further investigation into effects at differing time points will be made by analysing the least-square means as above. Plots of mean score over time will be shown for clarification.

All other continuous measures (clinical measures, etc) will be considered in the same manner as above (adjusting by baseline value if available). Dichotomous outcomes (mortality, etc) will be presented as risk ratios, with a corresponding chi-squared test performed.

Apart from baseline value, no adjustments for covariates will be made in the first instance in any of the investigations. Treatment estimates will only be adjusted when subgroups are explored. Interaction between treatment and subgroup variables will be examined in a similar fashion as above by including the relevant parameters in the model. This will be done in turn for each subgroup variable and adjusted estimates presented.

All tests are 2-sided and results will be presented as a point estimate along with 95% confidence intervals. All analyses will be conducted by the PI and statistician at Monash University.

This study is a proof-of-principle phase 1 trial and as such a power calculation has not been performed to calculate sample size. The purpose of this trial is to determine safety of treatment as well as appropriate outcome measures that can be used to calculate power for a future phase 2 randomised controlled trial for the same intervention.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia, about one in twelve babies are born prematurely. Compared to those born at term gestation these babies, particularly those born very or extremely preterm, are at increased risk of life-threatening conditions such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. This condition represents a major challenge because, not only is it life-threatening, but also there is no specific directed treatment. Current management is essentially limited to supportive care. As such, the mortality and morbidity toll exacted by bronchopulmonary dysplasia remains challenging, to say the least.

We have recently shown that stem-like cells can be isolated from the amniotic membrane. These cells, term human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs), bear many characteristics of traditional stem cells such as pluripotency, ability to self-renew and are able to escape immune surveillance, thus avoiding immune rejection even when administered xenogeneically. In our preclinical studies, we showed that hAECs were able to prevent and rescue lung injury in animal models of adult and neonatal lung disease.

In this clinical trial, we aim to evaluate the safety of hAECs delivered intravenously to preterm babies with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 

In this trial, we will determine the following:
1.	Safety of hAECs administered intravenously to premature babies with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
2.	Effect of hAECs administration on the infants short term respiratory parameters.
