  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of temozolomide therapy in the management of aggressive pituitary tumours. Case reports have suggested that temozolomide may be efficacious in the treatment of pituitary tumours, and this needs to be tested now in a prospective controlled trial with larger patient numbers. In addition, this trial will determine whether there are molecular markers present in tumour tissue that may help predict which patients will benefit most from this therapy.</summary>
