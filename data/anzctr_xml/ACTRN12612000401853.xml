  <interventions>
    <interventions>30mL 0.5% ropivacaine with/without hyaluronidase powder 1500IU (i.e. 50IU/mL hyaluronidase) will be used for fascia iliaca compartment block. A single block fascia iliaca compartment procedure is performed approximately 30minutes before commencement of surgery. The solution is delivered to the fascia iliaca compartment (deep to the fascia iliaca and superficial to the iliacus muscle in the groin). The needle tip is directed into the correct position with ultrasound guidance.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Success of facia iliaca compartment block (success is defined as anaesthesia of 3 nerves - the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (LCNT), the femoral nerve (FN) and the obturator nerve(ON)). Anaesthesia of the LCNT is defined as reduced/absent of cold sensation to ice on the skin of the lateral aspect of the mid-thigh. Anaesthesia of the FN is defined as reduced/absent sensation to cold (using an ice cube) on the anterior aspect of the thigh AND weakness of knee extension with the hip passively flexed. ON anaesthesia is defined as &gt; 20% decrease in 'strength' of thigh adduction (baseline is determined by force measured (mmHg) when teh patients thighs squeeze a sphygmonamometer cuff which has been pre-inflated to a pressure of 40mmHg).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to investigate the effect of the drug hyaluronidase on the efficacy of ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB). Hyauluronidase is a naturally occurring enzyme that it available as a drug. It possesses spreading properties and it is used as a pharmaceutical agent to facilitate the dispersion of drugs and other substances. It has been proven to be effective in enhancing ocular regional anaesthesia but it has not been adequately studied in peripheral regional blockade. FICB is a safe and effective method of lumbar plexus regional anaesthesia. The goal of FICB is to provide femoral nerve, lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh and obturator nerve block. While the femoral nerve and lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh are reliably blocked by FICB the overall success rate of the block is limited by obturator nerve anaesthesia which is successful in only ~44% of ultrasound guided FICB - presumably due to the distance the local anaesthetic must traverse from its site of infiltration to reach this nerve. 

We hypothesise that adding hyaluronidase to a plain 0.5% ropivacine local anaesthetic solution will increase the success of FICB - chiefly the proportion of patients achieving obturator nerve anaesthesia (weakness of thigh adduction). We will also study effects on the speed of onset and blood levels of co-administered local anaesthetic. 

An improvement in the success of FICB should improve post-operative pain after  knee replacement. If proven, there may also be other peripheral nerve block procedures that may benefit from the addition of hyaluronidase.</summary>
