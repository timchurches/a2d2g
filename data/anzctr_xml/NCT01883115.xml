  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our recent prospective randomized controlled study comparing single-port vs. multiport
      laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy (NCT 01660048) demonstrated
      superiority of the single-port technique in reducing post-op pain/analgesic requirements,
      quicker return to work/normal physical activities and improved cosmetic scar scores. During
      this study all patients underwent the initial extraperitoneal dissection with the distension
      balloon. However, the balloon itself costs AU $380 per device which represents a significant
      percentage of the overall cost of the procedure (when the hospital/operating rooms cost is
      approximately AU $2500 for a unilateral laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair) especially if
      only unilateral inguinal herniorraphy is performed.

      The European Hernia Society Guidelines encourage the use of the distension balloon for the
      initial distension/dissection of the extraperitoneal space especially during the learning
      curve. This recommendation arises from the fact that during the conventional multiport repair
      the umbilical port allows only the insertion of the laparoscope and the extraperitoneal space
      cannot easily be dissected with the scope itself, especially in patients with well-developed
      linea alba extending down to the pubic symphysis, and the camera itself, if used as
      dissection device, would become smudged and it would have to be repeatedly withdrawn for
      cleaning. Yet this must occur since the extraperitoneal space must be dissected in the
      midline sufficiently for safe insertion of two additional 5 mm ports for insertion of
      dissecting instruments in order to complete the extraperitoneal space dissection and the
      repair.

      With single incision laparoscopic surgery the use of the Triport system ensure that the port
      can be place under direct vision into the extraperitoneal space when the scope and two
      dissecting instruments can be safely inserted at the outset. In this way the extraperitoneal
      space can be dissected under direct vision. The balloon dissection is essentially a blind
      dissection even though the balloon distension is being observed by the scope, incorrect
      tissue planes can be entered ie the dissection can occur below the pre-peritoneal fascia
      exposing the nerves in the groin with the potential risks for nerve damage and entrapment.
      This is an argument that surgeons who practise transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia
      repair use to justify their superior technique over the TEP repair because, in the TAPP
      repair, the peritoneum is carefully dissected free from and leaving the underlying
      preperitoneal fascia intact.

      While the use of the balloon, when some 25 "pumps" of air are used during the insufflation,
      to create a significant space to place not only the two 5 mm ports but also to create a
      significant extraperitoneal dissection when usually only the lateral space and the hernia sac
      need to be dissected this is not always possible. In patients who have had previous lower
      abdominal surgery including previous anterior inguinal herniorraphy (especially if the mesh
      plug is used) the balloon dissention is normally judicious as one cannot predict whether
      there are any significant peritoneal or even bowel adhesions. Consequently, in such cases,
      the balloon distension is normally confined to an area just inferior to the umbilical port
      and superior to the pubic symphysis so that there is just enough extraperitoneal dissection
      to place the two 5 mm trocars. Usually this means only using only 5 pumps of air in the
      distension balloon for placement of two 5 mm trocars. Then the dissection of the
      extraperitonealy space under direct vision can take place. The use of the distension balloon
      in such cases represents an enormous waste of resources since AU $380 is spent just to create
      enough space to place the two 5 mm ports and hence allowing the insertion of the dissecting
      instruments. With the Triport+ port the dissecting instruments can easily be placed in the
      extraperitoneal space and the dissection can begin under direct vision hence achieving the
      same safe dissection that TAPP surgeons claim to perform.

      In this study we aim to look at the safety and efficacy of telescopic vs. balloon dissection
      by prospectively comparing a similar former group of patients to the ones who had previously
      undergone single-port inguinal herniorraphy with balloon dissection in our previous study
      (NCT 01660048).

      All patients having surgical treatment of groin hernia at St Luke's and Holroyd Private
      Hospitals are subject to very careful assessment and study. All patients are requested to
      report immediately if there are any problems.</summary>
