    <interventions>Needle knife sphincterotomy
This technique involves cutting through the duodenal mucosa directly into the bile duct rather than directly cannulating the bile duct via the anatomical opening (Ampulla of Vater). It involves the use of a needle knife - a thin stiff wire that cuts through the use of diathermy. Typically the needle knife technique takes between 1 - 10 minutes to gain access. Once used to gain access, it is not used again during the procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment - persistence of standard cannulation techniques.
Standard techniques involve the use of a sphincterotome or thin catheter to directly cannulate the bile duct through the anatomical opening - the sphincter (ampulla) of Vater. A range of different catheters or sphincterotomes can be used incorporating different sized catheters and angulation/rotations.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post ERCP pancreatitis
This outcome will be determined by blood tests - amylase and lipase at 24 hours. 
In the event of post procedural pain, clinical assessment will be performed and blood tests may be performed at an earlier timepoint. A CT scan may be performed if acute pancreatitis is confirmed on blood tests and clinical assessment, as this can suggest the severity of the pancreatitis episode. 
Patients will be contacted via phone within the first 5 days and again at day 30. Questions will relate to the symptoms of possible complications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate; at 24 hours; at day 30</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biliary cannulation success
This outcome is assessed at the time of the procedure and confirmed by the use of fluroscopy (XRay) and radio-opaque contrast and wires that identifies the bile duct and biliary tree.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post ERCP complications (non pancreatitis)
This outcome is assessed by a combination of clinical assessment, blood tests and imaging.
Complications typically occur within the first 14 days, predominantly in the first 24 hours. If there is a clinical suspicion of complications apart from pancreatitis - such as perforation or bleeding, the appropriate imaging and blood tests will be performed for confirmation of the diagnosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediate; at 24 hours; at day 30</timepoint>

    <concealment>All eligible patients (biliary indication and naive sphincter) invited prior to the procedure to be involved. Consent obtained prior to the procedure.
Random number generation was performed by a clinician not involved in the study and the number concealed in an opaque envelope. 
At prescribed time/criteria for randomization to occur, the next sequential envelope was opened by a medical team member not directly involved in the study. 
The proceduralist was informed of the randomized group and the randomisation result was recorded.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatoscopy (ERCP) is a procedure that can assist in the treatment and diagnosis of liver disease as well as gallstone disease. 
Like all medical procedures, ERCP is associated with complications specifically infalmmation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Pancreatitis is often associated with more difficult procedures that take longer than normal to complete. In these situations special techniques may be used to successfully complete the procedure, such as directly cutting into the drainage tube (bile duct)from the liver - this is called a needle knife cutting technique. 
This study looks at whether the use of this needle knife cutting technique may prevent or reduce the risk of pancreatitis complications if performed at an earlier stage.</summary>
