  <interventions>
    <interventions>intervention: as a training means, novice urologists will undertake 10 cases of percutaneous nephrostomy during six months before doing percutaneous nephrolithotomy independently. All the manipulation was supervised by a senior urologist who are completent in percutaneous nephrostomy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy. And the urologists' independent percutaneous nephrolithotomy is part of this trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>the urologists in control group have no training with percutaneous nephrostomy but during the past six months have performed  10 cases of purely ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy which means that percutaneous nephrolithotomy is performed under the sole guidance of ultrasound including puncture and tract dilation.</comparator>
