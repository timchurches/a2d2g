  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomly assigned to treatment or control group initially and then cross over to the alternate group after a one month washout period. 

Colchicine 1mg/day oral tablets for three months on top of standard medical therapy will be administered while in the treatment group.  

Standard medical therapy will include any of the following and is at the discretion of the primary care physician: Statins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors, Beta Blockers and Aspirin.

Flow mediated dilation testing is performed at baseline and after three months participation in both control and treatment arms.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will recieve standard medical therapy including aspirin, statin therapy +/- angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and will be observed for three months.  Treatment is at the discretion of the primary physician and will differ on case by case basis.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To correlate high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels with changes in endothelial function as measured by brachial artery flow mediated dilation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months.  Baseline and 3 month measurement of flow mediated dilation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the effect of low dose colchicine on blood inflammatory cytokines (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, Tumor necrosis factor alpha and serum amyloid A) via the measurement of inflammatory cytokine levels after phlebotomy using automated analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months.  Baseline and 3 month measurement of inflammatory cytokines.</timepoint>
