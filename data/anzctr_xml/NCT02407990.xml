          3. Subjects must have archival tumor tissues or agree to a tumor biopsy for analysis of
             predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1. (Fresh tumor biopsies are strongly recommended at

             who consent to the biopsies.)

          4. Subjects must have measurable disease as defined per RECIST Version 1.1.

                  7 days of the first investigational product administration), and uses adequate
                  contraception before study entry and throughout the study until 90 days after the
                  last investigational product administration. Adequate contraception, when used
                  consistently and in accordance with both the product label and the instructions
                  of the physician, are defined as follows:

                    -  Vasectomized partner who is sterile prior to the female subject's entry and
                       is the sole sexual partner for that female.

                       suppository, or film; OR diaphragm with spermicide; OR male condom and
                       diaphragm.

                    -  Not be breast feeding.

         10. Male subjects are eligible to enter and participate in the study if they are
             vasectomized or agree to the use of contraception during the study treatment period
             and for at least 180 days after the last dose of study drug</inclusivecriteria>

             excluded.

          6. Subjects should be excluded if they have a condition requiring systemic treatment with
             either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration.

             administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the interpretation of toxicity
             determination or adverse events;

         11. Prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy or any investigational therapies used
             to control cancer must have been completed at least 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives
             (whichever is shorter) before study drug administration, and all adverse events have
             either returned to baseline or stabilized.

             within 4 weeks (28 days) of initiation of study therapy and 60 days after the last
