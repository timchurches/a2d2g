  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assist in understanding the most effective parameters for TMS
      in Depressive Disorders. Most research conducted has used high frequency stimulation on the
      left hemisphere.However, low frequency on the right hemisphere has also been shown to have
      antidepressant properties and appears to be better tolerated. A promising approach to improve
      responses to rTMS may be to combine high and low frequency stimulation where they are both
      applied to the right side of the brain. In this approach, high frequency stimulation is
      provided first which may 'prime' or pre-prepare the brain for low frequency stimulation in a
      way that enhances its response. Participants are randomised to receive active or placebo
      priming stimulation.If participants do not respond to this treatment condition after 10
      sessions applied over a two week period they will be offered 10 session of high frequency
      left sided TMS treatment. Alternatively, if participants respond favorably they may continue
      with that treatment condition for another 10 sessions.</summary>
