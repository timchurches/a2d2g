  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involves participants who require upper premolar extractions as part of their overall orthodontic treatment plan.
First part:
The first part of the project involves placing orthodontic braces only on the upper posterior teeth.  Using a split-mouth design, one side will be randomly made control, while the other will be the experimental side in which micro-osteoperforations will be placed.  Micro-osteoperforations involves the placement of a series of small punctures through the gingiva and alveolar bone associated with the roots of teeth to stimulate a localized inflammatory process.  A specialized instrument designed specifically for micro-osteoperforations will be used.
Three perforations 3-7mm deep in a vertical alignment will be placed on both the mesial and distal aspects of the upper first premolar.  Including the anaesthetic administration, the micro-osteoperforation procedure would take approximately 30 minutes.  
Using partial braces on the upper posterior teeth (first and second premolar and first molar), orthodontic force will be applied to the first premolars bilaterally for 4 weeks, after which the teeth will be extracted as part of the patients ongoing orthodontic treatment.  These extracted teeth will then be scanned with a MicroCT scanner and the extent of resorption measured.  Patients will also be asked to record their level of discomfort on the experimental and control side following the placement of braces and micro-osteoperforations.  
Second part:

The second part of the study involves placing full braces on the subjects.  This will take place around 2 weeks after the extractions of the premolars and conclusion of the first part of the study.  It will involve 24 weeks of aligning and levelling teeth.  After this period, another three perforations in a vertical alignment will be placed distal to the upper canine on the experimental side and the rate of canine retraction will be compared to the control side.  Patients will be assessed and tooth movement measured off study models every 2-4 weeks, over an 8-week period.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The control would be the randomly selected side of the mouth where there will be no micro-osteoperforations.
First part:
Like the intervention side, an orthodontic force will be placed to move the upper first premolar buccally (towards the cheek) for 4 weeks, after which the premolar would be extracted and examined under Micro-CT to assess extent of root resorption.  Second part:
The rate of orthodontic space closure of the first premolar extraction space at the control side would also compared with the intervention side.</comparator>

    <concealment>Patients will be recruited from the orthodontic waiting list at Sydney Dental Hospital.
The Orthodontic Department routinely screens patients to assess whether they have an orthodontic problem that requires treatment.  The patient is placed on the appropriate waiting list if the quality for treatment.
Patients with a specific orthodontic problem (maxillary protrusion or bimaxillary protrusive and severe crowding) are selected from the waiting list.
These patients are sent a letter from the Head of Department inviting their participation in the study.  These patients are asked to attend for an examination to screen for eligibility for the study, if they meet the criteria, they are then invited to participate in the research project. 
When interested patients attend for screening, they are asked to complete the Participant Consent Form before any screening procedures are undertaken. 
If the patients are ineligible for the study, they will commence their routine clinical care immediately and will not be returned to the waiting list. 
Allocation is not concealed due to the split-mouth design of the study (one side of the mouth would be randomly assigned to be experimental and the other side would be assigned as control).  However, as the same operator is going to place the micro-osteoperforations and examine the root resorption, the extracted premolars will be given a random de-identification number which will be stored on master spread sheet.  This will be done to prevent the operator from knowing which tooth was experimental or control.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A primary objective of orthodontic treatment is to achieve a functional and aesthetic outcome efficiently and with minimum root resorption.  Preliminary research has shown promising results with micro-osteoperforations and accelerated orthodontic tooth movement.  Being a relatively recent adjunct to orthodontic treatment, further research is required to gain insight into the effects of micro-osteoperforation on tooth movement as well as on root resorption.

The aim of the proposed investigation is twofold.  The first part consists of applying buccally directed orthodontic forces to the upper 1st premolars to compare the amount of root resorption that occurs with normal orthodontic tooth movement, with that which occurs with orthodontic tooth movement in areas treated with micro-osteoperforations.  The micro-osteoperforations will be applied using a disposable appliance designed for this purpose by Propel Orthodontics.  The Propel device is a TGA approved, FDA registered medical device specifically designed to create micro-osteoperforations.  The second part consists of quantitatively measuring the rate of bodily canine retraction with normal orthodontic tooth movement, and orthodontic tooth movement associated with micro-osteoperforations.  The hypothesis of this research project is that micro-osteoperforations will minimise orthodontic root resorption while allowing accelerated rates of orthodontic tooth movement. 

The proposed investigation will be a Prospective Cohort study involving 12-14 subjects.  The first part of the project involves placing orthodontic braces only on the upper posterior teeth.  Using a split-mouth design, one side will be randomly made control, while the other will be the experimental side in which micro-osteoperforations will be placed.  Three perforations in a vertical alignment will be placed on both the mesial and distal aspects of the upper first premolar.  Orthodontic force will be applied to the first premolars bilaterally for 4 weeks, after which the teeth will be extracted as part of the patients ongoing orthodontic treatment.  These extracted teeth will then be scanned with a MicroCT scanner and the extent of resorption measured.  Patients will also be asked to record their level of discomfort on the experimental and control side following the placement of braces and micro-osteoperforations.  

The second part of the study involves placing full braces on the subjects with 24 weeks of aligning and levelling teeth.  After this period, another three perforations in a vertical alignment will be placed distal to the upper canine on the experimental side and the rate of canine retraction will be compared to the control side.  Patients will be assessed and tooth movement measured off study models every 2-4 weeks, over an 8-week period.  

Conclusion:
Root resorption is a significant consequence of orthodontic treatment.  As micro-osteoperforations is a new adjunctive treatment to orthodontics, further research is needed to assess its effect on root resorption and to confirm its association with accelerated orthodontic tooth movement.
