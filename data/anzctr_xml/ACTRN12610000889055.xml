  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of the effectiveness of 4% Articaine with 1:100,000 adrenaline compared with Lignocaine 2%  with 1:100,000 adrenaline in achieving local analgesia for dental extractions in the upper jaw among children when delivered as buccal infiltration only adjacent to the tooth to be extracted. Dosage of local anaesthetic limited to 5mg/kg body weight, to a maximum of 2.2ml cartridge of local anaesthetic. Supplementation with Lignocaine 2% permitted for palatal analgesia, dosage not to exceed 5mg/kg body weight. Mode of administration: buccal infiltration injection. Type of anaesthetic used (test or control) for one side of the mouth determined by random allocation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison local anaesthetic is 2% lignociane with 1:100,000 adrenaline delivered in the same manner as the test agent on the contralateral side. Both teeth can be extracted at the same visit or one at each visit, usually spaced 1 week apart.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of children with achievement of local analgesia through buccal infiltration alone to allow extraction of upper teeth among study participants. Achievement of analgesia initially tested through tactile probing after maximum of ten minutes wait after analgesia administration. If analgesia is deemed adequate extraction is performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Analgesia tested after 10  minutes from administration of local analgesia.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child's report of pain as reported through the faces pain scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>After completion of local analgesia administration and after extraction. If both teeth are extracted at the same visit the recorder ensures that child's response is for the indicated tooth.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assistant observation of child's reaction to administration of local analgesia and during extraction using the CHEOPS scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assistant record the observations during local anaesthetic administration and during extraction</timepoint>

      <outcome>Parental report of postoperative pain through completion of parent questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaire completed  24 hours after completion of the procedure.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reports of adverse events pain at injection site, excessive and or prolonged post operative bleeding and soft tissue injuries.</outcome>
