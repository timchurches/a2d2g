    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be by intention-to-treat based on the randomization. With the relatively modest sample size we are not planning to stratify randomisation but important co-variates will be collected and an important selection of these will be used as a sensitivity analysis. The primary analysis of the primary outcome variable will be by ANCOVA, with the six-month HbA1c as the response variable, and with the baseline measurement of HbA1c as a continuous co-variate as well as the randomized treatments and the interaction between randomized treatments as categorical explanatory variables. We plan to estimate the main effects of the interventions if the interaction term is not statistically significant. For the other continuous outcome variables we also plan to use ANCOVA. Normality assumptions will be checked and either data transformations or rank-based estimates used if normality assumptions are strongly violated. Logistic regression for assessment of dichotomous variables in relation to randomised treatments will be used. As a form of sensitivity analysis the following important co-variates: ethnicity, BMI, fasting glucose, and HOMA; will be assessed in ANCOVA models to check that conclusions are robust to possible maldistribution of important covariates.
There are few published studies reporting HbA1c change with lifestyle or pharmaceutical intervention in pre-diabetes.  In a trial by Defronzo et al Pioglitazone reduced HbA1c by 0.24% (2.6 mmol/mol) relative to placebo (DeFronzo et al., 2011).  Past research reports the standard deviation (SD) of HbA1c in similar clinical samples is between 4 and 6 mmol/mol (Parker, Byham-Gray, Denmark, &amp; Winkle, 2014).  If we use a clinically important difference of HbA1c of 5mmol/mol, as for established T2DM, and the larger SD then a sample size of 32 in each main effects arm has 90% power to detect this with a Type I error rate of 5%. Accounting for 25% drop-out a total sample size of 88 is needed (22 in each factorial combination). The power to detect differences is likely to be improved by using baseline HbA1c as a continuous co-variate. However, an uncertainty for this study is whether the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for reduction of HbA1c in the setting of pre-diabetes should be anticipated to be closer to that seen in the Pioglitazone study (increasing the required sample size) and that the SD of the HbA1c is likely to be smaller in pre-diabetes than T2DM (decreasing the required sample size). For 80% power to detect a difference of 2.6 mmol/mol with an SD of 4 and 25% drop-out a total recruitment of 92 is needed, and for 90% power n=136.  For a difference of 3.8 mmol/mol, half-way between the two values, and the larger SD of 6, a total sample size of 152 participants with 38 in each factorial combination, will be recruited for this study.
We have chosen not to use a co-primary outcome variable but we are interested in an important secondary outcome variable in the assessment of differences in mood variables. The nominated sample size has 80% power to detect an effect size (mean divided by standard deviation) of 0.6 Although this is a relatively large effect size by the standards of psychological variables this is in fact the effect size is reported for pharmacological interventions in depression in those with T2DM from a Cochrane review (Baumeister, Hutter, &amp; Bengel, 2014). 
If efficacy of study interventions is proven in stage 3 a thematic analysis of data will be undertaken looking for themes in relation to intervention acceptability and uptake and it is possible participants may record comments about health beliefs about pre-diabetes and food interventions, health literacy, lifestyle behaviour change and self-management strategies. Depending on survey return, it may be possible for the analysis to take account of cultural difference
In addition, a per protocol analysis will be undertaken.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A quarter of New Zealanders have pre-diabetes which is a condition that can progress to type 2 diabetes and cause significant long term health problems including cardiovascular disease, There is now exciting research demonstrating that microbes in our gut affect our health in many ways, including how our bodies process foods and sugars. We can modify our gut microbes by taking supplements of probiotics (which contain live bacteria that give health benefits) and cereals (which contain substances that support the growth of gut microbes). This study is a blinded randomised placebo-controlled trial with four groups. Adults with pre-diabetes will take a study capsule containing either a probiotic or a placebo and a daily portion of one of two different cereals daily for 6 months. Study followup will continue for 6 months after stopping the study interventions. 
 
 The study will examine changes in blood tests including HbA1c ( a measure of blood glucose levels over the previous 8-12 weeks), fasting glucose, insulin and lipids. In addition, it will examine changes in blood pressure, weight, and waist circumference, body mass index and general well being/health related quality of life. 

Some study participants will also take part in individual interviews and group discussions aimed at helping us learn about the acceptability of the study interventions, and factors that would support long-term use of the interventions if they are proven to be effective. 

If the interventions are found to have clinically important beneficial effects group discussions will also be held with health professionals and others who might recommend the interventions. This is to find the best ways to ensure that the interventions are adopted. </summary>
