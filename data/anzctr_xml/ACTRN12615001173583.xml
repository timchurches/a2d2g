  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1, Intravenous oxytocin ceased within 15 minutes of completion of the third stage of labour.
Arm2,Intravenous oxytocin ceased 30 minutes after completion of the third stage of labour.
Arm 3, Intravenous oxytocin ceased 60 minutes after completion of the third stage of labour.


Oxytocin is titrated up from 12 to 108 mls per hour until contractions are established therefore some women will need 60 mls to get into established labour and some women will need 108mls.  For analysis women will be grouped into low medium and high groups for the maximum amount of oxytocin reached.

      <outcome>The proportion of women who have a postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss greater than or equal to 500mls), when intravenous oxytocin is ceased at 15, 30 or 60 minutes following completion of the third stage of labour, for women who receive syntometrine management of the third stage of labour. Syntometrine is not given to women who 
have high bood pressure-67% in our hospital recieves Syntometrine. It is the prefered drug for third stage of labour</outcome>

Syntocinon is given in 33% of women in our hospital for third stage labour. Generally this is given to women who have raised blood pressure/cardiac abnormalities.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>To check that randomisation has been effective the baseline differences between groups (e.g. age, gestation, maximum millilitres of oxytocin infused per hour) will be investigated using t- tests.  Categorical data (such as the type of oxytocic administered for third stage) will be assessed using Chisquare or Fisher exact test.  Univariate logistic regression analysis will be used to identify the significant candidate predictors for their associations with measured blood loss.  Multivariable logistic regression will be used to identify simultaneous factors associated with measured blood loss, with the covariate effects summarised using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
We estimate that a total of 312 participants will need to be recruited to adequately power this study.  We are planning a study of independent cases and controls with one control per two cases.  The failure rate among controls (postpartum haemorrhage) is 0.39 in our study centre.  If the true failure rate for the experimental subjects is 0.19, we will need to study 80 control subjects and 80 experimental subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the failure rates for experimental and control subjects are equal with 80% power in a two armed trial.  As this is a three armed randomised controlled trial we need to multiply n=80 by 1.3 to maintain power.  Therefore, we need 104 in each group (a total of n=312) to detect a 20% change in proportions.  The type one error probability is 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Oxytocin is a hormone which stimulates the smooth muscle of the uterus, producing rhythmic contractions, towards the end of pregnancy, during labour and after delivery. Synthetic oxytocin is a drug which is given to women in a drip (intravenous infusion) to help start (induce) and continue labour.  Synthetic oxytocin is used because it helps establish contractions in a pattern similar to that of normal labour.
If a woman has a spontaneous vaginal birth, it is generally the midwife who decides when to stop the synthetic oxytocin infusion after the birth of the baby. However, if she has an assisted vaginal birth (such as a vacuum or forceps birth) or caesarean birth, it may be the obstetrician who decides when to stop the synthetic oxytocin infusion after the birth of the baby.
We are investigating the best time for the midwife to stop the synthetic oxytocin infusion after a spontaneous vaginal birth. We want to investigate this topic as there is no current evidence to guide this clinical practice.
The primary aim of this study is to determine the proportion of women who have a postpartum haemorrhage, when intravenous oxytocin is ceased at 15, 30 or 60 minutes following completion of the third stage of labour.
We hypothesise women who have intrapartum, intravenous oxytocin ceased at 15, 30 or 60 minutes following completion of the third stage of labour will experience the same rates of postpartum haemorrhage.
We estimate that a total of 312 participants will need to be recruited to adequately power this study
