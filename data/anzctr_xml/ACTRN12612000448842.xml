    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be approached to join the trial and informed consent will be taken. Pateints will then be randomised to either treatment or control groups. This allocation will be kept in hospital pharmacy with access to unblinding information always available via the on-call pharmacist.  The patients will be allocated by way of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes with the envelope giving the participant their unique trial number and their group allocation.  The patientsâ€™ unique medical record number (UMRN) will be linked to their trial number by means of a trial register kept in a locked filing cabinet in each hospital.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As the population ages there is an increasing number of elderly patients presenting to hospital with fractured hips.  A large proportion of these patients receive blood transfusions, a treatment that is associated a significant cost and potential harm.  Most of these patients being transfused have an iron deficiency anaemia.  We plan to examine the benefit of giving intravenous iron to these patients to see if we can reduce the number needing a blood transfusion and improve nadir haemoglobin and ultimately reduce length of stay and 6 month mortality</summary>
