  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children with ASD  who require premedication for operation and have received the preparation package, will be randomised to either placebo (water) plus standard dose of midazolam or low doses of clonidine plus midazolam. The intervention group will be given clonidine 3mcg/kg, 60 minutes before the operation and midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, 30 minutes before the operation. The maximum dose of clonidine is 250 mcg and maximal dose of midazolam is 12 mg. The standard of care group will receive water (placebo) 60 minutes before the operation and  0.5 mg of midazolam 30 minutes before the operation. the maximum dose of midazolam is 20 mg. All medication will be given orally.
The preparation package includes a face mask to practice, information re trial and how to prepare and distract the child, baseline information about the child and 3 booklets to choose from in order to prepare children for operation. these booklets are social stories that are for children with different level of understanding and the standard hospital booklet. The social stories are prepared by chief investigator (Dr Taghizadeh). The hospital booklet is written by Marieke Mitchell and is called "Going to hospital, what will it be like?". Social story are very commonly used in the educational setting and multiple studies support their use. The concept of social story was developed by Carol Gray  (Gray and Garand, 1993) in order to explain social situations to children with ASD and to teach them the appropriate responses that are expected of them. Gary suggested a specific combination of directive, perspective and descriptive sentences. Parents may choose any booklet that they find helpful to their child. The preparation package is sent 7-10 days before the operation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smooth or steal induction as per Almanrader Scale of 3-5. Almanrader scale is used in multiple studies before. There is no gold standard scale for induction and most studies use a 4 or 5 point scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Induction of anaesthesia</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergence delirium (agitation) in recovery room as measured by Watcha scale (&gt;2)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of admission to stage 1 recovery, every 30 minutes until discharge from stage 2 recovery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction of parents with preparation program as measured by a likert  scale
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The parents receive the preparation package. as part of this package there is a questionnaire to be filled up before coming to hospital. one of the questions is their satisfaction with preparation program.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Describing the characteristics of children that do not accept premedication or spit it up. The outcome is assessed by report from the nurses that administer the premedication in the medical record.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether the child has a steal induction. steal induction means to give the child inhalation anaesthetic without waking the child up. that means the child comes to operating room asleep.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post operative vomiting</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post operative pain score using r-FLACC scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Recovery room including stage 1 and 2. The rFLACC is assessed every 15 minutes for 60 minutes.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events including hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, excessive sedation. This outcome is provided either directly or by reviewing the medical records. The anaesthetist provide the information in the case report form about the complications during the operation.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety of parents and children having operation at the time of induction and discharge, using Visual Analogue Scale for anxiety.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Describe the characteristic of children that require significant restraint or ketamine despite premedication assessed by direct observation or by review of medical records.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>this trial aims to improve the experiences of children with ASD having an operation in Royal Dental hospital and the Royal Children's Hospital . The participants will be selected from operating list and a preparation package will be sent after verbal consent.  on the day of operation if the child requires premedication, they are randomised to clonidine plus midazolam at lower doses vs. placebo plus standard dose of midazolam. the primary end point is the quality of induction as measured by Almanrader scale.</summary>
