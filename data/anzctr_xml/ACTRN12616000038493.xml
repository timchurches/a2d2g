  <interventions>
    <interventions>Social cognitive theory has informed the intervention which consists of a one-hour individual face-to-face session (60 minutes duration), a booklet of Looking After My Kidneys and Health (adapted and translated in Vietnamese with permission from Kidney Health Australia and American Kidney Foundation), and two follow up phone calls at week 4 and week 12 (20 to 30 minutes duration). Both the face-to-face session (outpatient clinic) and follow-up phone calls are provided by the nurse (principal researcher).  The face-to-face session covers information about chronic kidney disease, medications, lifestyle modifications, and self-management skills based on the content of the booklet. It is also used to set individual self-management goals. Participants will also be asked to use the Looking After My Kidneys and Health booklet at home to guide their self-management goals. Information is reinforced during the follow-up phone calls. Adherence to the protocol is monitored by a log of successful phone call follow up sessions and return to the clinic for routine renal care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard renal care at the clinic will be given to all of the participants with chronic kidney disease in this study. There is no structured education about chronic kidney disease and neither any written information provided. Medical and nursing staff deliver very brief verbal instructions on taking medications and basic healthcare advice about returning to the outpatient clinic to be reviewed by a medical practitioner. 
At the end of the study participants in the control group will receive the CKD booklet from the Principal researcher.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The first primary outcome is chronic kidney disease self-management which is measured by the Vietnamese version of the CKD self-management instrument. The instrument has been validated in the study population.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be measured at time point 1: baseline
Repeated measurement: - Time point 2: week 8, Time point 3: week 16 
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second primary outcome is chronic kidney disease knowledge assessed using the Vietnamese version of the kidney knowledge survey (KiKS). This instrument measures knowledge related to kidney disease management, such as kidney functions, treatment options for kidney failure, signs and symptoms of disease progression, potential medications that harm or benefit the kidney, blood pressure targets, and other information related to preserving kidney function. The instrument has been validated in the study population.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be measured at time point 1: baseline
Repeated measurement: - Time point 2: week 8, Time point 3: week 16 
</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure obtained from patient's medical records.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be measured at time point 1: baseline
Repeated measurement: - Time point 3: week 16 when the study ended

      <outcome>Self-efficacy assessed using the chronic disease self-efficacy 6-item scale (SES)</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated by using the G*Power 3.1 sample size calculation program with an effect size of 0.5 for Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (two groups), a = 0.05, power of 80%, and allocation ratio N2/N1 is 1. The sample size is 134 participants (67 participants per group). However, allowing for an attrition rate of 20% (14 participants added per group), the sample has been increased to 162 participants in total (81 participants in the control group and 81 participants in the intervention group). 
Data will be entered into and analysed using SPSS. The statistical analysis will involve independent t-test, paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, and two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA).
