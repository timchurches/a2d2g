  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female, at least 18 years of age at the time of screening.

          2. Currently taking an immunosuppressant regimen based on either tacrolimus or
             cyclosporine.

             Corticosteroids such as prednisone or prednisolone are permitted as components of the
             immunosuppressant regimen providing the dose is not more than 10 mg/day.

          3. HCV IFN therapy treatment-na√Øve or -experienced, either pre or post liver or renal
             transplant.

          4. Screening HCV genotype testing indicating infection with genotype 1 or 4 HCV only.</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>
    <inclusivemaxage>115</inclusivemaxage>
    <inclusivemaxagetype>Years</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Use of everolimus or sirolimus as part of the immunosuppressive regimen within 2
             months of Screening Visit.

          2. Use of any medications listed below as well as those that are contraindicated for use
             with either ritonavir or RBV within 2 weeks prior to study drugs administration or 10
             half-lives (if known), whichever is longer.

          3. Positive test result for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or anti-human
             immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV Ab).

          4. Documented history of post-transplant complications directly involving the hepatic or
             renal vasculature as appropriate to the organ transplanted, e.g., thrombosis of the
             portal vein, the hepatic artery and/or hepatic vein.

          5. Clinically significant abnormalities, other than HCV infection, in a subject
             post-transplant based upon the medical history, physical examination, vital signs,
             laboratory profile and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) that make the subject an
             unsuitable candidate for this study in the opinion of the investigator.</exclusivecriteria>
