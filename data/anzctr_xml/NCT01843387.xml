  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of MPC therapy - Outcomes include the following safety parameters:
Number of and percent of subject with adverse events and serious adverse events
Clinically significant values and shifts from baseline in vital signs, physical examinations and electrocardiograms
Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis, flow cytometry with Class I and Class II PRA % with specificity)</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exploratory assessment of the efficacy of MPC therapy - Outcomes include changes from baseline at 12 weeks in the following parameters:
Renal function (glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow)
Serum creatinine
Urinary albumin and protein excretion
Glycemic control
Biomarkers</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 Weeks</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>-  Men and women who are = 50 and = 85 years old

          -  Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at least 2 years prior to Screening

          -  Subjects with diabetic nephropathy and CKD stage 3b-4

          -  Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) from a spot urine sample &gt;30 and &lt; 3000 mg/g at
             Screening

          -  Subjects must be receiving standard of care treatment for their diabetic nephropathy
             with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and/or an angiotensin II
             receptor blocker (ARB) for at least 12 weeks prior to Screening.

          -  HbA1c &lt; 10.0% at Screening</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Prior participation in any stem cell study

          -  Women of childbearing potential

          -  Potentially unreliable subjects and those judged by the Investigator to be unsuitable
             for the study

          -  History of active substance abuse (including alcohol) within the past 2 years. Current
             alcohol abuse is defined as daily consumption of &gt;3 alcoholic beverages (i.e. &gt; 21
             alcoholic beverages per week)

          -  Body weight &gt;150 kg

          -  Subjects with non-diabetic renal disease e.g. known polycystic kidney disease

          -  Subjects with a history of a renal transplant or who have had prior dialysis within 3
             months of Screening and/or have not maintained a stable level of kidney function
             within 3 months of Screening

          -  Current or history within 6 months of Screening of NYHA Class III or IV heart failure

          -  Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months prior to Screening

          -  Any concurrent medical condition/disorder or clinically symptomatic cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, hematological, pulmonary, acute or chronic infectious disease,
             active retinal disease or other disorder which in the Investigator's opinion would
             interfere with the subjects ability to complete the trial, would require
             administration of treatment that could affect the interpretation of the efficacy and
             safety variables or would preclude safe involvement in the study</exclusivecriteria>
