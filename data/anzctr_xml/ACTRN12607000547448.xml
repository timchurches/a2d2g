    <interventions>The goal of this study was to examine the resting-state functional connectivity within the fronto-striatal-insular network in subjects with ADHD and in healthy controls. Twenty-nine boys with ADHD  engaged in resting-state fMRI scanning for 8 minutes during which they were instructed to lie with their eyes closed, think of nothing systematically, and not fall asleep.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The reduced functional connectivity was mainly distributed among the right fronto-striatal-insular network (middle frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, insula, paracentral lobule and superior frontal gyrus).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients with ADHD had significantly less power in low-frequency oscillations (0.01 Hz ~ 0.1 Hz) in relation to healthy controls.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the present study was to use spatial ICA to identify differences in the resting-state functional connectivity of the fronto-striatal-insular network between healthy controls and patients with ADHD. We hypothesize that the pathophysiology of ADHD involves dysfunctional interaction or connectivity among regions of the fronto-striatal-insular network. ICA was used to calculate spatially independent, temporally synchronous regions (i.e., network) (Calhoun et al 2004); the fronto-striatal-insular network for each subject was selected using a spatial template to identify the network of interest. Study hypotheses were then tested by comparing the spatial-temporal characteristics of the fronto-striatal-insular network within and between groups.</summary>
