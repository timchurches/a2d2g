  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a self-management program consisting of a one-hour individual educational session, provision of a HF booklet, a diary and weighing scale. Participants receive the self-management program at discharge. The booklet is adapted with permission from the Australian National Heart Foundation.  The one-hour individual educational session aims to provide participants with knowledge and self-management in heart failure. Educational topics which are delivered by a trained nurse cover HF signs and symptoms, symptom management, advice regarding fluid and weight management, salt restrictions, medication use, exercise, recognition of worsening symptoms and alerting signs to seek help. The teach-back method is used as a teaching method to ensure understanding of information provided during educational session and during one follow-up phone call 2 weeks after that. The follow-up phone call (takes approximately 10 minutes) is purposeful to reinforce educational messages and promote adherence. The participants are taught how and when to measure their weight and to record in the diary. The diary also provides space for participants to record their symptoms, amount of fluid intake, blood pressure and list of medications.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care currently delivered to people with HF in the setting. Standard education is given mostly by a medical physician on the basis of patients clinical conditions and does not specifically target to HF self-management. The education is brief and provided once at discharge. Each participant in the control group also receives the HF self-management booklet identical with the intervention. The researcher explains briefly the content of the booklet but does not require them to teach-back. No follow up is provided.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome 1: heart failure knowledge. This is measured by the Dutch HF Knowledge Scale. The scale has been validated in Vietnamese population in a previous study.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is calculated to estimate 80% power, two-sided 5% significance level, type I error 0.05, type II error 0.2, mean change of HF knowledge 1.61 (SD 2.2), cluster size 20, intra-cluster correlation coefficient 0.05, the needed sample size is 140. 
The study follows intention to treat principles. Linear mixed models are used to determine the change in continuous outcomes. Risk ratio is used to compare hospital readmissions in two study groups
