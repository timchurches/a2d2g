  <interventions>
    <interventions>a) a novel intervention aiming to improve goal related activity and self regulation skills (goals-SR). The intervention uses components of both Identity Oriented Goal Training and Goal Management Training. Deliverred weekly for 8 weeks during intervention sessions lasting aproximately one hour.
b) Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) measurement tool, administerred weekly over an 8 week period during intervention sessions lasting aproximately one hour.
c) usual practice (ie participants will recieve no additional intervention from the researchers. They will continue with their planned rehabilitation process, details of which will be collected at the end of the study period. There is currently no standard practice)</interventions>
    <comparator>This study uses a factorial design looking at separate and interactive effects of the interventions a and b above, and comparing to 'usual practice'</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our objective is to determine effective strategies to improve goal related activity for people with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Goal setting is a key rehabilitation strategy for promoting recovery and adaptation. However, clinical practice is variable, outcomes uncertain, and both patients and professionals find the process frustrating. 
We recently completed an HRC-funded feasibility study examining two novel approaches to goal setting. Practical and methodological factors were identified and are addressed in the definitive trial proposed here. 
This Randomised Clinical Trial will determine the impact on health and functioning of: 
a)	a novel intervention aiming to improve goal related activity and self regulation skills (Goals-SR) compared with 
b)	use of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS), a measurement tool and
c)	usual practice 
This study will identify strategies that are most successful at improving goal related activity. This outcome will benefit the person with TBI (improved functioning, motivation, mood) and reduce carer burden.</summary>
