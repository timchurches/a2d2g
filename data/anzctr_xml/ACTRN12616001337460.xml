  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will complete an 8 week program of guided relaxation. This will be comprised of progressive muscular relaxation and a mindfulness-based meditation practice.  This will consist of one face-to-face group session per week (no more than 30 min in duration) and unsupervised regular daily practice (20 min per day). The intervention will be administered by an Accredited Practicing Dietitian and Yoga and Meditation Teacher (RYT-500hr+).  Adherence to required frequency of relaxation practice will be monitored through recording attendance to group sessions, and the maintenance of a home-practice diary.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control participants will continue their normal routine throughout the 8 week intervention period (i.e. no treatment will be given). All participants will complete pre- and post-intervention assessments eight weeks apart.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity and stress are two of the most pressing health concerns facing the modern world today and it is increasingly evident they are related.  Stress-induced eating is characterised by the preferential consumption of energy dense snack foods.  The physiological mechanisms underlying this behaviour are mediated by both stress and appetite hormones, largely dictated by the bodys desire for pleasure.  Given that relaxation is the physiological and psychological opposite of stress, this raises the question of whether relaxation strategies can reduce stress-induced eating. We aim to determine the effect of an 8-week guided relaxation intervention (supplemented by a daily home practice) on stress-induced eating, feelings of appetite (hunger and fullness), the circulating levels of appetite-related hormones,  perceived stress and psychological well-being. Identification of a therapeutic effect of relaxation will provide a novel, yet simple and cost effective, patient-centred tool that can be easily implemented to add to the existing strategies aimed at the prevention and management of obesity.  </summary>
