    <interventions>Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P

Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P (PCSSTP)is a brief behavioural family intervention consisting of four short sessions targeting one or two specific child problems.  Sessions are individually-delivered and designed to last approximately 15-30 minutes with the first three sessions being weekly and the final session occurring 2-4 weeks following the third session. The program is designed to be accessed through primary health care providers e.g., general practitioners, pediatricians, and nurses. The first session involves collecting family background information, discussing the history and nature of the presenting problem/s; and introducing baseline monitoring. Session 2 consists of a review of the assessment information; discussion of the monitoring and parents perceptions of the problem; sharing conclusions about the nature and etiology of the problem; setting specific goals for change; and developing a parenting plan. Session 3 includes reviewing progress; discussing any obstacles or difficulties in implementing the parenting plan; and making adjustments to the plan as necessary. Further discussion of strategies or behavioral rehearsal may also be included. Session 4 involves a review of progress with reference to specific goals set; discussion of problems encountered; strategies for maintaining change; and termination of contact. 

Parents choose which child problems they wish to target during the course of the intervention which can include a range of emotional, social, behavioural, and developmental problems. The problems are addressed by teaching parents a range of strategies based on social learning theory, research on child and family behaviour therapy, applied behaviour analysis, social information processing models, and developmental research.</interventions>
