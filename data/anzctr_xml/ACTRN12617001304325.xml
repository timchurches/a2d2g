    <statisticalmethods>there will be a total of 45 participants.
participant responses will be analysed using a split-plot ANOVA, to test for changes in test scores from pre, to post, and at follow-up, and for group comparisons.  Analysis will also include: measures of reliability and validity, convergent and discriminant validity. The dependent variable will be emotional dysregulation. To measure the effectiveness of the program, analysis will be conducted on the dependent variable between measurement at the initial baseline, post the program, and at follow-up.  To measure the effect of intensity and duration, comparison between the groups will be analysed. Attention will also be paid to clinically relevant indicators of change.

If there is considerable missing data a data imputation to estimate missing values will be utilised to estimate missing data that is missing at random. If missing data is substantial and it cannot imputed then a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) approach will be considered, where the treatment groups would be included in the model as random slopes</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has found Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) to be an effective treatment model for adolescents who have a variety of mental health concerns and difficulties coping with their emotions. This study involves the use of an online DBT skills-only training program for the management of emotional dysregulation for young people aged 16-25 years. The study will recruit young people through headspace  and allocate them to either a 4-week, an 8-week, or a TAU+ 4-week online skills training in DBT skills. The study will test the effectiveness of the online skills training program in improving participants emotional regulation and coping skills.  Understanding the role such programs can play and has the potential to greatly benefit clinical practice and further inform prevention and intervention policies. </summary>
