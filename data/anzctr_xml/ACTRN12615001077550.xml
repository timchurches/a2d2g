  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individually prescribed exercise, 3 days per week for 12 weeks. Exercise is prescribed by an exercise physiologist based on the findings from the baseline assessment. Exercise session duration will vary based on individual capacity but will be between 40-60mins. Exercise session will either be individual sessions or group sessions are preferred by the participant. All session are supervised and heart rate and blood pressure monitored. Adherence to the programme will be monitored with an attendance register and any missed sessions will be followed up with a phone call to the participant.
6, one-hour lifestyle education sessions will be provided at fortnightly intervals over the 12-week period. Participants are enrolled as 'clusters' into the programme (between 4 and 10 people) and each cluster will determine the topics of their education sessions themselves with guidance from the research team. Possible topics include nutrition, stress management or Maori health priorities. Education sessions will be facilitated by appropriately qualified and/or experienced individuals. An attendance register will monitor adherence to the education sessions.
Participants will undergo a baseline assessment, have a 6-week wait period (control), have a 2nd assessment, then complete the 12-week programme. A final assessment will be performed after the 12 weeks of intervention.
The programme adheres to kaupapa Maori principles and utilises Sir Professor Mason Duries 'interface space' approach. Within the interface key aspects of the usual care programme can be integrated with key aspects of the Maori world to create a programme that has a 'best of both worlds' approach. Participants will be able to shape the structure of their 12 week programme by applying Maori principles important to them, while the programme still maintain clinical rigour with the exercise and clinical measures</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Maori are disproportionately affected by CVD and innovative, Maori-centric approaches are required to address this inequity. The purpose of this project is to determine the effects of an exercise and lifestyle-management programme for cardiac risk reduction that is embedded within a kaupapa Maori approach. A controlled trial using kaupapa Maori methods, with a cluster wait-list design is proposed. Participants assigned to the intervention are able to redevelop a usual-care cardiac risk reduction programme to embed a Maori worldview. Clinical measures are assessed pre- and post-programme.</summary>
