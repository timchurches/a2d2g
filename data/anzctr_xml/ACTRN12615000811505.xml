  <interventions>
    <interventions>The project will involve two groups - a control group and an intervention group. The practice of the control group will not differ from normal, standard medication administration practice. The intervention group will undertake an investigator-facilitated 30-60 minute education program including viewing a 20 minute DVD with details of the incidence of interruptions, behavioural strategies of managing interruptions and simulations of interruptions and panel discussion by nursing leaders on changing ward culture. A register of all nursing staff within wards will be established and attendance will be monitored.

Ward posters noting "In the interest of patient safety please do not interrupt nurses administering medications" will be placed within patient areas.</interventions>

    <concealment>Cluster level: The study will be described through an educational program to Directors of Nursing and Nursing Unit Managers of potential medical/surgical units from major teaching hospitals within South Western Sydney Local Health District. Participant information sheets and consent forms will also fully describe the study.  Four intervention and four control wards will be selected from a list of potential sites based on geographical location and being general/medical surgical units. Critical care units are excluded from the study. 

To reduce the occurrence of contamination within the trial the wards that are geographically separated for the intervention and control groups and limited within each hospital will be selected. Wards will form a list. Allocation to control or intervention wards will be conducted off-site by a computer-generated randomisation process.
 
Nursing Unit Managers from these units will represent the cluster participant.

Nurse and patient level: In the intervention wards 75% of nurses will attend the educational intervention at the ward level. Only nurses (and coincidentally their patients) who have completed the education intervention will be requested to be observed for the intervention wards. In the control wards nurses (and coincidentally their patients) who voluntarily consent to participate will be observed.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The intra-cluster correlation coefficient was used to calculate sample size. Assuming an intra-cluster coefficient of 0.05 with an average cluster (ward) size of 30 nurses per ward, it was estimated that this would result in an 80% power of detecting procedural errors from 53% (estimates range from 38 to 85%) to 25% in intervention wards. Although these estimations suggest that 8 wards in the intervention and 8 wards in the control group would be required, at this pilot only 4 wards for both the intervention and control wards are being sought. We believe that more precise estimation of the intra-cluster correlation coefficient will provide a better estimate of the requirements for the larger multicentre study. 

The estimated number of 30 patients per ward was taken from separation data indicating that based an average 50-88 patients are separated from Liverpool hospital per month. It is expected that  36 medications per nurse will be observed in one hour, resulting in 30 nurses and 1080 medications being observed per ward.

Kappa statistic will be used to test inter-rater (observer) reliability.

Quantitative data analysis will be undertaken using R version 3.0.1 (R Core Team, 2013) or SPSS.
Summaries of baseline data for both clusters and individuals will be presented as tables.  For observed medication administration procedural and clinical errors (number of interruptions and medication errors (procedural or clinical) per 100 medication administrations or per 100 medication  events) are collected at individual patient level to analyse the intervention effect between the control  and intervention wards.

At the cluster level, unpaired t-tests will be used to compare interruption rates, medication administration errors rates and patient length of stay in control and intervention wards.  As this is a feasibility trail, and a small number of clusters in each arm, Wilcoxon Rank sum test may be required (violation of normality assumption).  At individual level, negative binomial regression accounting for over dispersion, with generalised estimating equations allowing for within cluster correlation will be used to examine the effect of the intervention on medication administration error rates between the intervention and control wards. Analysis of patient length of stay at individual level will be analysed using negative binominal regression with generalised estimating equations allowing for within-cluster correlation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To develop and pilot test an intervention to improve nurses abilities to manage interruptions during the
administration of medications, thereby reducing medication errors and potentially, patients length of stay.
Primary hypothesis: Interruptions associated with medication administration events will be reduced by 40%% where
nurses undertake education and simulation experiences compared to nurses not receiving any education. 

Secondary hypothesis:
There will be a 25% reduction in clinical and procedural errors during medication administration where nurses
undertake and education program and / or simulation experience compared to nurses not receiving any
education.
Design: A CRCT is proposed to test these hypotheses as the simulation experiences, by their nature, need to be applied to groups of nurses or wards.

Clinical and procedural error data will be collected at the nurse level, targeting nurses per ward.

Sample and Setting: clusters of medical and surgical units and nurses (and patients) from SWSLHD hospitals form
the sample. 
Randomisation: wards will be randomly assigned to the education or control arm. Due to the nature of
the intervention, no blinding of ward nurses will be possible. Research staff involved in group allocation and analysis will be blinded to the allocation.

Developing the intervention: Preliminary studies have been completed identifying sources of interruptions, extent of
the problem, and use of behavioural strategies (positive and negative). Cognitive load and processing and
strategies to manage the range of interrupters (nurses, doctors, patients, equipment), combined with strategies
gleaned from focus group studies and observations of nurses form a 20 minute educational program including simulations.
