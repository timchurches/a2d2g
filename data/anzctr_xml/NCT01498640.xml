  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Success - Clinical success defined as reduction in fixed-flexion contracture to less than or equal to 5 degrees 30 days after the last injection of AA4500</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Degree of Contracture - Change in fixed-flection contracture measured in degrees where a decrease of 100% would correspond to a reduction in contracture to 0 degrees</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Range of Motion - Range of motion defined as difference between full flexion angle and full extension angle expressed in degrees</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physician Global Assessment of Improvement - Physician global assessment of change (improvement) in subject's Dupuytren's contracture</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subject Global Assessment of Satisfaction - Subject global assessment of overall treatment satisfaction</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 days after last injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Recurrence of Contracture - Recurrence of contracture in the joint at day 365 that was successfully treated 30 days after last injection assessed. Recurrence was defined as 20 degree or greater increase of contracture of the treated joint at day 365 or medication intervention of the treated joint between the 2 time points.</outcome>
