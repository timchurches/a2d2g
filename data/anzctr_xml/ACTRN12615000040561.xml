  <interventions>
    <interventions>Conventional and ambulatory urodynamic assessment (pressure - flow studies) in patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer and orthotopic Hautmann W - neobladder with Abol Enein - Ghoneim uretero-intestinal anastomosis.
At the beginning of the study, patients are undergone conventional UDS using the Solar Silver (registered trademark) urodynamic device (MMS). The filling rate generally follow the formula weight in kg divided by four in ml/min but this is adjusted accordingly. All patients are in sitting position during the conventional UDS and the duration of conventional UDS is approximately 60 minutes.
Ambulatory UDS is performed subsequently at a date different from that of conventional UDS. On average the duration is approximately 18 hours. This orthograde filling cystometry is performed using the Luna (Wireless- Bluetooth) device with microtip catheters (MMS). Proper placement of the intravesical catheter is checked with the use of ultrasonography.
Each participant undertakes both assessments at baseline only.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>During the last decades, orthotopic reconstruction, following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer, is increasingly used. To date, different segments of intestine and different techniques have been used, aiming to succeed a sufficient functional reservoir capacity and to reduce intravesical pressure for the protection of upper urinary tract. In order to record this neobladder function, conventional urodynamic studies (UDS) has been used. However, this method is being accused that it is not able to mimic the patients symptoms, as they are in real life. In contrast, ambulatory UDS, that uses natural bladder filling, is thought to elicit more representative results. 
According to our knowledge, there is no information in the literature for the comparison of these two methods in patients with orthotopic neobladder substitution after radical cystectomy. For this reason, a record and a comparison of orthograde and retrograde filling cystometry findings was conducted in patients who had undergone modified orthotopic Hautmann neobladder following bladder removal.
