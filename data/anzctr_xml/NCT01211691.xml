  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Key Inclusion Criteria (Phase 1):

        in the Phase 1 portion of the study]).

        Key Inclusion Criteria (Phase 2):

          -  Part A: AML or MDS patients with an acceptable level of EphA3 expression

          -  Part B: MF patients with an acceptable level of EphA3 expression

        Key Inclusion Criteria (Both Phases):

          -  Confirmed hematologic malignancy refractory to or progressed following standard
             treatments, or subjects not considered medically suitable to receive standard of care
             treatment or who refuse standard of care treatment

          -  Acceptable level of EphA3 expression

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) =1

          -  Acceptable laboratory results

          -  For subjects with AML, more than 2 prior therapies for AML (induction and
             consolidation with or without a hypomethylating agent given in a maintenance setting
             are considered 1 therapy)

          -  History of or current central nervous system (CNS) involvement that may increase risk
             of bleeding

          -  Recent major surgery

          -  Ongoing surgical or wound healing complications

          -  Active clinically significant bleeding
