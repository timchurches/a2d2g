    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after discontinuation of treatment (SVR12) - SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, &lt; 25 IU/mL) 12 weeks following the last dose of study drug.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and antiviral efficacy of sofosbuvir (SOF)
      with ribavirin (RBV) in participants with GT 1 and 3 and ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF in participants
      with genotype 1 and 4 HCV infection who have chronic renal insufficiency (impaired kidney
      function).

      Approximately 35 subjects with severe renal insufficiency (not on dialysis) will be enrolled
      in 3 cohorts.

        -  Cohort 1 (GT 1 or 3): 10 subjects will receive SOF 200 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for 24
           weeks.

        -  Cohort 2 (GT 1 or 3): Following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics (PK)
           data through post-treatment Week 4 of Cohort 1, 10 additional subjects will receive SOF
           400 mg + RBV 200 mg once daily for 24 weeks.

        -  Cohort 3 (GT 1 or 4): Following review of safety and available PK data through Week 12
           of Cohort 2, 15 additional subjects will receive LDV/SOF 90/400 mg once daily for 12
           weeks.</summary>
