  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Observational evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may have a role in the causes of
      osteoarthritis (OA) and there are biologically plausible mechanisms to explain this. There
      is, however, no evidence which shows that intervening with vitamin D supplementation can slow
      the progression of OA. This study is to determine if vitamin D supplementation can reduce
      knee pain and slow knee cartilage loss in OA patients comparing with a placebo. Use of MRI
      will provide sensitive measures of knee OA changes.</summary>
