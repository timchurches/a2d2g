  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the intervention group will be given an iPad on discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. They will have it for 4 weeks and during this time will be able to use the iPad and the accompanying applications, in any way they so desire.
Applications loaded on the iPads given to patients will include but are not limited to those which by design facilitate: communication (ie. Speech Sounds on Cue, Conversation TherAppy), cognitive function (Memory, iMazing), dexterity (ie. Dexteria), movement (ie. physiotherapyexercises.com), socialisation (ie. Facebook, Safari for email access) and participation in fun leisure based games (ie. Angry Birds, Uno).

Frequency of use of computer technology (which includes tablet devices such as the iPad, but also computers/smart phones/iPods) will be collected in both the control and intervention group through weekly telephone surveys .</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients that are admitted for rehabilitation of their stroke that have been using an iPad during their admission will be invited to participate in TNT if they meet the aforementioned inclusion criteria.
Once a patient has given informed consent, the site coordinator will (I) collect baseline data including collection of demographic data, administer the pre-stroke technology survey and will administer a battery of measurement tools including the mRS, HADS, MoCA, WAB and SSEQ.
Once all baseline data has been collected, central randomisation by phone will occur (allocation concealment procedures). If randomised to intervention group, the participant will be given an iPad on discharge from the rehabilitation unit.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TNT is a pilot randomised control trial to determine the effect that access to and use of tablet technology within the first month following inpatient stroke rehabilitation has on stroke survivor quality of life. 

The primary aims of our pilot study TNT are to:

1. Determine the effect that access to and use of tablet use has on stroke survivor:quality of life, mood, cognition,
communication, self efficacy and activity participation. 

2. Estimate the frequency and nature of tablet use when stroke survivors are given training and access to tablet
technology within the inpatient rehabilitation and community setting.

We hypothesise that stroke survivors who use an iPad during the first month following discharge from rehabilitation
will experience a better quality of life than those survivors who do not use this technology. Furthermore, we predict
there will be a trend towards better mood, cognition, communication, self efficacy and higher levels of activity
participation in survivors whom have access to iPads. 
Data from this pilot RCT study will be used to inform the
design of future trials to determine the functional efficacy of tablet use during stroke rehabilitation.</summary>
