  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome : By using atherectomy catheters, plaques will be extracted from arteries of patients. Cholesterol content in these plaques will be analyzed. Cohorts receiving rLCAT will be compared to controls.

Tests used : Freezing sections in OCT compound, sectioning and subsequently staining with oil red O to study lipid content.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary Timepoint : Post infusion of rLCAT</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome : Blood will be collected pre- and post- infusion of rLCAT. Changes in fasting lipid profile and inflammatory markers will be compared. Cohorts receiving rLCAT will be compared to controls.

Test used : We will use COBAS to look at lipid profiles. Inflammatory markers will be assessed by using ELSA kits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary Timepoint : Pre and Post infusion of rLCAT</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome : From blood collected, we can determine the effects of rLCAT on existing LCAT levels in patients and (if possible) look at pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of rLCAT as well.

Test used : LCAT will be assessed by using ELSA kits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary Timepoints : Pre and Post infusion of rLCAT</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome : From blood collected, we can determine the change, if any, in functionality of HDL by observing cholesterol efflux. 

Test used : In-house in vitro system where plasma is incubated with cells containing labelled cholesterol.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary Timepoints : Pre and Post infusion of rLCAT</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether rLCAT, when given to patients can lead to changes in the composition of plaque in the leg arteries and to changes in the amount of cholesterol and inflammation in the blood. From laboratory studies, rLCAT shows promising outcomes in terms of its ability to remove cholesterol from cells and animal models. Hence, we hypothesize it will have a similar effect in patients.</summary>
