    <interventions>This is an observational study. Disease activity will be observed before and 6 months after starting biological therapy. The biological therapy used will be determined by the treating physician on a case by case basis. There will be one observation immediately  prior to starting biological therapy. Duration of therapy will be determined by the treating physician depending on response, tolerability and adverse effects</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common condition affecting 1-2% of the population. Early intensive treatment that effectively suppresses the disease is required to prevent irreversible joint damage. Many patients require the newer expensive biologic therapies, access to which is determined by PHARMAC rules. However it is not possible to predict which patients will respond to treatment.  Furthermore, patients receive the same dose regimen, which does not allow for differences between patients in how the drug is cleared from the body. Measuring concentrations of drug in the blood may allow better patient outcomes by adjusting the dose regimen. Furthermore, some patients receiving biological therapies may develop antibodies against the drug. The effect of these antibodies on blood concentrations of the drug, or response to the drug or subsequent treatments, is not well established. This study aims to address these issues by measuring drug concentrations and anti-drug antibodies and relating these to treatment effectiveness.</summary>
