  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a randomised controlled clinical trial with two parallel arms conducted under double-blind and placebo-controlled conditions on 84 participants aged 18 years or more, who have completed their acute stage of breast cancer treatment. 
One standard dose (10gr. in granule format) of Chinese herbal medicine, Shu Gan Liang Xue Decoction, dissolved in warm water and taken orally twice per day for 12 weeks, followed by a wash-out period of 4 weeks and then cross-over to the other arm of the trial.
Participants will be asked to mark in their Hot Flush Daily Diary if they miss any doses and will return all unused doses at next visit.</interventions>
    <comparator>One standard dose of Chinese herbal medicine placebo, dissolved in warm water and taken orally twice per day for 12 weeks, followed by a wash-out period of 4 weeks and then cross-over to the other arm of the trial. 
Placebo control:  placebo will be matched to the herbal medicine in colour, taste, texture and smell. The placebo consists of dextrin 86%, sucrose 5%, caramel 3.6%, citric acid 1.7%, leaf of broadleaf holly 3.5%, gardenia yellow 300 0.1%, sunset yellow 87 0.05%, lemon yellow 85 0.05% = 100%.  The interventions will be manufactured in accordance with Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Australia and Good Manufacturing Process (GMP) guidelines. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated in consulation with a professional statistician at Western Sydney University.  Allowing for a 25% drop in frequency of hot flushes due to placebo effect we define minimum clinically important improvement to be twice the size of the placebo effect (50% decrease in frequency). We expect the mean frequency to be 6 with a standard deviation of 4 at baseline and estimate the required sample size is 48 to produce 80% power to detect the difference between 25% decrease (placebo) and 50% decrease (treatment), using a two-sided matched pairs t-test with 5% significance level.  Assuming an attrition rate of 30%, based on earlier research, a target sample of 84 participants is required.
Statistical analysis will be SPSS based. The primary analysis is intention-to-treat with baseline frequency and treatment order as predictors.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a Chinese herbal medicine (SGLXD) can reduce hot flushes/night sweats in women treated for breast cancer. 

Who is it for?
You may eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with Stage 1-3 breast cancer, for which you have completed surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and are experiencing hot flushes/night sweats.

Trial details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to either group 1 or group 2 for 12 weeks of treatment. After this there is a 4-week period with no treatment then you are crossed-over to the other group for a further 12-week period. One 12 week treatment period will consist of two daily doses of the Chinese herbal medicine, Shu Gan Liang Xue Decoction dissolved in warm water and taken orally. The formula has been used at Beijing University Cancer Hospital by Professor Li and has been proven to be safe and effective in studies in China. During the other 12 week treatment period you will take an inactive placebo. 

Participants are required to undergo blood tests at 3 time points during the study and fill out a hot flush diary and quality of life forms. You are required to visit the hospital every 4 weeks to hand in the forms and receive 4-week supply of the treatment intervention. Pre-and post treatment differences in results of hot flush scores, quality of life scores and blood tests will be assessed between groups. Study results may contribute to achieving a novel intervention alternative therapeutic option to alleviate hot flushes and improve quality of life for Australian women treated for breast cancer.</summary>
