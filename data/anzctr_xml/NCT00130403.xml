    <inclusivecriteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA include:

             least 24 mos prior to enrollment

          -  Dosing regimens allowable are continuous (ie, uninterrupted) daily or weekly
             formulations of risedronate (5 mg once daily [OD] or 35 or 30 mg once a week [OAW]) or
             alendronate (10 mg OD or 70 mg OAW), for a minimum of 24 months prior to enrollment
             into study

          -  Lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-score 1ess than or equal to -2.0 and &gt;/= 1 prevalent
             osteoporotic fracture, or lumbar spine or total hip BMD T-score less than or equal to
             -2.5 with or without and &gt;/= 1 prevalent osteoporotic fracture. The qualifying values
             must be documented prior to enrollment

          -  Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) between 16 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml

          -  Urine NTX &lt;50 nmol/mmol creatinine (to assure treatment compliance and bone turnover
             is in the pre-menopausal range)

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA include:

          -  Impaired renal function, demonstrated by creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min

          -  Any condition or disease that may interfere with the evaluation of at least 2 lumbar
             vertebrae (not necessarily contiguous), determined in a screening radiograph by a
             radiologist at the central facility (eg, confluent aortic calcifications, severe
             osteoarthritis, spinal fusion, lumbar spine fractures)

          -  Depot injection vitamin D &gt;10,000 IU in the past 9 months prior to starting the
             investigational product

          -  Treatment with antiresorptive agents other than risedronate, alendronate, and hormone
             replacement therapy within the last 36 months before study entry (ie, ibandronate,
             pamidronate, etidronate, raloxifene, clodronate, or zoledronate)

          -  Use of combination alendronate and risedronate, either simultaneously or sequentially,
             within 60 months prior to enrollment, or use of any anti-resorptive agent in
             combination with risedronate or alendronate</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To determine how prior therapy with alendronate or risedronate in postmenopausal women with
      osteoporosis influences the clinical effectiveness of teriparatide; The primary objective of
      the study is to compare the teriparatide (human, recombinant PTH[1-34])-associated change
      from baseline in a marker of bone formation, N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP),
      between subjects previously treated with risedronate and those previously treated with
      alendronate.</summary>
