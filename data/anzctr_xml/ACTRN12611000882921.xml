  <interventions>
    <interventions>Alcohol will be administered to the intervention group orally via consumption of high strength spirits (e.g. 30ml nip of vodka, 40% alc. Volume) in one session only. Alcohol dosage will be administered according to the gender, age and weight of the participant over a 30 minute period with the intention of attaining a blood alcohol content of 0.08  0.12. Two-point discrimination will be assessed by trained physiotherapists using a commercially available tool.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are looking to investigate the effect of alcohol on simultaneous touch sensation.

There are specific areas within the brain that are vital for deciphering touch. When two areas of skin are touched simultaneously, some of these brain areas are excited and some are inhibited. A greater ability to determine between two simultaneous stimuli (a reduction Two Point Discrimination threshold) has been associated with increased inhibition in the brain.
Recent research has shown that alcohol can increase inhibition within the brain. With this in mind we look to explore the possibility that alcohol could improve tactile acuity, lowering the Two Point Discrimination threshold.</summary>
