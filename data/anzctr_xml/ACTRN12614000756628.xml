    <studytitle>A randomized controlled trial of a novel visualisation technique to improve emotional control in patients with depression in primary care.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with depression in primary care with a PHQ-9 score between 10 and 20 will be given a novel visualisation technique and advised to exercise regularly and given sleep hygiene advice versus advised to exercise regularly and given sleep hygiene advice with the outcome at 8 weeks of a PHQ-9 score &lt;7 or a score of &lt; 6 on the self reported Montgomery-Asberg scale. </scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Interventions (known as the Noval technique)
1.Coached in a drug free process for the client (one on one basis) on how to take themselves out of a state of depression with a novel visualisation technique. The clients will be coached through what depression is and a strategy for transitioning from depression to being happy using the novel visualisation technique. Clients will get to observe themselves internally as they transition through these states.
a. Observing a state that is symptomatic of depression.
b. Observe a state that is symptomatic of being happy.
c. Coached on how to get out of the state of being depressed.
d. Coached on staying in a state of being happy.
e. One week follow up to check client progress and reinforce their new awareness.
g. A final interview at the end of the 8 week clinical trial.
h. The intervention group will also get the sleep and exercise programme.
The intervention group will be a one time intervention at baseline lasting appromximately 45 minutes. The sleep and exercise programme is the same for intervention and control groups. There are  no stategies to monitor adherence. We are testing a one off Noval as the intervention. The verbal advice will be given face to face and this takes about 15 minutes.

    <comparator>Sleep and Exercise Programme-for intervention and control group
1.Sleep hygiene instructions and rationale
Instruction Rationale
Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that can delay sleep onset and impair sleep quality; people vary in their ability to metabolise these substances from their system; some people use alcohol to help them get to sleep because it relaxes them, but it may cause awakenings and reduce sleep quality later in the sleep. Therefore limit of caffeine to 1 cup of coffee in the morning (if at all), avoid alcohol and cigarettes at night, and limit other substances that can affect sleep. People do not fall asleep if their brain is wide awake, so going to bed before they are sleepy leads to frustration at not being able to sleep, which can further delay sleep onset; peoples sleep patterns and needs may not match those of their bed partners 

Avoid going to bed until you are drowsy and ready to sleep

Napping reduces the sleep pressure that builds up during the day to the point where a threshold is reached and we are ready to sleep; napping may delay the time of readiness for sleep and lead to erratic bedtimes, especially if the person can sleep in to compensate for a later bedtime (leading to a domino effect for the day after); if naps have been taken during the day, and the usual bedtime is kept, sleep onset may be delayed, leading to frustration and anxiety, which further prolongs sleep onset.

Avoid napping during the day

Regular daily exercise can help improve sleep, but avoid Exercise, too close to a sleep period, can serve as an arousal stimulus. 

The bed should be comfortable, the temperature not too hot or cold, the room dark, and noise minimised;discomfort, being too hot or cold, noise, and light can disrupt sleep.

Ensure that the bedtime environment is comfortable and
conducive to sleep

Looking at a computer screen in the hours before bed may delay sleep onset (the light waves emitted are thought to reduce the production of melatonin, a hormone that is secreted by the pineal gland to promote sleep); looking at a clock during awakenings can delay sleep onset by contributing to frustration at being awake (lit clocks may also contribute arousal stimuli to the brain); if co-sleepers are disturbing sleep (by excessive movements or snoring) they probably warrant their own assessment for sleep disorders 

Think about computer screens, clocks, and co-sleepers
The thought behind this idea is that bed needs to be associated with being asleep not with being awake and having difficulty getting to sleep. If not asleep within 15-20 minutes, get out of bed and return only when drowsy.

3. Exercise 
a. Participants will be asked to do regular exercise that involves an activity such as brisk walking for 30 minutes at least 3 times per week.

4. Both intervention and control group get the sleep and exercise advice-verbally by face to face interaction. This is done as a one off intervention and not repeated. There is no mechanism to monitor their adherence.

    <sequence>Patients are randomised to the control group or treatment arm by way of the standard built-in random number generator on the server. This produces a random number between zero (assignment to the control group) and one (assignment to the intervention arm-there are only two arms to this trial). Each time the application launches, the random number generator is initialized with a random value, which is obtained from the system clock</sequence>

All statistical tests will be two-tailed. Logistic regression models will also be used for the primary and secondary outcomes to adjust for clinically important baseline variables. We expect 50% of the control group to improve and 79% of the intervention group to improve which means we need 48 participants each in the two arms beta 0.2 alpha 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be conducted using a 2-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial. Randomisation will be at the level of the individual patient. Depresssed participants will be offered one of two interventions to make them blind to their actual intervention. Intervention: One group will get the the NoVal technique, and the control group will be usual care. Both groups will get exercise and sleep advice in addition to the Noval and the usual care (control group). </summary>
