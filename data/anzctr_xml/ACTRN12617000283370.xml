  <interventions>
    <interventions>To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine containing 20 mg artemether+ 120 mg lumefantrine in each tablet will be given twice daily for three days according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. The total target dose ranges are 5-24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29-144 mg/kg bw of lumefantrine.
All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The two drugs will be tested separately. The patient will be given artemether+lumefantrine and will be followed up for 28 days.

    <statisticalmethods>Minimum sample size
Treatment failure rate artemether-lumefantrine in the study areas is assumed to be 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per site. 

Analysis of data
The WHO Excel software programme for therapeutic efficacy database will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine  for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in two sites in Yemen.
Purpose: To assess the efficacy of the current first and/or second line treatment policy; 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine  for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.
Study Sites: Al Udayn, Ibb governorate and in Bajil, Al Hudeida governorate.
Study Period: April to November 2017.
Study Design: One arm prospective study.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months and above, excluding female minors 12-17 years old and unmarried females aged 18 years and above, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. The female minors and unmarried females will be excluded as subjecting them to pregnancy testing is unacceptable according to the local customs and cultures.
Sample Size: 88 patients per site.
Treatment(s) and follow-up: Artemether/lumefantrine, Novartis, Basel Switzerland], a fixed combination of 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet)] will be administered according to the recommended weight bands as follows: One tablet to those weighing 5-14 kg; two tablets for 15-24 kg; three tablets for 25-34 kg and four tablets for greater or equal to 35 kg. The full course of treatment for all study patients consists of 6-doses given twice daily over 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events
to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for name of the antimalarial drug(s) resistance.
