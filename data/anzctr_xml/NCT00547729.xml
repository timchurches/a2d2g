  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most people with heart failure take a number of medications that work in different ways.
      Patients and their families need to keep track of prescribed medications and follow
      instructions on how much to take and when to take them. Currently, doctors are guided
      primarily by symptoms. The device being studied in this trial (called the HeartPOD System)
      monitors heart function from inside your body and alerts the patient and physician of
      necessary changes to your medication.</summary>
