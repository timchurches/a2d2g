Other interventions - Standard nutritional drink

Experimental: Intervention (study nutritional drink) - Study nutritional drink comes in the form of a sachet to mix with water &amp; take twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening).
The drink will be taken before the participant becomes pregnant (for up to 1 year) and throughout pregnancy.

Active Comparator: Control (standard nutritional drink) - Standard nutritional drink comes in the form of a sachet to mix with water &amp; take twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening).
The drink will be taken before the participant becomes pregnant (for up to 1 year) and throughout pregnancy.


Other interventions: Study nutritional drink
Study nutritional drink containing a mix of micronutrients, probiotics and myo-inositol.

Other interventions: Standard nutritional drink
Standard nutritional drink containing a mix of micronutrients.
