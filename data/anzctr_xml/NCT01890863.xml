    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria

          -  Males and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator determines that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body mass index within the range 18 to 35 kilograms/meter squared (m^2) (inclusive).

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

        Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
        ligation or hysterectomy (for this definition, "documented" refers to the outcome of the
        investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as
        obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records); or
        postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases a
        blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone &gt; 40 milli international
        unit/mililiter [mL] and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/mL [&lt;147 picomoles/liter] is confirmatory.
        Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will
        be required to use one of the contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT
        during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of
        post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4
        weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval
        depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
        status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

        Child-bearing potential with negative pregnancy test as determined by serum human chorionic
        gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing.

        Agrees to use one of the contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as
        determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to
        sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to
        use contraception until 2 days post-last dose.

        OR has only same-sex partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;= 1.5xupper limit of
             normal (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated
             and direct bilirubin &lt;35 %).

          -  Based on single or averaged QT interval corrected (QTc) values of triplicate
             electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief recording period: QT duration
             corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula (QTcF)&lt;450 millisecond (msec), and QT
             duration corrected for heart rate by Bazett's formula (QTcB)&lt;480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block.</inclusivecriteria>

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units for males or &gt;14 units for females. In Australia
             one unit (= standard drink) is equivalent to 10 grams of alcohol: 270 mL of full
             strength beer (4.8%), 375mL of mid strength beer (3.5%), 470 mL of light beer (2.7%),
             250 mL pre-mix full strength spirit (5%), 100 mL of wine (13.5%) and 30 mL of spirit
             (40%)

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) of Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol
      combination (FSC) 100/50 micrograms (mcg) delivered via the capsule-based inhaler (Rdpi)
      relative to FSC 100/50 mcg delivered via the multi-dose dry powder inhaler (Ddpi) to
      establish whether the Rdpi inhaler has exposure (in terms of fluticasone propionate area
      under time concentration curve [AUC] and Salmeterol maximum concentration [Cmax]) no greater
      than 1.2500 compared to the Ddpi, sufficient to allow progression to Phase 3. This study will
      enroll 36 healthy adult male and female subjects and each subject will be allocated to one of
      two sequences and will participate in four treatment periods, receiving each of the
      treatments twice.</summary>
