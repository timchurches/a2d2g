  <interventions>
    <interventions>15 subjects with crack dependence will receive oral disulfiram 250mg daily for 60 days and 15 subjects with crack dependence will receive placebo for 60 days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some clinical trials have demonstrated success with the administration of 250mg a day of disulfiram in patients with alcohol abuse and cocaine and this effect was attributed to dopamine potentiating properties. Possibly disulfiram inhibits the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which is involved in the catabolism of neurotransmissor.Activation of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (pleasure center) is one of the biological theories of dependency on drugs. Disulfiram blocks also prevents plasma and microsomal enzymes responsible for metabolism of cocaine in his pathways. However, the was no study that evaluated efficacy and safety of dissulfiram in crack dependence. In the present study 30 subjects with crack dependence will be allocate in two groups: to receive dissulfiram 250mg per day by 60 days and to receive placebo by 60 days. The two groups will participate of psychological and occupational therapy treatment. The outcomes measure will be mean number of day without drug use, mean number of drug miligrams used in a week, side effects, presencer or not of craving. Our hyphotesis is that dissulfiram will be effective and safe for crack treatment.</summary>
