    <interventions>A retrospective observational trial where critically ill children subjected to acute kidney injury undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are characterized. Patients are identified in the ICU database. The patients are primary studied to elucidate if ability to achieve or not to achieve negative water balance within the first 72 hours after CRRT is initiated is associated with increased mortality rate. The patients are observed during the entire PICU stay. </interventions>

Potential predictors of mortality (where water balance during the first 72 hours after CRRT initiation is the primary variable) will be analyzed by univariate logistic regression followed by step-wise backward multiple logistic regression using the software NCSS 2007, Kaysville, Utah. Only factors with p &lt; 0.1 will be used in the multiple logistic regression.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute kidney injury is common in the PICU and is associated with fluid overload. Increasing degrees of fluid overload at the time of CRRT initiation is associated with increased mortality.  It is unknown if the ability to achieve negative water balance is related to outcome, circuit life span and infectious control in children. 
The main purpose of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the association between possible inability to achieve negative water balance within 72 hours after CRRT initiation in critically ill children and mortality. We will retrospectively include all patients subjected to acute kidney injury and undergoing CRRT admitted to our PICU. The period of inclusion is set from 2009 until 2016.   </summary>
