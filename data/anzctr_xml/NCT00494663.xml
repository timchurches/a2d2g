  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>DiObex Inc. is developing an experimental drug (DIO-902) that is made up of part of the
      ketoconazole molecule for the treatment of elevated blood glucose associated with type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Ketoconazole (NizoralÂ®) is a drug available by prescription for the
      treatment of fungal infections however DIO-902 is an investigational drug. DIO-902 may lower
      blood glucose by lowering levels of a naturally occurring hormone called cortisol. Elevated
      cortisol may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.

      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of DIO-902 when taken by mouth with
      metformin and the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin to determine the type and severity
      of any side effects from this treatment.

      Other purposes of the study are to see how the treatment affects your blood glucose levels,
      cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and waist circumference.</summary>
