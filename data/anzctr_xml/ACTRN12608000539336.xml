  <interventions>
    <interventions>Advance care planning. This involves a nurse or other health professional to come and discuss an individuals future health wishes. Generally this is done with family members also present. This usually takes between 1 and 2 hours over 1-3 visits during the hospital stay. The patients will then be followed for 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual treatment is the normal treatments someone receives when they are admitted to hospital with any type of medical  problem. There is no universal usual treatment as it varies with the medical condition, but would include tests, medication and other treatments as required. The control treatment will occur for 6 months.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wishes known and respected. This will be measured via telephone questionnaires, involving the deceased patients nominated relative, and via review of the patients hospital file</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>outcome of advance care planning. This is measured by a telephone questionnaire to a relative (the appropriate relative is decided at the time the person is enrolled, and the relative consents to be interviewed if the patient subsequently dies. Some of these are novel questionnaires, and the IES (Impact of events scale, and the HADS - hospital anxiety and depression scale) will also be used</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many patients would like to have a say in their future health care treatment choices. Currently for many people they don't get this opportunity, as they are not routinely asked, or they may become unconscious, confused or very sick, and may not be able to participate in their medical decision making. We propose that  a formal program aimed at making advance care planning available will allow people to express their wishes, and have their end of life wishe=s respected. We also think that advance care planning may lessen the stress placed on relatives around the time of the persons death.</summary>
