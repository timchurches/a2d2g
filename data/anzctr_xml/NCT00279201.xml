  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare insulin lispro low mixture [LM] and insulin glargine both in
      combination with the patient's oral diabetes medicines, for their ability to control blood
      sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes and compare insulin lispro LM to insulin glargine with
      regard to the length of time that the overall blood sugar can be controlled.

      This study will also determine whether the safety of insulin lispro LM and any side effects
      that might be associated with it are different from those observed with insulin glargine,
      both in combination with the patient's oral diabetes medications.

      The addendum study (Intensification Addendum) will compare how different insulin treatments
      work to control blood sugar in patients whose diabetes could not be controlled by either
      insulin lispro LM or insulin glargine.</summary>
