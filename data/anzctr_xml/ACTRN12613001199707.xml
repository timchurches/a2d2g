  <interventions>
    <interventions>During caeserean delivery, after applying low transverse segment incision, as a surgical option the incision is expansed either bluntly with finger laterally or sharply with scissors laterally. The intraoperatively maternal blood loss and unintended extensions of insicion is determined.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>maternal blood loss that will be determined by calculation the difference in the postoperative and preoperative weight of surgical drapes and towels.Also, the difference between the initial hematocrit and the final hematocrit (24 h after the operation) was evaluated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>intraoperatively and also postoperative 24 hour.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>unintended extension of incision evaluated as any defect beyond original incision.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>postpartum endometritis diagnosed as the presence of postoperative fever (&gt;38 degrees celcius on two occasions and 6 h apart after the first postoperative day) and as at least two of the following symptoms: uterine tenderness, foul smelling lochia and leukocytosis (white cell count &gt;15,000/ml). </outcome>
      <timepoint>first postoperative day</timepoint>
