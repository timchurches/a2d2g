  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: placebo tRNS
Group 2: active tRNS 

For tRNS:
a) Dose administered: 1 mA for 10 minutes with 60 seconds ramp up and ramp down at the beginning and end of each stimulation session.
b) Frequency of stimulation: 3 times a week for 2 weeks.
c) Treatment will be administered by a trained Assistant Research Fellow
d) Mode of administration: external head device (Starstim system- NE neuroelectrics) worn with electrodes on anterior cingulate cortex (4 cathodes at F7, T3, F8 and T4; 1 anode at Fz)
e) Monitoring adherence using Case Report Forms</interventions>
    <comparator>For placebo tRNS, current will be applied at 1mA for 60 seconds ramp up and 3 seconds ramp down before terminating. tRNS device will be worn at the same frequency and duration as intervention group.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food craving will be assessed using the Oxford Leeds Questionnaire ( a validated computer task to measure food craving). Participants will be shown different paired presentation of food items (96 trials) and will be asked to select their most wanted food as quickly and as accurately as possible. Participants will not be aware of the measurement of their reaction time for the choices they make allowing a covert assessment for implicit motivational wanting of a particular food.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, after tRNS, week 4, and week 6 after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Day to day craving. Information on the food being craved for will be self-reported on a daily basis in a questionnaire designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, week 6 after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Liking of food. The validated Leeds-Oxford questionnaire will be used to assess food liking. Participants will be shown a single food item and will be asked to rate "how pleasant would you find the taste of this food right now?" on a visual analogue scale (100-unit).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, after tRNS and week 6 after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety. Electroencephalogram (EEG) using a 19 electrode cap on a Mitsar -201 system will be conducted.  Participants will be asked to consume a liquid meal (Sanitarium Up and GO) until they reach satiety.
Fasting EEG will be recorded and a second EEG will be conducted to assess 'peak satiety'. The participant will be allowed to leave the clinic thereafter and asked to return at 360 minutes for another follow-up EEG.
During this process, participants will also be asked to complete a numerical rate scale to assess hunger and satiety at fasting state, at peak satiety, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, after tRNS, 6 weeks after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Genetic markers. Blood sample will be collected to assess for TaqA1 alleles of dopamine D2 receptor and the opioid receptor OPRM1 gene.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological and behavioural outcomes.

 Participants will be given the following questionnaires.
a) Addictive Tendency Questionnaire - A 96-item questionnaire measuring addictive tendencies across 12 domains.
b) Intuitive Eating Scale (IES) - A 21-item questionnaire assessing eating in response to hunger and satiety cues rather than situational and emotional cues.
c) Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) - A 51-item questionnaire assessing restrained, emotional and external eating.
d) Mindful Eating Scale - A 28-item questionnaire measuring mindful eating (i.e., being aware of and appreciating the effects of food on the senses).
e)  Binge Eating Scale - A 16-item questionnaire assessing the presence of binge eating which may be indicative of an eating disorder.
f) Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS)  Behavioural Activation System (BAS) questionnaire - A 20-item scale measuring the two motivational systems (inhibition and activation) underlying behaviour and affect.
g) Hypomanic Personality Scale - A 48-item questionnaire assessing stable hypomanic traits.
h) State/Trait Food Cravings Questionnaires - A 36-item questionnaire assessing temporal and situational states of food craving.
i) Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II)  A 21-item self-reported inventory for measuring severity of depression.*
j) Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  A 21-item self-reported inventory for measuring severity of anxiety.*

* Participants will be asked to complete the BDI-II and BAI after their physical and vital signs evaluation to screen for depression and anxiety. 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Aside from the BDI-II and BAI used to screen for depression and anxiety, the rest of the questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 8 weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>In order to provide 80% power to detect a difference of 0.07 in mean food craving (SD 0.06) using two-sided tests at the 0.05 level, without making any assumptions about the correlation between baseline and follow-up values, 14 participants are needed in each group (treatment tRNS vs placebo tRNS).

Twenty participants (10 in each group) will be recruited followed by an interim analyses of the data. Depending on the results from the interim analyses (treatment versus placebo), the trial may be terminated earlier.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Functional brain imaging studies have shown dysfunctional neural activity in the cortical reward system network of obese individuals. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis would be that altering this pathological state using techniques of non-invasive neuromodulation may prove to be a therapeutic option. To date, no studies have used transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)  in the treatment of obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to use (tRNS) to target the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as part of the addictive network in 28 obese food-addicted individuals (as defined by the Yale Food Addiction Scale, YFAS) to investigate the effects on craving/wanting and brain activity. </summary>
