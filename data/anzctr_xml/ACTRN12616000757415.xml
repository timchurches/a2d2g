  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 16-week exercise intervention will increase moderate to vigorous physical activity towards a weekly target of &gt;150 minutes. The program includes a weekly, 45 minute individual session with an exercise physiologist. Within each session, participants will undertake supervised exercise training, discuss strategies to improve weekly PA and an individualised, strategic exercise program will be agreed between the health professional and patient for each week to enable patients to incrementally move towards attaining the goal physical activity target within 8 weeks of the program.

Supervised exercise, alternating between treadmill walking, cycling, and rowing, will be conducted with a target heart rate of &gt;85% peak HR (determined from baseline exercise testing) for four-minute bouts repeated four times and separated by 2 minutes of light activity as a recovery.

Home exercise will be prescribed in the moderate intensity domain with a target heart rate of 70-75% peak HR. Alternatively, patients will be prescribed activities according to the ratings of perceived exertion scale (target 12-13). The frequency of home exercise will be increased from 2 sessions per week initially, to 4 sessions per week by 3 months. Similarly, the duration of each session will begin with 20 minutes, increasing to 30 minutes by 12 weeks 

Patients will maintain a journal detailing their physical activity and exercise habits. If required, additional sessions will be scheduled. 24-hour telephone and email support will be accessible to the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>A usual care control group will be issued with written advice regarding physical activity (as per American Heart Association guidelines) at commencement of their participation in the study. Patients in the usual care group will receive risk factor management at the discretion of their treating physician. All other medical care will continue as per best-practice guidelines outlined by the American College of Cardiology and Heart Rhythm Society.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with atrioventricular block and/or sinus node disease are commonly characterised by impaired functional capacity. Exercise training improves cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life and measures of heart function. However, there is little evidence regarding the benefits of exercise training in patients requiring a pacemaker. This study will assess the benefits of exercise in this cohort, when compared with usual medical care.</summary>
