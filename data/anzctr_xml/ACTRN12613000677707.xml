  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection (Biomet Biologics), injected intra-tendonously. This will be performed only once during the trial. Patents receiving the PRP procedure will have 55 mls of blood taken. The blood is placed in a balanced centrifuge and spun for 15 minutes. The resulting 7 mL (approx) of platelet-rich plasma is then injected.</interventions>
    <comparator>A single injection of Celestone Chronodose (cortisone), 5.7ml as a single dose, injected intra-tendonously. Patients receiving the Cortisone treatment will have 55 mls blood taken. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial's main purpose is to test the effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections in patients who have painful gluteal tendonopathies. The trial aims to see if PRP use in patients who have gluteal tendonopathies reduces pain and improves functional levels at 12 weeks follow-up, compared to cortisone injection. No data exist on the use of PRP in gluteal tendonopathies. A small, uncontrolled study carried out by the investigators showed promising results. Therefore we want to study the use of PRP injections in patients with gluteal tendonopathy prospectively, in a double-blind randomised, controlled trial. </summary>
