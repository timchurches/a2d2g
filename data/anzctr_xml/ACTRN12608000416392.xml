  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants (intervention group and comparator group) will be prescribed metformin and participate in a diet and exercise program. The diet and exercise program will be the same for all participants except for the macronutrient content of the diet. The intervention diet is moderate carbohydrate and increased protein. Carbohydrate will provide 40 to 45% of energy and protien will provide 25 to 30% of energy. The energy level will be tailored on an individual basis to incorporate an energy restriction of approximately 500-1000 kilojoules (kJ)/day. Particpants will be encourage to stay on the diet for 12 months.Individual, face to face, dietary instruction will be given by a dietitian (6 consultations of 30 to 60 minutes, over 12 months) which will be supported by computer/phone support (8 contacts of 5 to 10 minutes, over 12 months) according to a pre established schedule</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants (intervention group and comparator group) will be prescribed metformin and participate in a diet and exercise program. The diet and exercise program will be the same for all participants except for the macronutrient content of the diet. The comparator goup will be high carbohydrate, low fat diet. Carbohydrate will provide 55 to 60% of energy and protien will provide 10 to 15% of energy. The energy level will be tailored on an individual basis to incorporate an energy restriction of approximately 500-1000 kJ/day.Particpants will be encourage to stay on the diet for 12 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity in adolescents is a major public health problem in Australia and the prevalence is increasing.  Along with the rise in prevalence of obesity there has been a dramatic increase in the number of adolescents with insulin resistance and/or pre-diabetes.
It is essential that insulin resistance/pre-diabetes in adolescents be targeted for early intervention. Unmanaged it is likely to progress to type 2 diabetes and early cardiovascular disease. Development of type 2 diabetes in adolescence is of particular concern as complications are common and appear early in the disease. However, there is only limited evidence to guide management of clinical insulin resistance in young people.
The aim of this study is to establish an evidence based management plan for these adolescents by undertaking a randomised control trial designed to examine the role of dietary protein in improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic profile.</summary>
