  <interventions>
    <interventions>The experimental intervention will be based on the principles of progressive-resistance training. The intervention will be delivered to one leg, 3 times a week, over an 8-week period. Participants will perform two sets of 6 X 10 leg extension exercises against a weighted resistance. The first set of 6 X 10 leg extension exercises will require participants to voluntarily and maximally contract their quadriceps muscles with ES superimposed. The second set of 6 X 10 leg extension exercises will not require participants to voluntarily contract their quadriceps muscles. Instead this set will be done with ES alone. During both sets participants will extend the knee against resistance equivalent to 10 repetitions maximum (10 RM). There will be a 3 minute rest after each 10 lifts.

The resistance will be applied through a device specifically designed for the purpose. Briefly, the device will consist of a wheel attached to a leg bar. A weight will be hung from a rope which wraps around the wheel and attaches to the leg bar. The participant will be required to extend the knee against the leg bar. This will necessitate lifting the weight suspended from the wheel. Training of experimental lower limb increased according to the principles of progressive resistance training. That is, if participants could lift the weight more than 10 times per set, the weight was too light and increased. In the experimental lower limb this progression also involved increasing stimulation intensity as tolerated up to 100 mA</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will recieve no intervention or placebo intervention. All participants will be living in the community and most will not be receiving any other related health care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee extension strength: A Biodex dynamometer will be used to measure peak isokinetic knee extension torque. Initially the torque generated by the weight of the leg will be measured by passively moving the knee through range. Participants will then be required to perform six maximal effort knee extension contractions at 30 degrees.sec-1, between a 100 degree and 165 degree range of the biodex. There will be a 60 second rest between each trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to allocation) and 8 weeks later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee extension fatigue ratio: A Biodex dynamometer will be used to measure knee extension fatigue ratio at 20 degrees.sec-1, between a 100 degrees and 165 degree range. Participants will be required to perform repeated maximal knee extension contractions over a 3-minute period. Each dynamic contraction will last for 3 seconds followed by a 3 second rest. If the joint range of motion is limited, the speed will be reduced accordingly. The fatigue ratio will be represented by average strength over the first five contractions divided by average strength over the last five contractions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to allocation) and 8 weeks later.</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Participants will be asked to identify and rate three goals of therapy related to leg function.  The rating will a 10-point scale based on task importance,  task performance and outcome satisfaction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to allocation) and 8 weeks later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stimulated knee extension strength: A Biodex dynamometer will be used to measure stimulated peak isokinetic knee extension torque. A Biodex dynamometer will be used to measure stimulated knee extension strength at 30 degrees.sec-1. The quadriceps muscles will be maximally stimulated whilst the participant's leg is passively moved through range. There will be a 60 second rest between each trial.  Stimulation will be delivered at either 100mA or the maximum intensity tolerated by the participant. The best effort will be selected and recorded.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stimulated knee extension fatigue ratio: A Biodex dynamometer will be used to measure stimulated knee extension fatigue ratio at 20 degrees.sec-1. Participants will be required to perform repeated passive maximal dynamic knee extension contractions over a 3-minute period with electrical stimulation. Each contraction will last 3 seconds followed by a  second rest. The quadriceps muscles will be maximally stimulated at the same time. Stimulation will be delivered at either 100mA or the maximum intensity tolerated by the participant. The fatigue ratio will be represented by average strength over the first five contractions divided by average strength over the last five contractions.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical impression of change: At the completion of the trial participants will be asked to rate their impressions of change in strength on a 15-point scale where -7 indicates ?a very great deal worse?, 0 indicates ?no change? and +7 indicates ?a very great deal better?.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of delivering electrical stimulation in conjunction with traditional strength training in the quadriceps muscles of people with incomplete spinal cord injuries.  The study will be undertaken over an eight-week period. This research can help physiotherapists understand how best to strengthen weak muscles in persons with incomplete spinal cord injuries. The quadriceps muscles are being used as a model to determine the effectiveness of regular electrical stimulation and strength training to all large muscle groups.</summary>
