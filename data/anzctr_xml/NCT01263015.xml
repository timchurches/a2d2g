  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of Subjects Responding Based on Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 - The percentage of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 was assessed. Plasma samples were collected for the quantitative assessment of HIV-1 RNA based on the Missing, Switch, or Discontinuation equals Failure (MSDF) algorithm,as codified by the Food and Drug Administration's Snapshot algorithm. This algorithm treats all participants without HIV-1 RNA data at the visit of interest (due to missing data or discontinuation of investigationl product prior to the visit window) as non-responders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant antiretroviral therapy (ART) in certain scenarios. Since changes in ART were not permitted in this protocol, all such participants who changed ART were to be considered non-responders. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was to be determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on treatment within the visit of interest window.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Viral Suppression (&lt;50 c/mL) - Viral suppression is defined as the first viral load value&lt;50 c/mL. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time to viral suppression, defined as the time from the first dose of study treatment until the first viral load value &lt;50 c/mL was reached. Participants who withdrew for any reason without having suppressed prior to the analysis were censored.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With a Confirmed Plasma HIV-1 RNA Level &gt;=1000 c/mL at or After Week 16 and Before Week 24, or a Confirmed Plasma HIV-1 RNA Level &gt;=200 c/mL at or After Week 24 - Data are presented as Kaplan Meier estimates of virologic failure (VF), defined as a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA level &gt;=1000 c/mL at or after Week 16 and before Week 24, or a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA level &gt;=200 c/mL at or after Week 24. A plasma HIV-1 RNA value was considered to be confirmed failure if a consecutive measurement satisfied the same failure criterion. The number of participants who experienced autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) VFs was measured. For participants who withdrew from the study/were not documented to have reached confirmed VF at the cut off date of the Week 48 analysis, time to VF was to be censored at the planned visit week of the last measured plasma HIV-1 RNA sample. Data for participants who missed three consecutive scheduled plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements were to be censored at the planned visit week of the last assessment prior to the 3 consecutive missed visits.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in CD4+ Cell Counts at Week 144 - Cluster of differentiation (CD4) lymphocyte cells (also called T-cells or T-helper cells) are the primary targets of HIV. The CD4 count and the CD4 percentage mark the degree of immunocompromise. The CD4 count is used to stage the patient's disease, determine the risk of opportunistic illnesses, assess prognosis, and guide decisions about when to start antiretroviral therapy. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 144 value minus the Baseline value. The least squares mean is the estimated mean change from Baseline in CD4+ cell counts at Week 144 calculated from a repeated measures model including the following covariates: treatment, visit, Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, Baseline CD4+ cell count, treatment*visit interaction, Baseline HIV-1 RNA*visit interaction, and Baseline CD4+ cell count*visit interaction. No assumptions were made about the correlations between a participant's readings of CD4+, i.e., the correlation matrix for within-participant errors is unstructured.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With the Indicated Post-baseline HIV-associated Conditions and Progression, Excluding Recurrences at Week 144 - Clinical disease progression (CDP) was assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-1 classification system. Category (CAT) A: one or more of the following conditions (CON), without any CON listed in Categories B and C: asymptomatic HIV infection, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, acute (primary) HIV infection with accompanying illness or history of acute HIV infection. CAT B: symptomatic CON that are attributed to HIV infection or are indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity; or that are considered by physicians to have a clinical course or to require management that is complicated by HIV infection; and not included among CON listed in clinical CAT C. CAT C: the clinical CON listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition. Indicators of CDP were defined as: CDC CAT A at Baseline (BS) to a CDC CAT C event (EV); CDC CAT B at BS to a CDC CAT C EV; CDC CAT C at BS to a new CDC CAT C EV; or CDC CAT A, B, or C at BS to death.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With the Indicated Genotypic Resistance With Virological Failure (VF) Through 144 - Whole blood samples were collected from participants to provide plasma for storage samples for potential viral genotypic and phenotypic analyses. Participants with confirmed virological failure (confirmed HIV-1 RNA &gt;=50 copies/mL throughout the study and/or confirmed HIV-1 RNA &gt;=200 copies/mL at Week 144) had plasma samples tested for HIV-1 RT genotype and HIV-1 integrase genotype from Baseline samples and from samples collected at the time of virological failure. Genotype testing was conducted at Day 1 and at the time of suspected protocol-defined virological failure (PDVF). A genotyping assessment was made of change across all amino acids within the integrase (IN)-encoding region, with particular attention paid to specific amino acid changes associated with the development of resistance to RAL, ELV, or DTG.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Symptom Bother Score (SBS) at Week 4 Through Week 48 - The Symptom Distress Module (SDM) is a 20-item, self-reported questionnaire measuring the presence/perceived distress linked to symptoms associated with HIV/its treatments. Developed with support from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, it has demonstrated construct validity and has shown strong associations with physical/mental health summary scores and with disease severity. The SDM consists of 2 main scores: symptom count and the SBS, ranging from 0 (best) to 80 (worst) and based on the degree of bother that each symptom present posed. The SBS was calculated by adding the 20 individual bother item scores, which were calculated as: 0, "I do not have this symptom"; 1, "It doesn't bother me"; 2, "It bothers me a little"; 3, "It bothers me"; 4, "It bothers me a lot." Estimates are calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for age, sex, race, Baseline (BL) viral load, BL CD4+ cell count, and BL SBS.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the non-inferior antiviral activity of GSK1349572 50
      mg plus Abacavir/Lamivudine once daily versus Efavirenz/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (ATRIPLA® a trade mark of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences LLC) over 48
      weeks; non-inferiority will also be tested at Week 96. This study will be conducted in HIV-1
      infected ART-naïve adult subjects. Long term antiviral activity, tolerability, safety, and
      development of viral resistance will be evaluated.</summary>
