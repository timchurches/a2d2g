  <interventions>
    <interventions>We conducted a random clinical trial study in which 23 individuals were recruited. 
	Patients were randomized in two groups: control (CG) and intervention (GI). Patients were assessed at pre and post intervention by the instruments: Berg Scale (BBS), Tinetti balance and mobility scale, Timed Up and Go, Flexibility Assessment, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS -15) and Assessment of Quality of Life Questionnaire by WHOQOL - BREF.
	After the assessment procedure and the forming of groups, began a program of physical therapy intervention associated with dance therapy, with 60 minutes of therapy, 2 times per week for a total of 16 therapies. The intervention consisted of exercises in a lying, sitting and standing positions (following a trend of activities more easy to difficult) and dance taught by a physiotherapist. The dance therapy was performed from a selection of songs that have been choreographed and rehearsed with the elderly by the physiotherapist responsible for the research.
Initially there were 23 individuals who were randomized into IG (n = 12) and CG (n = 11). Both groups were initially evaluated. In IG a patient was excluded for having severe comorbidities (n = 11). At the end of the intervention period, there was another assessment in the IG and CG. In  IG, 3 patients were excluded because they were absent from 4 sessions, with the maximum being allowed in skippable sessions being 3, for this reason they were excluded (n = 8). 
All individuals allocated to the CG came back for the assessment (n = 11).
After analyzing the results between IG and CG we found positive differences in the IG in main outcomes analyzed. For this reason and for ethical reasons, the CG has received the same treatment after the trial ended. All participants were recruited from the community, for convenience and spontaneously and were not necessarily on the waiting list.
After intervention, the CG finished with 5 seniors.
	Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 14.0 for Windows Evaluation Version.</interventions>
    <comparator>All individuals allocated to the CG was instructed not to vary from their normal daily activites in 8 weeks. After this period they came back for the reassessment (n = 11) and received the same proposed treatment for the IG.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>BALANCE

Berg Scale (BBS): Used to assess balance in elderly individuals. It is composed for 14 items with a maximum score of 56, each item having a scale of 5 options ranging from 0 to 4 points, where zero means that the subject is unable to perform the desired task and four refers to the subject that performing well.

Tinetti balance and mobility scale: Classifies aspects of gait and balance. It consists of 16 items, in which 9 are to balance and 7 for gait. A lower score indicates a poorer physical ability. The maximum score is 12 points for the gait, 16 to balance and 28 for both.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 - Initial Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) 
2 - Intervention for 8 weeks, twice a week lasting 60 minutes per therapy
3- Final Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) the ninth week post-randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>FLEXIBILITY and AGILITY

Flexibility Assessment: Was used the Bank of Wells to measure the extent of the back muscles chain stretching and lower limbs12. 3 measurements were performed, and we used the higher value measured for analysis. The test was conducted at the Bank of Wells with open and closed window.

Timed Up and Go: Assesses the agility. The patient have to rise from a chair, walk a distance of three meters, turn around and return. 3 tests were performed and the value adopted for analysis was the best</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 - Initial Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) 
2 - Intervention for 8 weeks, twice a week lasting 60 minutes per therapy
3- Final Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) the ninth week post-randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>DEPRESSION and QUALITY of LIFE

Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS -15): It is one of the most frequently used for the detection of depression in the elderly. It consists of 15 negative questions where major results indicate a higher level of depression. 

Assessment of Quality of Life Questionnaire by WHOQOL - BREF: It is an instrument of 26 questions about quality of life, developed by WHO. It is divided into four domains: physical, psychological, social relationships and environment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 - Initial Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) 
2 - Intervention for 8 weeks, twice a week lasting 60 minutes per therapy
3- Final Evaluation for every participants (IG and CG) the ninth week post-randomization</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives: To develop a functional exercise program associated with dance aimed at healthy seniors and verify its effectiveness in terms of the following outcomes: balance, flexibility, agility, quality of life and (the reduction of) depression. Methodology: Random clinical trial. The sample was divided into two groups: intervention (n = 11) and control (n = 11). A program consisting of 16 sessions of therapy was proposed with the aim of stimulating coordination, balance, functional independence, physical strength, muscle stretching and improved quality of life for all participants. Participants underwent the following types of evaluation in the pre and post intervention phases: balance and march (walk) assessment according to the Berg and Tinetti scale; agility according to the Up and Go Test; flexibility according to the Wells Bank; quality of life according to the WHOQOL-BREF scale; and depression level test according to the GDS-15 scale. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 14.0 program. Results: were as follows: The intervention group showed improved balance (p = 0.04), flexibility (p = 0.01) and agility (p = 0.03) as compared to the control group. Depression and quality of life outcomes showed no statistically significant results, albeit reports of qualitative group improvement were reported during the program. The control group showed improvement in the flexibility levels (p = 0.01). Conclusion: The proposed program was effective as far as improving balance, flexibility and agility among participants.</summary>
