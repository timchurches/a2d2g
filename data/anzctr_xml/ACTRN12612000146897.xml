  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is an open study examining the effects of withdrawal of oral iron supplements in patients with the genetic condition Cystic Fibrosis (CF). In CF it is believed that unusually high levels of iron can be found in respiratory tract, and that the presence of iron within the airways may promote bacterial infection.

In this study we explore how withdrawal of iron supplements may effect airway iron content and microbiology. As well as assessing the effect on systemic iron stores, lung function, and disease related symptoms.

This study will be conducted by the staff of the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Centre located at The Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane, Australia.

All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate. Subjects will provide written informed consent prior to participation. If patients decide to withdraw from the study at any point this will not  have any impact on their ongoing care.</summary>
