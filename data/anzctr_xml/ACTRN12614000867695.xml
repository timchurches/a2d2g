  <interventions>
    <interventions>A clinical feedback tool that provides a trajectory of eating disorder symptomatology for both "good" and "poor" outcomes over the course of therapy. It will be implemented into a regime of enhanced CBT for individuals with eating disorders. 

A subset of Eating Disorder Examination- Questionnaire (EDE-Q; Fairburn &amp; Beglin, 2008) items will be administered at pre-treatment and every subsequent week during treatment. (duration 20-40 weeks). This brief questionnaire will take approximately 2-3 minutes to complete. The scores will be utilised by the clinician between sessions to monitor the patient's progress. This will enable the clinician to to examine whether clients are making reliable change in their questionnaire scores (and thus eating disorder psychopathology), and to monitor when clients are approaching, or have reached, a score indicative of reaching the "healthy" range.. Patients' individual progress will be monitored weekly by the clinician.</interventions>
    <comparator>Use of a similar existing feedback tool that focuses on general process-based outcomes as opposed to specific eating disorder symptoms.

The Outcome Rating Scale (ORS; Miller et al., 2003) is a self-report, brief visual analogue measure, providing a measure of general patient progress in relation to overall wellbeing, and individual, interpersonal, and social wellbeing.

In the control group this questionnaire will be administered weekly over the course of treatment, (duration 20-40 weeks), and takes no more than 2-3 minutes to complete.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Remission versus non-remission

Full Remission is defined as complete absence of eating disorder symptoms in the last 28 days, that is, 1) cessation of all key eating disorder behaviours, 2) BMI &gt; or equal to 18.5, 3) not meeting the DSM criteria for an Eating Disorder

Partial remission is defined as meeting all but 1 of the above criteria for full remission

This is a composite primary outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eating Disorders are a very serious illness with severe and psychiatric and health consequences. Current treatment outcomes are less than optimal, with room for improvement. Research is required to find out ways in which these outcomes can be improved.

Research has shown that the provision of patient progress feedback to clinicians can enhance therapy outcomes, although the body of literature into the provision of feedback within an eating disorder treatment setting is minimal. This study seeks to implement a symptom based clinical feedback tool into the course of eating disorder therapy, and compare it to an already established, more general, therapy process-based feedback tool.</summary>
