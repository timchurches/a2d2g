  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide, thiotepa, and
      carboplatin followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation or bone marrow transplantation
      in treating patients who have brain cancer.</summary>
