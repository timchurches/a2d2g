  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a pilot study of 16 sessions of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT)  (run over 16 weeks) compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for young people aged 15 to 24 years with co-occurring first episode psychosis and full or sub-threshold BPD. Patients who consent to be involved in the current study will be randomized to TAU or TAU + CAT. Measures will be undertaken at three time-points: baseline, end of treatment phase (for both conditions), and 6 month follow up. Measures include: demographics, and standardized measures of diagnosis, psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, treatment adherence and service utilization.</interventions>
