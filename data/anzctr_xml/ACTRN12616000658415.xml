    <interventions>This randomised controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy of manualised Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) in reducing weight and improving executive function in obese patients. Manualised cognitive remediation therapy is a face-to-face treatment approach with a focus on improving cognitive functioning. CRT consists of mental exercises aimed at improving cognitive strategies, thinking skills and information processing through practice (Tchanturia, 2014). The NHMRC guidelines strongly recommend obese individuals lose weight through lifestyle modification interventions. The current standard evidence based approach is Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL), it uses behavioural techniques to help individuals modify eating and exercise habits.  

The following conditions will be compared; CRT plus behavioural weight loss (BWL) and BWL (standard care) alone.  It is expected that individuals who receive CRT will show greater weight-loss and improved executive functioning than those in the BWL alone, post-treatment and at 1 year follow-up (post-treatment).

Treatment will continue for 5 months and be provided by two psychologists. A dietician will facilitate groups related to the diet component of the BWL program.  Participants aged 18 to 55, with a BMI of 30 or above will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions: 
1) CRT group: Eight weekly sessions of individual CRT followed by twelve weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL)
2) BWL group: Eight weekly sessions of individual BWL followed by twelve weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL)

Individual treatment will be conducted before group sessions commence.  Twelve participants will be allocated  to group treatment.

Description of sessions:
1) CRT group: Eight 50-minute weekly sessions of individual CRT plus twelve 2 hour weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL) treatment.

CRT Sessions: During CRT 10 cognitive training exercises will be delivered per session. An example of an exercise is the Map Task - the aim is to think in different ways when navigating and to use different cues (compass, street, location, etc). The psychologist will facilitate a discussion about thinking styles after the completion of tasks. Homework will be given after every session, homework should take about 15 mins to complete.

Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL) Group sessions: During these sessions a modified version of the Look Ahead Trial manual will be delivered. The Look Ahead program is an intensive lifestyle intervention program that targets diet and exercise through behavioural modification techniques. During this program participants will be given weight loss information and be encouraged to set calorie and activity goals. Participants will be asked to monitor and record their behaviour. In the group setting participants are taught techniques such as: problem solving, stress management and mindful eating to assist them to reach their weight loss goals. Thoughts and emotions related to overeating and inactivity are also addressed in treatment sessions.

2) BWL group: Eight 50 minute weekly sessions of individual BWL plus twelve 2 hour weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL).
This treatment group will experience an intensive BWL program. The addition of individual sessions will help to examine whether more sessions of BWL are beneficial. The individual sessions of BWL will focus upon providing detailed education about weight loss techniques and addressing any barriers that the participant may have in terms of changing their behaviour.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be inspected for normality and non-parametric statistic applied where appropriate. Weight loss percentage will be computed. Scores on cognitive measures will be transformed into z-scores. Linear mixed models will be used to compare differences between treatment groups in % weight lost, and to examine whether changes in executive function predicted changes in weight. To examine the baseline and prospective relationships between biological data and cognition/weight. linear or logistic regression analyses will be performed while controlling for a range of potential confounders. The Bonferroni correction or FDR (False Discovery Rate) method will be used for multiple comparisons and post-hoc testing will be performed where appropriate.

Power Calculations: We calculated the sample size with a method that takes into account
the intracluster correlation coefficient (r=.02) for comparison between groups using a two-tailed linear mixed model, predicting a medium effect size (Cohen's d of .4  which is the difference between the effect size of CRT(1.2) and brief BWL (.8) compared to waitlist control on weight loss and using a power of 80%, and determined that a sample size of 70 individuals per group is needed. Assuming an attrition rate of 25%, a sample of 88 per group is necessary, totalling 176 participants (14 groups of 12 people on group BWL).

This sample will also allow the detection of small effect sizes (Cohens f-squared = 0.01) for
a given predictor in the presence of 10 other predictor variables in the regression equation, based on a two-tailed alpha rate of .05 and power of .80. Stratification by SES, age or sex, to explore the findings in more detail, is also possible and the sample size should suffice.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is at epidemic proportions and current weight loss programs offer little
respite.  While many current interventions help individuals to reduce 5-10% of their body weight, most individuals regain the weight as soon as professional contact ends (Perri &amp; Corsica, 2002). Treatment strategies that will aid with weight loss maintenance are urgently needed.

Recently weight loss failure has been linked to cognitive difficulties, specifically problems with executive functioning. Executive functioning encompasses a range of processes that facilitate initiation, inhibition, planning, regulation, sequencing and achievement of complex goal-oriented behaviour. It is evident that executive functioning underlies many behaviours associated with successful weight management (Riggs, Spruitt-Metz, Chou &amp; Pentz, 2012).  Our review (Smith et al., 2011) found 22 out of 24 studies showed a negative association between obesity and executive function. Despite this, current treatments do not target executive function deficits.

Manualised cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is a face-to-face treatment approach with a focus on improving cognitive functioning. CRT consists of mental exercises aimed at improving cognitive strategies, thinking skills and information processing through practice (Tchanturia, 2014).

There is evidence that CRT improves executive function and helps individuals regulate their eating. It has been shown to be effective at improving executive function in those with anorexia nervosa (Dingemans et al., 2014). Our recent pilot RCT on manualised CRT for obesity provides promising evidence for its efficacy (Raman, Hay &amp; Smith, 2014). The results showed that those in the CRT group experienced a significant increase in executive function and a significant decrease in weight compared to controls and that changes in executive function predicted changes in weight. 

This study aims to determine the efficacy of CRT in reducing weight and improving executive function in obese patients. The following conditions will be compared; CRT plus behavioural weight loss (BWL) compared to BWL (standard care) alone.  It is hypothesized that individuals who receive CRT will show greater weight-loss and improved executive functioning than those in the BWL alone,  both at post-treatment and at 1-year follow-up (post-treatment).

Treatment will continue for 5 months and be provided by two psychologists and a dietician. Participants aged 18 to 55, with a BMI of 30 or above will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions: 
1) CRT group: Eight 50 minute weekly sessions of individual CRT plus twelve, 2hour, weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL)
2) BWL group: Eight 50 minute weekly sessions of individual BWL plus twelve, 2 hour, weekly sessions of group Behavioural Weight Loss (BWL)
