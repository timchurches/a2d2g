  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) Time in Months for All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint - OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. Participants were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. Median OS time was calculated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Hazard ratio (HR) and the corresponding Confidence Interval (CI) were estimated in a stratified Cox proportional hazards model for distribution of OS in each randomized arm. Interim analysis (Primary Endpoint) was planned to occur after at least 380 deaths, with the actual analysis occurring at 413 deaths.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until 413 deaths, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>One-year Overall Survival (OS) Rate in All Randomized Participants - The one-year overall survival rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of all randomized participants who were alive following one year of treatment. Overall survival was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death as a result of any cause. Survival rates were determined via Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Deaths From Any Cause in All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint - The number of participants who died from any cause was reported for each arm. Interim analysis (Primary Endpoint) was planned to occur after at least 380 deaths, with the actual analysis occurring at 413 deaths.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until 413 deaths, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) in All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint - ORR was defined as the percentage of participants whose Best Overall Response (BOR) was a confirmed Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR). BOR was defined as the best investigator-assessed response designation, recorded between the date of randomization and the date of objectively documented progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) or the date of subsequent anti-cancer therapy (excluding on-treatment palliative radiotherapy of non-target bone lesions or Central Nervous System (CNS) lesions), whichever occurred first.
CR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking, as reference, the baseline sum diameters. CIs were computed using the Clopper and Pearson method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until 413 deaths, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Objective Response (DOR) in Months for All Confirmed Responders at Primary Endpoint - DOR was defined as the time from the date of first confirmed response to the date of the first documented tumor progression (per RECIST v1.1), as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. DOR was evaluated only for confirmed responders (i.e. participants with confirmed CR or PR).
CR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking, as reference, the baseline sum diameters.
Participants who neither progressed nor died were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of confirmed response to date of documented tumor progression or death, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time To Response (TTR) in Months for All Confirmed Responders at Primary Endpoint - Time to Response (TTR) for participants demonstrating a response (either CR or PR) was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first confirmed response. CR = Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt; 10 mm.; PR = At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking, as reference, the baseline sum diameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until confirmed response, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Rate at 12 Months - PFS rate was defined as the percentage of participants experiencing no disease progression or death from any cause at 12 months after randomization. Progression was assessed by investigators according to RECIST v1.1. 95% CIs were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) Time in Months for All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint - PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined by the investigator per RECIST v1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause. Participants underwent radiographic tumor assessments every 6 weeks (+/- 5 days) from week 9 (+/- 5 days) for the first year on treatment, then every 12 weeks after the first year on treatment until documented disease progression. The PFS curves were estimated using KM method. Two-sided 95% CIs for median PFS were computed by Brookmeyer and Crowley method (using log-log transformation). Interim analysis (Primary Endpoint) was planned to occur after at least 380 deaths, with the actual analysis occurring at 413 deaths.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until 413 deaths, up to March 2015 (approximately 29 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Disease-related Symptom Improvement by Week 12 - Disease-related symptom improvement rate by Week 12 was defined as the percentage of randomized participants who had a 10 point or greater decrease from baseline in average symptom burden index score at any time between randomization and Week 12. The participant portion of the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) consisted of 6 symptom-specific questions that addressed cough, dyspnea, fatigue, pain, hemoptysis, and anorexia, plus 3 summary items on symptom distress, interference with activity level, and global health-related Quality of Life (QoL). The scores range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the best possible score and 100 being the worst possible score. The average symptom burden index score at each assessment was defined as the mean of the 6 symptom-specific questions of the LCSS. 95% CIs were computed using Clopper-Pearson Method.</outcome>

      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) Time in Months by Baseline PD-L1 Expression for All Randomized Participants at Primary Endpoint - Overall Survival time was measured in months for all randomized participants grouped by their baseline PD-L1 expression level. PD-L1 expression in participants was defined as the percent of disease tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1 staining of any intensity using an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay. Interim analysis (Primary Endpoint) was planned to occur after at least 380 deaths, with the actual analysis occurring at 413 deaths.</outcome>
