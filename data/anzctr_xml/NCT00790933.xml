  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants with one or more Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any experience that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: results in death, is life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change from Baseline in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Scores at Week 28 - The IBDQ is an instrument used to assess quality of life in adult participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It includes 32 questions on 4 domains of Health-Related Quality-of-Life (HRQOL): Bowel Systems (10 items), Emotional Function (12 items), Social Function (5 items), and Systemic Function (5 items). Participants are asked to recall symptoms and quality of life from the last 2 weeks and rate each item on a 7-point Likert scale (1=worst to 7=best). A total IBDQ score is calculated by summing the scores from each domain; the total IBDQ score ranges from 32 to 224, with lower scores reflecting worse HRQOL.

      <outcome>Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5D Health States (EQ-5D) Composite Score at Week 28 - EuroQol 5D health states (EQ-5D) questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. A decrease of =0.3 points in the composite EQ-5D score represents improvement in quality of life of participants. The change between the EQ-5D total score at Week 28 relative to baseline.</outcome>

Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a 20-cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as the best possible health. An increase of =7 points in the EQ-5D VAS score represents a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for participants.

      <outcome>Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5D Health States (EQ-5D) Composite Score at Week 100 - EuroQol 5D health states (EQ-5D) questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. A composite EQ-5D score can be calculated from the individual scores to assess overall HRQOL. A decrease of =0.3 points in the composite EQ-5D score represents improvement in quality of life of participants. The change between the EQ-5D total score at Week 100 relative to baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change from Baseline in EuroQol 5D Health States (EQ-5D) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Score at Week 100 - EuroQol 5D health states (EQ-5D) questionnaire is an instrument used to measure general HRQOL in participants with IBD. It considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e. mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three possible levels, i.e 1 = none, 2 = moderate or 3 = extreme. The EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score is a self-assigned rating of overall health using a 20-cm visual, vertical scale, with a score of 0 as the worst and 100 as the best possible health. An increase of =7 points in the EQ-5D VAS score represents a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life for participants. The change between the EQ-5D total score at Week 100 relative to baseline.</outcome>
