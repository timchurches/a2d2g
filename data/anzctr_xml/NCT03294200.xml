Treatment: devices: TriCinch Coil System implantation
Patients enrolled in this study with all eligibility criteria confirmed will be implanted with the TriCinch Coil System. This device offers a percutaneous treatment (access through the vein at the groin) to treat the leaking tricuspid valve, without the need for surgical intervention.
