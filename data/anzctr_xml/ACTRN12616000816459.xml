  <interventions>
    <interventions>"Open weighing: Patients are individually weighed in their underwear by a nurse twice weekly for four weeks. Weighing takes place in the morning in front of the nurses station before patients have breakfast. The outcome is communicated clearly to the patient in form of an actual weight (not simply "up", "down", or "OK"). The patient's weight is then overtly discussed between the patient and treating team (e.g., dieticians, psychologists, psychiatrists) and this information is used as a part of treatment. For example, dieticians may make changes to the patient's meal plan depending on weight gain/loss and psychologist may discuss weight in the context of cognitive behavioural therapy sessions. Patients are asked to complete outcome measure questionnaires directly before and after being weighed.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Blind weighing: Patients are individually weighed in their underwear by a nurse twice weekly for four weeks. Weighing takes place in the morning in front of the nurses station before patients have breakfast. The patient's weight information is shared with the treating team (e.g., dieticians, psychologists, psychiatrists) but not with the patient. Specific weight information (i.e., the exact number on the scale) is not used as a part of treatment. To justify treatment decisions (e.g., changes in meal plan) the treating team may communicate to the patient whether the weight has gone up or down but will not discuss actual numbers. Patients are asked to complete outcome measure questionnaires directly before and after being weighed. </comparator>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Meal completion. Patients who refuse or cannot complete a meal or snack are required to drink a liquid meal supplement (e.g., Ensure) of equal caloric content. The quantity of liquid meal supplement required (this is always equivalent to the amount of food left on the plate) is recorded by nurses and will be used to assess meal non compliance. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Meal completion (or non compliance) is recorded in the patient's chart after each meal/snack. This data will be used to track meal completion across 4 weeks from intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment motivation as assessed by 100mm Visual Analogue Scales (3 questions; e.g., How motivated do you feel right now to engage with your treatment?)</outcome>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be randomised to either open weighing or blind weighing. To prevent potential problems of drop-out that may result if participants from different groups are treated alongside one another in hospital and become dissatisfied with their allocation, we will divide the sample into blocks and randomly assign these blocks to one of the two conditions. Once all participants from a block have discharged, recruitment for the next block will start.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>For a between group difference in mean scores on the visual analogue ratings of anxiety, a medium to large (clinically relevant) effect size of 0.6 would at power of 80%, thus beta of 0.20, and significance (p) of 5% (0.05) for 1-sided test a group size of n=36 would be required and thus allowing for some attrition (6/42 per group or approximately 15%) a total sample size of n=84 is needed.
The data of this study will be analysed using mixed-effects models (MEM). We hope to determine which approach is more beneficial for patients in the early stages of therapy.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare different weighing practices in the early stages of inpatient treatment for Anorexia Nervosa. Specifically, we aim to compare the benefits of open weighing (where patients are weighed within the therapy session and their weight is then discussed with the therapist overtly) and blind weighing (where patients are weighed by the therapist but this information is not shared with him or her). 

Despite considerable debate about this issue in the literature, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic comparison of patient outcomes following blind and open weighing. Weighing is a key component in the treatment of eating disorders and specific evidence is needed to determine which approach is most beneficial for patients. 

The current project aims to fill this gap by comparing weighing methods in a specialised inpatient setting. Participants will be randomised to either open weighing or blind weighing. Following consent (assent for adolescents aged&lt; 18 years), participants will be randomised in blocks. The primary outcome variable will be anxiety levels before and after being weighed. Secondary outcomes include rate of weight gain, body and weight preoccupations, tolerance of uncertainty, meal completion and treatment motivation.</summary>
