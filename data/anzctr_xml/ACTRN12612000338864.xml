  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The outcome in patients with Multiple myeloma (MM) who fail to respond to treatment or relapse after treatment is extremely poor. This study plans to treat approximately 80 patients in a number of sites throughout Australia and aims to investigate the effect of pomalidomide (a type of chemotherapy drug) on the immune system, and in turn, whether the outcomes of treatment with pomalidomide as single agent therapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (a blood cancer) are different to that achieved by patients treated with pomalidomide and dexamethasone (a steroid treatment commonly used in this disease) combination therapy. 

Who is it for? 

This study is open to male or female patients aged 18 or above with a diagnosis of MM and failing previous therapy, either refractory or relapsed after at least 2 previous lines of chemotherapy (including lenalidomide). The full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the relevant sections within this record. 

Trial details 

Initially, all patients will receive induction therapy consisting of four 28 day cycles of pomalidomide and dexamethasone. Patients then randomised to the pomalidomide arm for maintenance treatment will receive 4mg oral pomalidomide daily on a cyclic 21-day out of 28-day schedule for approximately 12 cycles. Patients randomised to the control arm for maintenance treatment will receive 4mg oral pomalidomide daily on a cyclic 21-day out of 28-day schedule along with 40mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, &amp; 22 of 28 day cycle for approximately 12 cycles. For each arm of the study, the actual cycle number will be determined by the patient's treating clinician and based on response to and tolerability of treatment.</summary>
