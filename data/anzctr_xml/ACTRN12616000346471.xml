  <interventions>
    <interventions>Attentional bias modification (ABM)  intervention with 5 sessions completed over 5 nights before bed at home (1 x approx, 15 minute session/day).

Each ABM session consists of delivery of 384 trials using 48 word pairs comprising sleep-related threat words (e.g. Agitated, Exhausted) paired with length and frequency-matched non-threat words (e.g. Carriers, Developed),

Each trial of the task will begin with a fixation cross in the centre of the computer screen for 500ms. A word pair will then appear for 500ms. Immediately following this, a visual probe comprising of two small red dots oriented either horizontally (..) or vertically (:) will appear in the location on the screen of one of the words previously shown. On each trial, participants will be required to indicate which of the two probes was shown by pressing the corresponding buttons on the keyboard or screen. The probes will appear on the screen location previously occupied by the non-threat words 100% of the time.

Adherence to the daily ABM sessions will be automatically tracked by the computer program. Standardised email reminders will be sent to a participant each day.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants apply online and eligibility is assessed via online screening questionnaires. Those who meet the inclusion criteria will be asked to enter basic demographic information over the internet, read the information sheet and return an electronic consent form to the investigators. They will then be randomly allocated to one of the two conditions, determined automatically through the ABM training program and therefore neither the investigators nor participants are aware of group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using a number generated at first log-in to the study and allocated to either group at a 1:1 ratio. An off-site staff member not involved in the clinical trial will allocate either odd or even participant numbers to either condition and keep this decision from the investigators and participants.</sequence>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>On the basis of previous studies we anticipate a between-groups effect size difference of 0.8 on the primary outcome. To detect this difference, we will recruit 66 participants, which will have 80% power (at 95% significance level) to detect this difference, taking into account attrition.

Mixed ANOVA will be used to evaluate the data collected, with time as the within-subjects factor and group as the between-subjects factor. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This RCT will evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of a multi-day online ABM program targeting insomnia symptoms by comparing an active ABM intervention with a control ABM task. It will also examine whether improvements in insomnia lead to reduction in comorbid anxiety/depression symptoms and appraise the longer-term therapeutic effects of ABM on insomnia and comorbid anxiety/depression.</summary>
