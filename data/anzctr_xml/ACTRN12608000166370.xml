    <studytitle>Shared Team Approach between Nurses and Doctors For Improved Risk Factor Management for stroke patients</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of efficacy (control of risk factors at 12 months) and cost effectiveness of a team approach between nurses and doctors (coordinated transition from hospital to general practice) versus standard care (the ongoing care that a patient would normally receive) in patients discharged home after an acute stroke.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have had a new stroke are randomised to receive a coordinated team approach of risk factor management following discharge home from hospital. The approach involves assessing patients risk factors, educating patients about their risk factors, and then treating their risk factors and/or otherwise managing their risk factors with behavioural changes. Both nurses and doctors in hospital and primary care settings coordinate this care. The intervention will continue for 18 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in the updated Framingham cardiovascular disease (CVD) Risk Score from baseline.

General cardiovascular risk profile for use in primary care: the Framingham Heart Study. Circulation. 117:743-53). The factors included in this measure that are subject to change are: systolic blood pressure; total and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels; diabetes control as measured by glycosylated haemoglobin levels &lt; 7%; and current smoking as assessed by urinary cotinine.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised-controlled trial of a shared approach to risk management (the intervention)  versus standard care (control) following stroke. Outcome is blinded and analysis is intention-to-treat. A cost-effectiveness analysis is included. It is hypothesised that at 12 months following stroke a shared nurse/doctor team approach to risk factor management will result in improved management of patients risk factors, result in fewer adverse events, and will be cost-effective.</summary>
