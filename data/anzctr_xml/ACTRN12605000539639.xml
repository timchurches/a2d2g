  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomly assigned to experimental / control groups. Experimental subjects undergo prism adaptation (PA) training for five sessions over two weeks in addition to usual care. (PA training consists of 30 reaches for targets while wearing 15 degree right deviating prism glasses.) 
Double blinded FIM and Catherine Bergego Scale scores are assessed on hospital admission and discharge.
Additional tests include: letter cancellation, figure copying, TUGT walking test, seated reach test, and Fluff test.
Mailed survey follow up at 4 months includes Stroke Impact Scale (SIS-16) and depression screening (CESD-10).</interventions>
    <comparator>Control subjects complete the identical procedure but wear sham coloured glasses.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will clarify the effectiveness of prism adaptation treatment for stroke patients with hemi-spatial neglect. The treatment group will undergo five training sessions while wearing prism glasses. The control group will undergo the same procedure while wearing sham glasses. The two groups will be compared for improvements in the neglect impairment and in functional abilities.</summary>
