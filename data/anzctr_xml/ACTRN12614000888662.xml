  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete three therapy sessions per week over four weeks (a total of 12 sessions). Therapy sessions will be delivered one-on-one by a provisional psychologist and the duration of sessions will be 60 minutes. The content of sessions will follow common cognitive-behavioural treatments for social anxiety disorder, including psycho-education, cognitive restructuring and behavioural experiments. A treatment manual will be developed for use in this study. The methods used will aim to reduce social anxiety symptoms such as maladaptive thoughts about social situations (cognitive restructuring), and beliefs about catastrophic consequences of behaviour in social contexts (behavioural experiments). The aim of this study is for participants to experience a reduction in symptoms sooner, and potentially increase efficacy of CBT for social anxiety disorder by reducing the timeframe in which treatment is delivered.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is intended to investigate the efficacy of intensive cognitive behavioural therapy for social anxiety disorder. The effect of this intervention will be analysed, and participants will be questioned about the acceptability of the intensive treatment format. The results of this study will hopefully inform us of any benefit of intensive individual CBT for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. </summary>
