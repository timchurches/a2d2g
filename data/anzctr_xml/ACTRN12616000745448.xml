  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will view a short (&lt;5-8 minutes) online video on a smartphone while waiting for their rheumatology clinic appointment in the public hospital study sites.  The video will teach people with RA how to examine 28 key joints to determine the presence or absence of "tenderness" and/or "swelling" in these joints. The exact content of the video will be determined by rheumatologists and people with rheumatoid arthritis in a co-design workshop (planned for August 2016).  
A research assistant will provide the smartphone with the app RAConnect loaded, through which each participant will complete a tender and swollen joint count, following instructions within the app.  Then participants randomized to the video training intervention will watch the video, via link in RAConnect, then complete the tender and swollen joint count again.  The intervention will occur once only and with individual participants.

    <statisticalmethods>Inter-rater reliability for patient-performed tender and swollen 28 joint counts compared with rheumatologist performed joint counts, before and after viewing video for people randomised to 1. performs joint counts, watches video, second joint count and 2. performs two joint counts without any training/education.  Primary outcome of interest is difference in change in ICC between the two groups. 
Previous studies suggest that the ICC between patients and health care professionals is between 0.70 and 0.92 for TJC and between 0.30 and 0.55 for SJC (1).  Short training changes the ICC for patient and physician TJC from 0.33 to 0.48 and the ICC for patient and physician SJC from 0.66 to 0.84 (13) From SD Walter, M Eliasziw and A Donner, Sample Size and Optimal Designs for Reliability Studies, a sample size of 50 patients per group will provide 80% power to detect an improvement of ICC for TJC from from 0.66 to 0.84, at the 0.05 level of significance (2). Fifty patient per group will give an 80% power to detect and improvement of ICC between groups of 0.33 to 0.48 for SJC at the 0.05 level of significance. We therefore plan to recruit 100 patients for this study and randomly assign to the training (Group B) or no-training group (Group A).  This will also provide enough data to be able to estimate the final ICC to within + 0.2 (3).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives
To assess if a video designed to train people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to perform their own tender and swollen joint counts improves concordance of patient-reported tender and swollen joint counts with those performed by their rheumatologist
Hypothesis
After watching a video designed to train people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to perform their own tender and swollen joint counts, self-performed joint counts will have sufficient concordance with rheumatologist performed joint counts that patient reported joint counts are likely to be acceptably accurate in remote monitoring of RA.  
Design
One hundred people with RA will be recruited as they attend their usual rheumatology clinics in public hospitals in Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Before the appointment with their rheumatologist participants will record their own RA disease activity including 28 tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) imputed to into a mobile health application (an app) RAConnect. They will then be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 1. Repeating the self-28 TJC and SJC in RAConnect or 2. Viewing the joint count training video in RAConnect then repeating the the self-28 TJC and SJC in RAConnect. During the clinic appointment their rheumatologist will record the physician-performed 28 TJC and SJC, blinded to patient self-joint counts and allocated group. Concordance of patient self-joint counts with rheumatologists joint counts for the first and second joint count will be assessed.</summary>
