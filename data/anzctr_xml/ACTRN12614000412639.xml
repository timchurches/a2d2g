    <interventions>Treatment protocol in the experimental group 

Three techniques were performed in the following order.

(a) Neuromuscular technique of the masseter muscles. With the subject lying supine, the therapist sat at the head of the table and rotated the subjects head. One therapists hand was placed on the zygomatic arch to fix the superior edge of the muscle, while the thumb of the other hand performed longitudinal myofascial strokes, of about 5-8 centimeters length (each of four to six seconds of duration). Tissue restrictions were respected during the gentle slide movement and no pain was provoked during the technique 

(b)Passive stretching of the hamstring muscles. With the subject supine, the therapist performed a hip flexion keeping knee extension until the edge of flexibility of the posterior muscle chain, with no pain or discomfort. When this position was achieved, the therapist underwent a dorsal flexion of the ankle and kept the position for forty seconds. The stretching technique was performed in both lower limbs, avoiding any possible body compensation during the stretching. 

c) The suboccipital muscle inhibition technique. With the participant lying supine, the therapist placed both hands under the head of the subject as a hammock. While contacting the inferior edge of the occipital bone, the therapist exerted a constant and painless pressure in cranial and ventral direction until suboccipital soft tissue was relaxed. The technique was performed for four minutes approximately.

The whole treatment protocol lasted about 10 minutes and involve a single treatment session
</interventions>
    <comparator>The treatment in the control group consisted of the same protocol used in the experimental group, but including only the first two techniques. Therefore the protocol included in this order:

(a) Neuromuscular technique of the masseter muscles. With the subject lying supine, the therapist sat at the head of the table and rotated the subjects head. One therapists hand was placed on the zygomatic arch to fix the superior edge of the muscle, while the thumb of the other hand performed longitudinal myofascial strokes, of about 5-8 centimeters length (each of four to six seconds of duration). Tissue restrictions were respected during the gentle slide movement and no pain was provoked during the technique 

(b)Passive stretching of the hamstring muscles. With the subject supine, the therapist performed a hip flexion keeping knee extension until the edge of flexibility of the posterior muscle chain, with no pain or discomfort. When this position was achieved, the therapist underwent a dorsal flexion of the ankle and kept the position for forty seconds. The stretching technique was performed in both lower limbs, avoiding any possible body compensation during the stretching. 

The whole protocol was performed during a single session of about 6 minutes of duration</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement equal or superior to 14% in the vertical mouth opening in the experimental group compared to the control group

Vertical mouth opening was assessed with the subject in the supine position using an electronic digital caliper (Powerfix, London, United Kingdom). The subject was instructed to open the mouth as much as possible without there being any sensation of pain or discomfort. This procedure has proven to have high intra-tester reliability. The mean of three consecutive measurements, with a resting period of 30-45 seconds between them, was taken as the reference value for further analysis. The standard error of measurement for repeated evaluations in seated position in subjects with temporomandibular disorder has been observed to be between 2.1-2.9 mm.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference between-groups of at least 10% in pressure pain threshold after treatment

A digital algometer, model FDX 25 (Warner Instruments, Greenwich, CT, USA), with a 1cm2 contact area was used to measure pressure pain threshold (PPT). PPT is defined as the minimum pressure needed to provoke pain and/or disconfort in a certain site. With the subject lying supine, evaluations were made in the dominant and non-dominant sides on: (a) the anatomical site described for the location of tense bands in the masseter muscles, close to the mandibular angle; and (b) the three emerging branches of the trigeminal nerve, supraorbital, infraorbital and mental nerves.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An increase of 10%-15% in suboccipital range of motion in flexion and extension in the experimental group compared to the control group

To measure suboccipital mobility, a digital inclinometer (DI), model ACU002 (Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafallette IN, USA) was used. The DI is an electronic device that displays absolute angular inclination with a resolution of 0.1 degrees. The DI has two different sensors. With the subject standing still and with the head and the back resting on the wall, one of the sensors was placed along the sagittal suture as a reference line perpendicular to the bridge of the nose, and the other was placed on the wall. The subject was asked to gently look upwards (to the ceiling) to measure suboccipital extension and then to look downwards (to the floor) to evaluate suboccipital flexion, without moving the back or head from the wall to ensure that suboccipital mobility was evaluated. In addition, any possible compensatory movements were prevented by the assessor. Participants were instructed to perform their maximal pain-free range of motion at a comfortable and self-selected pace and to keep the final position for at least 3 seconds. The DI has been previously validated and is considered to be an effective and easy to use tool to measure cervical mobility. When measuring neck range of motion in a seating position, the standard error of measurement is between 2.4 degrees and 2.6 degrees for cervical extension and flexion. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately after intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A between-groups difference of 5%-10% in lumbar spine mobility

Lumbar mobility was evaluated using the sit and reach (SAR) test, and by means of measuring lumbar forward bending with a digital inclinometer. 

- The SAR test is a common tool to measure maximum spinal mobility in flexion and hamstring muscles flexibility. The subject was sitting with knees extended and both feet against the edge of a standard sit-and-reach box. The participant was asked to bend slowly forward towards the toes as far as possible keeping knee extension and placing both hands on the box. The final position was kept for around 5 seconds. The SAR test has shown excellent intratester reliability, and a moderate to high criterion-related validity, ranging from 0.46 to 0.89. The typical percentage of measurement error has been observed around 3 cm.

- Lumbar foward bending evaluates spinal mobility in flexion and it is a possible indicator of functional limitation. Standard protocol requires the patient to be standing and to maintain knee extension, while bending forward. The digital inclinometer was positioned with one of the sensors on the lumbar spine (L3-L5 segment) as the dynamic region, and the other was placed on the wall, as the static stable position. The American Medical Association recommends using an inclinometer as the preferred tool to measure lumbar spine mobility. In the worst case scenario, the accuracy level of this measurement tool has been established between 3.4  3.8 cm for lumbar flexion and extension.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical processing of the data was performed with the PASW Statistics tool, version 18.0 plus (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess the normality of the data. The mean, standard deviation and 95 per cent of confidence intervals were calculated for quantitative variables, while categorical data was expressed in terms of percentage frequencies. 

Baseline characteristics in both groups were evaluated with the chi-squared (X^2) test for qualitative variables and the Student´s t test for independent samples for quantitative variables. The inferential analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA test), with the group as the between-subjects variable, and with the time (pre and post-intervention) as the within-subject variable, was used to evaluate the between groups differences and to observe the immediate effects of the protocol interventions. 

The statistical analysis was conducted considering a p value inferior to 0.05 statistically significant.


Sample size estimation was made using the Granmo software, version 7.12 (Granmo, IMIM Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain). For an unilateral contrast, taking into account an alpha value of 0.05, and in order to achieve a statistical power of 90 per cent, 25 subjects were needed in each study group to detect a difference equal or superior to 14 per cent in the vertical mouth opening, that was taken as the outcome measure that defines mandibular functionality. A common standard deviation of 16 per cent and a loss to follow-up rate of 8 per cent was assumed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis of the study was that a combination of  local myofascial and neuromuscular techniques in the craniomandibular region and techniques in a distal area (stretching of the hamstring muscles) in subjects with temporomandibular disorders will have a better impact than a treatment protocol including only local techniques in the orofacial area on aspects such as vertical mouth opening, suboccipital and lumbar mobility, and orofacial mechanosensitivity. </summary>
