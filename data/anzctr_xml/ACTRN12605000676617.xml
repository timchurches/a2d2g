  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project seeks to study the impact of the WHO international classification of functioning and disability looking at contextural factors affecting people with MS.  Secondly to provide specific targetted rehabilitation intervention to the identified problem areas reported by the MS cohort and further to measure and quantify the selected functional and social outcomes from rehabilitation intervention.

Specific research questions include:
- establishment of a database to document the prevelence of medical social and functional parameters for a community dwelling cohort of patients with MS.
- to study and compare the effects of disablement on everyday living activities and participation in these persons.  This will be done by:
a. record the patient's perceived problems due to MS and their coping ability using an open ended questionnaire.
b. to determine the perspective of their partners/carers regarding problems living with MS.
c. determine the perspective of the treating general practitioner/neurologist regarding problems living with MS.
d. to determine the impact of these listed problems and the distress caused on these patients with measured effects on activities and participation using the WHO ICF classification.
- Determine burden of care for the partner/carer,
- Study the impact of fatigue in persons with MS in the everday activities of daily living and function.
- To measure the impact of defined personal factors such as (depression, anxiety, stress) on the everyday activities and participation. 
- Measure the impact of defined environmental factors that affect function and participation in this group.
- Record a generic indicator of health status measure using a general health questionnaire.
- To ascertain self efficacy in this patient group and their carers.
- To provide targetted rehabilitation intervention for these identified problems and measure specific functional and social outcomes.</summary>
