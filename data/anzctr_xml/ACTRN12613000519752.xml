  <interventions>
    <interventions>After one month of the curative resection, the adjuvant group received 1250mg/m2 capecitabine tablets two times per one day by oral; Taking two weeks and have one week dicontinuation as one course of treatment, repeated six courses. The monthly review of the blood, liver, renal, CA-19-9, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and liver ultrasound. The three-monthly review of liver-enhanced CT or MRI. If bone pain, line ECT or check.
adverse reactions processing program:
a. Grade III adverse reactions: capecitabine dose reduced 25%
b. Grade III adverse reactions last more than 2 weeks or grade IV adverse reactions: stop taking capecitabine
c. WBC &lt;2.5 × 109 / L and/or PLT &lt;40 × 109 / L: capecitabine dose reduced 25% and give drugs which can rised white blood cells and/or platelet counts
d. WBC and/or platelet count still continued to decline after  the dose of capecitabine reduced: stop taking capecitabine
A standardized clinical data management procedure will be carried out to make sure all of the data including the data on the adherences satisfy good clinical practice (GCP) requirements. All of the data will be entered in a verified database while the original paper records will be kept for at least 5 years. To make sure that the data in the database is consistent with the original one, a data validation process will be carried out. Disagreements were adjudicated by answering the query forms after referring to the original records.</interventions>
    <comparator>After R0 resection, patients with ICC will be observed or participate in clinical trials according to NCCN2012 guideline. So the control group will get best supportive care.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative recurrence of intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma (ICC) is a major problem that hampers the efficacy of surgical resection. To date, adjuvant chemotherapy or other adjuvant modalities have not been proven effective for ICC. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate whether adjuvant therapy with capecitabine after the operation could inhibit the recurrence of ICC after curative resection.</summary>
