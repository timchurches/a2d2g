      <outcome>Changes From Baseline in Modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) at Month 6 - mTSS = sum of erosion and Joint Space Narrowing (JSN) scores for 44 joints (16 per hand and 6 per foot). mTSS scores ranged from 0 (normal) to 448 (worst possible total score). Change: scores at observation minus score at baseline.

Each item scored on 4-point scale, 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty;2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as sum of domain sc ores and divided by number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3: 0=least difficulty and 3=extreme difficulty.

      <outcome>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Baseline, Month 1, 3, and 6 - FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</outcome>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</outcome>

All the scales ranged from 0 (limited none of the time) to 100 (limited all of the time). Work Loss Index, which represented percentage of lost work over time period relative to a normative population, was derived (total score:0[no loss] to 100[complete loss of work]).</outcome>

      <outcome>Work Productivity and Healthcare Resource Utilization (HCRU) at Baseline, Month 3 and 6 - Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)-HCRU assessed healthcare usage during last 3 months for direct, indirect medical cost domains. Direct cost: visit to doctor, non-medical practitioner, nursing home, hospital, surgery, emergency room(ER) treatment, diagnostic tests, over-night stay, home healthcare services, aids/devices used. Indirect costs associated with functional disability: employment status, willingness to work, work disability due to RA, sick leave, part time work, ability to perform chores, chores done by family, friends or housekeeper. Assessment was based on 0 to 2-point scale; higher score=higher medical cost.</outcome>
