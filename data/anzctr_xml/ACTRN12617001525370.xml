  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) has been introduced globally, however, in 2016 shortages of IPV supply caused stock-outs and put strain on IPV use for routine immunizations as well as for poliovirus outbreak response; this shortage is going to last until 2018 if not longer. Administration of 1/5th IPV dose intradermally (fractional IPV  or fIPV) has been proved to be safe and provides similar immune response as full dose IPV administered intramuscular, however, fIPV administered with BCG needle and syringe (BCG NS) intradermally is technically difficult and many countries are hesitant to adopt fIPV in their routine immunization schedules because of the additional needs for training of health staff. 
fIPV administered intramuscularly has been less examined; the few documented uses of intramuscular fIPV suggest no safety concerns, however, it is unclear whether desired immunogenicity could be achieved.
In this study we will compare immunogenicity achieved after two doses of full dose IPV or fIPV administered at the age of 4 and 8 months to poliovirus naive children in Cuba. We will assess two volumes of fIPV doses: 1/5th and 2/5th of full dose (0.1 ml and 0.2 ml).
