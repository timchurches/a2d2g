  <interventions>
    <interventions>Exposure is body mass index &gt; 40 or body mass index &lt;30.  the primary outcome is the success or failure of use of their epidural for their anaesthetic for caesarean section.  The outcome will be measured at the time of caesarean section.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of failure to extend an existing labour epidural to successful anaesthesia for caesarean section, described as an odds ratio. Failure will be defined as:
1.    use of an alternative neuraxial technique 
2.	general anaesthesia was administered:  
a) as a pre-operative decision, before skin incision
b) as an intra-operative decision, after skin incision

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measures:  Demographic data, details of antenatal care, co-morbidities, insertion of the labour epidural and anaesthetic management for caesarean section will be collected in order to determine potential predictors of extension failure</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data from a pilot study conducted at the RBWH, using identical definitions, were used in calculating the sample size.  Assuming a failure rate of 0.159 in the control group, the study group will require 100 participants with 200 control participants, to detect an odds ratio of 2.27 (alpha equals 0.05 and beta equals 0.8).  Recruiting from two sites it may be estimated that full data collection may take three years.

The primary outcome measure will be analysed using Chi-square statistic.  Demographic and baseline data will be presented as frequencies/percent for categorical data or means/standard deviations for continuous data.  Multiple logistic regression will be used to determine significant predictors of extension failure.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnant women with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 may be recommended to have an epidural inserted early in labour.  One reason given, is to avoid a general anaesthetic.  However a pilot study showed that these women are 2.47 times more likely to receive an alternated technique.  This study aims to compare the use of epidurals at caesarean section in women with a BMI &gt; 40, with the use in women with a BMI &lt;30.  The results may affect the advice given to obese women in the antenatal period and change their anaesthetic management.</summary>
