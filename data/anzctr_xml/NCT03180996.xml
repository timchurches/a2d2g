  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients must meet all of the criteria below in order to be eligible for inclusion in the
        study -

          1. Patient is aged 18 years or over on the date of consent

          2. Patient is willing and able to comply with all study procedures and study follow-up
             visits

          3. Patient is willing and able to give written informed consent to participate in study

          4. Patient has a juxtrarenal or suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with maximum
             sac diameter = 5.5cm, or an AAA = 4.5 cm which has increased by &gt; 1.0 cm in the past
             year

          5. Patient is anatomically suitable for a bifurcated Fenestrated Anaconda device

        NOTE: Both the treating Investigator and the Manufacturer must agree that the proposed
        patient's anatomy is suitable for treatment using the Fenestrated Anaconda device. Where
        the Investigator proposes that the patient anatomy is suitable and the Manufacturer
        subsequently disagrees, the patient will be recorded as a screen failure and deemed not
        eligible for the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any patient who meets any of the criteria below will be excluded from participation in the
        study -

          1. Patient has a life expectancy &lt; 2 years, as judged by the Investigator

          2. Patient has psychiatric or other condition that in the opinion of the Investigator may
             limit their ability to comply with study procedures

          3. Patient is participating in another clinical study which in the opinion of the
             Investigator could influence the outcomes of this study

          5. Patient has a coagulopathy or uncontrolled bleeding disorder

          6. Patient has a ruptured, leaking or mycotic aneurysm

          7. Patient has a serum creatinine (S-Cr) level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (177 µmol/L)

          8. Patient has had CVA or MI within three months of enrolment or treatment

          9. Patient has a connective tissue disease (e.g. Marfan Syndrome)

         10. Patient has had a previously inserted endovascular stent in the abdominal aorta
