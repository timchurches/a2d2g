  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RPX7009
Treatment: drugs - Biapenem
Treatment: drugs - Normal saline

Placebo Comparator: Normal saline - Single and multiple dose of normal saline

Experimental: Single dose IV of biapenem or RPX7009 - Single dose IV infusion of biapenem or RPX7009

Experimental: Single dose of biapenem or RPX7009 - Single IV dose of biapenem or RPX7009 (for those on active drug, this will be the drug not given in the first IV treatment)

Experimental: Biapenem and RPX7009 in combination - Single dose followed by a multiple dose of biapenem and RPX7009 in combination


Treatment: drugs: RPX7009
Up to three (3) cohorts of 10 healthy adult subjects (8 active, 2 placebo)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety from baseline to the end of the study - Number of patients with adverse events; assessed by patient reporting, collection of vital signs, ECGs and absolute values and changes over time of hematology, chemistry and urinalysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 - Day 17</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite of Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of RPX7009, biapenem &amp; the combination following ascending single and multiple dose administration. - Comparison will be performed between the cohorts for the plasma AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Cmax, and Tmax.
Urine PK parameters such as amount excreted and % dose excreted will be calculated from urinary excretion data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 - Day 14</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite of Pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of RPX7009, biapenem &amp; the combination following ascending single and multiple dose administration. - Serum for bactericidal titers (SBT) assessments will be collected on Days 1, 4, 7 and 14 (at the end-of-infusion (EOI)), and at 2, 4, and 8 hours after start of infusion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days 1-14</timepoint>
