  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of this trial are to determine if a program of stretching before and after vigorous physical activity reduces risk of experiencing soreness after physical activity or reduces the risk of incurring an injury while participating in vigorous physical activity. The trial is internet-based and open to the whole world of English and Norwegian speakers.</summary>
