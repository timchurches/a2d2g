  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised, controlled trial of supplementation with vitamin C versus glucosamine (the 'placebo') for healing of foot ulcers.
Daily, oral capsule, 500mg of vitamin C, up to 60 days. Empty packet return will be used to assess compliance. In people in whom baseline levels are low, from the return of the result, they will receive BOTH supplements (so the first part of the study remains blinded). </interventions>
    <comparator>Vitamin C daily or glucosamine daily.
When vitamin C results are available, if deficient, people will receive BOTH treatments, so that they remain blinded to initial treatment.
Glucosamine, capsule orally, daily, 1000mg. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RCT of vitamin C versus glucosamine to improve ulcer healing in people attending the high-risk foot clinic. The hypothesis is that vitamin C will improve ulcer healing. We also predict that it will be more effective in people with diabetes, and people who are deficient in vitamin C at the beginning of the study.</summary>
