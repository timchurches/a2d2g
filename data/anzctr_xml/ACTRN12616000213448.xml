  <interventions>
    <interventions>An 18-week (semester-long) health literacy program embedded in an exisiting adult language, literacy, and numeracy (LLN) program at TAFE NSW. Core topics cover reading medicine and food labels, communicating with health professionals and shared decision making, and understanding serve size.  Non-core topics cover immunisation and screening, understanding prescriptions and talking to the pharmacist, completing medical forms, being active, understanding diet and nutritional information.  Teachers can select non-core topics based on learner needs and interests.

The program has been planned on the basis of 2x3 hour lessons per week, for 18 weeks; however, not all TAFE colleges will fit that model. A suggested lesson plan is included in the Study Manual, given to all participating teachers. It includes an overview of the trial and suggested time to cover each core topic. Students (even within the same class) will vary in their language, literacy, numeracy, and communication skills  and teachers are responsible for tailoring their teaching to suit their students needs.  For this reason the intervention program was designed to be flexible, with a relatively small number of core units.

Every effort will be made to match class size and student characteristics; however, class composition is determined by student enrolments and consent.  Class sizes are expected to range from 5 to 20 students. 

Intervention teachers were instructed to cover 10 core topics, and to use their discretion when selecting other topics.  The 2 course manuals ("Being Healthy" and "Staying Healthy") invite teachers to rate each activity as they teach it, and return the completed ratings sheet to the study centre. This enables us to monitor which activities and topics are taught.  Qualitative interviews with students and teachers also assess course content and topics covered.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be recruited following standard TAFE processes for enrolling students. Participating TAFE teachers will invite 300 adults assessed at ACSF level 2, seeking basic education at TAFE in NSW to join the study. As part of standard procedures, students literacy and numeracy levels are assessed by TAFE teachers on enrolment day. 

We will recruit classes from TAFE Institutes in metropolitan and regional centres across NSW, Australia, including multiple Sydney districts, and Illawarra, Hunter, New England, and Southern NSW.  

Eligible classes will be learning basic language, literacy and numeracy at Australian Core Skills Framework level 2 (in one of 4 eligible course codes). Intervention and standard LLN classes will be matched on typical demographic characteristics including age, sex, English proficiency, literacy skills, course code, and region.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each participating Institute will be required to contribute (at least) 2 classes that are matched on course code, time of day (i.e. day or evening) and typical student characteristics. At enrolment, students will be allocated to classes following normal TAFE procedures.  Matched classes will be randomised centrally into “intervention” or “standard LLN” groups by the University of Sydney team.  
At campuses holding only one class participating in the study, all enrolling students will be allocated to that class.  At larger metropolitan campuses with more than one participating class, students will be randomised into classes on enrolment day, by selecting an “odd” or “even” paper ticket.  Matched classes at the same location will be held on different days to minimise risk of contamination between intervention and standard groups.

Students will be invited to participate in a research trial but will be blinded as far as possible to its aims. Students will be informed simply that the study is about a new adult literacy program, the “Living Literacy Program” but will not be informed that its purpose is to evaluate a health literacy program. Detail about the purpose of the trial will be given in a debrief statement following the final data collection session (6 months after course conclusion).

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome for sample size calculation is the functional health literacy score used in our pilot study. We estimate that 86 students are required per group to detect a difference in the mean total score between the intervention and standard LLN groups of 0.5 standard deviation (SD) with 90% power at the two-sided 5% significance level. An established systematic review indicates that a half-standard deviation is the threshold of discrimination, or the minimally important difference, for changes to psychosocial outcomes in chronic disease assessment. To allow for clustering within a class and using an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.05 and an average class size of 10, the required sample size is 125 students.  Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up, we aim to recruit 150 participants in each arm (n=300 in total; 15 pairs of classes of approximately 10 students per class). This sample size will also be sufficient to detect a difference in retention of at least 20% between the intervention and standard LLN group, with 80% power.  Due to the unpredictability of TAFE enrolments, unequal cluster sizes are assumed.

Analysis will be by intention to treat. We will compare outcomes between the intervention and standard LLN arms for the primary outcome using a regression analysis and will account for clustering through the use of generalised estimating equations. 
We will also conduct secondary analyses to adjust for baseline health literacy and numeracy (measured with NVS) and language spoken at home.  We will conduct these analyses separately.  We will also conduct the same set of analyses for the primary outcomes, but using the intervention as actually received.  
For the secondary outcomes, we will only conduct intention to treat analyses, and we will also conduct further analyses that adjust for NVS and language spoken at home.  
The statistician will be blinded to the allocated group definitions (i.e., health literacy vs standard LLN) until completion of the statistical analysis.

    <summary>ABSTRACT
Background:  People with low literacy and low health literacy have poorer health outcomes. Literacy and health literacy are distinct but overlapping constructs that impact wellbeing. Interventions that target both could improve health outcomes.
Methods &amp; Design
This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with a qualitative component.  Participants are 300 adults enrolled in basic language, literacy and numeracy programs at adult education centres across New South Wales, Australia. Each adult education institute (regional administrative centre) contributes (at least) two classes matched for student demographics, which may be at the same or different campuses. Classes (clusters) are randomly allocated to receive either the health literacy intervention (an 18-week program with health knowledge and skills embedded in language, literacy, and numeracy training (LLN)), or the standard Language Literacy and Numeracy (LLN) program (usual LLN classes, specifically excluding health content). 
The primary outcome is functional health literacy skills  knowing how to use a thermometer, and read and interpret food and medicine labels.  The secondary outcomes are self-reported confidence, health literacy; shared decision making skills, patient activation, health knowledge and self-reported health behaviour. Data is collected at baseline, and immediately and 6 months post intervention. 
A sample of participating teachers, students, and community health workers will be interviewed in-depth about their experiences with the program.
Ethics and dissemination
The study has ethical approval from the University of Sydney and 10 NSW Institutes of TAFE. Results will be published in peer reviewed journals, and reported to partner organisations.
