  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation of older adults with a primary or secondary diagnosis of Intellectual disability for 6 months. 
Participants will be asked to complete a falls diary for 6 months where the rate of falls and injurious falls will be collected. The circumstance surrounding a fall will also be document when a fall occurs over a telephone interview. Participants who fall may also be asked to participate in an interview regarding their post-fall experience. </interventions>

      <outcome>Post-fall experience</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured with a face to face interview with a participant and/or their caregiver(s) after a fall to gather qualitative information about what they experienced after the fall such as the care support they received or was offered to them, what services did they access, what activities did they engage to prevent the next fall, did they experience any post-fall related fears, do they perceive any barriers in engaging in falls prevention recommendtations </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of injurious falls</outcome>
      <timepoint>A fall is classified as injurious if a participant reports a physical injury as a result of the fall. This is measured with diary collection and phone call for each participant fall.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
The incidence of falls in this population is uncertain but based on previous studies is estimated to be about 0.27. If the expected result is 0.27 we want 95% confidence, within a 1% absolute margin of error that the true incidence rate frequency lies between 0.73 and 1.27. For this we will need a minimum sample size of 78. As the study population has both physical and social disability and the observation periods extends for six months we will allow for a drop out of approximately 15%, which is higher than the 5% allowed for in previous observational falls cohort study of older people, therefore the aim is to recruit 90 participants. 

Observational study:
Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of the participants. Falls analyses will follow recommended statistical guidelines for analyzing falls data. 
The primary aim: estimate the incidence of falls - this will be expressed as incidence rate per person year (falls rate). 

The secondary aims: estimate number of fallers - this will be expressed a percentage of people falling in the cohort. 
The rate of injurious fall will be expressed as the incident rate per person year. 
Generalized linear mixed modelling will be conducted to examine patient and clinical characteristics predictive of falls, injurious falls and risk of falling in the 6 months after commencement of falls diary. 
The modelling strategies will start with unadjusted univariate analysis, followed by multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, severity of intellectual disability, presence or absence of epilepsy, level of assistance required with activities of daily living, level of mobility and a history of falls in the six months prior to enrollment in the study. These variables have been shown to be predictive of falls in either older people with intellectual disability.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls have also been identified as a serious health issue which can cause serious physical injuries and fear of falling. People living with intellectual disability (ID) in residential settings have been reported to have a higher incidence of falls and experience falls at a younger age than the general older population. There are existing comprehensive multi-targeted interventions and services for the older mainstream populations, however, its been reported that there are no suitable falls prevention guidelines or specific services targeting people with ID and their care providers. 
The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the nature of falls in people with ID and to identify gaps in recommended falls prevention service pathways that people with ID may face. The study will also investigate the barriers that people with intellectual disability may face in engaging in evidence based falls prevention guidelines. This will allow the development of preliminary recommendations for falls prevention that are specifically targeted for people with ID.
