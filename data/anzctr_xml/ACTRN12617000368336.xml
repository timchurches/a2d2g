  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is observational evidence that patients with high left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) post ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have higher mortality and re-admission rates but there are no prospective studies that have targeted LVEDP reduction after opening the infarct related artery. In order to design a prospective trial with LVEDP as the treatment target, dose of nitrates needs to be calculated that can cause a reasonable reduction in LVEDP without causing a significant drop in the systemic blood pressure. Thus, the aim of this acute hemodynamic study is to find a dose of nitrate in conjunction with a single bolus of frusemide that reduces LVEDP without causing symptomatic drop in the systemic blood pressure. We aim to enroll 20 patients in our study (Intervention group=10, Control group=10). All patients will have left heart catheterization performed and LVEDP measured immediately after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as is standard practice in our institution. Patients with LVEDP greater than 20 mmHg will be enrolled to our study. The patients in the intervention arm will have intravenous administration of frusemide 40mg bolus plus escalating doses of IV glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) during simultaneous measurement of pressure in their left ventricular cavity. We will administer 100mcg GTN intravenously and administer further 100mcg boluses each minute to a maximum of 1000mcg. The study will terminate when there is a drop in either arterial pressure or LVEDP by 20% or if 1000 mcg is reached (over 10 mins) without any demonstrable effect on LVEDP or systemic blood pressure. 
We will also perform echocardiogram simultaneously and measure mitral inflow pulse wave Doppler, mitral annular velocities (E/E' ratios), pulmonary venous pulse wave Doppler and pulmonary artery systolic pressures at baseline and after the last dose of GTN.</interventions>
    <comparator>The 10 patients in the control arm will have standard treatment for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. They will be recruited to the control arm If their LVEDP is greater than 20 mmHg after the intervention to the infarct related artery. These patients will be administered 10 mls of normal saline every minute for next 10 minutes with simultaneous measurement of LVEDP and systolic blood pressure (10 readings over 10 minutes). No trial medication will be administered to this group. We will also perform echocardiogram and measure mitral inflow pulse wave Doppler, mitral annular velocities (E/E' ratios), pulmonary venous pulse wave Doppler and pulmonary artery systolic pressures at baseline and after 10 minutes and will note the changes in these echocardiographic parameters over the 10 minute period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>For this acute hemodynamic study, we will measure pressure within the main pumping chamber of the heart (the left ventricle) with a plastic tube (called catheter) after treating the heart attack. In the intervention group, we will give increasing doses of a medication (Glyceryl trinitrate) through the drip for 10 minutes if there are no contraindications or concerns and will simultaneously measure the pressure within the main pumping chamber. Patients will also be given 40 mg of a fluid medication (frusemide). In the control group, pressure in the main pumping chamber will be measured for 10 minutes but no trial medication will be administered.
The aim of this study is to find a dose of these medications that will reduce pressure within the main pumping chamber of the heart without affecting blood pressure or causing any side effects. These medications are routinely used during all the angiography and stenting procedures but have never been used to reduce the pressure within the heart.</summary>
