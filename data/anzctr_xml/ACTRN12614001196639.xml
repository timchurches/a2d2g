    <interventions>We propose to incorporate a 0.2micron filter unit into the intravenous lines of patients undergoing anaesthesia for hip or knee replacement or cardiothoracic surgery, and a request that participant anaesthetists inject all drugs except propofol (due to its pharmaceutical characteristics) and infusions through this. The filter unit will be inserted into the patients IV administration line at the beginning of the case (just after the patient has been transported into theatre) and removed at the end of the patients stay in the post anaesthesia care unit or cardiac operating room. This involves a small change in current practice which we believe is benign and was the basis for our previous study "Investigating the microbiological contamination of drugs administered for anaesthesia in the operating theatre" ACTRN12613000040763. In the current study we will recruit participating anaesthetists managing patients under their care until the required number of cases (11,000 in total) has been included.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All surgical site infection (SSI) in patients remaining in hospital or requiring readmission to hospital, including (a) superficial incisional SSI; (b) deep incisional SSI; and (c) organ/space SSI derived from the national surveillance programme. This programme has recently been established to track SSI for total hip and total knee replacement surgery. It already provides robust data on the overall mean rate of SSI for these two conditions (the national average is currently 1.4%). The programme substantially simplifies the problem of collecting postoperative data on SSI. Surveillance for cardiac surgical operations is expected to be in place later this year and a somewhat higher rate of SSI is expected in this group (in 2013 the rate of deep SSI in cardiac patients was 2%; for superficial SSI it was 7% (unpublished data on 100 patients)). </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The participants are anaesthetic specialists, trainees and other medical officers willing to take part in the study, who will undertake 11,000 cases (a case is defined as one patient undergoing general or regional anaesthesia on one occasion). The cases are elective or acute hip or knee arthroplasty, or elective cardiothoracic surgery under general anaesthesia with or without regional anaesthesia, or under regional anaesthesia with sedation in adult patients (i.e. 16 years of age or over). We shall attempt to include all eligible cases started during normal working hours on Mondays to Fridays when the researchers and the participant anaesthetist are both available. </inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We plan to include six of the busiest district health boards, which manage hip and knee arthroplasty surgery in NZ, and all the cardiothoracic surgery. At each of six study centres we will randomly allocate “months” (actually 28 day periods) to be “filter unit months” or “standard care months” so that there is a 1:1 ratio over clusters of 6 months. Within those clusters the allocations will be in random order. For example, a sequence could be filter-filter-standard-filter-standard-standard. Thus, in each hospital over a 24-week period (6 x 4 weeks), there will be 12 weeks in which filter units will be used and 12 weeks of standard care. Allocation will be carried out by the study statistician but is not concealed. Allocation and data collection will only apply to hip and knee arthroplasties and cardiac operations.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We assume that the relationship between injected micro-organisms and SSI is not independent but rather, that micro-organism injection occurs in a higher proportion of those patients that develop an SSI. Consider 1000 patients: micro-organisms will be injected in 60 (6% from unpublished data  collection completed June 2014). If just one in 10 of these patients develops a related SSI that otherwise would not have occurred, this will be 6 infections per 1000 (0.6%) patients. Eliminating these infections would reduce SSIs from 14 (1.4%) to 8 (0.8%). A decision to change practice would only be justified by a reduction in the rate of infection; if there was either no difference or (very improbably) the filter unit increased the rate of infection, no change in practice would be justified. It follows that to show a reduction from 1.4% to 0.8% with 90% power (beta=0.10) as statistically significant (1-tailed alpha=0.05) 5503 patients per group (11006 in total  rounded to 11000, or 5500 per group) are required (estimated with MedCalc (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium)). These power calculations assume that the intra-class correlation within site blocks is 0.0. This assumption will be tested with the blinded interim analysis (with no analysis of outcomes) and if necessary the sample size amended.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study follows on from previous simulation-based research where we found bacterial growth in 13.1% (n=5/38) of empty sterile IV bags used to collect all administered medications from ten surgical scenarios. These findings were confirmed in our recently completed clinical study (data collection completed June 2014) ACTRN12613000040763. In the current study we will test the primary hypothesis that the rate of SSI will be reduced by asking anaesthetists to inject all drugs except propofol and infusions through a 0.2micron filter unit to reduce the number of micro-organisms inadvertently injected into patients' bloodstreams. Our secondary hypothesis is that the rates of all SSI are higher in Maori and Pacific than non-Maori and non-Pacific Peoples in New Zealand.</summary>
