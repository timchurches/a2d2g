    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - 5-Fluoruracil
Treatment: drugs - Folinic acid
Treatment: drugs - Onartuzumab
Treatment: drugs - Oxaliplatin
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Onartuzumab+mFOLFOX6 - Participants will receive onartuzumab 10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) intravenous (IV) infusion + mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and 5-fluoruracil) regimen. Participants will receive a maximum of 12 cycles (each cycle is 14 days) of mFOLFOX6 with onartuzumab. Participants whose disease has not progressed after 12 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with onartuzumab will continue treatment with onartuzumab until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo+mFOLFOX6 - Participants will receive onartuzumab matching placebo + mFOLFOX6. Participants will receive a maximum of 12 cycles (each cycle is 14 days) of mFOLFOX6 with placebo. Participants whose disease has not progressed after 12 cycles of mFOLFOX6 with placebo will continue treatment with placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death.


Treatment: drugs: 5-Fluoruracil
Participants will receive 5-fluorouracil 400 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) IV bolus and then 2400 mg/m^2 as a continuous IV infusion over 46-48 hours on Day 1 of every cycle until disease progression or at the maximum of 12 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Folinic acid
Participants will receive folinic acid 400 mg/m^2 IV infusion over 2 hours on Day 1 of every cycle until disease progression or at the maximum of 12 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Onartuzumab
Participants will receive onartuzumab 10 mg/kg IV infusion on Day 1 of every cycle (each cycle = 14 days) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participant or physician decision to discontinue treatment.

Treatment: drugs: Oxaliplatin
Participants will receive oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV infusion over 2 hours on Day 1 of every cycle until disease progression or at the maximum of 12 cycles, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants will receive onartuzumab matching placebo on Day 1 of every cycle (each cycle = 14 days) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or participant or physician decision to discontinue treatment.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of onartuzumab (MetMAb) in combination with 5-fluorouracil, folinic Acid,
      and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in participants with metastatic human epidermal growth receptor
      (HER) 2-negative and MET-positive adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction.
      Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either onartuzumab or placebo in
      combination with mFOLFOX6. Participants may continue to receive onartuzumab or placebo until
      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, participant or physician decision to discontinue
      treatment.</summary>
