  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A single-arm, open-label, two-stage multicenter, phase II study. Patients will be
      pre-screened for ALK positive status. Treatment with LDK378 at 750 mg qd will continue until
      the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, discontinues
      treatment at the discretion of the investigator or patient, starts a new anticancer therapy
      and/or dies. LDK378 may be continued beyond RECIST defined PD as assessed by the
      investigator, if in the judgment of the investigator, there is evidence of clinical benefit.
      Patients who discontinue the study medication in the absence of progression will continue to
      be followed for tumor assessment until the time of PD as assessed by the investigator. Male
      and female patients aged 18 or over with ALK-rearranged NSCLC will be screened for
      eligibility. Patients must have received no prior crizotinib, and must be chemotherapy-naïve
      or have been pretreated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (up to three prior lines)</summary>
