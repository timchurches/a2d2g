  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend 2 separate sessions, one week apart (on the same day and time).  On each occasion, the participant will be given a capsule to swallow containing either 600mg sulpiride or a placebo sugar pill, according to a randomised, double blind procedure. Participants will commence the study tasks after 180 minutes have elapse (to coincide with peak drug levels) and will complete the tasks within 330 minutes.  Observation will occur for a further 30 minutes.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Each measure will be analysed using a Mixed Model ANOVA and will be run twice. The first analysis will involve the within-subjects factor consisting of the conditions placebo and sulpiride and the between subjects factor consisting of DAT1 genotype group. Those with zero or one copy of the 10-repeat allele (non 10/10 group) will be compared with those with two copies of the 10-repeat allele (10/10 group) on each. The second analysis will involve the within-subjects factor consisting of the conditions placebo and sulpiride and the between subjects factor consisting of Taq1A genotype group. Homozygous carriers of the C[A2] allele will be compared with carriers of the minor allele T[A1] on each of the measures. In both instances, we are looking for the main effect of drug, main effect of gene group and an interaction of drug and gene group. Analyses will be undertaken to examine whether shifts in posterior alpha hemispheric asymmetry are in the same direction as shifts in spatial bias behaviour. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether temporarily reducing dopamine transmission in the healthy brain affects an individuals spatial selective attention, that is, the direction in space (left or right) in which an individuals visual attention naturally falls. By combining this investigation with measures of electrical activity in the brain and genetic testing, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in spatial attention and the influence on these mechanisms of genes implicated in the structure and function of the dopamine system in the brain.  Uncovering the mechanisms of spatial attention may help us better understand and treat disorders involving spatial attention deficits, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, which involves an impaired awareness of, and ability to respond to, objects and information in a particular area of visual space.
