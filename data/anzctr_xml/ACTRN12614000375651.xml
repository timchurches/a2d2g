    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be selected from those attending glaucoma clinics at the Flinders Medical Centre and the Repatriation General Hospital eye outpatients department. Once a patient has been identified as being appropriate for the study, they will be invited to be involved. If they agree, then their details will be forwarded to the department of pharmacy at the Flinders Medical Centre where randomization will take place. Patients will be allocated to either receive an intravitreal injection of Avastin (1.25mg in 0.05ml) or a sham/placebo injection of balanced-salt solution. This injection will be dispensed to the surgeon who will administer it and the completion of the trabeculectomy surgery. Patients will then be followed by the surgeon over the following 12 months.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous work and when considering an IOP of less than 21 mmHg, the 1 year complete success rate for trabeculectomy surgery can be expected to be 85%. However, this target would not be considered a success in the advanced patients who are now requiring surgery. Therefore, we would be aiming for a lower target IOP, but with that we would also expect a lower success rate. We therefore feel that an expected complete success rate of 75% would be a conservative estimate. Furthermore, we would expect that an improvement in success rate of 20% would be required for a change in practice to occur. We would therefore aim to recruit a minimum of approximately 100 patients (50 cases and 50 controls). This would allow us to detect a difference of at least 20% between groups, with 80% power and type 1 error of 5%. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Glaucoma is a progressive disease of the optic nerve, which if undiagnosed, can lead to blindness. Surgery is often reserved for very severe cases and as such, surgical success is imperative. Our project will address this by performing a randomised double blinded assessment of the adjunctive use of intraoperative intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin), a currently available and widely used anti-VEGF drug, on post-operative glaucoma surgery success. If this intervention is successful, the outcomes could undoubtedly influence future surgical management. </summary>
