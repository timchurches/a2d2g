  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Lebrikizumab
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Lebrikizumab High Dose - Participants will receive lebrikizumab at high dose level as subcutaneous (SC) injection every 4 weeks during the 44-week DBPC period, followed by a 32-week ATE period, and during the LTE period.

Experimental: Lebrikizumab Low Dose - Participants will receive lebrikizumab at low dose level as SC injection every 4 weeks during the 44-week DBPC period, followed by a 32-week ATE period, and during the LTE period.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants will receive placebo matching to lebrikizumab SC injection every 4 weeks during the 44-week DBPC period. Participants will then be randomized to receive either high- or low-dose lebrikizumab every 4 weeks during the 32-week ATE period and will continue same treatment in the LTE period.


Treatment: drugs: Lebrikizumab
Lebrikizumab will be administered as SC injections every 4 weeks at dose and schedule described in arm description.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo matching to lebrikizumab will be administered as SC injections every 4 weeks as per schedule described in arm description.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will
      evaluate the efficacy of lebrikizumab compared with placebo, as measured by the ability of
      participants to achieve lower daily doses of OCS, among those with severe
      corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Prednisone/prednisolone will be the OCS therapy prescribed.
      Participants will be randomized to receive lebrikizumab or matching placebo for 44 weeks in a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) period. Those who complete the 44-week period may
      continue into a 32-week active treatment extension (ATE) period, during which all
      participants will receive lebrikizumab treatment. Following completion of the ATE period,
      participants who have both tolerated and derived benefit from treatment with lebrikizumab may
      continue their lebrikizumab treatment into a long-term extension (LTE) period. Participants
      will transition to 24 weeks of safety follow-up upon discontinuation of study drug.</summary>
