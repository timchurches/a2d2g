  <interventions>
    <interventions>A patient with a SPN will receive a Respiratory Gated (4D) PET scan as well as their whole body PET scan.  The participant will have a 20minute whole body Positron Emission Tomography/Computerised Tomography (PET/CT) scan as per normal.  Immediatly after the whole body scan the patient will have a 10minute 4D scan.  The total scan time is approximatly 30 minutes. 

The participant will have to remain still for both scans and try to breath in a regular pattern.  The only difference between the two scans is that a breathing trace will be recorded for the 4D scan.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the number of patients who have a change in classification as a result of the addition of a 4D PET scan.  The reporting doctor will first make a diagnosis based on the whole body scan. Then the doctor will look and the 4D PET scan and any change in diagnosis as a result of the additional information will be recorded.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any change in diagnostic accuracy of Positron Emission Tomography/ Computerised Tomography (PET/CT) scanning in SPN's as a result of the addition of a 4D PET scan through long term follow up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The diagnosis will be confirmed by either biopsy or observation of the lesion on additional imaging.  The method of follow up is determined by the participant's reffering physician.  The follow up period will be no longer than 12 months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study to investigate a new scanning technique called respiratory gated (4D) PET scanning in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules.  

Who is it for?
You can be part of this trial is you have a single round lesion in your lung that needs investigation with a PET scan.  

Trial details
The participants will recieve their whole body PET scan as per normal but they will have an additional 4D PET scan that will take an extra 10 minutes. The 4D PET scan is a scan that will create a movie of the lung breathing. This movie can reduce blurring of lesions caused by movement due to normal breathing. 

The study aims to see the proportion of patients who have a change in the way the cancer is classified as a result of the additional 4D PET scan</summary>
