                  active arthritis but without active systemic features) must have a minimum of 5
                  active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the
                  absence of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion
                  or tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry.

             Subjects with psoriatic or enthesitis related arthritis must have a minimum of 3
             active joints (an active joint is defined as a joint with swelling or, in the absence
             of swelling, limited range of motion accompanied by either pain on motion or
             tenderness) at screening and baseline to be eligible for study entry.

             Treatment with stable doses of a Non Steroidal Anti inflammatory Drug (NSAID) and/or a
             stable dose of an oral glucocorticoid, and/or a stable dose of methotrexate is
             permitted.

             For subjects receiving an oral glucocorticoid: Glucocorticoids may be administered at
             a maximum dose of 0.2 mg of prednisone equivalent per kilogram per day or 10 mg per
             day for = 2 weeks before baseline, whichever is lower.

             For subjects receiving methotrexate (MTX) treatment: MTX may be administered either
             orally or parenterally at doses not to exceed 25 mg/wk or 20 mg/m2/week (whichever is
             lower); participants must have taken MTX for 3 months and be at a stable dose for at
             least 6 weeks before baseline. Subjects taking MTX must be taking folic acid or
             folinic acid in accordance with local standards.

             For subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the following topical treatments for psoriasis
             are allowed: non medicated emollients for use over the whole body; topical steroids
             including hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate =1% for the palms, soles, face,
             and intertriginous areas only; tar, salicylic acid preparations, and shampoos free of
             corticosteroids are permitted only for the scalp

          3. Inadequate response or intolerance to at least one Disease Modifying Anti Rheumatic
             Drug (DMARD), which may include MTX or biologic agents; in the case of ERA and
             psoriatic arthritis, inadequate response to Non Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs
             (NSAIDs).

          4. No evidence or history of untreated or inadequately treated active or latent
             tuberculosis (TB) infection as evidenced by the following:

               1. A negative QuantiFERON ®TB Gold In Tube test performed within the 3 months prior
                  to screening. A negative purified protein derivative (PPD) test can be
                  substituted for the QuantiFERON® TB Gold In Tube test only if the central
                  laboratory is unable to perform the test or cannot determine the results to be
                  positive or negative and the Pfizer medical monitor is informed and agrees on a
                  case by case basis.

               2. Chest radiograph without changes suggestive of active tuberculosis (TB) infection
                  within 3 months prior to screening is recommended and should be performed
                  according to local standards of care or country-specific guidelines.

               3. No history of either untreated or inadequately treated latent or active TB
                  infection.

             If a subject has previously received an adequate course of therapy for either latent
             (9 months of isoniazid in a locale where rates of primary multi drug resistant TB
             infection are &lt;5% or an acceptable alternative regimen) or active (acceptable multi
             drug regimen) TB infection, neither a PPD test nor a QuantiFERON-Gold®TM test need be
             obtained. A chest radiograph should be obtained if not done within the 3 months prior
             to screening. To be considered eligible for the study, the chest radiograph must be
             negative for active tuberculosis infection.

             A subject who is currently being treated for latent TB infection can only be enrolled
             with confirmation of current incidence rates of multi-drug resistant TB infection,
             documentation of an adequate treatment regimen, and prior approval of the Sponsor.
