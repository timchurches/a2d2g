  <interventions>
    <interventions>Completion of a questionnare (The questionnare is going to be completed by medical students of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. This questionnaire is going to be mailed to students and after asking their parents, they will be asked to complete it within a week and send it back). The type of questions included in the questionnaire is about at what age did you start controlling passing urine, stool during the day, night, about nocturnal enuresis, related family history and about existing of of incontince and voiding difficulties at present time. An individual needs about 30 minutes in order to complete it.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if the process of maturation of sphincter control during childhood is associated with voiding habits during adult life. This is going to be assesed by completing a questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of three parts: a) demographic-somatometric data, b) information on the maturation process of sphincter control of both the students and their families and c) information about the voiding habits during adult life and their various disorders. </outcome>

      <outcome>To assess if there is statistically significant correlation between nocturnal enuresis in students and their parents, impling genetic predisposition.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nocturnal enuresis and delayed urinary control during childhood are common entities. Not every child is ready for complete urinary control by 5 years of age, and it is difficult to predict their ability to gain this control. It would seem to be a continuous developmental situation with most problems resolving as the child grows older. Often, it seems to be a family trait with a parent, brother or sister late in developing complete urinary control. It is also unknown the impact of these problems in adult life and possible association with pathologic urinary conditions. The purpose of this study is to answer some of these questions.</summary>
