  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Colorectal polyps are common and usually benign and produce no symptoms. There may be single or multiple polyps and they become more common as people age. There is some evidence that most cancers develop from polyps, particularly from adenomatous polyps; therefore, detection and eradication strategies for polyps are important. In most cases, the polyps may be removed at the same time a colonoscopy is performed.</healthcondition>

      <conditioncode2>Other diseases of the mouth, teeth, oesophagus, digestive system including liver and colon</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the first part of the procedure the colonoscope is inserted through the rectum and advanced to the large intestine, using conventional colonoscopy in both groups for detecting lesions. Thereafter, patients will be randomly assigned to colonoscope withdrawal using either conventional wide-angle (approximately 10 minutes) or narrow-band imaging (NBI) technology. The colonoscopies will be performed using High Definition monitors. Appropriate and complete bowel preparation before colonoscopy will be ensured using four liters of polyethylene glycol lavage until clear rectal fluid will be  evacuated as well as cleaning enema</interventions>
    <comparator>The narrow-band imaging (NBI) technology in conventional video colonoscopes uses special filters to narrow a light source, eliminating red, enhancing structures and rendering vascular structures in black (approximately 10 minutes).</comparator>
