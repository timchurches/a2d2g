  <interventions>
    <interventions>- Reprioritising play and reframing risk: one 2 hour workshop with teachers and parents. The adults will examine their beliefs regarding play and risk associated with active play. Discussions will focus on the benefits of play, healthy vs unhealthy risk and the consequences of preventing children from engaging in play and healthy risk taking. 
- Introduction of unstructured play materials: The play material (e.g. car tyres, milk crates, crash mats etc.) will be present on the school playgrounds during the 13 week intervention and can be used by all the children at the school.</interventions>
    <comparator>Regular school recess where the children are free to engage in activity as they normally would.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Disturbing numbers of children in Australia are overweight, bullied or have poor mental health  problems that are often inter-related. Recent decreases in outdoor play may be partly responsible. Outdoor play pulls for social interaction and physical activity; indoor play is often sedentary and solitary. Most young children love active outdoor play but parents and teachers fear injury. 

This project is a school-based intervention to increase outdoor play by: (1) adding 'loose part' materials to the playground and (2) helping adults change their views of risk associated with active play. We expect to demonstrate a significant effect on childrens activity levels, coping and social skills through strategies that are replicable in every school playground in the nation and to contribute to policy regarding play, health, and education.</summary>
