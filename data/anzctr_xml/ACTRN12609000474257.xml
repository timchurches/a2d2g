  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will examine the uptake into, and removal from the human body, of meloxicam.  The update and removal of meloxicam from the Meloxicam Nanoformulation capsules and marketed capsules (called Mobic (R)) will be compared, when they are taken after a fast and after a high fat breakfast.  There will be four treatments in the study.  The Sponsor wants to know if the meloxicam in the Meloxicam Nanoformulation capsules is absorbed more quickly than the meloxicam in Mobic(R).</summary>
