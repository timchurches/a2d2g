    <interventions>Oral chloroquine tablet (25 mg base/kg divided to be given over 3 days; day 0, 5 mg base/kg per/meal for 3 meals; day 1, 5 mg/kg; day 2, 5 mg/kg). In this trial, we study the efficacy of chloroquine alone for the treatment of uncomplicated vivax malaria. So we give Primaquine after study finished. The standard treatment of vivax malaria patient in Thailand is 25 mg base/kg divided to be given over 3 days plus primaquine 20 mg base taken daily for 14 days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment outcomes will be classified on the basis of an assessment of the parasitological and clinical outcome of antimalarial treatment according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Thus, all patients will be classified as having early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of any adverse event such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. will be documented. All patients will be asked routinely about the previous symptoms and about symptoms that have emerged since the previous follow-up visit. When clinically indicated, patients will be evaluated and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case report form. Serious adverse events must be reported to the sponsor.</outcome>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria in Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi provinces in Thailand 
Background: Current first-line treatment for P. vivax in Thailand is chloroquine. Study conducted in 2009 in 2 sentinel sites revealed high efficacy of the chloroquine (100%). The monitoring the efficacy of the first line treatment to generate valuable information for updating the national treatment policy is critical. 
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of chloroquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria in Mae Hong Son and Kanchanaburi provinces in Thailand
Methods: Antimalarial drug efficacy trials will be conducted in 2 sites. The participants will be febrile patients aged 6 months and above with confirmed uncomplicated P. vivax infection. Vivax malaria patients will be treated with Chloroquine 25 mg base/kg divided over 3 days; day 0, 5 mg base/kg per/meal for 3 meals; day 1, 5 mg/kg; day 2, 5 mg/kg. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy for vivax malaria. The study will be conducted from July to December, 2010. The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated P. vivax malaria.</summary>
