    <statisticalmethods> Statistical analysis of treatment effects on primary and secondary endpoints will according to intention-to-treat principles.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of trial medication will be included in the analysis.  We will use an intention-to-treat analysis of all randomised participants with relevant sensitivity analyses. This will use a generalised linear mixed model for longitudinal analysis to estimate both temporal (random, repeat measure) and treatment effects. This model allows adjustment for time x treatment interactions, adjustment for baseline levels and is robust to missing-at-random data. Possible bias by different study centres will be assessed and adjusted for as a fixed effect by centre.  The primary endpoint (mean fully adjusted treatment effects with 95% CI) will be the treatment change over time represented by the interaction term in the model. A per-protocol analysis is also planned

The sample size has been calculated to be 250 based on assumptions made from our initial 12 month RCT.  In this RCT, infection or death occurred in 32% of subjects on testosterone and 49% of subjects on placebo.  The patients that completed the RCT were a healthier group than those who dropped out, with a lower MELD score and higher serum testosterone, thus we expect a lower event rate for the second 12 months.  We therefore estimate the event rate for 2 years to be 1.5 times the 12 month event rate, at 48% in testosterone-treated subjects versus 73% on placebo.  To demonstrate a 25% reduction in the composite endpoint over 2 years with power of 80% and a type I error rate of 0.05 and type II error rate of 0.2, a sample size of 118 is required.  Given the dropout rate in our initial RCT of just over 50%, we aim to recruit 250 men, 125 in each group</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many cirrhotic men have reduced testosterone (T) levels. We recently found that testosterone deficiency is an independent predictor of death in this population. One possible explanation for this is that testosterone deficiency contributes to sarcopenia, a known risk factor for the development of both serious infections and mortality in cirrhotics. In a recent 12 month randomised study we showed that testosterone treatment has multiple short term beneficial effects in testosterone deficient cirrhotic men. These included improvement of sarcopenia, increased bone mass and increased haematocrit. However, this study was not powered to assess the effects of testosterone treatment on the major clinical endpoints linked to sarcopenia in cirrhosis of infection and death.
We therefore propose to conduct a multi-centre randomised placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of 24 months T treatment in 250 cirrhotic men with a low T level (serum total T &lt; 12nmol/L or free T &lt; 230pmol/L) to investigate whether T treatment will reduce the composite outcome of mortality or hospitalisation for infection. 
Primary hypothesis: In cirrhotic men with low testosterone, T therapy will reduce the composite outcome of mortality or hospitalisation for infection, a major trigger for decompensation in chronic liver disease
Secondary hypotheses: T treatment will improve the following measures: total numbers of days in hospital, muscle mass, muscle function, bone mass, fat mass, insulin resistance, haemoglobin and quality of life
Aim: To conduct a 2-year, multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine if T treatment together with dietary and exercise advice improves outcomes in men with cirrhosis.
