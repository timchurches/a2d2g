  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety (Subjects Without a Model 4396 Lead Related Complication) - A subject who was free of a Model 4396 lead related complication by the one month visit. All adverse events (AE) in the time frame were recorded at the subject's center and assessed by a centralized Adverse Event Advisory Committee (AEAC). The AEAC determined whether an AE was a complication and whether the event was related to the Model 4396 lead. A complication is an AE that results in death, termination of significant device function or invasive intervention (any therapy that penetrates the skin including administration of intramuscular (IM) and parenteral (IV) fluids).</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Distal Tip Electrode Voltage Threshold - Subjects' distal tip electrode voltage threshold was collected at the one month visit. The Model 4396 was considered effective if the mean voltage threshold was less than 3.0 Volts. Voltage threshold was collected using LV tip to Right Ventricular (RV) coil configuration at 0.5 milliseconds [ms]. Voltage threshold is the minimum energy required from the device to consistently pace the ventricle.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy: Proximal Ring Voltage Threshold - Subject's proximal ring electrode voltage threshold was collected at the three months visit. The Model 4396 was considered effective if the mean voltage threshold was less than 3.0 Volts.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

    <summary>This study is designed to show that a new lead, which paces the left bottom chamber (left
      ventricle) of the heart, is safe and effective. Using a lead on the left side of the heart
      has been shown to potentially improve heart failure symptoms. The shape and size of this new
      lead may make it a good choice for patients or physicians.</summary>
