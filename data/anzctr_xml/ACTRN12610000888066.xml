  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be a  4 week lead in period during which all the participants will consume their habitual diets. Faecal samples  over a 48 hour period will be collected immediately prior to this period ,to determine habitual profiles, and then at the end of each subsequent fortnight of a 16 week study period.During the first 4 week intervention period half of the participants will be asked to consume a diet containing rye bread ,4 slices per day then crossover after 4 weeks washout period to the comparator treatment.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The consumption of rye foods has been shown to improve some markers of bowel and metabolic health in humans. However, the effects of rye foods on the activity and numbers of bacteria of the large bowel, which are increasingly being shown to be important mediators of gut health and health more broadly, are poorly understood. It is the primary objective of this study to determine whether the consumption of a rye bread  selectively stimulates the growth of the bacteria Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli in the large bowel of humans.</summary>
