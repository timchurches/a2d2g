  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Home
Other interventions - Ward
Treatment: drugs - ceftriaxone
Treatment: drugs - flucloxacillin

Experimental: Home - Patients will be treated at home through the Hospital-In-The-Home program with intravenous once daily ceftriaxone (50mg/kg once daily), administered by a nurse/doctor visiting once daily.

Active Comparator: Ward - Patients will be admitted to hospital ward and treated with six hourly flucloxacillin (50mg/kg), administered by a ward nurse as per routine practice.


Other interventions: Home
The main intervention is for children with uncomplicated cellulitis to remain at home throughout the period of intravenous treatment but as it is not feasible to administer flucloxacillin four times a day by the Hospital-In-The-Home team, once daily ceftriaxone is the most ideal antibiotic to be given to this group

Other interventions: Ward
Admission to a hospital based ward

Treatment: drugs: ceftriaxone
50mg/kg once daily

Treatment: drugs: flucloxacillin
50mg/kg 6 hourly

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many children every year present to the Emergency Department (ED) at The Royal Children's
      Hospital (RCH) with cellulitis (skin infection). If it is mild, the children can go home with
      oral antibiotic treatment. If it is complicated and severe, these children are admitted to
      hospital for intravenous (IV, through a drip) antibiotic treatment. There is a middle group
      with uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis who require IV antibiotics but who are not
      acutely unwell. In order to determine whether it is just as effective for children with
      uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis to receive antibiotic treatment at home (via
      Hospital-In-The-Home) as it is to receive antibiotic treatment in hospital, there is a need
      to conduct a larger study and randomly assign children to receive either HITH or hospital
      ward care.

      The primary research question to be addressed is:

      In children with moderate/severe uncomplicated cellulitis, is the failure rate at 2 days
      following the first dose of antibiotic non-inferior for children treated with IV antibiotics
      at home compared to the failure rate at 2 days following the first dose for children treated
      with IV antibiotics in hospital?</summary>
