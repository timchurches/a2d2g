    <interventions>In this study, the efficacy and tolerability 2g daily of oral N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) will be compared to placebo as an augmenting strategy in patients with SZ who have proven resistant to clozapine. All participants will remain on clozapine for the duration of the trial (i.e. 52 weeks). Adherence will be monitored with pill checks at each visit and the supervision of all doses.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Intention-to-treat analysis will be employed to prevent over-estimation of efficacy. Categorical variables will be analysed using chi-squared tests (or Fishers exact test for small samples). A mixed-effects model, repeated measures (MMRM) approach will be used to examine the longitudinal profile of all continuous variables at weeks 8, 24, and 52 post-baseline. For all MMRM analyses, baseline scores will be used as covariates and the models will include pre-specified fixed effects of treatment, site, and time, and treatment-by-time and treatment-by-site interactions.
The MMRM modelling for the primary outcome measure  PANSS Negative scores   will also include baseline PANSS Positive, Negative, and General Psychopathology scores, CDSS scores, and extrapyramidal side effects (AIMS, SAS) as covariates. The secondary outcomes consist of CDSS, LQoLP, and MCCB global score, while the process outcomes include GSH concentrations peripherally and cortically, respectively.
Secondary analyses using Analysis of Covariance will be conducted to compare change scores during treatment and follow-up phases for all primary, secondary, and process outcomes using treatment group as a main effect with the baseline score as a covariate. Correlational analyses will also be performed to examine for relationships between outcome variables (i.e. treatment response with cognition and GSH levels, peripherally and cortically).
Power was calculated to detect a medium effect size of d = 0.5. The calculations followed the method described by Diggle et al. and assumed one primary outcome measure (PANSS Negative scores), four assessment points (baseline, 8-weeks, 26-weeks, and 52-weeks follow-ups), a study-wide Type I error rate (alpha) of .05, a Type II error rate (beta) of .10 (power of .90), a correlation of post-treatment scores with baseline measurements (rho) of 0.70, and a two-tailed statistical test. To detect the effect size of d = 0.5, 45 participants in each of the control and intervention groups will be required. Allowing for up to 46% attrition (based on a 20% dropout over the first 8 weeks and a further 30% dropout over the ensuing 44 weeks), a total of 168 participants, or 84 in each group will be recruited. Similar attrition rates are reported in other treatment trials with treatment resistant SZ. To accommodate the required number of patients, at least 42 patients will need to be recruited from each of the four study sites. For the MRS component, groups of 15-20 are widely accepted as an appropriate size to permit appropriate neuroimaging analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A proportion of individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) do not respond adequately to clozapine, with anything from 40-60% of individuals having residual symptoms at the completion of an adequate trial of clozapine. Agents that could work synergistically with clozapine to improve efficacy whilst not increasing the side effect burden are both desired and necessary to improve the lives of individuals with clozapine-resistant SZ, such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Our group has extensive experience with NAC with pilot data support from a rigorous RCT exploring the efficacy of NAC in clozapine-resistant SZ. This project grant seeks funding to expand this work by conducting a multi-site randomised placebo-controlled trial of NAC in the treatment of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia, with 8, 24 and 52 week endpoints. 
We will target negative symptoms as our primary outcome measure, with quality of life and cognition as secondary outcomes. We will examine both peripheral and cortical glutathione concentrations. Additionally, we will measure a number of other biomarkers pertinent to the glutathione hypothesis. Such analyses will further our understanding the role of oxidative stress in SZ.
The trial is a randomised controlled double-blinded superiority trial of two parallel patient groups. The study will be conducted across four Australian sites, namely Melbourne (St Vincents Mental Health Service), Sydney (Cumberland Hospital), Adelaide (Northern Adelaide Local Health Network), and Brisbane (Metro South Addiction and Mental Health Service). Forty-two patients will be recruited from each of the sites, with a total target of 168 patients aged 18 - 65 years meeting DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia. Block randomisation will be used.
This trial, if successful, will establish a cheap, safe and easy-to-use agent (NAC) as a go to adjunct in patients only partly responsive to
clozapine.</summary>
