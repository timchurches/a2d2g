  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study contains two distinct phases.


Phase I: A 3-month Weight Loss (WL) phase

All men in the study will receive a WL tool kit which has been developed and extensively tested in our pilot research. The SHED-IT WL Program includes:

1.The SHED-IT WL DVD for Blokes
2.The SHED-IT WL Handbook for Blokes
3.The SHED-IT WL Log Book for Blokes'
4. Tools (pedometer, tape measure and kJ counter book). 

Men will also be advised to self-monitor their food and exercise diary 4 days each week and record their weight weekly.

Men will receive weekly text messages to reinforce key behaviours for weight loss and to target the hypothesised cognitive and behavioural mediators of behaviour change outlined in Social Cognitive Theory (e.g. self efficacy, social support).


Phase II: A 36-month Weight Loss Maintenance (WLM) phase (6-month WLM Program + additional 30 months of unsupervised follow-up)

The 'baseline' assessment for this RCT will occur at the beginning of Phase II (i.e. 3 months after the commencement of the weight loss program in Phase I).

At this assessment, all men who have lost at least 4 kg during Phase I will be randomised to either a self-help control group (see comparator / control treatment below) or a WLM group. Men who have not lost at least 4 kg will not be eligible for Phase II of this study.

The WLM group will receive the SHED-IT WLM program, which is a six month program that includes:

1. 'The SHED-IT WLM DVD for Blokes'
2. 'The SHED-IT WLM Handbook for Blokes'
3. 'The SHED-IT WLM Logbook for Blokes'
4. A Gymstick (portable, elastic tubing resistance training device).
5. Access to the weekly SHED-IT WLM Online Blog

Men will be advised to engage with the resources at their discretion and to check in with the WLM Blog weekly. A gymstick manual will be provided to men, but the intervention will not involve a specified resistance training program. However men will be advised to aim for at least 300 minutes per week of moderate physical activity.

Men will also be encouraged to continue self-monitoring their food and exercise 2 days per week and to record their weight each week.

Men will receive fortnightly text messages to reinforce key behaviours for weight loss maintenance and to target the hypothesised cognitive and behavioural mediators of behaviour change outlined in Social Cognitive Theory (e.g. self efficacy, social support).</interventions>

    <concealment>Study information for the two different groups (SHED-IT Weight Loss Maintenance and Self-help control) will be pre-packed into identical black plastic opaque envelopes
and consecutively numbered and ordered according to the randomisation schedule.

The packing and sequencing of these envelopes will be completed by a research assistant who will not be involved in enrolment, assessment or allocation of participants.

Study participants will complete all 3-month assessments before proceeding to a separate room to meet with a research assistant who will not be involved with the baseline assessments. The allocation sequence will be concealed during this process.

Participants who have not lost 4 kg or more will not be eligible for entry into Phase II of this study and will not be randomised.

Participants who have lost at least 4 kg will be stratified by weight loss and 3-month weight and their name will be written down in the next available position in their relevant strata before being provided with their information pack.

At this point the envelope will be opened by the research assistant and details of the particular information pack will be provided to the participant using a standardised protocol.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation allocation sequence will be generated by a statistician who will not have any contact with participants during the trial. Allocation will be stratified by weight loss and 3-month weight and the allocation sequence within strata will be generated by a computer based random number producing algorithm. Randomisation codes will be stored in a restricted computer folder, which will not be accessible by those assessing participants, those involved in group allocating participants or those participating in data entry for the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity in men is one of the greatest public health challenges facing Australia. Obesity is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and a major cause of preventable death and disability. With 70% of Australian men overweight or obese, the current and predicted financial and human costs are alarming. Despite men being more susceptible than women to many of the serious consequences of obesity such as CVD, men rarely engage in weight loss (WL) programs, and when they do lose weight they rarely maintain the WL. There is an urgent need to develop and evaluate novel and cost effective approaches that achieve long-term WL in men. The aim of this pilot study is to develop and evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a WL maintenance (WLM) program specifically for men.</summary>
