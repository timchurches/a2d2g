  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lifestyle intervention: intensive heart failure education over 12 weeks by study nurses to encourage a life-time low salt diet, fluid monitoring and regular daily exercise as tolerated, as well as awareness of symptoms of exacerbation of heart failure and knowledge of disease process.  Two weekly phone calls for 2 years after randomisation by study nurse to monitor health status and provide encouragement.  Titration of medications by a cardiologist at monthly visits, guided by echocardiography. Functional status as measured by oxygen uptake and exercise stress test and 6 minute walk test prior to randomisation and at one and two years, blood testing to monitor renal &amp; liver function and B-type natriuretic peptile (BNP) level during titration of medication, at randomisation and at one and two years</interventions>
    <comparator>Those enrolled participants who exhibit remodelling (unresponsive to drug therapy) once fully titrated on heart failure medications (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme [ACE] Inhibitors and Beta Blockers), as per echocardiography,  or whose B-type natiruretic peptide levels remain elevated will be randomised to one of two arms:
Arm #1 will undergo further echocardiography and functional testing at 12months and 24months.  They will receive the usual care and monitoring provided by their own General Practitioner (GP) or cardiologist and the outpatient heart failure care provided by the hospital heart failure services if they chose to enrol in this program.
Arm #2 - An intensive disease management program as outlined in the intervenion (above).  A further randomisation will occur within this group (for eligible participants - not taking hydralazine and nitrates for another purpose and whose blood pressure is considered acceptable by the investigator) to receive hydralazine and nitrates in addition to the standard medication regime for heart failure or placebo. The participants will be monitored 2 weekly initially for 3 visits and thereafter monthly by the study investigator as long as considered necessary.  At 12 months all patients will cross over to the alternative of either active or placebo medication.  All eligible Arm #2 participants will be given 12months of active hydralazine and nitrate and 12 months of placebo. The placebo consists of an inactive substance (a sugar pill) and will look similar to the active medication.   Eligible participants will commence on 25mg twice daily of hydralazine and be uptitrated to 50mg twice daily as tolerated, as well as 60mg of nitrate daily and be uptitrated to 120mg daily as tolerated. All medications are oral tablets.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether sequential physiologic assessment using B-type Natriuretic Peptile (BNP), 3-dimensional and strain rate echocardiography can guide the management of Congestive Heart Failure. The efficacy of this strategy will be established by assessment of functional capacity using measurement of oxygen uptake with exercise (VO2), 6-minute walk (6MW), hospital admissions and quality of life. The study will also assess whether a the use of a combination of nitrate (isosorbide mononitrate) and hydralazine in addition to the contemporary medical regimen (including beta blockers and ACE Inhibitors) leads to improved outcomes in symptomatic patients with systolic heart failure.
Hypotheses:
#1  Short-term (3 month) reduction of end-systolic volume on medical therapy, BNP and cardiac imaging are predictors of improved functional capacity, BNP and Quality Of Life (QOL) at 12 months. This will be addressed by an observational trial.
#2 - Use of physiologic testing to guide intensity of a Heart Failure Managment Program (HFMP) (including the combination of isosorbide mononitrate and hydralazine to the contemporary medical regimen) leads to better outcomes over 2 years follow-up.</summary>
