  <interventions>
    <interventions>The BTM wound dressing is composed of polyurethane materials, 2mm in thickness and is available in multiple sizes.
 
A qualified surgeon will administer the following procedures:
The wound bed must be cleaned with no devitalized tissue present. The BTM foam side is pressed into the wound, held with surgical steel staples and then applied with overlying dressing and crepe bandages. Dressings are changed every 3-5 days. 
The BTM may be ready for grafting by 3-5 weeks. The BTM membrane is removed (delamination) leaving foam remnants attached to its underside. The wound is refreshed by gentle demabrasion until gently bleeding surface is obtained. A split skin graft is secured to the surface of BTM with staples or sutures and dressed.

    <statisticalmethods>If the level of significance is set to 0.05 with a 2-sided test, a postulated standard deviation for average % take rate of SSG of 12.5% then 28 patients will provide 90% power to test the null hypothesis that average % take rate of SSG was less than or equal to 77% against the alternative hypothesis that average % take rate of SSG was equal to 85%. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for average % take rate of SSG will be approximately Â±4.6%, which provides a narrow CI for the estimation of average % take rate of SSG. Analysis will be conducted on an intent-to-treat (ITT) basis.

The sample size will be increased to 30 to allow for some early withdrawals.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of a novel, biodegradable dermal matrix for the treatment of patients with deep burns (deep-dermal/full-thickness injuries) involving 10-70% total body surface area (TBSA) requiring burn excision and significant skin grafting. 

Current standard of care for deep partial or full-thickness burns includes early excision of necrotic tissue and prompt coverage. This attenuates the postburn hypermetabolic response, decreases fluid loss, and ultimately improves survival. 

A full thickness autograft (skin transplant) is used to cover the debrided wound. However, if the extent of the burns is very severe, then this approach becomes impracticable, there is not enough healthy skin left to harvest and the patient is already too unwell to cope with another large wound. 

For moderate to large burn injuries in subjects, grafting at a second operation allows significant physiological recovery of the subject prior to graft harvest and application. Reducing the early surgical insult to major burn injury sufferers is important in assisting patient survival and reduces the risk of loss of resources (such as harvested applied skin grafts and skin graft donor sites) secondary to physiological insufficiency or deterioration. 

The Biodegradable Temporising Matrix (BTM), manufactured and assembled by PolyNovo Biomaterials Pty Ltd has been designed specifically for use in extensive full thickness burn injuries, but its structure and properties make it suitable for other full thickness wounds where dermal reconstruction is necessary or desirable.</summary>
