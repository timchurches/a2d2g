  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Movement Strategy Training (MST): an 8-week, once-weekly 120 minute individualised program which comprises strategies to prevent falls, enhance balance and improve mobility, along with education about risk factors for falls and general education about Parkinsons disease. Participants will also receive a once-weekly individualized and structured home program to reinforce the content of each outpatient session. The person shall also receive one home visit by an occupational therapist (OT). The OT will conduct a detailed environmental analysis using a standardized home assessment checklist and recommend home modifications to minimize falls risk.

2. Progressive Strength Training (PST):  an 8-week, once-weekly 120 minute individualised program for functional strengthening of muscles such as quadriceps, hamstrings, calf, tibialis anterior, glutei, abductor and trunk muscles plus education about methods to prevent falls and general education about Parkinsons disease. Each person shall receive a strength program that is tailored to their individual needs and reinforced by a once-weekly individualized and structured home program. An OT will perform one home visit as above except without MST.
</interventions>
    <comparator>3. Control group (CG): the CG will receive an 8 week, once -weekly 120 minute outpatient social activity program (games, crafts, cooking, general education about Parkinsons) provided by an OT. Participants will also receive a once-weekly individualized and structured home program of activities. During the program, the person will receive 1 home visits by a nurse to check on general well-being, mobility or physical function.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are common and disabling in people with Parkinsons disease, affecting up to 60% of those who live at home. This clinical research trial aims to minimize the number of falls and fall-related injuries in people with Parkinsons disease and to improve mobility and participation in life. Two physical therapy programs, known as movement strategy training and strength training will be coupled with falls education and compared with a social program plus usual care. The effects of therapy will be measured for a period of 12 months. The data analyst will be blinded to group allocation. After 12 months, quality of life is predicted to be higher in the people that receive strengthening or strategy training because falls and injuries are predicted to be less than for usual care. Quality of life in close family members is also predicted to increase, by lessening the burden of care arising from the disease. The results will provide information about which therapy programs are most effective for reducing falls and improving mobility, so that people with Parkinsons can continue to lead safe and fulfilling lives.</summary>
