  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both caregivers and dementia patients in the intervention arm will be offered a group-based rehabilitation concurrently but in separate groups of 10 persons. These groups will consist only caregivers and only patients. They will meet four hours in a day center once a week over a total of 8 weeks. There are two professional group facilitators in each group. The facilitators have received thorough training. 
Intervention will empower older people by encouraging them to bring up their wishes and aims of group work. The contents of the group discussions will be based on the preferences of the participants. The aim is to enhance agency of older people and their self-management skills. Intervention will take advantage of group dynamics, peer support. 
The group facilitators will make one home-visit before the intervention to get to know the participants and to encourage them to express their needs and hopes for the intervention. Group intervention will be objective-oriented.</interventions>

    <concealment>During years 2011-12 160 dementia patients and their spouses will be recruited from memory clinics and newspaper advertisement. The couples will be randomized in clusters of 20. After assessing 20 couples with eligibility criteria confirmed and agreeing to consent the study, the randomization will be performed by calling to randomisation unit where  an outsider person will use the computer programm for the allocation. The allocation will be concealed by central randomisation using phone  and computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Couples will be randomly allocated by means of computer-generated random numbers to two arms: to receive group-based intervention or to receive the usual care. The study nurse will call by telephone to a randomization staff member who has not seen the couples neither their clinical records. She will assign the next number from the computer and the group assignment to the patient.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>According to the literature, the dementia families feel that they receive too little support and information to solve their concerns related to dementia and they often have feelings of isolation. The aim of this study is to investigate whether self-management enhancing group intervention has effectiveness on dementia patients and spousal caregivers. 160 dementia patients and their spouses will be recruited from memory clinics for the randomized controlled trial. The intervention will be arranged in groups of 10 caregivers and 10 patients separately. The intervention contents will  be based on closed group dynamics and on the preferences of the participants. It aims to empower participants, promot their problem solving skills, self-efficacy and mastery in their life.  The primary outcome measures are dementia patients' (15D) and spousal caregivers (RAND-36) quality of life and caregiers sense of competence (SCI). Secondary outcomes will be e.g.  the use and costs of health care services of home-dwelling dementia patients and their spouses.</summary>
