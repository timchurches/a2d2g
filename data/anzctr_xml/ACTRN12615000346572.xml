  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thirty patients have inoperable upper gastrointestinal  tumors including (cancer lower third esophagus, stomach, pancreas, biliary tract).
Technique of modified trans-discal neurolytic celiac plexus  block procedure it will be undertaken in each patient on a single occasion only:
Step1.  Position and monitor the patient 
Place the patient prone on the table. Place a pillow under the abdomen to flex the thoraco-lumbar spine. The patients head is turned to the side, and the arms are permitted to hang freely off each side of the table. 
Oxygen is provided by nasal cannula.
Monitoring of vital signs is mandatory heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation.
The area extended from inferior border of the scapula  to iliac creast will be sterilized by bovine iodine and trapped in sterile fashion. 
Step2.  Equipment and drugs for the technique 
10 ml syringe for local anesthetic 2 % xylocaine. 
10 ml syringes for neurolytic agent (alchole 70%). 
One 15 cm, 22 gauge CHIBA needle for Celiac block. 
5 ml syringe for the contrast material ( omnipaque 300mg/ml). 
1% xylocaine for skin infiltration.
Step3.  Visualization 
The body of  T12 and L1vertebra will be  identified in the postero-anterior view of fluoroscopy keeping a mark on space between T12-L1, then,  in a caudo-cephalic direction to achieve alignment of the vertebral body of L12- L1 disc space.
 Rotate fluoroscope to an oblique position ipsilateral (20 - 40 degree) guided by entrance of facetal line between T12 and L1 toward midline. 
Step 4 .  Direction of the needle 
Skin infiltration will be  made just lateral to superior articular process of T12.
Needle insertion at this point till feeling gritty sensation of disc enterance. Then, turn C- arm to lateral position to evaluate passage of the needle through disc space. While advancing the needle, loss of resistance will be confirmed using saline till penetrating the disc. Now position the C -arm for the postero-anterior view again to verify the midline position of the needle with the vertebral body.
Aspirate for blood. If the aspiration test is positive, withdraw and redirect the needle.
Step 5 .  Confirm the position of the needle 
Inject 5 ml of (omnipaque 300mg/ml). On the postero-anterior view the contrast material will spread adhering to the T12, L1 vertebral body. A smooth contoured image will appear in the lateral view; the tip on the lateral view should stay retrocrural to the aorta.
Step 6 .  Celiac block
Inject 3ml of xylocaine 2% via CHIBA needle.
Inject 40 ml of 70% alcohol via needle and then, inject 1ml of 0.9% of normal saline during needle withdrawal to avoid track formation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Upper gastrointestinal cancer pain as assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS 0 - 10)</outcome>
      <timepoint>patients will be evaluated personally in pain clinic every two weeks and by telephone every week (to evaluate patient generally and if there is any need for early date as incidence of severe pain, change character of pain or side effects). Pain intensity will be determined by asking the patients to record the scale (VAS) daily on a paper given to them from the clinic and the observer will calculate the average weekly.   However, data will be included in statistical analysis at preprocedure,   then every 2 weeks for 4 months and then monthly for one year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Opioid consumption during the follow up period by patient self-report and pain physician report</outcome>
      <timepoint>data will be included in statistical analysis  every 2 weeks for 4 months and then monthly for one year after the procedure. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>opioids side effects, including loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, insomnia, constipation, urinary retention, pruritis will be evaluated and subjectively determined by each patient. Incidence of side effects as will be informed by the patient and if  it will be find moderate to severe degree and require medications, changing opioid regimen or tapering the dose down, it will be reported in the results </outcome>
      <timepoint>during the follow up period, i.e. up to 1 year post procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The chi-square test and Fisher's exact test will be used for qualitative parameters. Data shown as means +/- SD will be analyzed by Student's t test. Mean values will be rounded off to the nearest whole number. Statistical analysis will base on intention to treat analysis by substituting the missing data due to patients' death by the last reported data. A significant difference was accepted when P &lt; 0.05. 
This study will be a preliminary one to test the validity of the technique.  The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives was determined, based on previous clinical study of the author which supported that 30 patients is enough to detect  statistical significant  difference  in visual analogue scale
