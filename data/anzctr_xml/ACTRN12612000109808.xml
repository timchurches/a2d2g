  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups, receiving combined use of ICG and methylene blue(Combination Group) or methylene blue alone as the lymphatic mapping tracer.Methylene blue will be injected periareolarly or peritumorally 8 minutes before the standard biopsy insicion.In the combination group,ICG would be injected 3 minutes before the surgery.In the combination group, sentinel lymph nodes are identified by ICG fluorescence using a near-infrared camera and blue stained lymph nodes found during this precedure will also be resected, while in blue dye alone group, sentinel lymph nodes are identified as blue nodes along the blue lymphatic vessel.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Methylene blue is widely used in developing country for SLNB.The ICG is an innovative fluorescent tracer that could be visualized by near-infrared camera.This trial is designed to compare the efficacy and Safety of Combined Use of ICG Fluorescence and Methylene Blue Dye versus dye alone  for SLNB in Breast Cancer Patients.</summary>
