  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioavailability study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing three formulations of tiotropium with no health condition or problem studied. 

Tiotropium is a long-acting, antimuscarinic agent, which is often referred to as an anticholinergic and is used to make breathing easier for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).</healthcondition>
    <conditioncode>
      <conditioncode1>Other</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Research that is not of generic health relevance and not applicable to specific health categories listed above</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives tiotropium test formulation 1 on one occasion, tiotropium test formulation 2 on one occasion and the innovator formulation of Spiriva HandiHaler on one occasion with each dose separated by a 21 day washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of tiotropium.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 2 hours after dosing. Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and will be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing , urine dipstick pregnancy testing and urine dipstick drugs of abuse testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site at least 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory, oximetry and spirometry tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis, serum pregnancy, RPR and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose will be inhaled using an inhaler. Each subject will be trained on the correct use of the inhaler using empty training devices. 

Due to the commercially sensitive nature of this study the Sponsor company has requested that the doses to be administered are not disclosed.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of tiotropium (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the three formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for tiotropium using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines. </outcome>
      <timepoint> 0, 0.03, 0.05, 0.08, 0.17, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 4.00, 6.00, 8.00, 12.00, 18.00, 24.00, 36.00, 48.00 and 72.00 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. </outcome>
