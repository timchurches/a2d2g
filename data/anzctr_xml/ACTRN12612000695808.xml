  <interventions>
    <interventions>Use of a specific mechanical dynamic orthosis plus Occupational Therapy training (intensive one­-on­-one movement training sessions, behavioural strategies to increase patient motivation, and a task­-specific home exercise program using the mechanical dynamic orthosis).
The mechanical dynamic orthosis (Saebo splint) is worn on the hemiplegic arm only, and may be used up to twice daily (5 x per week) for a maximum session length of 60 minutes for 8 weeks. All sessions are administered by an occupational therapist within the hospital clinic environment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Occupational Therapy rehabilitation program: at the participating hospitals this will include a minimum of 1 x session per day with an occupational therapist focused on improving range of movement, active grasp and release, and reach. Treatment sessions are based on task-specific motor training, and will be approximately 45 minute session length. The program duration is 8 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to develop and test the feasibility of a client­centred intervention for improving dexterity for people with stroke. Upper limb hemiplegia is common after stroke, and such people typically achieve lower levels of functional recovery. Many individuals suffering from hemiplegia after stroke exhibit some shoulder and elbow movement but little or no hand function, preventing them from participating in Constraint­ Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT). Using newer technologies such as a mechanical orthoses offers promise for stroke survivors with hemiplegia. However, no direct evidence exists for optimum wearing regimes, training protocols and timing of therapy.

This study will therefore make a significant contribution to healthcare decision making. Participants in the 'treatment' group will be recruited from the Prince of wales in­patient hospital service and will receive an 8­-week intervention which will include intensive one­-on­-one movement training sessions, behavioural strategies to increase patient motivation, and a task ­specific home exercise program using a hand splint. Participants in the 'control group' will be recruited from the same centre and will receive usual rehabilitation.

Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post­ intervention, and at 3 months following the conclusion of intervention and will include assessment of range of movement, dexterity, functional task performance, and quality of life.</summary>
