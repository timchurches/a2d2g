  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants are given a workplace-based exercise intervention with 4 resistance strengthening exercises targeting the neck and shoulder muscles. Each exercise is performed for a maximum of 2 minutes a day, for 5 working days a week, for 10 weeks.
The participants are supplied with the resistance bands and an exercise diary each to record their daily performance. 30 minutes of initial exercise training instruction is provided to each participant, with 1 weekly supervised exercise session for the first 4 weeks. Participants will receive weekly reminders to encourage adherence to the exercise program.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postural Assessment: The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment tool is used to score the risk for developing neck/shoulder pain while the participant is performing a typical oral examination task.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre and post the 10-week exercise intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of neck/shoulder symptoms with a 11-point visual analogue scale from 0 to 10. A body map is used to define region of neck/shoulder.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre and post the 10-week exercise intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of the 10-week exercise intervention will be examined via a questionnaire scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree'. Questions are designed to elicit participants' perception of the intervention such as 'the exercises were easy to perform', 'it was easy to find time to do the exercises'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the 10-week exercise intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to the exercise program, measured with the number of training session completed as recorded in the exercise diary, expressed as a percentage of the 50 possible sessions during the 10 weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After the 10-week exercise intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale assessed on a 5-point Likert Scale from 'not at all confident' to 'completely confident'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre and post the 10-week exercise intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Isometric muscle strength testing of the neck flexors and extensors, and shoulder elevators (in scaption plane) with a hand-held dynamometer, using a 'make' test procedure.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With the tight work schedules of the dental workers, we propose that small daily doses of neck/shoulder specific exercise is an optimal approach to minimise the risk of neck/shoulder pain for these workers. This project will test the feasibility and benefits of a 10-week workplace-based exercise intervention in a population of dental health students in their clinical environment.</summary>
