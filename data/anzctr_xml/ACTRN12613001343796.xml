    <interventions>Pressure Injury Prevention Care Bundle (PIPCB). Includes the delivery of a one on one education containing 3 key messages: 1) keep moving, 2) good skin care, and 3) good nutrition via a brochure, poster and a 5 min DVD. 
Participants in the intervention group will receive the PIPCB in addition to usual care.  After recruitment by a dedicated recruiting RA, an intervention RA will provide the training in a single session, expected to last approximately 30 minutes.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care: Participants will receive all of the hospital pressure injury prevention strategies such as: pressure injury risk assessment, regular repositioning, good skin care, patient education etc.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of hospital acquired pressure injury (HAPI) in "at risk" hospitalised patients. The RA assessing the outcome will be different to the RA recruiting patient and the RA delivering the intervention in the intervention group.  The outcome assessor will only know that the study is focusing on the development of new PI (i.e. HAPI) in patients who have consented to have their skin assessed daily.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Development of a HAPI; Hospital Discharge (includes rehabilitation unit); or Day 28, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>a) Pressure injury stage i.e depth of tissue damage.  This outcomes will be assessed by a trained outcome assessor (dedicated to this activity only).  The outcome assessor will visually inspect the skin of all participants daily and will refer to their training manual to determine if an area of skin abnormality meets the definition of a Stage of Pressure Injury (stage 1-4).  The outcome assessor will be employed to assess patients in one site only and will be unaware of what the intervention and control arms of this study are.  They will be aware that the study is focusing on measuring the development of a pressure injury on consenting patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Development of a HAPI; Hospital Discharge (includes rehabilitation unit); or Day 28, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient participation in care. A 13-item patient participation in care scale, rigorously developed and tested in 2,025 patients will be used. Item stems will be modified to reflect participation in PIP. Patients will complete this scale on reaching one of the trial endpoints. The outcome assessor RA will administer the scale to participants.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Development of a HAPI; Hospital Discharge (includes rehabilitation unit); or Day 28, whichever comes first.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Demographic and clinical data of our sample will be compared to national data to assess the representativeness of our sample.  Our primary hypothesis will be tested at cluster (i.e. hospital) level. However, further patient level analyses will also be carried out.  Recent advances in statistics such as Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) models, hierarchical or generalized mixed models and multi-level models will allow us to adjust for clustering of patient-level data. Within each approach, we will consider simple analyses such as t-tests, Chi-square tests or more complex approaches such as multivariate logistic regression models. Both allow the effect of the intervention on the incidence of HAPI and other secondary outcomes to be tested; however, only complex analyses allow adjustment for potential covariates, such as baseline performance. As we propose to collect covariate data on the hospital and individual patient level, the adjustment of these factors will be carried out in the appropriate level of analyses using GEE or multi-level models.
Cluster Level Analysis: The traditional approach to the analysis of c-RTs has been to calculate a summary measure for each cluster, such as a cluster mean or proportion. Because each cluster then provides only one data point, the data can be considered to be independent, allowing standard statistical tests to be used.  Estimates of the HAPI incidence in each group, differences along with the 95% CI and p values will be reported.  Other outcomes will also be compared at the cluster levels between the intervention and control group. Baseline variables and other covariates will be compared between the two groups to make sure the intervention and control groups do not differ in their baseline characters. If they do differ, further analyses to provide adjusted estimates will be considered. Such adjustment can be carried out at cluster level using multiple regression models to adjust for cluster level covariates directly, but can incorporate patient level covariates through a two-stage process using GEE or multi-level models.  
Patient Level Analysis: Patient level analyses will primarily account for the intra-cluster correlation, thus increasing the statistical power of the analysis. Patient level data analyses will include simple statistical tests, adjusted to account for the clustering effect.  Z-tests for comparing the proportion between the intervention and control groups or t-tests to compare the means between the groups, can be carried out at patient level using cluster adjusted Z-test or t-test, by dividing the Z or t-test values by the square root of for design effect. This is required to avoid spuriously low P-value and overly narrow CIs, over-emphasizing the impact of the intervention. However, the more comprehensive inferences in our study will be based on the use of new modelling techniques to incorporate patient level data such as mixed linear models, hierarchical linear modelling and GEE. These modelling techniques allow the direct correlation within clusters to be modelled explicitly, and many potential confounding factors would be included in the model when comparing the effect of the intervention. Such models will be developed for primary and secondary outcomes.  The type of the model will depend on the type and nature of the outcome variable.  Our detailed analysis plan will ensure that the modelling is hypothesis-led rather than data-driven. As such, our a priori model-fitting approach will identify the covariates to be considered for inclusion in any modelling approach to analysis and the potential confounding variables that are to be considered for inclusion in the model with the intervention. These modelling techniques adjust well for clustering and allow adjustment for both cluster level and patient level covariates. We will use SAS and STATA for the analyses of our data.  An intention to treat analysis will be primary but we will also undertake a per protocol analysis. 
Cost-effectiveness Analysis: An economic evaluation will be undertaken from the health system perspective to compare the total costs and effects of a PIPCB for the prevention of HAPI, relative to standard care. Detailed resource utilisation and costs assessed in this substudy will be used to undertake a stepped economic evaluation and estimate (i) the comparative per patient HAPI related healthcare prevention costs for each group, and (ii) the comparative incremental cost of preventing an additional case of HAPI. Hierarchical modelling approaches and cluster-adjusted non-parametric bootstrapping techniques will be employed to compare mean difference in the total costs between groups, and to estimate a confidence interval around the mean. In addition, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be undertaken based on the primary outcome measure (incidence of HAPI), to estimate the incremental cost per additional person remaining free from pressure injury. The comparative costs and cost-effectiveness estimates will inform recommendations on the adoption of the PIPCB for the prevention of pressure injury in clinical practice.

The incidence of HAPI in Australian hospitals ranges from 7.4%  17.4%.  The 2012 Qld Health statewide PI audit demonstrated that 15.1% of patients who were unable to reposition independently developed a HAPI.  CIDs Cochrane review on support surfaces showed that pooled data from five studies showed a relative reduction in new PI of 60% (95% CI 0.21  0.74).  In our sample size estimate we have taken a conservative approach of incidence of 10% HAPI (control) with an expected reduction of 50% or an absolute reduction of 5% (from 10% to 5%) in the intervention group and an intra-class correlation (ICC) of 0.001, the actual ICC in another c-RCT of a PIP strategy. We are fortunate to have this previous cRCT to base our ICC estimate, as we originally thought we would need more hospitals.  To obtain 90% power with a two-sided a level of 0.05, 8 hospitals with 169 patients per hospital are required (PASS  Power Analysis and Sample Size system, NCSS, Utah).  Thus, the total sample required will be 1,352.  To allow for attrition, a further 18% (n = 248) will be recruited for a total sample of 1,600 (n = 200/site).
