    <interventions>Intervention  the Stand up for heart health program:
Intervention: In week 2 of the 6 week cardiac rehabiliation (CR) program, participants in the intervention group will attend a one hour individual session in addition to the `standard' CR sessions. The intervention will consist of a one on one face to face session where participants are guided through three activities: 1) review of their assessed sedentary time; 2) normative feedback on sedentary time, using percentiles to compare an average Australian of similar age; and 3) guided goal setting to reduce sedentary time and increase the number of breaks in prolonged sitting time. The guided goal setting will involve a 'small steps' approach, whereby each participant will choose 5 to 6 ways to decrease their sitting time from a list which combines pre-specified behavioural items with suggestions of their own arising from the interview. One goal will be integrated into the participant's habitual behaviour each week for six weeks (e.g. Week 1 goal 'I am going to stand up during the ad breaks on TV, Week 2 goal 'I am going to stand up while I talk on the phone'). Each step is designed to be easily achievable and to reduce sitting time by about 10 to 15 minutes per day. A summary of the specific goal setting plan will be mailed to participants following the face to face session. Participants will be required to self-monitor their goals daily with the completion of a simple checklist (e.g. 'Today, did you achieve your goal of standing up during the TV ad breaks? Yes/No. If not, why not?'). Weekly phone calls will be completed to provide support, and remind participants to build on their previous week's goal. 

The intervention has been informed by constructs from self-determination theory (Ryan and Deci 2000) which argues that enduring behaviour change arises from universal and innate human needs for competence (i.e. mastery of ones activities and environments), autonomy (i.e. choicefully endorsing ones actions), and psychological relatedness (i.e. interacting with and being cared for by others). The program captures each of these needs, for example:
* Competence: the small steps are incremental, modest and easily achievable, which would be expected to support the progressive development of participants perceptions of competence, 
* Autonomy: participants suggest and choose their own weekly small steps, which would align with increased perceptions of autonomy related to behaviour, and
* Relatedness: phone calls with the research team will be completed weekly to promote regular interaction. The phone calls will be provided in a need-supportive way, with participants who do not achieve their goals being supported with a non-judgemental and empathetic approach, rather than focussing on controlling behaviours. This approach would be expected to promote participants feelings of being cared for (relatedness), making it more likely that participants will internalise the views of others (Ryan and Deci 2000).
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will complete usual care (outpatient CR program). In the second week of the CR program, participants in the control group will be provided with a one hour 'heart health' DVD to watch. Weekly phone calls for the duration of the 6 week CR program will also be completed for participants in the control group. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through the CR program at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The CR program at the RAH is led by a CR nurse and a physiotherapist. Potential participants will be approached and provided with information about the study by the CR nurse at the same time they are referred to the outpatient CR program. A flyer with information about the study will be provided to potential participants at this time. Potential participants will be asked to contact the principal investigator or research staff if they are interested in participating in the study. They will then be asked a series of questions to determine their suitability for the study. Potential participants will be asked to contact the principal investigator either by phone or email to register their interest in the study. The principal investigator will then make contact with potential participants via a phone call or email, depending on the contact details provided by the potential participant. Participants will be randomised to the intervention or control group via a computer-generated randomisation procedure using a secure web-based system to ensure allocation concealment. Participants will not be aware of the intervention of interest. 

This study involves a control group who will receive usual care in the form of an outpatient CR program at the RAH. Participants in the intervention group will receive the usual outpatient CR program as well as a goal setting intervention aimed to decrease their sitting time. Participants will not be informed which intervention ('usual CR' or 'usual CR + intervention to decrease sitting time') is the intervention of interest. The study will be known to participants as the 'Stand up for Heart health' study. Both participants in the control and intervention groups will receive weekly supportive phone calls from the research team.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>In a single group pre-post study involving community-dwelling older adults, daily sitting time was reduced by 30.7 (+/- 85.4) minutes per day; representing an effect size of 0.35 (Gardiner et al 2011). In a two groups random effects mixed model, with alpha at 0.05, a total sample of 54 is required to detect an effect size of 0.35. While we are unlikely to demonstrate a similar effect size in an RCT, our target sample size of 60 will be sufficient to detect trends in sedentary time changes.  

Demographic data will be descriptively analysed. Ordinal data from the participants' feedback will be analysed in terms of frequency of responses. Open-ended data (such as comments regarding aspects of the program) will be compiled, and common themes identified. All participants will be analysed in the groups they were initially randomised into (intention to treat analysis). Changes in the overall sedentary time (ActivPAL/GENEActiv) in the intervention group relative to the control group at post-intervention will be compared using random effects mixed modelling.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate sedentary behaviour in people with cardiovascular disease undergoing a cardiac rehabilitation program at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and impact of a goal-setting intervention at decreasing daily sedentary time in people with cardiovascular disease. A secondary aim of this study is to describe the sedentary behaviour (total duration and type of activities) of people with cardiovascular disease before and after undertaking a cardiac rehabilitation program.</summary>
