  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive their home exercise programs via the App associated with www.physiotherapyexercises.com. The specific exercises will be prescribed by their treating physiotherapists prior to randomisation. Patients will be advised to complete their exercises as prescribed for 4 weeks. Patients will be instructed to record their adherence through the App. This information will be relayed back to a trial physiotherapist. The participants will be rung soon after receiving the App to ensure they are able to access it. They will also be rung at 2 weeks. In addition, participants will be rung at 1 and 3 weeks if they have not accessed the App in the preceding 7 consecutive days. The trial physiotherapist will also send patients text or email messages of encouragement and feedback about their progress on a weekly basis unless the participant requests not to receive these.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive their home exercise programs as per current practice (i.e., exercise instructions on a sheet of paper). The specific exercises will be prescribed by their treating physiotherapists prior to randomisation and patients will be advised to complete their exercises as prescribed for 4 weeks. Participants in the control group will not receive any encouragement or feedback about their progress.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-Reported Exercise Adherence. 

Participants will be asked to rate their adherence on a visual analogue scale anchored at one end with 0= Never performed my exercises and at the other end with 10= Always performed my exercises.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after randomisaton</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). 

Patients will be asked to identify up to 3 activities which they find difficult to perform as a result of their condition. Patients will then be asked to rate each of their identified activities on a visual analogue scale anchored at one end with 0= Unable to perform activity and at the other end 10= Able to perform activity at the same level as before the injury or problem.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Global Impression of Change.

Participants will be asked to rate the change in their condition on a visual analogue scale anchored at one end with 0= A great deal worse and the other end 10= A great deal better.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with healthcare service delivery.

Participants will be instructed to rate their satisfaction on a visual analogue scale anchored at one end with "0= Not at all satisfied and "10= Extremely satisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 weeks after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessor-reported exercise adherence.

Blinded assessors will ask a series of questions deemed appropriate in order to formulate an opinion on the participants' adherence over the preceding 4 weeks. They will then score this on a visual analogue scale anchored at one end with "0= Never performed his/her exercises" and at the other end with "10= Always performed his/her exercises."</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be screened by their treating physiotherapist for eligibility, and included in the trial if all criteria are met. The treating physiotherapist will not be aware at the time of inclusion which group the subject will be allocated to. Participantsâ€™ allocations will be placed in opaque, sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes and held offsite by an independent person. Once a participant passes the screening process and completes the initial assessment, the trial co-ordinator will contact this independent person who will open an envelope and reveal the allocation. </concealment>
    <sequence>A secure random-allocation schedule will be computer-generated prior to commencement of the trial by an independent person. The randomisation schedule will be blocked (1:1) ensuring equal numbers of participants are randomised to the intervention and control condition.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 80 gives a better than 80% probability of detecting a between-group difference in exercise adherence of 2/10 points. This calculation is based on best available evidence which suggests that the SD in the control group is likely to be approximately 3 points. This assumes an alpha of 0.05 and a worse-case scenario of lost to follow-up of 10%.

All analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Separate analyses will be conducted on each outcome. Between-group comparisons will be conducted using linear regression with baseline scores included in the model to increase statistical precision and power. If necessary, outcomes will be transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Alternatively, it may be necessary to use a median regression model.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The  primary purpose of our study is to determine whether home exercise programs delivered via an App have greater adherence rates than usual methods of prescription used by physiotherapists. 

We will conduct an assessor- blinded, randomised controlled trial, with a sample size of 80. 

Subjects will be deemed eligible for inclusion if they meet the following criteria:
* have sustained an upper or lower limb fracture, injury or other musculoskeletal condition
* have been prescribed a set of exercises for the next 4 weeks (or longer) by their treating physiotherapist 
* have been advised to complete their exercises at least 3 times per week
* have access to a smart phone, tablet device or computer 
* are over 18 years of age and are able to provide informed consent
* are willing to participate in the trial
* are not expected to require surgery or be readmitted to hospital during the trial

Subjects will be excluded if they:
* are unlikely or unwilling to co-operate (e.g. serious medical condition, cognitive impairment, drug dependency, psychiatric illness, behavioural problems)
* are scheduled to receive face- to- face physiotherapy for their condition or injury within the next 4 weeks 
* have limited English


This trial will be undertaken in patients who have been prescribed a home exercise program by physiotherapists based on  the orthopaedic ward or short stay surgical unit of Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH); or from the outpatient department or hand therapy clinic of Royal North Shore Hospital (RNSH). Participants will be randomised to receive their home exercise program delivered via either the current paper-based method alone, or via our App with supplementary follow-up phone calls. The primary outcome will be self-rated exercise adherence in the first 4 weeks following prescription of exercises by a physiotherapist. The secondary outcomes will include functional status, degree of disability, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, satisfaction with healthcare service delivery and assessor-rated exercise adherence. 

Baseline assessments will be conducted just prior to randomisation by treating physiotherapists. Follow up assessments will be conducted 4 weeks after randomisation by a blinded assessor via telephone interview and online survey. </summary>
