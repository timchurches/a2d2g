  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, cisplatin, gemcitabine, and
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to
      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving rituximab as maintenance therapy
      after stem cell transplantation may kill any remaining cancer cells. It is not yet known
      which salvage chemotherapy regimen is more effective before autologous stem cell
      transplantation in treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying salvage chemotherapy using
      dexamethasone, cisplatin, and gemcitabine to see how well it works compared to dexamethasone,
      cisplatin, and cytarabine given before autologous stem cell transplantation in treating
      patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This trial also is
      studying giving rituximab as maintenance therapy to see how well it works compared to no
      further therapy after stem cell transplantation. Rituximab was added to both salvage
      treatment arms for CD20+ patients in a protocol amendment in 2005.</summary>
