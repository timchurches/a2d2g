  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause. For participants not known to have died as of the cut-off date, OS was censored at the last known date alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to Date of Death from Any Cause Up to 39.36 Months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Time - PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of objectively determined progressive disease (PD) [according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v). 1.1] or death due to any cause, whichever was first. PD is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). Participants who died without a reported prior progression were considered to have progressed on the day of their death. Participants who did not progress or were lost to follow-up were censored at the day of their last radiographic tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to Measured PD or Date of Death from Any Cause Up to 38.01 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving an Objective Response (Objective Response Rate) - The objective response rate is equal to the proportion of participants achieving a best overall response of partial response or complete response (PR + CR). Response was defined using RECIST, v. 1.1 criteria. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm and normalization of tumor marker level of non-target lesions; PR was defined as having at least a 30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until Disease Progression Up to 38.01 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] QLQ-C30 Global Health Status - The EORTC QLQ-C30 (v. 3.0) is a self-administered, cancer-specific questionnaire with multidimensional scales assessing 15 domains (5 functional domains, 9 symptoms, and global health status). A linear transformation was applied to standardize the raw scores to range between 0 and 100 per developer guidelines. For the functional domains and global health status scale, higher scores represent a better level of functioning. For symptom scales, higher scores represent a greater degree of symptoms. Maximum improvement is the best post-baseline change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline Up to 171 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in EuroQol- 5D (EQ-5D) - The EQ-5D is a generic, multidimensional, health status instrument. The profile allows participants to rate their health state in 5 health domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood using a 3-level scale (no problem, some problems, and major problems). These combinations of attributes were converted into a weighted health-state Index Score according to the United Kingdom (UK) population-based algorithm. The possible values for the Index Score ranged from -0.59 (severe problems in all 5 dimensions) to 1.0 (no problem in any dimension). A negative change indicated a worsening of the participant's health status.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 30-Day Follow-Up (FU) up to 171 Weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Anti-Ramucirumab Antibodies - Blood samples were tested to determine if a participant reacted to ramucirumab by producing anti-ramucirumab antibodies. Samples were identified as treatment emergent anti-drug antibody (TE ADA) if the post-treatment sample had an increase of at least 4 fold in titer from pre-treatment values. If the pre-treatment value was not detected or was not present, a 1:20 post-treatment titer was required to indicate treatment emergence. The percentage of participants with TE ADA was calculated as: (the number of participants with TE ADA / total number of participants with at least 1 post-treatment immunogenicity sample analyzed)*100.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 30-Day FU</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Observed Maximum Concentration (Cmax) and Observed Minimum Concentration (Cmin) of Ramucirumab</outcome>
      <timepoint>Preinfusion and 1 hour postinfusion in Cycles 3, 5, 9, 13, and 17</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer, excluding primary tumors
             of appendiceal origin (participants are eligible to enroll irrespective of KRAS
             mutation status)

          -  Confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer (Stage IV)

          -  The participant has received first-line combination therapy of bevacizumab,
             oxaliplatin, and a fluoropyrimidine for metastatic disease and, a) Experienced
             radiographic disease progression during first-line therapy, or b) Experienced
             radiographic disease progression =6 months after the last dose of first-line therapy,
             or c) Discontinued part or all of first-line therapy due to toxicity and experienced
             radiographic disease progression =6 months after the last dose of first-line therapy.
             Note that a participant must have received a minimum of 2 doses of bevacizumab as part
             of a first-line regimen containing chemotherapy; in addition, a participant must have
             received at least 1 cycle of first-line therapy that included bevacizumab, oxaliplatin
             and a fluoropyrimidine in the same cycle. Note that a participant must not have
             received more than 2 different fluoropyrimidines as part of a first-line regimen;
             disease progression is not an acceptable reason for discontinuing 1 fluoropyrimidine

             regimen. Note that rechallenge with oxaliplatin is permitted and will be considered
             part of the first-line regimen for metastatic disease, both initial oxaliplatin
             treatment and subsequent rechallenge are considered as 1 regimen
