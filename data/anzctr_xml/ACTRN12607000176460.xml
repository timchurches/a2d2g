Patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who have received either one anthracycline-taxane combination chemotherapy, or two prior therapies, including an anthracycline-based regimen without a taxane, and a taxane-based regimen. The order in which the regimens were received is unimportant. The treatments may have been administered as adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or for the treatment of advanced or metastatic disease.If the treatment has been administered as adjuvant or neoadjuvant disease (no both), the patient must have progressed during the treatment or within one year of the last dose of the most recent chemotherapy treatment If the treatment has been administered for advanced or metastatic disease, the patient must have progressed during the last treatment or within six months of the last dose of the most recent chemotherapy treatment.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phase 3

This is a trial of the drug E7389 (eribulin) versus oral capecitabine in advanced breast cancer which has been treated with an anthracycline drug and a taxane drug.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are a woman with breast cancer which is locally advanced or has spread to secondary distant sites (metastases), and this has been treated previously with an anthracycline drug and a taxane drug.

Trial details
Capecitabine given orally twice daily for 14 days followed by a week's rest is widely-used treatment for people with breast cancer with progressive disease after anthracycline and taxane treatments.  E7389 (eribulin) is a new drug derived from a marine sponge which stops cancer cells growing in the laboratory and has slowed cancer growth in some cancer people.

Participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group receives oral capecitabine (standard treatment). The other receives E7389 (eribulin) given intravenously on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days.  The study aims to look at the effectiveness of the new treatment compared with capecitabine, and measures patient survival, whether the tumour responds and for how long.</summary>
