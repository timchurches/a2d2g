    <exclusivecriteria>-  Women who are pregnant or lactating

             immunosuppression due to medication or medical condition

          -  Clinical and/or MRI evidence of a named cranial or cervical nerve involvement by
             tumour

          -  Inability to localise surgical bed on CT scans and/or surgical margins (cm) not known

          -  Previous radical radiation therapy to the head and neck, excluding superficial
             radiation therapy to cutaneous SCC or basal cell carcinoma, which is not within or
             overlapping the tumour bed

          -  High risk for poor compliance with therapy or follow-up as assessed by investigator

          -  Patients with prior cancers, except: those diagnosed = 5 years ago with no evidence of
             disease relapse and clinical expectation of relapse of less than 5%; prior
             successfully treated Level 1 cutaneous melanomas = 2 years ago; or non-melanoma skin
             cancer; or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  Albinism

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a 2-armed randomised controlled trial comparing surgery alone with surgery plus
      post-operative radiation therapy for patients with completely resected primary melanoma
      showing histological features of neurotropism. Uncontrolled studies suggest that this form of
      primary melanoma has a high risk of local recurrence and that postoperative radiation therapy
      may substantially reduce that risk. Patients who are eligible on the basis of the pathology
      of the excised melanoma will be offered the opportunity to take part in the trial. Those
      randomised to receive radiation therapy will be treated with a simple technique encompassing
      the surgical bed plus a margin. Radiation will commence within 3 months of surgery (maximum
      of 14 weeks from surgery to start of radiotherapy).</summary>
