  <interventions>
    <interventions>At the first consultation, all participants will complete a perception of milk supply questionnaire. Those with perceived insufficient milk supply will receive individual targeted care provided by the lactation consultants. The advice given will include one or more of: correcting positioning and attachment, changing feeding frequency, commencing or increasing breast expression, taking domperidone, or investigation of the need of the infant for frenotomy. The time allocated for the first consultation is 2 hours. At the first consultation participants will be asked if they are willing to measure their 24-h milk profile. Those who agree will be randomised into either Group A or Group B (control). The randomisation codes will be in sealed, opaque envelopes that are opened in consecutive order only when the client has agreed to participate. Participants in Group A will measure their milk profile during one 24-hour period immediately after their first visit with the lactation consultant, and then again after 2-4 weeks of following the advice of the lactation consultant. They will then complete a second perception of milk supply questionnaire.  All participants will attend the second (follow-up) consultation and questioned regarding compliance with advice given. For the 24-h milk profile, participants are loaned a set of BabyWeigh scales to  weigh the baby in normal clothes before and after each breastfeed or supplementary feed. This is done in the participant's own home for 24 hours. The weights are entered on a secure website. Participants will also be asked to measure and enter the amount of any breastmilk expressed during that time</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in Group B (control) will receive individual targeted care provided by the lactation consultants, identical to the intervention group. After following the advice of the lactation consultant for 2-4 weeks they will complete a second perception of milk supply questionnaire. They will then measure their milk profile (milk production) during one 24-hour period. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The questionnaire, called "Milk supply questionnaire" was designed specifically for this study. It takes the form of statements for which the participant can choose between: strongly agree, agree, unsure, disagree and strongly disagree. The statements are: 1) I think I produce enough milk for my baby, 2) my baby is: a) growing well, b) has enough wet nappies, c) has enough soiled nappies, d) is normally alert, e) is well attached during breastfeeding, f) sucks well during breastfeeding, g) appears satisfied after breastfeeds, h) feeds too often, g) feeds too quickly, h) needs supplementary infant formula; 3) my breasts: a) feel full before feeds, b) feel soft after feeds, c) feel empty in the afternoon or evening. The outcome measure will be changes in frequencies of Likert scale responses to these statements that may contribute to the perception of insufficient milk supply.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The questionnaire will be administered before the initial consultation (baseline) and again 2-4 weeks after following the advice of the lactation consultant</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome will be a change in milk production. This is measured by the mothers using BabyWeigh scales to weigh their babies at home in normal clothes before and after each breastfeed or supplementary feed, and measure the amount of any breastmilk expressed for a period of 24 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Group A. Milk production will be measured immediately following consultation with the lactation consultant and again 2-4 weeks after following the advice of the lactation consultant (prior to the second perception questionnaire. Group B. Milk production will be measured 2-4 weeks after following the advice of the lactation consultant  (following the second perception questionnaire).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Mothers of infants less than 6 months old who are exclusively, fully or partially breastfeeding and perceive that they have an insufficient milk supply will be included. This will be determined by their response to the first question of the "Milk supply questionnaire" "I think I produce enough milk for my baby". If the response is "disagree" or "strongly disagree" they will be considered to have a perception of insufficient milk supply.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome measures for the two groups will be changes in frequencies of Likert scale responses to the 16 factors that may contribute to this perception. Changes in perceptions from before to 2-4 weeks after receiving targeted care will be tested using Fishers exact test. We have previously observed a positive change for 40% of participants in perception between assessments. We will be able to detect a significant difference if we recruit 30 participants in each group and there is a change in perception for 30% of the participants.
The significance of any change in total milk production from immediately receiving targeted advice and 2-4 weeks after following that advice will be assessed using paired t-test. In order to be able to detect a physiologically significant difference of 100 mL between the first and second measurements with 80% (Type I error rate a=0.05) data from 30 participants who have completed both measurements will need to be analysed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to determine if professional advice for perceived insufficient milk supply results in a change in perception of milk supply, and whether objective measurement of milk supply before and after receiving professional advice shows a measurable difference in breastmilk production and affects the change in perception.
When participants have a perception of insufficient breastmilk supply, we predict that there will be a significant change in the participants perceptions from before to after receiving advice from a lactation consultant, and there will be a measurable difference in milk production. We would like to know if objective measurement of milk production before and after following advice affects the change in perception.
