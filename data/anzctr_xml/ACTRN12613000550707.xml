  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sixteen bi-weekly workshops of half an hour each, across an eight week period. Fifty percent of the presented material is from Positive Psychology and the other fifty percent from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. The workshops are presented face-to-face with a facilitor. Presented material will be supported by group discussions, videos and internet-based exercises. Workshops will take place during students health classes. Classroom teachers will be present but will not aid in program delivery. 

Material presented from Positive Psychology will be based on developing Hope, Mindfulness, and Meaning. The Acceptance and Commitment Training material will include Values, Accepting Negative Emotions and Thoughts, and Committed Action.

Students will complete questionnaires regarding their wellbeing and mental health before the workshops, at the end of the workshops, and 6-months and at 12-months follow-ups. As part of the follow-up assessments, students will be asked to report on the extent that they have utilised the strategies presented during the workshops.</interventions>
    <comparator>Eight weeks of Personal Development, Health, and Personal Education (PDHPE) classes as usual. There are two classes per week, each of a half hour duration. 

The PDHPE classes are led by school teachers and teach students skills in communication, decision-making, interacting, moving, planning, and problem-solving, in relation to their own self, their relationships, physical activity, and their health. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the efficacy of a school-based resilience program for adolescents. The program is based on Positive Psychology and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and runs for 1 hour per week for eight weeks. It is hypothesised that the program will prevent future cases of mental health problems, reduce psychopathology that exists at the time of the program, and increase subjective wellbeing. </summary>
