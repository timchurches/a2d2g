  <interventions>
    <interventions>Immediate Exercise Group:
The physical exercise intervention program will include 12 weeks of resistance (i.e. lifting weights) and aerobic exercise (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) undertaken 3 times per week in an exercise clinic. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be conducted in small groups under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist. Participants will also receive 3 one-on-one 45 minute consultations with a dietician during weeks 1, 2 and 3 of the intervention. These consultations will involve advice about nutritional intake for healthy fat loss, maximising gains in muscle as well as reducing whole body inflammatory state. Attendance rates and exercise training logs will be used to monitor adherence with the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Delayed Exercise Group: Participants will maintain their normal lifestyle for 12 weeks and then will receive the exercise intervention and consultations with a dietician for the following 12 weeks (i.e. 12-24 weeks).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psoriasis is a chronic and lifelong autoimmune disease which affects the skin and for one in four sufferers also results in arthritis. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is believed to play a role in psoriasis by acting as a regulator of inflammation. Exercise, fat loss and muscle gain have been proven to reduce chronic inflammatory state in the body as well as lower TNF levels. Exercise and dietary modification may enhance the effectiveness of pharmaceutical therapies such as Humira, a TNF blocker which has been very effective for the management of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases. Our main aim is to find out if an exercise and nutritional support program can reduce body fat, improve physical fitness and function, lower inflammatory status, and improve the cardiometabolic risk profile of patients receiving Humira for psoriasis.</summary>
