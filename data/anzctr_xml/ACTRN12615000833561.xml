  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers comparing two formulations of desvenlafaxine with no health condition or problem studied. 

Although this study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the condition to which the medicine is used, desvenlafaxine belongs to a class of medicines called Serotonin-Nonadrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors and is an antidepressant prescribed for the treatment and prevention of relapse of depression.</healthcondition>

      <conditioncode2>Research that is not of generic health relevance and not applicable to specific health categories listed above</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover over study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of desvenlafaxine (1 x 100 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of desvenlafaxine (1 x 100 mg) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of desvenlafaxine.

Each dose (1 x 100 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose. Subjects will be provided with a standardised high fat breakfast which they must start eating 30 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance can be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the healthy of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax). Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points. All plasma samples will be assayed for desvenlafaxine using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method.</outcome>
