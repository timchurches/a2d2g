  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomized to receive a daily, oral supplement containing either 140mcg or 400mcg of folic acid for 10 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the blood folate status of participants following a daily folic acid supplement of 140mcg or 400mcg for 10 months, to produce a dose-response model.  Blood and plasma folate will be measured at weeks 0, 4, 26 and 43.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected at the start of treatment and then subsequently at weeks 4, 26 and 43.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in the forms of folate (including unmetabolized folate) found in whole blood and plasma will be compared between the supplement groups from baseline (at the start of treatment) and at week 43.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected at the start of treatment and week 43</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is being undertaken to determine the effect of folic acid bread fortification on blood folate concentrations in New Zealand women of childbearing age.  We will be measuring the response of blood folate to a daily folate vitamin supplement of either 140mcg, 400mcg, and comparing these results to a placebo group.</summary>
