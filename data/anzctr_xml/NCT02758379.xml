    <summary>The objective of this clinical trial is to study the early safety and feasibility of the
      Shockwave Coronary Lithoplasty System. To demonstrate that the Shockwave device can safely
      and effectively deliver localized shockwave energy for balloon dilatation of calcified,
      stenotic, de novo coronary lesions.</summary>
