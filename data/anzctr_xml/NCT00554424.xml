  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see whether injecting local anaesthetic into the vaginal
      tissues,just prior to transvaginal egg collection,will decrease the amount of pain
      experienced by women having their eggs collected on an IVF cycle. All women will also receive
      intravenous sedation as required as well as a sleeping tablet thirty minutes prior to the
      procedure which is our routine procedure for egg collection.</summary>
