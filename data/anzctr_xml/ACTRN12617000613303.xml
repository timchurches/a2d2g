  <interventions>
    <interventions>This was a case study design of five recreational multisport athletes (four females, one male), with no control control. Athletes were regularly involved in high-level competitive multisport for at least five years undertook a non-calorie-controlled ketogenic diet (&lt;50g carbohydrate; 1.5g protein / kg body weight; remaining calories from fat) for 10 weeks. All participants were non-smokers, healthy and injury-free as per a health screening questionnaire and not consuming a low carbohydrate diet (defined as carbohydrates less than 45% of total energy intake). 

Prior to the start of the intervention, participants underwent a series of tests and a full consultation for dietary instruction and planning as follows:

Performance tests: Participants reported to the lab in the morning in a fasted state and underwent a performance test on three occasions: i. one week prior to the intervention (familiarisation), ii. immediately prior to the intervention (baseline), and iii. immediately post the intervention (post). The performance test was an incremental cycle test using an electromagnetically controlled cycle ergometer to determine VO2peak and gas exchange thresholds (GET)  in a temperature-controlled laboratory (21 degrees Celcius, 65 % rH). The test commenced at 30 W and increased by 30 W every 3 minutes until volitional exhaustion. The tests were administered be an experienced exercise physiologist.

Body composition measures:
Body weight and skinfolds were measured by an ISAK level one accredited anthropometrist, prior to and at the conclusion of the intervention, at the same time of the day. A sum of 8-site skinfold ISAK protocol was applied: triceps, biceps, subscapular, iliac crest, supraspinale, abdominal, front thigh and medial calf.

Diet:
An initial consultation was conducted with each participant by the primary researcher/Registered Dietitian directly after the performance test. Participants were provided with a daily macronutrient prescription of &lt;50g total carbohydrate, 1.5 g.kg protein and ad libitum fat. A detailed explanation of the practical application of the ketogenic dietary principles along with appropriate tracking and monitoring procedures was provided. Participants were provided with a sample diet and were advised to add variations provided they adhered to the carbohydrate and protein macronutrient thresholds provided. The were instructed to track their diet using a dietary analysis programme Easy Diet Diary (Xyris Software (Australia) Pty Ltd). Diets were monitored weekly by the primary researcher, and participants were contacted and offered additional support if they deviated. The primary researcher maintained regular contact with all participants throughout the 10-week study duration. 

Interviews and focus group. A 20-30 minute individual interview was conducted on the phone at 5 weeks and a 60-minute focus group was conducted in person once the intervention had concluded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The efficacy of ketogenic diets on enhanced performance in endurance athletes is equivocal. The purpose of this work was to assess the effects of a 10-week ketogenic diet intervention on the sport performance, body composition and perceived wellbeing of five well-trained multisport athletes. </summary>

    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>This was a retrospective ethics application. The reason this was is to obtain approval for some work we conducted in our sports science laboratory at AUT-Millenium in 2014, which we decided to write up and submit to a journal for peer-review publication. This work was undertaken with five of our existing colleagues, who are multisport athletes, At the time that this work was conducted, it was not envisaged as a research project that required ethics as we were not intended on publishing the work, and it was a normal part of what we did in our lab. Despite this fact, it was conducted under research-rigorous conditions, as our work of this nature usually is, even under usual clinic protocols. We decided retrospectively that the work is worthy of publication and therefore we applied for ethics, and it was approved. </publicnotes>
