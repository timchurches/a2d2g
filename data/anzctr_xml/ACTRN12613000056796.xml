  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study - video recordings of routine general practice consultations.

GPs will be recruited into the study. 1-4 sessions with the GP will be videorecorded. Patients presenting during that session will be invited to participate.

Basic data from each video will be collected to provide a snapshot of general practice consultations e.g. number of presenting problems, consultation length etc. 

Consultations involving the diagnosis, measurement, management or discussion of blood pressure, cardiovascular risk or lifestyle risk factors will be analysed in more depth using video-tagging software. Data collected will include: frequency, content and quality of BP management consultations.

For these consultations a video-elicited semi-structured interview will be conducted with the GP. Information collected here will include: relevant background context, previous treatments, reasons for cessation/change, etc.

For the cases selected above, a review of the patient file will be conducted looking for details relevant to the consultation e.g. specialist referral and blood test results to help provide context to what is otherwise only a snapshot of management seen in one consultation.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Key inclusion criteria into the study (Want to capture routine general practice so GP and patient will be unaware of the condition under review).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to explore and describe the clinical decision making of Australian general practitioners involved in the management of blood pressure: how is BP being measured? How is BP being recorded? How is BP being interpreted by the GP and patient? How is BP being managed  lifestyle interventions, medication, as an isolated risk factor or in the context of absolute cardiovascular risk?

We also want to explore the barriers and facilitators to the management of blood pressure in Australian general practice: What factors influence the clinical decision-making of the GP?</summary>
