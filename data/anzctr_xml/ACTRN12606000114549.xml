  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recruited women will be randomized in one of the two groups (Control group or Intervention group) and participate in the study from the day of booking on untill oocyte pick up procedure (6 - 8 weeks). 

    
       Intervention group will receive information on dietary and exercice regimes. 

1.Dietary regime (5500Kj or 1300calories):
one meal replacement with very low calorie diet (VLCD) and two meals from CSIRO brochure per day.
2. Exercise programme is a home-based progressive physical conditionning (using ruber tubing for resistance) and walking programme.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will receive standard information on factors influencing fertility and advice on a healthy lifestile by dietion at CSIRO.</comparator>
