    <designfeatures>This is an open-label study of BIT225 in patients with HCV and HIV-1 co-infection that are HCV treatment-naive and currently receiving HIV treatment. Participants must be on a stable regimen of ART for the last 6 months and throughout the study.  One dose level of BIT225 (300 mg BID) will be studied in 4 patients with HCV genotype 1 and 8 patients with HCV genotypes 2 or 3, resulting in 12 patients enrolled in total.  Patients will initiate standard of care (SOC) treatment with IFN and RBV on Day 0.  On Day 7, BIT225 treatment will be added for 28 days (300 mg once daily on Day 7 and Day 35 and twice daily on Days 8  34).  Patients will remain on ART and will continue IFN and RBV for up to 48 weeks.
If HCV RNA from baseline to 12 weeks decreases less than 2 logs, subjects will discontinue IFN and RBV treatment.  In addition, subjects will discontinue IFN and RBV treatment at 25 weeks if there is detectable HCV RNA at repeat measurements at Weeks 24 and 25.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the safety of BIT225 in combination with the standard of care therapy of IFNand RBV in patients with HCV, co-infected with HIV-1 who have not received any prior IFN or RBV therapy.  The patients will be currently receiving therapy for HIV-1, and will be virologically suppressed.   The study will also assess how well the BIT225 is tolerated in this patient group, the level of BIT225 in the blood following oral administration and how well BIT225 performs at reducing HCV levels in the blood. Patients with HCV, HIV-1 co-infection tend to have a lower response to IFN and RBV, and it is hoped that the addition of BIT225 will improve the response to treatment.</summary>
