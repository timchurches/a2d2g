  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, controlled, cross-over trial will be conducted to investigate the effects of different types of vegetables on blood pressure and arterial stiffness.

Each participant will complete three intervention diets of 4 weeks each in random sequence. The first intervention diet will be preceded by a 4 week lead in (washout) period. The first, second and third intervention diets will be separated by a 4 week wash out period. 

The intervention diets are:
1. High nitrate diet (~400 mg per day)  with an increase in high-nitrate vegetables (lettuce  all types, spinach, rocket, Chinese leafy greens, other leafy greens, celery, and beetroot). This will involve the consumption of two blended high-nitrate vegetable juices each day: one before breakfast and one before dinner.
2. Low nitrate diet (~100-150 mg per day)  with an increase in low-nitrate vegetables (cauliflower, capsicum, sweet potato, cucumber, tomato, and parsnip). This will involve the consumption of two blended low-nitrate vegetable juices each day: one before breakfast and one before dinner.
3. Low nitrate diet (control diet, ~100 mg per day)  without an increase in vegetables. This will involve the consumption of two blended juice drinks without vegetables each day, matched in energy to juices in diets 1 and 2: one before breakfast and one before dinner.

Participants will be provided with personal blenders and advised on which vegetables/ingredients to buy and blend themselves (all meals will be maintained as usual with the exception of limiting nitrate-rich vegetables where possible). Adherence to the intervention diets will be monitored using juice checklist diaries; food intake questionnaires; and blood, urine and saliva samples.

Participants will attend 9 visits over a period of 6-8 months at the School of Medicine and Pharmacology Research Unit at Royal Perth Hospital.

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of 6 sequence orders using computer generated random numbers. 50 sealed opaque envelopes, numbered 1-50, each containing one of the 6 sequence orders for intervention diets will be used for randomisation by opening an envelope, in consecutive order, as participants are entered into the study. The computer generated random numbers and sealed opaque envelopes will be completed and held by a person independent of study researchers within the University of Western Australia. The study coordinator will contact the person independent of study researchers to obtain the next available envelope once an individual is deemed eligible. The envelope will be opened and the code will be recorded</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses will be performed according to a pre-specified statistical analysis plan using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 (2012, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.); SAS software (Version 9.3: SAS Institute Inc); or STATA 12 (StataCorp). The primary analysis will be modified intention to treat (all randomised participants for which we have collected baseline data). Analysis will be performed using mixed models (including all available data). The level of significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05 for a two-tailed test.
A sample size of 25 participants has been calculated on the primary outcome of blood pressure assessed as 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure. 25 participants will provide &gt;80% power to detect a 2.0 mm Hg difference in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure assuming a within-group SD of 15 mm Hg, and a minimum of 50 blood pressure measurements over 24 hours per subject. This calculation is based on a between group comparison of means using a type I error rate of 0.05/3 (0.017). 
In addition, we will have &gt;80% power to detect a 2.0 mm Hg difference in mean home systolic blood pressure assuming a within-group SD of 15 mm Hg based on our previous studies, and a minimum of 50 blood pressure measurements per subject at each time point (baseline and post).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for mortality. Diet and lifestyle change, which can reduce the need for costly blood pressure medication, can have the largest potential impact on high blood pressure in the community. Large randomised controlled trials demonstrate that consumption of diets rich in plant foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains) lower blood pressure. We propose that the amount and type of vegetables consumed is important for blood pressure, and that focused advice to consume nitrate-rich vegetables will result in lower blood pressure. Acute and very short-term studies clearly demonstrate that an increase in nitrate intake can significantly reduce blood pressure. The objective of this study is to establish if these effects on blood pressure are sustained over a 4 week period. In a separate investigation we also wish to determine if daily consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables can lower the cardiovascular response to stress. Secondary objectives of this study are to explore the role of nitrate-rich vegetables in improving blood vessel stiffness and cognitive function and mood.</summary>
