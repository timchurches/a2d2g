  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as the time in months from randomization date to date of death due to any cause in all randomized subjects. For participants alive at the time of the database cutoff date, OS was censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization to date of death</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival Rate - The overall survival (OS) rate is a percentage, representing the fraction of all randomized participants who were alive following treatment, from 1 to 5 years. OS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death as a result of any cause. Survival rates were determined via Kaplan-Meier estimates.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization to date of death</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - All PFS events were based on investigator's assessment. Participants who were alive and did not experience a PFS event were censored at the earlier of the latest prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or radiological tumor assessment date. Participants who did not die, showed no clinical deterioration, and who had no recorded post-baseline PSA or radiological tumor assessment were censored at randomization date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Date of randomization to earliest date of confirmed PSA or radiological progression, clinical deterioration or death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain Response - The percentage of participants with a pain response assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) completed by participants throughout the study in a daily diary log. Pain-evaluable participants were defined as those with a decrease in the average daily worst pain intensity by at least 30% from baseline, maintained over 2 consecutive evaluations without the use of any rescue analgesic medication or increase in analgesic use in the same time period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at screening, weeks 12, 18, 24, and at the end of treatment visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Pain Response - The time between the initial date of pain response and completion date of pain response. The initial date when the pain response criterion was achieved was considered the pain response date. The earlier of date of death, date of tumor resection surgery, or date when pain response criterion was no longer met was considered the completion date of the pain response. If none of these scenarios occurred, the completion of the pain response was set to the last known alive date.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day of initial pain response to day of completion of pain response or date of death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Severe Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Treatment-Related AEs, Deaths, Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to AEs, Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAE) and Immune-Mediated Adverse Reaction (imAR) - AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment.
SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible or missing relationship to study drug. Death=during study and up to 70 days after last dose. IrAEs=AEs potentially associated with inflammation and considered to be causally related to study drug and grouped into gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic, skin, endocrine and neurological. ImARs were collected prospectively and grouped into enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies and endocrinopathies. IrAEs/ imARs were graded using Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Ver. 3.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to date of death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Onset of Grade 3 or 4 Immune-Related Adverse Event (irAE) - The time between first dose of study drug and date of earliest Grade 3 or 4 irAE. These irAEs are AEs of unknown etiology, consistent with an immune phenomenon and considered as causally related to drug exposure. The five subcategories of irAE examined include gastrointestinal (GI), liver, skin, endocrine, and neurological and are graded using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 3.0.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to 70 days after last dose of study drug</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Resolution of Grade 3 or 4 Immune-Related Adverse Event (irAE) - Time between the date of onset of a Grade 3 or 4 irAE and the date of improvement to Grade 1 or less or the worst grade at baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to 70 days after last dose of study drug</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Onset of Grade 3 to 5 Immune-Mediated Adverse Reaction (imAR) - The time between first dose of study drug and date of earliest Grade 3 or 4 imAR. ImARs were collected prospectively and grouped into enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies and endocrinopathies and graded using Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Ver. 3.0.
Only the Ipilimumab + Radiotherapy group of participants was included in the analysis because ipilimumab is associated with inflammatory events resulting from increased or excessive immune activity likely to be related to its mechanism of action.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to time of onset of the imAR of interest</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Resolution of Grade 3 to 5 to Grade 0 Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions (imARs) to Grade 0 - Time between the date of onset of an imAR to the date of resolution date of the event or the last known date participant was alive if an event did not resolve.
Only the Ipilimumab + Radiotherapy group of participants was included in the analysis because ipilimumab is associated with inflammatory events resulting from increased or excessive immune activity likely to be related to its mechanism of action.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 to 70 days after last dose of study drug</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
