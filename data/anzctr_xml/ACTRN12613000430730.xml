    <interventions>Spinal Manipulation (Pull-Move Technique) in the Treatment Group 

The Spinal Manipulation technique (pull-move) will be performed according to previous literature. 
The subject positions himself in a lateral decubitus position of the opposite side to the posteriority. The uppermost lower limb is flexed until mechanical impact and tension is caused in the fifth lumbar vertebra. The therapist stands facing the patient. The front leg is supported against the edge of the bed and the back leg is flexed with the tibia placed in the popliteal fossa. With the upper hand, the therapist controlls the subject's trunk. The forearm of the caudal hand makes contact with the sacroiliac joint, placing the index finger in the L5 spinous process. Three stages will follow from here:  (a) placing the levers. After contacting with L5 from increased flexion of the hip, the therapist keeps the spine in a neutral position. Then, the therapist extends the patient's upper limb against the bed to carry out the rotation of the spine to L5 level; (b) reducing the slack. The therapistÂ´s caudal hand directs L5 towards the ceiling, making contact with its spinous process and (c) thrust. The caudal hand pushes the pelvis in the ventral direction and directs the spinous process to revert the L5. The cephalic hand counter thrusted. The thrust should be short range and very fast.
The protocol will last for two minutes approximately. 
Participants in this group will only receive a single spinal manipulation
</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control group the intervention manoeuver consists in maintaining the same therapist-patient position as previously described for the treatment group. However, after entering the parameters, no tension will be added as no levers, slack reduction nor articular thrust will be performed. The position will be maintained during the same length of time as estimated for the pull-move technique.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement of Self-Perceived low back pain in at least 20%

Low back pain is measured with a visual analogue scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a horizontal 100 mm line where the subject marks their perceived pain severity. The range is from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (severe pain).The VAS is an effective, sensitive and appropriate tool to measure acute and chronic pain</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement of Neural Tension by means of passive straight leg raise test in at least 15%

Nerve root tension will be observed by means of the passive straight leg raise (SLR) test.  The initial appearance of pain or discomfort will be the test end point. In this position a goniometer (model Carci) will be used to measure the range of coxofemoral flexion. The fixed arm will be placed on the mid axillary trunk line, while the mobile arm will be placed on the lateral surface of the hip resting on the greater trochanter and aligned with the shaft of the femur. The lower limb that presents radiating pain will be chosen to be assessed. The SLR test is considered an easy tool to use, with hip flexion reliability (ICC) of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.69 - 0.95).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>INCREASE OF SUBJECT'S HEIGHT IN AT LEAST 20%

Subject's height is measured by means of a stadiometer. The stadiometer is a device which measures height variations and the amount of Intervertebral disc compression, susceptible to reflect the spinal load. The first step of the protocol is to familiarise and train the individuals in the procedure so as to minimise measurement errors. The participants are considered sufficiently trained when after five consecutive evaluations, the measurements showed a standard deviation of less than 0.5 mm. The person's height is measured after a short time (90 seconds) standing upright. This waiting time is established to allow any deformed body structures to reach their equilibrium. To prevent postural adjustments while measuring, fixing metal bars are placed on different anatomical points; occipital protuberance, cervical level, lower limit of the shoulder blades, and the second sacral vertebrae. To stop head movement and keep it aligned, the subject wears safety glasses with a leveling system. Finally, after adjusting the position, the measuring stick of the digital transducer is positioned on the center of gravity above the subject's head. The subject remains on the stadiometer at all times during successive measurements, instead of using the in-out method. The stadiometer is a noninvasive method that has proved validity.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>INCREASE OF SPINAL MOBILITY IN FLEXION IN AT LEAST 10%
Subjects will be assessed using the finger to floor distance (FFD) test. The FFD test evaluates the maximum spinal mobility in flexion and it is a possible indicator of functional limitation. The test will be conducted according to the methodology already established in the literature. The subject stands barefoot, with legs slightly apart, knees straight and back straight. From this position the subject is asked to bend forward as far as possible without feeling pain or discomfort. The distance between the third fingertip and the floor is measured with a tape measure. The subjects maintain this maximum flexion position for two seconds before measurements are taken. This test is considered as easy to conduct and with a high degree of interexaminer reliability (r 0.96 to 0.98)</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The descriptive and inferential analysis of the results will be performed using the BioEstat 5 free software programme. The mean, standard deviation and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) will be calculated for the different variables. The significance level will considered for a value of p&lt;.05.
	The D'Agostino test will verify the normality of the study variables. The comparison between groups will use the student t statistic for the initial values of the quantitative variables, and the Chi-square (X2) for the categorical variables. In the intra-group comparison, the Student t-test will be used to analyse the parametric dependent variables while the Mann-Whitney U test will be used for the nonparametric variable. 
The analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA test) with the group (control or experimental) will allow the intergroup differences to be observed. In the same way, the correlation test (Pearson or Spearman) will be used to verify the association between extraneous variables and the dependent variables.

The sample size has been calculated using the Granmo version 7.12 software (IMIM Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain). For a two-sided contrast and accepting an alpha value of .05 and a beta risk of .01, eighteen subjects are required per study group to detect a difference that is equal to or greater than 17.5% in the mean intergroup value of the stadiometry, based on the observations made previously. 15% standard deviation is assumed together with an estimated 10% loss to follow-up rate.
