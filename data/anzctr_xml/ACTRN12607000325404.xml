  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients commence imatinib at 600 mg/day. Dose is escalated to 800 mg/day if the trough imatinib plasma level is less than 1000 ng/ml on day 22. Dose is increased to 800 mg/day if the Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR) values of BCR-ABL are &gt;10% at 3 months, &gt;1% at 6 months or &gt;0.1% at 12 months. Dose is switched to nilotinib 400 mg/day if a patient is unable to dose escalate to 800 mg after 1 month of trying or if the BCR-ABL value is &gt;10% at 6 months, &gt;1% at 9 months or &gt;0.1% at 15 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial tests the hypothesis that molecular response can be maximised by a combined approach of higher dose imatinib for all de-novo CML patients plus a rapid switch to nilotinib in patients who are intolerant or have suboptimal response to imatinib.</summary>
