Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 


Treatment: drugs: TRx0237 200 mg/day
TRx0237 100 mg tablets will be administered twice daily.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo tablets will be administered twice daily. The active placebo tablets include 4 mg of TRx0237 as a urinary and fecal colorant to maintain blinding; hence the placebo group will receive a total of 8 mg/day of TRx0237.
