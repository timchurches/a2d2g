SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; was life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required or prolonged hospitalization. Treatment-related AE was defined as an AE that had certain, probable, possible, or unknown relationship to study drug. Mild (Grade 1): awareness of event but easily tolerated; Moderate (Grade 2): discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual activity; Severe (Grade 3): inability to carry out usual activity; Very severe (Grade 4): debilitating, significantly incapacitates participant despite symptomatic therapy. Only Grade 2-4 treatment-related AEs were reported.</outcome>
