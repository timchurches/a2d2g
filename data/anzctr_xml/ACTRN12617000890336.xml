    <interventions>The educator will be the diabetic nurse.
Intervention module - Diabetes Literacy and Numeracy Education Toolkit (DLNET) adopted and adapted from Vanderbilt University
This module specifically design for diabetes patients with moderate and low health literacy. DLNET used here will be modified to suit the culture, diet and anti diabetic treatment used in Malaysia.
Teaching of this module will be face to face verbally in small groups (6-8 respondents) at a private room in a primary care clinic. Teaching language will be in Bahasa Malaysia. This clinic is run by 2 family medicine physician. The respondents are selected from their diabetic patients list. Each teaching session is 2 hours per session alternate 2 weeks in 2 months (2 session per month in 2 months). The module booklet will be printed in Bahasa Malaysia. It will also available in PDF form. For this research I will be teaching the module with the help of diabetic educator. No treatment will given to the respondents except they will continue with their own medication. The sessions comprise of verbal education explaining self-care entities which are diet, exercise, blood sugar testing and control, medical treatment and foot care.
Teaching technique is based on self-efficacy theory. It will be in two way communication between the educator and respondents.
Other than that whats app  group will be created for the intervention group.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue their  diabetic education receive from diabetic educator at Army Hospital. The module used is based from Ministry of Health Malaysia. The session will consist of diet, medication and exercise. It will be delivered verbally in Bahasa Malaysia. No booklet will be given and no whats app group will be created.
The teaching session will be held at Medical Clinic in Army Hospital. It will be 2 hours session, 2 weekly in 2 months.
The respondents are selected from their diabetic patients list from the medical clinic.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size estimation is based on formula of hypothesis testing for two population mean in Adequacy of Sample Size Determination in Health Studies by Lemeshow, Hosmer and Lwanga (1990). Two population mean formula is used due to it being analytical in nature and comparing two groups for hypothesis testing. This is based on patients HbA1c level difference pre and post intervention between control and intervention group with response rate of 90%.

 
Where 
N = Sample size estimate
Z1-a/2 = standard error associated with 95% confidence interval = 1.645
Z1-beta = standard error associated with 80% power = 0.842
mu1 = mean of HbA1c post 6 months in intervention group = 9.26% (Butt et al., 2015)
mu2 = mean of HbA1c post 6 months in control group = 8.47% (Butt et al., 2015)
s = estimated standard deviation = 1.5
n = 46.9 ~ 47
N = n x 2 = 94
Adjustment for two groups:
Estimated response rate = 94 / 0.9 = 104
Estimated eligibility = 118.9 / 0.9 = 115
N = 115 participants (for 2 groups) ~ 116
Participants in control group = 58
Participants in intervention group = 58

Statistical analysis:
Statistical analyses will be perform using SPSS from IBM company for Windows version 23. The purpose of these analyses is to answer all the research questions ( Health Literacy Status, HbA1c level, impact of DLNET on reducing HbA1c, self-efficacy score, self-care score, predictors of HbA1c and Cost-effectiveness Analysis).The level of significance for all statistical tests will be set at alpha less than 0.05. Odd numbers will be allocated for the intervention group, so they represent the responses and scores of participants in intervention group, whereas even numbers will be allocated for control group, as they represent the responses and scores of participants in control group. 
	
The researcher will verified the accuracy of data entry with the help of a professional statistician. Both descriptive as well as inferential analyses will be analysed. Outcome variables will be compared at baseline and the effects of intervention on changes in outcome measures will be determined within six month after intervention. Descriptive results will be presented as mean, median, frequency and percentage. Inferential statistics will be utilized where appropriate. Normality assessment statistically and graphically will be assessed. Confidence interval will be set at 95% for the estimation of mean. The level of significance will be set at p less than 0.05. To access comparability of the intervention and control during baseline Chi-square will be used in categorical data whereas paired T-test will be used in continuous data.  

Data analysis will be done in different stages, with in subject analysis and between subject analyses. A General Linear Model (GLM) will be used for outcome without covariates and with covariates. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) will be used to see the different between controlling the covariates (after post hoc test) and without controlling the covariates (before post hoc test). Spearman correlation will be used to analysis correlation between self-efficacy and self-care. The independent variable of this study is DLNET intervention, intermediate dependent variables are self-efficacy score and self-care score and main dependent variable is HbA1c. The covariates in this study are age, gender, level of education, ethnicity, BMI, comorbidity, duration of diabetes, number of medication and treatment pattern. Cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be performed using cost-effectiveness ratio (CER).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malaysian diabetic patients are mostly poorly controlled, with a mean hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 8.7% and only 22% of patients achieving the treatment goal of &lt;6.5%.Clearly, an improvement in glycemic control is likely to reduce the risk of diabetic complications. Diabetic education is one of the approach to achieve HbA1c target. It is effective for improving clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients with diabetes. Health literacy targeted intervention is one type of diabetic education approach which integrate self-efficacy and self-care behavior into the module. It is targeted towards diabetic patients who have medium to low health literacy. The objective of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate the health literacy targeted intervention on reducing HbA1c level and cost effectiveness of the intervention among Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients at Hospital Angkatan Tentera Tuanku Mizan.


This study will be carried out at Hospital Angkatan Tentera Tuanku Mizan (HATTM), specifically at Medical Outpatient Department (MOPD) and primary care centre of HATTM at Kem Kementah. Study design is parallel, single blind, randomized control trial will be used. There will be two arms, there are the intervention arm (receiving the Diabetes Literacy and Numeracy Toolkit (DLNET) module) and control arm (receiving the usual Diabetes Education module). Inclusion criteria will be confirmed patients with T2DM (within 6 months), adult ( Age more than 18 years old), able to understand English or Malay language, low health literacy (NVS score less than 4) and baseline HbA1c higher or equal to 6.5%. Exclusion criteria are patients who has psychiatric problem (e.g schizophrenia), high health literacy (NVS score more than 3), corrected visual acuity of less than 20/50 using a Rosenbaum Screener and color blinded. Sample size estimation is 58 participants for each arm.

Data analysis will be done in different stages, with in subject analysis and between subject analyses. A General Linear Model (GLM) will be used for outcome without covariates and with covariates. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) will be used to see the different between controlling the covariates (after post hoc test) and without controlling the covariates (before post hoc test). Spearman correlation will be used to analysis correlation between self-efficacy and self-care. The independent variable of this study is DLNET intervention, intermediate dependent variables are self-efficacy score and self-care score and main dependent variable is HbA1c. Cost effectiveness analysis will be performed using cost effectiveness ratio</summary>
