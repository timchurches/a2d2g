  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will have a high tibial osteotomy performed using the AKRFX System with the implant and anchors. The implant and anchors are intended to be permanent though they can be removed if necessary. Patients in the historical control group will have received osteotomy using currently available systems. No contact will be made with these patients. All information will be obtained from an existing database at the Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic in London, Ontario Canada</interventions>
    <comparator>The historical control group will be comprised of patients matched on age, gender, Body Mass Index and degree of preoperative malalignment. The patients are part of an existing database of patients having had high tibial osteotomy using currently available systems, at Fowler Kennedy Sports Medicine Clinic in Ontario Canada.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a 12 month study seeking to enroll patients with symptomatic knee pain caused by osteoarthritis, who are bowlegged (with varus malalignment). The study will evaluate the safety of a new implant designed to realign the lower leg. Realignment can prevent further progress of osteoarthritis, decrease pain and allow individuals to return to more normal activity. In order to evaluate the safety of the system the study will collect information on any problems patients may experience during the surgery and recovery (up to 12 months), X-rays of the leg to evaluate bone healing and stability of the implant, and answers to surveys with questions about how patients are feeling and what their activity level is. This information will then be compared to a matched group of patients who had a high tibial osteotomy performed with a currently available metal plate and screw system.</summary>
