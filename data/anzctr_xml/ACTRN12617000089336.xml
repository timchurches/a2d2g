  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two-arm randomised controlled trial including 1,560 adult (18yrs and older) patients. Prospective patients scheduled to have a PIVC inserted and meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.

Arm 1: The BD Nexiva closed IV catheter system is an integrated PIVC system. BD Nexiva consists of a number of key components incorporated as one piece: IV catheter, stabilization platform, finger grips, needle safety shield, extension tubing, pinch clamp, Y adapter (double port catheter), BD Q-Syte Luer Access Split Septum and vent plug. The Nexiva catheter is available in a range of sizes from 18 up to 24 gauge and as a single or double port. In this study, the double port will be used; therefore two BD SmartSite connectors will be added to close the Y-connector completely (780 participants). 

Arm 2: The traditional non-integrated system is different to the integrated system in that all the components are separated pieces, which need to be attached during cannulation. In this study, the B Braun Introcan Safety 3 catheter will be used. Key components of this catheter are: IV catheter, needle, transparent catheter hub, push-off plate, flashback chamber, removable vented flashplug, passive safety clip (to cover the needle tip). A Connecta extension set 15cm and a small bore with SmartSite connector will be attached to the catheter (780 participants). 

Insertion and care of the PIVCs: Study and control catheters will be inserted by trained clinicians at each hospital, who are existing skilled or competent IV inserters. Pre-trial they will have training and simulated practice inserting the study catheter until they feel confident that their skills are at the same level as the control catheter insertion. The training will be provided by a Research Fellow and a Clinical Nurse (both specialists in vascular access devices), and will consist of a single 3-hour workshop with a maximum of six participants. During the training, educative videos with content on the characteristics of the integrated system, insertion techniques, dressing, care, and removal of the device will be shown, followed by a discussion on the main differences between the non-integrated and the integrated systems as well as a Q&amp;A section. After the theoretical content is delivered, clinicians will practice the insertion of the device on insertion arms until they feel equally confident using the integrated catheter (level of confidence &gt;80%). We anticipate 15-20 successful insertions will be sufficient. 

Patients will only have their initial PIVC entered into the study. As PIVCs can fail at any time of day and need to be replaced quickly, it is not possible to have subsequent insertions for that patient follow the study protocol. This is because the general hospital staff would not be trained in integrated PIVC insertion. Once patients have a failed PIVC, they will receive the standard institutional PIVC inserted by the hospital staff, and are no longer on the trial. During the trial, patients will have other aspects of PIVC care standardised in all study groups, consistent with usual practice. The devices will remain in situ as per hospital policy.
All other PIVC policies will be standardised between groups throughout the study e.g. skin preparation, dressings, etc, as far as practicable.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is PIVC failure (composite endpoint) for reasons of: occlusion, infiltration/extravasation, phlebitis/thrombophlebitis, dislodgement, haematoma, localised or bloodstream catheter-related infections.
a) Occlusion is defined as the inability to infuse or inject solution into a catheter; the inability to aspirate blood from a catheter or both. .   
b) Infiltration/extravasation infiltration is defined as the inadvertent permeation of IV fluid (non-vesicant solution) into the interstitial compartment, causing swelling of the tissue around the site of the catheter. Extravasation is the inadvertent administration of a vesicant solution into surrounding tissue. 
c) Phlebitis/thrombophlebitis phlebitis is defined as irritation and inflammation of a vein wall caused by the presence of the PIVC. It is characterised by the presence of any combination of tenderness, pain, erythema, swelling, warmth, palpable cord, or purulent drainage. In this study phlebitis includes pain (&gt;1 out of 10) alone or plus any of the criteria mentioned above (on questioning, then palpation by the research nurse). Thrombophlebitis is also characterised by a visible clot on removal and/or palpable thrombosis of the cannulated vein. All these are consequence of the inflammation of the vein wall that leads to thrombus formation. In this study the presence of thrombophlebitis will be confirmed by ultrasound of the compromised vessel (if ordered by clinicians). 
d) Dislodgement is defined as movement of the catheter in and out of, or around and within, the vein resulting in partial or complete dislodgement. This may be characterized as Leaking (partial dislodgement)
e) Haematoma is defined as solid swelling of clotted blood within the tissues caused by a break in the wall of the blood vessel due to the insertion of a PIVC.
f) Localised venous infection is defined as organisms grown from purulent discharge or vein segment with no evidence of associated bloodstream infection..
g) Bloodstream infection is defined as positive blood culture from a peripheral vein; clinical signs of infection (i.e. fever, chills, or hypotension); no other apparent source for the bloodstream infection except the intravenous catheter (in situ within 48 h of the bloodstream infection); and a colonised intravenous catheter tip culture with the same organism as identified in the blood.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device colonisation: From the Qld site, approximately 468 (234 per group) PIVC tips will be analysed by the semi-quantitative method in the Griffith University laboratory. PIVC tips will be selected based on availability of the Research Nurse when the PIVC is removed and when transfer to the lab is available. Colonisation of intravenous catheter tip will be considered if more than 15 colony-forming units are present. Blood cultures from a peripheral vein, and PIVC skin swabs (if ordered by clinicians) will be cultured by Microbiology Pathology Queensland-Central Lab by blinded scientists </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Power analysis a priori was performed using the online power/sample size calculator of the University of British Columbia to estimate the sample size for this study. We used a relative reduction in PIVC failure of 0.83 as reported in previous research (Gonzalez Lopez et al. 2014) from baseline 41% to 34%, power of 90% and significance level of 0.05 and allowed for potential attrition of 2.5%. In total, 2060 patients (1030 integrated and 1030 non-integrated) are needed. Data from 500 participants in the Gonzalez Lopez (2014) study will be used in the meta-analysis; therefore, in this current trial 1560 participants will be recruited. 

Quantitative data analysis: Data will be cleaned and checked for missing and invalid values before importing into STATA. Descriptive characteristics and survey results will be presented using means and standard deviations (SDs) or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. All randomised patients will be analysed by intention to treat with patients the unit of measurement and one PIVC per patient. Chi-squared or Fishers exact tests will be used to compare qualitative variables and the Students t test to compare quantitative variables. The primary analysis will compare the integrated and non-integrated groups. Baseline group comparisons will be by clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to display the rate of events in relation to catheter-hours and catheter-days, with the log rank test used to compare differences in failure over time. Secondary endpoints will be compared between groups using parametric/nonparametric techniques. The proportional hazards assumption will be checked, and Cox regression will test the effect of group, patient, device and clinical variables on failure, and assess for an interaction effect. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes, with multiple imputations considered if data is missing at random. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. We will quantify additional costs, benefits, net monetary benefit, considering PIVCs indwelling time, reinsertions and treatment costs of complications/group. Cost-analyses using ANCOVA will be undertaken to compare group costs. P-values &lt;0.05 will be statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: 
Peripheral Venous Catheters (PVCs) are frequently used to provide treatment for hospitalised patients. However, the failure rate of these devices is extremely high. Recent evidence suggests that integrated PVC systems may improve patient outcomes compared to the traditional non-integrated PVC systems. However, more evidence is needed to inform clinical practice and guidelines. 

Objectives: 
1. To compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two PIVC systems: (i) integrated, and (ii) non-integrated (current practice) to prevent PIVC failure, insertion pain, microbial colonisation, functional dwell time, and adverse events. 
2. To assess the acceptability and implementation challenges of integrated systems via quantitative and qualitative feedback from inserters, patients, clinicians and policy-makers. 

Methods: 
Two-arm randomised controlled trial including 1,560 adult (=18yrs) patients. 
· Integrated system: BD Nexiva integrated intravenous catheter system with two SmartSite connectors to close the Y-connector completely (n=780). 
· Non-integrated system: B Braun Introcan Safety 3 catheter, Connecta extension set 15cm, small bore with SmartSite connector (n=780). 
Clinicians (n=20) and policy-makers (n=10) will be assessed using qualitative methods to determine the acceptability and implementation of the integrated system.
The primary outcome is PIVC failure: Composite endpoint of occlusion, infiltration, phlebitis/pain, dislodgement, haematoma, localised or bloodstream catheter-related infections. 

Results: 
Results could improve millions of patients' health outcomes by reducing PIVC complications and failure as well as clinicians' workloads and health-care costs. 

Conclusion:
Results of this study could assist policy-maker decision-making about the best PIVC system choice, and inform clinical guidelines, which could benefit patients and health care systems worldwide.</summary>
