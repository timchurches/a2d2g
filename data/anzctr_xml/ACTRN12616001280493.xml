  <interventions>
    <interventions>An information brochure, co-produced with consumer advisors and health professionals, to describe in lay language the checking procedure that nurses are required to follow when administering medications in the hospital setting.

Research staff will distribute the brochure by hand to all patients who meet the inclusion criteria within 24 hours of their admission to an intervention ward. The brochure will remain with the patient for the duration of their inpatient stay. Patients in the usual care wards will not receive the brochure.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 1. Medication errors measuring using medication chart audits.
With a 10% medication administration error rate, a 95% CI and 80% power, to detect an anticipated 5% error reduction rate, Approximately, 600 medication orders in each arm per audit cycle will be audited. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Audits will be carried out on all four wards on a single day each month for 3-months prior, 3-months during, and 3-months post intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 2: Medication errors reported in RiskMan (risk management system). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: For all four wards, monthly reports of RiskMan data will be obtained for 4-months prior, 3-months during, and 4-months post intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 3: Observations of nurses medication administration practices. Non-participant observation will be conducted by a member of the research team who will not interact with the nurse or patient and will remain as discrete as possible. Observation periods will be of 2-hours duration and will be conducted at typical medication administration times (e.g., 0800, 1400, 2000). A total of 200 administration episodes will be observed in each ward during each of the three phases. A structured data collection tool will be used during the observation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: For the 3-months pre, during and post intervention, observations of medication administration by nurses will be undertaken on the four wards. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 1: Patient perceptions of whether they exercised the right to ask if the checking procedure had been followed. A semi-structured telephone interview will be conducted by research personnel to elicit patients perceptions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: Interview conducted at approximately 48 hours post discharge.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 2: Focus group interviews will be conducted with registered nurses and medication endorsed enrolled nurses on each of the intervention wards to elicit their perceptions of the acceptability of the patient engagement intervention and its effect on patient behaviour. One to three focus group interviews will be conducted on each ward, dependent on the number and availability of nurses willing to participate in an interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint: The focus groups will be undertaken within the first three months following completion of the intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary objectives
To determine (1) the feasibility of the KT patient engagement intervention and study design, and (2) the effect of the patient engagement intervention on medication administration error rates. 

Secondary objectives 
To determine (1) patients and nurses perceptions of the acceptability of the KT patient engagement intervention, and (2) the effect of the intervention on nurses and patients behaviour.

The intervention
The basis of this knowledge translation (KT) patient engagement intervention will be a patient brochure containing information about the required medication administration checking procedures, developed in consultation with consumer representatives and clinical nurse representatives. Four general wards across two hospitals will be included: two intervention wards (i.e., brochure) and two control wards (i.e., usual practice/no brochure). Research staff will distribute the brochure to patients within 24 hours of their admission to the intervention wards. Their attention will be drawn to the content of the brochure and their right to ask the nurse if the checking procedure has been adhered to. The brochure will remain with the patient for the duration of their inpatient stay. 

Outcome data
Data on medication administration errors will be obtained from three different sources:
Medication chart audits: Carried out on all four wards on a single day each month for 3-months prior, 3-months during, and 3-months post intervention. 
RiskMan medication error data: For all four wards, monthly reports of RiskMan data will be obtained for 4-months prior, 3-months during, and 4-months post intervention. 
Random observations of nurses medication administration practices: For the 3-months pre, during and post intervention, observations of medication administration by nurses will be undertaken on the four wards. 

Process evaluation data
Patient interview: Approximately 48-hours following discharge from intervention wards (consent will be obtained prior to discharge), a telephone interview will be conducted to elicit patients perceptions of the brochure and whether it had any effect on their behaviour.
Patient survey: Patients discharged from all four wards during the 3-month intervention phase will be invited to complete a survey, primarily focused on their confidence to manage their health and their involvement and engagement in their own care. 
Staff focus group interview: Registered nurses and medication endorsed enrolled nurses on intervention wards will be invited to participate in a focus group interview to determine their perceptions of the intervention.</summary>
