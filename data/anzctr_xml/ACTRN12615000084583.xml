  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be studied in a purpose built room where the temperature is regulated. The chamber is housed within a large room of the institute. Participants will be studied on three occasions during a total of 4 hours exposure to 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C  or 27 degrees C in random order. A minimum of washout of one week will apply between trials.
Participants with known impaired glucose tolerance or Type 2 Diabetes must have been diagnosed for at least 2 years and have their condition well controlled. Participants should have residing in Australia for more than 2 years. We will measure metabolic rate, endothelial function, blood pressure, skin temperature, fat and carbohydrate oxidation at rest. Following a fasting blood sample collection after 1.5 hour exposure to selected temperature, participants will  ingest a glucose solution (75 g in 300 ml water, OGTT). All measurements will be continued at each half hour after glucose for a further 2 hours. Participants will be required to lie in bed, reading or listening to music in between measurements. A final blood sample for lipids, insulin glucose and liver function tests will be made 2 hours after the glucose drink and conclude the trial.</interventions>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>To calculate the effect size we used a 3% variance in BMR on cold exposure and a within subject error variance of 13% (GPower version 3.1.9.2). Hence for an effect size of 0.480, a power of 0.95, alpha = 0.05 and an MANOVA for repeated measures, we can detect differences in treatment (3 temperatures,), if we recruit 18 participants. We will recruit 10% more to allow for dropouts. </statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The aim of the study is to understand how the bodys metabolism changes in response to mild cold. In general, people with obesity, insulin resistance or diabetes do not increase their metabolic rate as much as those who are insulin sensitive.  </summary>
