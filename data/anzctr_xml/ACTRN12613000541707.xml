  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single group repeated measures study with orthosis made from medical grade thermoplastic elastomer.
Different sizes (small,medium, large) of orthosis to be tested.
Different densities (soft, medium, firm) of orthosis to be tested.
Women lying on orthosis in prone position during assessment of mechanical forces (5 minutes) measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and capacitance pliance sensors.
All measurements are taken within one day.
Hypothesis: Can orthosis reduce pain, displacement, compression and loading forces through the breast tissue during prone activties.</interventions>
    <comparator>No orthosis
Women lying on orthosis in prone position during measurement of mechanical forces (5 minutes) measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and capacitance pliance sensors immediately before measurements with different orthoses.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Any clinically relevant abnormal findings, which in the opinion of the investigators, may put the participant at risk of adverse events because of participation in the clinical trial. These findings may come from physical examination, clinical chemistry and vital signs.
Any recent history of thoracic cage trauma or loss of bone integrity such as osteoporosis.
Alcohol abuse.
The use of illicit drugs.
Any psychiatric disorders (determined by history or examination) that would prevent completion of the study or result in possible adverse events for the participant.
Pregnancy
Breast augmentation recipients with a history of complications.
Breast augmentation recipients to be less than three weeks post operation.
Breast augmentation recipients with Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) silicone implants.</exclusivecriteria>
