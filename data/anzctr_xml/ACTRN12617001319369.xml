  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient will be randomised to intervention 1 or a control treatment to treat their humeral shaft fracture.
 Intervention 1 is operative treatment of the humeral shaft fracture. If randomised to this treatment the patient with undergo internal fixation of the humerus fracture by the treating Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon. They may use whichever fixation method is usual for them. (In practice this will mean a plate and screws or an intramedullary nail fixation method.) The operation will take between 60 and 120 minutes. When well enough following the operation the patient will be allowed home and to begin moving their arm. They will be reviewed in the fracture clinic as is routine for these injuries at 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks following their operation for a clinical check and check X-ray by the treating Orthopaedic Surgeon</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be non-operative treatment which will consist of a temporary plaster on the arm until the patient is comfortable enough to be placed into a standard removable humeral brace. (This timescale for the change between plaster and brace will be slightly variable between patients but the aim would be to get all patients treated with the control treatment into a brace by the end of the first week of treatment,)
The length of time in the brace will be determined by the treating Orthopaedic Surgeon and will be judged by pain level and degree of fracture union as determined by normal clinic attendance and routine check X-ray. This period of time in brace may be as long as 3 months. Plasters will be applied by suitably trained doctors or nursers from the Emergency or Orthopaedic departments. The change to a brace will be supervised by a suitably experienced and trained Orthopaedic Doctor or Nurse. Clinic visits and check X-rays at fracture clinic will likely be undertaken at 1 week, 2 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post injury. If additional clinic visits or X-rays are required for clinical reasons, this will be determined by the treating Orthopaedic Consultant Surgeon.

    <statisticalmethods>difference of 10 points on the DASH (out of 100) has been shown as the minimum clinically important difference necessary to detect improvement. The standard deviation of the DASH score is approximately 20, therefore using a significance level of 0.05 and power of 90%, 85 patients are required in each group. Allowing for 15% loss to follow up, we aim to recruit a total of 100 patients per group. 
Continuous data such as the DASH and pain scores will be analysed using a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the two independent groups. Categorical outcomes (eg union, re-operation or re-admission rates) will be analysed using a chi-squared test. The statistician performing the analysis will be blinded to the treatment groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A multicentre randomised controlled trial comparing outcomes for humeral shaft fractures (arm fractures) treated with and without an operation to 'fix' the bone (with a metal plate and screws or a rod versus treating with an arm brace).
200 patients will be randomised over 14 hospitals (100 to each treatment type) and followed up over one year to determine if there is any difference in outcome.

The hypothesis is that those treated with surgery will have better outcomes. The primary outcomes is the difference between the groups for scores on the Disabilities of hand and shoulder survey at one year post injury. 
Other outcome measure will be fracture healing, pain and quality of life scores, complication rates and return to activity levels as well as a cost analysis of both treatment types.</summary>
