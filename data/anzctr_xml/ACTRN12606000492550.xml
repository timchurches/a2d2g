  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment group: Single episode of Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) injections into the intrinsic muscles of the thumb (dosage of 0.5 U/kg BTX-A (max 20 units) injected into flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis or adductor pollicis to a maximum total dose of 1.5 U/kg or 30 units) + casting for one week, home therapy program (to be carried out daily for 8 weeks) and resting hand splints to be worn daily (for resting time over night eg 10 hours) for 8 weeks.
Botulinum toxin A dosing to be determined by blinded physician. Muscles injected dependent upon clinical determinants of spasticity in those muscles 

Home therapy programme will involve a range of activities selected according to the child's individual goals and will take approximately 20 minutes per day.  For example:  strengthening excercises for thumb flexors with playdoh.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group: Single episode of saline injections into the intrinsic muscles of the thumb (dosage dependant upon equivalent volume of BTX-A, dilution 100u/ml) injected into flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis or adductor pollicis to a maximum total dose of 1.5 U/kg or 30 units) + casting for one week, home therapy program (to be carried out daily for 8 weeks) and resting hand splints to be worn daily for 8 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Goal attainment scaling (GAS) is an individualized outcome measurement technique developed for use in the human services field  It allows for individual assessment of patient goals and standardization of measurement using a summary formula that calculates the extent to which an individuals goals are met.  Parents will be asked to nominate three to five goals relating to the use or position of the thumb and scale levels will be formulated around each goal from -2 (baseline performance), zero (expected outcome after intervention) to +2 (better than expected outcome).  The formula applied to calculate GAS scores will be: 
GAS score = 50 +  10?(wixi) 
       v (0.7 ? wi2 + 0.3 (? wi)2)
where xi = the attainment level and wi = the weight assigned to the goal area.  The expected score is 50, with 100 being the best possible score post-intervention.
Administration of the GAS with the parents will be approximately 20 minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Administered at baseline, 8 weeks post intervention and 6 months post intervention.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of upper extremities skills test (QUEST), modified Ashworth scale, modified Tardieu scale, classification of thumb deformities.</outcome>
