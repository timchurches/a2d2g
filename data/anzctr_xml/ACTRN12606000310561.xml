    <interventions>This is a dose-blinded, long-term safety and efficacy study of a new experimental drug called darusentan.  Darusentan is not currently approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in Australia, which means that a doctor cannot prescribe this drug.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of darusentan in subjects with resistant systolic hypertension despite treatment with full doses of four or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic.  Three doses of darusentan (50, 100, or 300 mg qd) that are orally administered will be examined for the long-term duration of the study.</interventions>
