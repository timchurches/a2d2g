  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the first part of the study with 32 healthy volunteers, participants will be randomised to one of five treatment groups as indicated  below. 
-	Treatment A: 5 g of 1% ZYN002
-	Treatment B: 10 g of 1% ZYN002
-	Treatment C: 5 g of 2.5% ZYN002
-	Treatment D: 10 g of 2.5% ZYN002 
-	Treatment E: 5 g or 10g of placebo 
During the second part of the study with 12 patients diagnosed with epilepsy, will receive the highest tolerated dose (Treatment A, B, C or D)  from the first part of study or placebo.
ZYN002 or placebo gel will be applied to the skin on the right or left shoulder and/or upper arm as a single application.
The gel will be thoroughly massaged into the shoulders and/or upper arms by a member of the research facility. Participants will not be permitted to wash their shoulder and/or upper arm (application site) for at least 12 hours after application.

The trial site Pharmacist will be in possession of a sealed opaque envelope. The outside of each of the envelopes will be labelled with the randomization number.  Inside the envelope will be the randomization sequence assigned to the specific randomization number. A sealed envelope will only be opened by the site if the blind is required to be broken. 

The trial site will screen and enroll subjects that meet the study criteria.  Once it is determined the subject/patient qualifies to participate in the study the site will choose from the randomization list the first randomization number for the participant.  The randomization list does not denote the treatment the participant is receiving.  The site will continue to use the next randomization number in the sequence provided for each subsequent subject enrolled, until they have randomized the appropriate number of subjects for the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is this study about? The purpose of this study is to investigate how safe and tolerable a single dose of ZYN002 transdermal gel is in healthy participants and patients with epilepsy. The study will look at how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and then removes the study drug from your body.  This will be done by analysing the levels of ZYN002 in your blood and urine at various times following drug administration.  Your skin at the application site will be checked to see if there is any irritation or reactions present after ZYN002 application.  The study will also investigate the effect that ZYN002 has on your visual attention and ability to complete a simple task.  The task requires you to connect-the-dots of 25 consecutive dots as fast as possible.

Who is if for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 55 years and are either in general good health or have epilepsy with partial onset seizures that is stable. 

Study details: This study will investigate various doses of ZYN002 compared to a placebo gel (a treatment with no active ingredients which looks like the real thing but it is not).  This study is double-blind which means you and your study doctor, together with the study staff administering the study treatment will not know whether you are receiving ZYN002 or placebo gel.  

What does study participation involve? Your participation in the study includes a screening visit, which could be up to 28 days before your study treatment; One confinement period starting on the evening before dosing and lasting until 48 hours after the study treatment i.e. a total of about 62 hours (2.5 days).  This will require three (3) nights in the clinic. There are also two out-patient clinic visits following the confinement period on Days 4 and 5.  These visits will be at 72 and 96 hours after the application of the study treatment. Additional out-patient visits may be required if there is any skin irritation present at the study treatment application site. 
Throughout the study you will have various medical tests (physical examinations, vital signs measured, ECG measured, neuropsychological tests) and will have several blood and urine samples collected for laboratory analysis.
