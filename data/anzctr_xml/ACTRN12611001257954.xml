  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive access to the Get Happy program, a mCBT (mobile Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) program.  This mCBT program is based on the iCBT program with demonstrated efficacy at reducing symptoms of depression (Perini, Titov &amp; Andrews, 2008; Perini, Titov &amp; Andrews, 2009).  The mCBT Get Happy program consists of six lessons and summaries.  The homework assignments are emailed to the participant to enable printing.  

The six lessons represent best practice principles used in CBT for depression including behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, and assertiveness skills. Part of the content of each lesson is presented in the form of an illustrated story about a woman with depression who, with the help of a clinical psychologist, learns to gain mastery over her symptoms.  As participants progress through each lesson they have access to additional written documents providing supplementary information about techniques such as managing sleep problems, panic, and other common comorbid symptoms.  The participants are also provided with access to vignettes written by previous participants about their own experiences in managing depressing during the Get Happy program.  Participants are also expected to complete the homework tasks prior to completing the next lesson.

All participants will begin the 8-week treatment program at the same time.  Participants will be advised to complete one lesson every 7-10 days and to complete the six lessons within 8 weeks of starting.  All participants will be able to receive automatic emails and/or SMS, depending on their preferred mode of contact, congratulating them for lesson completion.  Automatic emails and SMS can also be sent to participants informing them when a lesson is to be completed and reminding about homework.  Reminder emails and SMS will also be sent if they have not completed the next lesson within 7 days of notification. There will be a minimum of 5 days between when each lesson can become available. 

Participants will have one-on-one contact with the Clinician (Clinical Psychologist) by telephone or email in the first 2 weeks, then as required.  The clinician will use a script as a guideline, which identifies the topics covered.  After the participants have finished the program, all participants will complete a second set of diagnostic questionnaires.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both groups will be offered the same treatment at the same time.  However, one group will have access via a mobile or tablet, and the second group will have access via a computer.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Applicants will be recruited via our website (www.virtualclinic.org.au) providing information about common mental disorders including depression, and a link to apply online to join a research treatment program.  Applicants will first apply online, completing questionnaires about severity of symptoms, demographic details, and chronicity of symptoms. Those scoring 5-19 on the PHQ-9 scale will be invited to proceed. Those scoring lower will be advised via email that their symptoms are below the threshold we are interested in and that they should read the self help material on www.crufad.org. Those scoring higher than 19 on the scale will be advised via email that their condition is unlikely to respond to the mobile therapy; and that they should seek the help of a local clinician.  Those scoring PHQ9 Q9=2 and who have a history of a prior suicide attempt and those scoring PHQ9 Q9=3 will also be advised to consult a local clinician. Those invited to proceed will be offered a phone call to discuss the trial at a time that is convenient.  

Applicants will be telephoned for a diagnostic interview using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 5.0.0 (MINI) to determine whether they meet DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode. Applicants that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode using the MINI will be excluded from the study and thanked for their application.  These applicants will be encouraged to discuss their symptoms with physician.  

Applicants that do meet the criteria for a major depressive episode will be informed of the study design and invited to return a completed consent form via email.


Before the diagnostic interview phone call the patient information sheet and informed consent form will be sent so that it can be discussed over the phone. The technician will administer the structured diagnostic interview and if they meet criteria for major depression they will be admitted to the study.   Allocation concealment will occur in the following way: A staff member not involved in the clinical trial will generate the sequence using computer software, and place each choice in a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed and stapled envelope.  The technician is then unaware of which group the participant will be allocated and will open up an envelope at the end of the interview and reveal to the participant which group they have been randomly allocated.

The participant will be enrolled in the study after the informed consent process has been completed.</concealment>
    <sequence>The participants accepted in the program will be randomized via a true randomization process (www.random.org) to either the treatment group or control group.  Allocation will follow the diagnostic telephone call, and self report measures will preclude blinding.  Equal randomization (1:1) will be conducted.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate the value of a new mobile therapy for depression using your mobile phone or tablet compared to doing the same therapy program on a computer. We have been modifying an existing internet therapy program for adults with depression and developed a new mobile version. It comprises an illustrated story of someone recovering from depression, take home tasks to facilitate this recovery, and regular clinician advice to improve progress. A username (your email address) and password is required for you to access this mobile therapy application. This is a trial that compares two groups: People who access the course via mobile app and people who access the course via computer. All participants will begin the course at the same time, starting in May.</summary>
