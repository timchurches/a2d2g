  <interventions>
    <interventions>Grandparent Triple P is a nine session program, with one session provided per week. The first 6 sessions are conducted in a group setting with between 4-10 other grandparents in attendance and they are of a two hour duration. The final three sessions are individual telephone consultations with the participants. They are also provided weekly and each phone consultation has between a 20-30 minute duration.

Grandparent Triple P Program Session Details:

Session 1: Positive Grandparenting
We introduce the 6 principles of positive grandparenting and discuss causes of grandchild behaviour. We also develop goals for change.

Session 2: Helping Grandchildren Develop
We discuss the 10 positive strategies to improve grandparent-grandchild relationships.
We also discuss how to apply the strategies of descriptive praise, talk, affection, and setting a good example to the parents.

Session 3: Managing Misbehaviour
Discuss 7 strategies to manage misbehaviour.
We also discuss the stop and start routines.

Session 4: Building a Positive Parenting Team
We discuss expectations of being a grandparent, communication skills, problem solving, and using strategies to manage the emotional distress of parents. We also discuss how to use casual conversations to help share parenting strategies between grandparents and parents.

Session 5: Grandparent Survival Skills
We discuss the unhelpful emotions of stress, anxiety, depression, and anger, and how these emotions can affect the relationship with the parents, your partner, and grandchildren.
We discuss 10 different coping strategies to manage these emotions.

Session 6: Planning Ahead
We discuss how to prepare for high risk situations (e.g., situations with the parents, going shopping, etc)

Session 7 -9: Telephone Calls and Program Close
At this point the practitioner provides ongoing support to the grandparents through telephone calls. This is when the program gets tailored to the individual needs of the grandparent. 
The final session can also occur as a group session. In the final session we also discuss how to maintain positive change and looking ahead for further high-risk times.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether Grandparent Triple P is effective in assiting grandparents supporting their grandchildren. Specifically it is hypothesised that compared to a control group, grandparents participating in Grandparent Triple P would have increased parenting self-efficacy; increased relationship satisfaction with biological son or daughter (the parent); decreased reliance on dysfunctional parenting strategies; and decreased levels of depression, stress, and anxiety. Additionally, it was hypothesised that grandparent participation in the intervention would result in positive childhood outcomes, specifically a reduction in childhood behavioural problems. The secondary hypotheses were that grandparents would experience higher marital relationship satisfaction and decreased partner conflict over parenting strategies. It was predicted that these positive treatment outcomes would be maintained at six-month follow-up. Finally, a secondary outcome hypothesized was that parents would report an increase in relationship satisfaction with the grandparents, and that parents would also report a reduction in childhood behavioural problems.</summary>
