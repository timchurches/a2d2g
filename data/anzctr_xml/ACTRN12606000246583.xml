  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous clonidine and dexmedetomidine in children as this has not been determined before and will lead to more rational dosing.   Once the child is enrolled in the study (following parental consent and child assent, if of age) the child is given a single dose of clonidine or dexmedetomidine once stable in the intensive care unit following surgery.  Following administration of the drug, 3 blood samples will be taken at 5 minutes, 3 hours and 8 hours following drug administration.  These blood samples will be assayed to determine the plasma concentration of clonidine or dexmedetomidine and allow the determination of the pharmacokinetic profile.  Pharmacodynamic data will also be obtained.  Blood pressure, heart rate, morphine and benzodiazipine useage will be determined from nursing flow charts and drug charts hourly.  The time to extubation will also be noted.   This will enable us to determine if clonidine or dexmedetomidine has any effect or BP, HR, analgesic and sedative use and time on mehcanical ventiation.</summary>
