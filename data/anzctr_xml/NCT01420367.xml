  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  All patients who have their appendix removed and are found on operation to have
             'simple appendicitis' as defined in the Cochrane review[7]. That is an appendix that
             is non-inflamed, acutely inflamed, phlegmonous, suppurative or mildly inflamed.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients who on operation are found to have 'complicated appendicitis' defined as an
             appendix that is gangrenous or perforated.

          -  Patients who pre-operatively appear to be acutely septic or for another reason require
             extended antibiotic therapy.

          -  Patients who, at operation, are found to have other pathology e.g. Meckel's
             Diverticulum, Intussusception; requiring surgical or medical intervention.

          -  Any patient whose guardian does not wish for them to participate in the study.

          -  Patients who have additional co-morbidities, including diabetes, immuno-suppression,
             cardiac, renal or liver failure.

          -  If the child continues to show sign of sepsis, in terms of fever, tachycardia, he/she
             will be discontinued from the study and be given additional doses of antibiotics, as
             clinically indicated.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>Hypothesis: A single dose of prophylactic antibiotics is as effective as a three dose regime
      in preventing post-operative complications in paediatric patients with simple appendicitis.

      This project will compare patients 16 years and under with simple appendicitis (appendicitis
      that is not perforated or gangrenous). Patients will be randomly divided into two groups;

        -  Group one will receive a single pre-operative dose of antibiotics (metronidazole
           12.5mg/kg up to 500mg and cefazolin 25mg/kg up to 1g) and two 'doses' of normal saline
           (placebo) eight and sixteen hours after the initial dose, respectively.

        -  Group two will receive one pre-operative dose of antibiotics (metronidazole 12.5mg/kg up
           to 500mg and cefazolin 25mg/kg up to 1g) and two post-operative doses, eight and sixteen
           hours after the first dose, respectively.

      Group allocation will be concealed from the patient and their guardian, the treating surgical
      team and outcome assessors (triple blinded). A process to rapidly reveal group allocation if
      required will be in place.

      The aim of the study is to determine if a single dose of antibiotics is as effective as three
      doses in preventing post-operative infection. This will be assessed by comparing:

        -  Duration of hospital stay from operation until discharge, based on a standardised
           discharge criteria.

        -  Development of wound infection or requirement of antibiotics in the six weeks
           post-operation

        -  Need for re-admission.

      Information will be collected prospectively from each patient's hospital notes and from a
      follow-up phone call six weeks after the operation.</summary>
