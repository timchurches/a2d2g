  <interventions>
    <interventions>Combined Cognitive Training (CT) and psychoeducation program covering healthy brain ageing.  This consists of a two hour group-based (8-10 people) session twice every week for 7 weeks. The psychoeducation sessions are delivered by specialists including clinical neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, psychogeriatricians, chronobiologists, and experts in diet and exercise.  The computer-based cognitive training sessions are facilitated by trained clinical neuropsychologists. The first hour delivers information pertinent to healthy ageing including use of cognitive strategies and information on diet and exercise, vascular risk factors, depression, anxiety and sleep.  The second hour is a computer based cognitive training program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual. This includes standard clinical care by usual health care professionals. There is no prescribed intervention administered by the trial. The control arm is a waitlist control arm. It also runs for 7-weeks, and then participants are re-assessed, and offered the opportunity to participate in the cognitive training groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Formal neuropsychological testing will assess performance in a number of cognitive domains including learning and memory, language, speed of processing, attention and working memory, and executive functioning.  

The primary outcome is memory which will be measured using the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test and the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants are assessed at trial entry, and again after 7 weeks of either 'cognitive training' or 'treatment as usual' (ie. waitlist).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression, as assessed by a Psychogeriatrician using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders.  

Patients are also asked to complete questionnaires pertaining to their mood (Geriatric Depression Scale; Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants are assessed at trial entry, and again after 7 weeks of either 'cognitive training' or 'treatment as usual' (ie. waitlist).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evoked related potentials as assessed by neurophysiological testing (EEG).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While many studies have shown that cognitive training in older people is associated with improved cognitive abilities, little is known about the predictors of change, or whether cognitive training is associated with improvements in neurophysiological activity or in real world functions such as social relationships. In older individuals at risk of cognitive decline, this study therefore aims to determine the neurobiological, clinical and cognitive predictors of ability to benefit from a healthy brain ageing cognitive training program. It is expected that those who participate in the treatment will improve in terms of memory functioning.</summary>
