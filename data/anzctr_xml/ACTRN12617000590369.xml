Very low nicotine cigarette MAGIC 0, crafted with carbon filter (Federal Trade Commission [FTC] nicotine yield per cigarette = 0.04mg, FTC tar yield per cigarette = 4.1 mg, 22nd Century Group, Inc). 

This brand of VLNC (called MAGIC 0), manufactured by 22nd Century Group, Inc, has recently became available on the Europe market (although they are not available in New Zealand). Similar to the previously developed MAGIC, MAGIC 0 cigarettes yield only 0.04 mg nicotine per cigarette  95% less nicotine than conventional cigarette brands. It has been claimed that the proprietary tobacco used in MAGIC 0 cigarettes has the taste of a conventional cigarette, but with lower-addictive levels of nicotine. According to the company, the addition of a carbon filter reduces toxic compounds in the smoke, and provides a full air flow smoking experience, making it different from previous products (e.g., MAGIC).

Each participant will be allocated to smoke one MAGIC 0 and one MAGIC cigarette at the study site. Participant will smoke each cigarette as closely as possible to their normal smoking pattern. After smoking each cigarette participants will be given a 45 minute washout period in order to complete the evaluation questionnaire and to allow most of the inhaled nicotine to be metabolised (nicotine has a half-life in plasma of nine minutes).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability as measured using the satisfaction domain of the modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ). This domain includes the three questions: 

1) Was smoking satisfying? 
2) Did the cigarettes taste good? 
3) Did you enjoy smoking? 

These questions will be self-rated by participants on a seven-point likert scale (1-not at all, 2 very little, 3-a little, 4-moderately, 5-a lot, 6-quite a lot, 7-extremely). An average of the three questions will be obtained to achieve a single overall measure of smoking satisfaction.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Psychological Reward: measured by the mCEQ

1) Did smoking calm you down? 
2) Did smoking make you feel more awake? 
3) Did smoking make you feel less irritable?
4) Did smoking help you concentrate? 
5) Did smoking reduce your hunger for food?</outcome>
      <timepoint>Secondary outcome measures will be measured immediately after smoking each cigarette</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Craving reduction measured by the mCEQ

1) Did smoking immediately relieve your craving for a cigarette? 

These questions will be self-rated by participants on a seven-point Likert scale (1-not at all, 2 very little, 3-a little, 4-moderately, 5-a lot, 6-quite a lot, 7-extremely). </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Respiratory tract sensations from the mCEQ:

1) Did you enjoy the sensations in your throat and chest?

These questions will be self-rated by participants on a seven-point Likert scale (1-not at all, 2 very little, 3-a little, 4-moderately, 5-a lot, 6-quite a lot, 7-extremely). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured immediately after smoking each cigarette</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Negative effects measured by the mCEQ

1) Did smoking make you dizzy? 
2) Did smoking make you nauseous?

These questions will be self-rated by participants on a seven-point Likert scale (1-not at all, 2 very little, 3-a little, 4-moderately, 5-a lot, 6-quite a lot, 7-extremely). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured immediately after smoking each cigarette </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Characteristics of the cigarette smoke

1) How strong did you find the cigarette smoke?
2) How hot did you find the cigarette smoke?
3) How hard was it to draw smoke from the cigarette? 
4) How harsh did you find the cigarette smoke? 
5) How intense did you find the flavour of the cigarette smoke? 
6) How thick did you find the cigarette smoke? 
7) How fresh did you find the cigarette smoke? 
8) How heavy did you find the cigarette smoke? 
9) How similar in taste did you find the cigarette compared to your usual brand?

All items will be self-rated by the participant on a seven-point scale from one (not at all) to seven (extremely).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Study power
A sample of 32 participants will be required to detect a difference in satisfaction scores between the treatments of at least 0.5 points on a 7-point scale, assuming the within-patient standard deviation of the response variable is 0.8. This estimate assumes 90% power that the study will detect a treatment difference at a two sided 5% significance level. 
Statistical analysis
Baseline characteristics will be summarised. Comparison of the primary endpoint, (change in acceptability of different treatment conditions) will be compared by means of repeated measures analysis with a mixed model. Treatment by time interaction effects will be tested. Comparisons of ratings of acceptability and satisfaction will be made using mixed model analysis. P=0.05 as cut-off for significance; 95% Cis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increasing attention has been given to the concept of very low nicotine content (VLNC) as a mean to help individuals quit smoking or reduce the harm from smoking. Although not safer than normal cigarettes, VLNC could dramatically improve public health by reducing the prevalence of smoking if they assist people to quit smoking. The viability of VLNC as a smoking cessation strategy hinges in part on their acceptability and the willingness of smokers to use them. Although our RELIQ trial found that users reduced their total number of cigarettes smoked, smoking satisfaction appeared low, with smokers disliking the taste of the VLNC. Since the publication of the RELIQ trial, a new type of VLNC cigarettes has become available, one with a charcoal filter that tobacco companies claim are far more acceptable to consumers than previous products, and therefore more likely to be used as part of an attempt to quit tobacco altogether.  To assess the acceptability, psychological reward, craving reduction, and physical and sensory effects experienced when smoking a newly developed brand of Very Low Nicotine Cigarette (VLNC; MAGIC 0), in comparison to smoking a previously developed brand VLNC (MAGIC). </summary>
