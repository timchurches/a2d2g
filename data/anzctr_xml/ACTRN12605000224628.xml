  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will be a clinical trial of exercise for children with haemophilia. The treatment group will receive a general exercise program (aerobic exercise and resistance training) lasting 12 weeks. The effects of the control and exercise treatments will be measured at the beginning and end of the exercise program.</interventions>
    <comparator> In this study the control group will receive usual care.</comparator>
