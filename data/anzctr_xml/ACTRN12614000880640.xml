  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will attend two intervention sessions in random order, one will be an experimental session where they will receive chiropractic care, and the other will be a control session where they will receive no adjustments but will be repositioned as if the chiropractor was going to adjust their spine (i.e. cervical, thoracic and lumbar adjustment setups). This will act as a physiological control for time, as well as the vestibular, cutaneous and muscular afferent discharge changes involved in moving and touching the subject when preparing for the adjustments. Care will be taken to ensure no forces are applied to individual segments during the control intervention. Full spine adjustments will be carried out during the experimental session. The entire spine and sacroiliac joints will be assessed for vertebral subluxations and adjusted where deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor with at least ten years clinical experience. Each intervention session will take approximately 1 hour and there will be a minimum 1 week washout period between each session.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention will consist of passive and active movements of the subjects head, spine and body that will be carried out by the same chiropractor who pre-checks the participants for vertebral subluxations and who performs the adjustments in the experimental intervention session. This control intervention will involve the participants being moved into the adjustment setup positions where the chiropractor would normally apply a thrust to the spine to achieve the adjustments. However, the experimenter will be particularly careful not to put pressure on any individual spinal segments. Loading a joint, as is done prior to spinal adjustments has been shown to alter paraspinal proprioceptive firing in anesthetised cats (Pickar &amp; Wheeler, 2001), and will therefore be carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to end-range-of-motion when passively moving the participants.  No spinal adjustments will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is not intended to act as a sham adjustment but to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that will occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a patient for an adjustment. It also acts as a control for the effects of the stimulation necessary to collect the dependent measures of the study, and acts as a control for the time required to carry out the adjustment intervention.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low back pain (LBP) is a major health problem that affects up to 90% of people during their lifetime (Darlow et al.,
2014). Approximately one third of individuals will suffer recurrent episodes of low back pain that require treatment
after becoming pain free and apparently returning to full function (Wasiak, Kim, &amp; Pransky, 2006). It is unclear why
some people develop recurrent low back pain while others dont (MacDonald, Moseley, &amp; Hodges, 2009). Recently
evidence has been accumulating that suggests that recurrent low back pain may be due to a change in neural
control of the muscles of the trunk (Cholewicki et al., 2005; MacDonald et al., 2009). Proper function of the spinal
muscles is critical for spinal motion and stability and spinal health (MacDonald et al., 2009). It is therefore not
surprising that changes in spinal muscle control have been observed in individuals suffering from chronic LBP and
sciatica and they are even present in sufferers of recurrent LBP between episodes of pain (MacDonald et al., 2009).
These alterations in motor control that are associated with LBP include delayed onset of muscle activation during
postural perturbations (delayed feed forward activation) (MacDonald et al., 2009) and delayed muscle reflex latency
following force release in different directions of trunk movement (Cholewicki et al., 2005). Recent evidence
suggests that chiropractic care alters the neural control of spinal muscles and may have a beneficial effect on reflex
activity that is associated with LBP (Haavik &amp; Murphy, 2012; Marshall &amp; Murphy, 2006). The purpose of this study is
to investigate whether a single session of chiropractic care alters trunk muscle activity that is associated with LBP in
people with recurrent LBP who are in remission at the time of the study.</summary>
