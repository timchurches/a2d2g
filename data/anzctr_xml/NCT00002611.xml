Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy.

Active Comparator: Stratum 7 - Stages I-IV clear cell sarcoma): After conventional surgery (nephrectomy), patients receive vincristine sulfate VCR IV weekly on weeks 1, 2, 4-8, 10-13, 18, and 24; cyclophosphamide sulfate (CTX) IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 and on days 1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV (beginning after CTX infusion) weekly on weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and etoposide (VP-16) IV over 1 hour (beginning after CTX infusion) on days 1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also undergo abdominal radiotherapy and whole lung radiotherapy (if pulmonary metastases are present).

Active Comparator: Stratum 8 - Stages II-IV DA Wilms' tumor: After conventional surgery (nephrectomy), Patients receive treatment as in stratum 7 (patients receive vincristine sulfate VCR IV weekly on weeks 1, 2, 4-8, 10-13, 18, and 24; cyclophosphamide sulfate (CTX) IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 and on days 1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV (beginning after CTX infusion) weekly on weeks 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24; and etoposide (VP-16) IV over 1 hour (beginning after CTX infusion) on days 1-5 of weeks 3, 9, 15, and 21. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours after completion of chemotherapy and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also undergo abdominal radiotherapy and whole lung radiotherapy (if pulmonary metastases are present).

Active Comparator: Stratum 9 - Stages I-IV rhabdoid tumor: After conventional surgery (nephrectomy), patients receive carboplatin IV on days 1-2 and VP-16 IV over 1 hour (beginning after carboplatin infusion) on days 1-3 of weeks 0, 3, 9, 12, 18, and 21 and CTX IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 6, 15, and 24. Filgrastim G-CSF is administered as on stratum 7. Patients also undergo radiation therapy. After completion of chemotherapy, patients undergo second-look conventional surgery (laparotomy) and conventional surgery (partial nephrectomy or wedge excision if feasible). After conventional surgery (second-look surgery), patients without persistent or residual disease resume chemotherapy.

Source and Pharmacology: An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius. Binds to DNA and inhibits nucleic acid synthesis, with its major lethal effect occurring during the S phase of the cell cycle. Has some topoisomerase II inhibitory activity. Since it is primarily excreted by the liver, any liver impairment may enhance toxicity. 40% to 50% is excreted in the bile; &lt;5% in the urine. The drug has a very short initial t½ of &lt;20 minutes and a terminal t½ of 17 hours. Animal studies indicate cytotoxic levels persist in tissue for as long as 24 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It
      is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy alone or combination chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy is more effective for childhood kidney cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy with or
      without radiation therapy in treating children who have kidney cancer.</summary>
