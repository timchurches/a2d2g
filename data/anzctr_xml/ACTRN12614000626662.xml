  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women randomised to the intervention arm will undergo a single endometrial pipelle biopsy performed between day 4 of the natural menstrual cycle preceding their embryo transfer cycle and day 3 of the menstrual cycle in which embryo transfer is planned </interventions>

      <outcome>Adverse events - including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, pain or bleeding following the procedure, infection etc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Bleeding and pain: on the day of the procedure or the following day
Infection: for 1 month following the procedure
Ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage: up to 20 weeks following pregnancy </timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Have had any disruptive instrumentation within the uterine cavity (e.g. hysteroscopy, hysterosalpingogram, laparoscopy, surgically managed miscarriage or endometrial biopsy) within three months prior to day one of the planned embryo transfer cycle, or planning to undergo a procedure involving disruptive instrumentation at any stage during the study. Embryo transfer and intrauterine insemination procedures are not considered to cause disruptive instrumentation

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A number of studies have been published which appear to show that performing an endometrial biopsy results in an increase in pregnancy and live birth rates.
 
Most of the studies have been conducted in a focussed subgroup of women, such as those with recurrent implantation failure, and there is little data available on the utility of endometrial biopsy prior to frozen-thaw embryo transfer.

To address these limitations, PIP-IVF is a pragmatic randomised trial recruiting all women undergoing autologous embryo transfer, and has been powered to allow detection of subgroup effects such women undergoing their first IVF cycle and women undergoing frozen-thaw transfers.</summary>
