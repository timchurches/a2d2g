  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) The intervention was supervised exercise added to the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP-Ex). See point two below for a description of the CDSMP.
Frequency - 1 session per week, held in the same week as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program .
Intensity -  the intensity of exercise was determined by using the modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, aiming for a minimum of moderate intensity (RPE = 3) and not exceeding a strong intensity (RPE = 5). 
Time (duration of exercise session) - 1 hour
Type - This general guideline was adjusted according to individual needs:
  5 minutes of warm-up exercises
  30 minutes of aerobic exercise (bicycle , treadmill, corridor  walking, bicycle arm pedals)
  5 minutes of stretching exercise (upper limb, lower limb, and trunk)
  10 minutes of strengthening exercise (upper limb, lower limb, trunk with free weights, pulleys, steps, elastic bands, or fit ball)
  5 minutes of cool-down exercises.
Mode - Participants attended in a group, with each individual progressing according to their response to exercise. Exercise sessions were supervised by a trained physiotherapy assistant, with the physiotherapist readily available for consultation if needed.

(2) The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program  is a highly structured group-based 6-week workshop with sessions of 2Â½ hours duration offered once per week and facilitated by pairs of trained leaders.The leaders may be peers (others with a chronic condition) or health professionals who have undertaken 24 hours of training. It offers generic education about health-related behaviours: symptom management (anger, fear, frustration, depression, shortness of breath, fatigue, pain); breathing exercises; muscle relaxation; endurance exercise; cognitive symptom management; communication skills; advance directives for health care; working with and informing the healthcare team; medication usage and healthy eating. The CDSMP aims to facilitate the development of self-management self-efficacy (akin to confidence) through guided feedback sessions, problem-solving and completing action plans to achieve participant-defined goals. There is no supervised exercise component.</interventions>

Do you exercise regularly according to the definition below? Y/N 
Regular Exercise is any planned physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, aerobics, bicycling, swimming, line-dancing, tennis, doing formal exercises etc.) performed to increase or maintain health and physical fitness. Such exercise should be performed on all or at least 5 days of the week to accumulate 30 minutes or more per day. Exercise does not have to be painful to be effective but should be done at a moderate level that increases your breathing rate and makes you feel warmer.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Recruitment to the programme was by referral from general practitioners, specialist practitioners, or in-hospital referrals from medical practitioners, allied health or nursing staff.
Allocation concealment was by opaque sealed envelopes as described below.</concealment>
    <sequence>The confines of the gym meant that the numbers randomised to the exercise intervention were confined to up to seven participants at a time. Therefore consecutive random numbers were used and the following process implemented.
If, during randomisation, the limit of seven was reached in one group, all other participants had to be allocated to the other group. The allocation was kept in separate opaque sealed envelopes until participants had completed the 6-minute walk test and pre-assessment questionnaires. Following this, a volunteer participant randomly selected one of the sealed envelopes, nominating CDSMP-EX or CDSMP-Only, similar to tossing a coin. In this way the two groups named in the envelopes were randomly allocated to the intervention or control groups. The investigator was blinded to the study allocation until participants were informed.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is a prospective study of the CDSMP, with or without a supervised exercise component, in the Royal Hobart Hospital outpatient area for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary diesase.  The research will use a mixed methodology of quantitative and qualitative outcome measures: physical activity, shortness of breath, health-related quality of life, stage of change for physical activity, self-efficacy for physical activity in the presence of deterrents and narratives of the lived experience of the participants themselves.</summary>
