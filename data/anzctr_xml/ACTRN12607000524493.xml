  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Stroke is one of the most important causes of mortality, hospitalization and disabilities in the developed populations. The general aim of this study was to value the acting of the physiotherapy, connecting it with the time of admission of patients who have had an Stroke, admitted in the Hospital Governor Celso Ramos of Florianópolis, in the period of July of 2004 to July of 2005. The data were collected in the service of medical archive, where 180 handbooks were found. The incidence of the pathology was also checked, type of Stroke, main sequel, number of physiotherapy sessions, time of admission of the patients and secondary pathology. As result one pointed out that the Stroke Ischaemic was present in 81,03 % of the cases, the hemiparesis was one of the most important sequel (25 % of the patients), 15,51 % of this patients received 06 physiotherapy sessions, the majority of the patients (45,69 %) had been admitted in hospital from 6 to 10 days. The systemic arterial high blood pressure was the commoner secondary pathology (25,86 %). The obtained data agree with other researches, besides that, the acting of the physiotherapy signs influence in the reduction of the time of admission of patients with Stroke, although through the collected data was possible to notice that patients which did not receive physiotherapy intervention, remained on average 16 days of admission, whereas the patients who received service remained on average eighty days.</summary>
