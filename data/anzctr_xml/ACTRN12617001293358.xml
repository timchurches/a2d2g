  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will include multiple components.  Coordinated care and management by a registered nurse with at least 2 years experience in hepatology will be provided to patients randomised to the intervention group.  This will include a home visit (within one week of discharge from hospital) of varying duration (it is expected that the assessment will take around 1 hour), weekly telephone reviews for 3 months (from 5-30 minutes depending on the symptoms for review), reminders prior to appointments, planned admissions for paracentesis, and close biochemistry monitoring, protocol driven diuretic titration and extensive education,  Content of the contact will include monitoring and management of signs and symptoms, medication review, education and self-management advice, care coordination and education and involvement of family.  There will be enhanced communication with GPs post discharge and ensure that assessment by a hepatologist occurs within 1 month of discharge from hospital.  After 3 months, contact will reduce depending on stability and symptoms.  An individualised care plan will be developed signed off by the specialist and communicated to the GP.  The intervention will continue until the study end which will be 24 months from the first patient randomised.  As recruitment will stop 12 months from first randomisation, the maximum intervention is 24 months and the minimum is 12 months.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control group will continue hospital and out of hospital management via usual care processes.  They will have usual access to hepatologists and GPs. Usual care patients will have no contact with Chronic Liver Failure Nurses until a final end of study interview.  Surveys will be mailed 3-monthly to the control group during the trial.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergency liver-related hospital admission rates - patient case notes and hospital databases will be searched to record emergency attendances and admissions and whether they were Liver-related and how many days were spent in ICCU.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Admissions will be collected at 12 months and at the end of the trial (24 months post trial commencement date/recruitment start).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incremental cost effectiveness and quality of life assessed using the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ5D5L) questionnaire and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The surveys for QOL will be administered at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and then 6 monthly until end of trial (24 months post trial commencement date/recruitment start).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease severity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Disease severity will be assessed using the Child Pugh and MELD score at baseline, 3 months, 6 months then 6-monthly until end of study (24 months post trial commencement date/recruitment start).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Care - adherence to hepatology protocols will be assessed using locally developed data collection tools assessing specific protocol outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adherence to protocols will be assessed at baseline for the intervention group and at study end (24 months post trial commencement date/recruitment start) for both groups.  Assessment at baseline will determine for the intervention group what activities need to be conducted in order to meet protocols (ie have they had an ultrasound in the last 6 months) and assist with the development of the care plan.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction will be determined with a short survey used previously in the pilot study.   A sample of usual care and intervention patients will be asked to participate in a semi-structured telephone interview to assess their experience of care.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study (24 months post trial commencement date/recruitment start).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attendance (or non-attendance) at liver-related outpatient appointments (medical, allied health, radiology, endoscopy) will be collected by auditing patient case notes and electronic systems at the hospital to record appointments.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Differences between groups for hospitalization rates, quality indicators, satisfaction rates and self-management scores will be assessed using negative binomial regression, which is appropriate for count data with evidence of over-dispersion. All models will allow adjustment for baseline values and other co-variates. Suitable transformations will be applied in the case of non-normally distributed data. 
For the economic analysis mean costs between the intervention and control groups will be compared and incremental cost effectiveness ratios presented with confidence intervals.  Cost effectiveness acceptability curves for varying threshold values of cost effectiveness will also be presented. An assessment of the sensitivity of the results obtained to variation in measured resource use, effectiveness and/or unit costs will be undertaken using appropriate one-way and multi-way sensitivity analysis. Differences between groups in quality of life scores will be assessed using mixed effects regression to account for the repeated measures (every 3 months) and subsequent within-subject correlation. Survival analysis will be performed using Cox regression with results presented as Kaplan-Meir survival curves.
