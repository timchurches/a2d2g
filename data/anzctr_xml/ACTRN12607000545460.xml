  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose in this clinical study was to evaluate the effects of progesterone on functional outcome of the patients with severe head injury. 
Progesterone, a hormone, has steroidal, neuroactive and neurosteroidal action in the center neuronal system. Recently, neuroprotective effects of progesterone have been shown in a variety of animal models including ischemic and traumatic brain insults models. Post-injury administration of progesterone in head injury subjects confers significant protection against injury-induced cerebral edema and secondary neuronal death, promoting behavioral recovery.</summary>
