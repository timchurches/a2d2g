    <interventions>This research will evaluate the efficacy of a nutrition therapy with additional exercise in managing prostate cancer-related fatigue, in men treated with androgen deprivation therapy, among residents in Queensland. 

Study Design
The study is designed as a two-arm 20-week randomised controlled trial. 

Participants
All men treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or adjunctive ADT with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for longer than three months will be involved in the study. Participants will be recruited from the Mater Hospital Brisbane Queensland, The University of Queensland, Cancer Council Queensland, and the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia support groups located in Brisbane Queensland. Sample size calculations showed that a total of 116 participants are needed to detect statistically significant differences in prostate cancer-related fatigue. 

Intervention group
Participants will be invited to attend fortnightly dietetic consults with an Accredited Practicing Dietitian for 20 weeks. The diet composition is developed in accordance to evidence based literature and will encompass anti-inflammatory foods targeted to reduce metabolic parameters, and improve cancer-related fatigue. Participants will be provided individualised diet plan to follow. Dietary adherence will be monitored each fortnight through dietetic consults; of approximately 45 minutes. From weeks 12-20 participants will additionally undertake exercise sessions, which may be conducted in groups of up to four participants, three times per week. Exercise will involve 4x4 minutes at high intensity of 85-90% of heart rate peak, interspersed by 3-minute periods of recovery at a lower intensity on a bicycle ergometer at 50-70% heart rate peak. All high intensity exercise sessions will include a 10-minute warm-up and 5 min cool down. With warm-ups and cool-downs each exercise session will last approximately 40 minutes in total; conducted by an Accredited Exercise Physiologist. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group
The control group will be monitored for a period of 20 weeks usual care receiving ADT, or adjunctive ADT with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The usual care group will then be randomly allocated through a computerised program, to undertake eight weeks of moderate intensity exercise or high intensity interval training after the 20-week usual care monitoring period has finished. Moderate intensity exercise will consist of 50 minutes of cycling at a 50-70% heart rate peak on a bicycle ergometer. The high intensity exercise will involve 4x4 minutes at high intensity at 85-90% of heart rate peak, interspersed by 3-minute periods of recovery at a lower intensity of 50-70% heart rate peak on a bicycle ergometer. All exercise sessions will include a 10-minute warm-up and 5 min cool down. </comparator>

Participants from the Mater hospital will be identified by the site specific Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurse, and provided with an information sheet, consent form for the study, and contact details for the study. Participants will also be recruited by way of media releases, presentations and advertisements in newsletters, newspapers, and noticeboards at The University of Queensland, Cancer Council Queensland, and the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia support groups. All interested participants will be encouraged to email or phone primary investigator, or will be contacted by primary investigator for eligibility. All individuals interested in participating in the study, will be provided with a study information sheet for the study, then participant eligibility and trial scheduling times will be discussed. Information sheets/consent forms will be provided once eligibility is ensured. Once the participant has read, understood and signed the consent form, the first trial and baseline measurements dates will be agreed upon. Randomisation will take place after completion of baseline testing, using a computerised random sequencing generator, by a person external from the primary and co-investigators at the University of Queensland.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Combined diet and exercise interventions, with cancer-related fatigue as the primary outcome are relatively limited. One diet and exercise intervention in men treated with ADT showed cancer-related fatigue (FACT-F) scores increase of 3.7  14.2 (CI, 95%; adjusted mean 8.9 points). Assuming the group was normally distributed with a SD of 8.9, and the true difference in the experimental and control arms were 5.2, we would need 47 experimental and control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis, with a probability (power) of 0.8. The type 1 error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. With a 20% attrition rate, to maintain statistical significance in sample size calculation, we would need 58 experimental and control group subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis.

Data will be analysed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 20.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Analyses will include standard descriptive statistics, t tests, correlation, regression and two-way repeated measures ANOVA or the comparable non-parametric test as necessary to examine differences between and within groups, from baseline, week 8, 12, 20, 24 and 28.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of nutrition therapy with additional high intensity interval training in improving cancer-related fatigue and quality of life in men with prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy. 

Who is it for? 
Men aged 18 years or over who have prostate cancer and are currently being treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), for longer than 3 months. 

Study details 
Research has found that men with prostate cancer treated with ADT have a high prevalence of cancer-related fatigue, which affects quality of life during and after treatment. Whilst the benefits of both dietary modification and exercise prescription have been well described in prostate cancer prevention and progression, little is known about the influence of nutrition therapy and high intensity exercise on cancer-related fatigue in men with prostate cancer during or after ADT treatment. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of nutrition therapy and high intensity exercise in prostate cancer-related fatigue. 

All participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of the two groups. Participants in one group will be invited to attend fortnightly 45 min long dietetic consults with an Accredited Practicing Dietitian for 20 weeks and to undertake high intensity interval training sessions, 3 times per week, in weeks 12-20. Participants in the second group will receive usual care monitoring followed by moderate or high intensity interval training, 3 times per week, for eight weeks after usual care has finished. The usual care group will continue to be treated with ADT, or adjunctive ADT with chemotherapy/radiotherapy for the study duration. 


Throughout the study, participants will be asked to answer questionnaires on prostate cancer-related fatigue and quality of life as well as have blood samples taken and perform some physical function tests. It is hoped that this study will help assist in alleviating cancer-related fatigue, and improving quality of life for men with prostate cancer treated with ADT.
