  <interventions>
    <interventions>Gradual vs. immediate removal of orthosis at time of clinical union when orthosis ready to be removed. Gradual removal of orthosis is instruction to wear  the orthosis out of the house or when performing vulnerable activities (eg playing with grandchildren, doing home duties) and remove it when at home and overnight as pain permits.  Patients will be encouraged to increase time out of orthosis by 2 hours each day until complete withdrawal by up to 2 weeks.  This was the protocol surveyed by The Alfred trauma surgeons to be the most common used. Patient will record daily usage via diary.
The immediate removal of orthosis  group will have orthosis removed immediately at time of clinical union and they will be given strategies to reduce pain.</interventions>
    <comparator>Gradual vs. immediate removal of orthosis as outlined above. Control group is the group that are randomised to immediate removal of orthosis. The difference is timing comparison where immediate removal of orthosis at time of clinical union is compared to gradual removal which will be the documented hours over 2 weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>All eligible patients will be recruited by a research nurse after diagnosis of clinical union of injury. A research nurse shall explain trial and seek informed written consent from the patient. Once consent is obtained, the independent examination (independent examiner) shall take place prior to randomisation being allocated via concealed method with usage of opaque envelopes (research nurse).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by computer generated block randomisation and placed in opaque envelopes. Allocation will be concealed until informed consent is obtained and baseline assessment completed. Randomisation will occur either into protocol A(immediate removal of orthosis) or protocol B (gradual removal of orthosis)</sequence>
