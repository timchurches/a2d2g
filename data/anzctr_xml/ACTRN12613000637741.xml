    <interventions> The E.A.S.Y. Minds Program involves the integration of PA  in the Primary school curriculum. The Classroom Teacher will be primarily responsible for the delivery of the program during normal lessons.  The program will run for 6 weeks.E.A.S.Y. Minds will involve the modification of a stage 3 unit of work that will be developed from the NSW Board of Studies k-6 syllabi to maximise and create opportunities to integrate physical activity and enhance learning. Teaching ideas  and resources will be supplied by the research team. Following the randomisation of the participant schools all baseline assessments will be undertaken. Two professional development days will be carried out prior to the research project. All costs will be met by the University of Newcastle. These days will focus on the key principles of teaching of movement-based learning activities. Control schools will receive this workshop on the completion of the program. All schools will provided with all lesson plans and a physical activity equipment pack containing all teaching resources (balls, drill ladders, stop watches, tape measures.The project will use a group randomised control trial. Schools will be randomly allocated to intervention or comparison groups for the study duration. Students and teachers in the control group will be provided all program information and resources following the collection of post-test data.

The following research methodologies will be used:

Height and Weight: height will be measured using a portable stadiometer and weight will be measured using calibrated weight scales.

Learning Styles: will be measured using the Barsch Learning Style Reference Form (Barsch, 1991).From this, an indication of students preferred perceptual modality will be determined. Students intelligence strengths will be assessed using a Multiple Intelligences Checklist for Upper Primary and Secondary (MICUPS) (Mcgrath and Noble, 2005)

On task behaviour: will be observed using a momentary time sampling procedure adapted from Behaviour Observation of students in Schools and Applied Behaviour Analysis for Teachers (Alberyo and Troutman) Students will be chosen at random and will be observed in 15 second intervals over a 30 minute period pre, during and post intervention 

Physical activity (PA): Accelerometers will be used to provide an objective measure of both PA intensity and duration. Accelerometers are light instruments, small and robust that measure physical activity ( Freedson, Prober &amp; Janz, 2005) Accelerometers will be worn throughout the school day.

Academic performance: Academic performance in Mathematics will be measured using an ACER Progressive Achievement test in Mathematics delivered by the classroom teacher.

Enjoyment of Maths Survey:   Students enjoyment of maths will be evaluated using a validated mathematics attitude scale.

Evaluation: All teachers and Students will be asked to complete an evaluation survey at the completion of the program.

    <concealment>The researcher will invite 8 schools of similar size from a variety of demographic locations, all within 60 minutesâ€™ drive from The University of Newcastle, Callaghan Campus; The 8 schools will all be from the public sector.  The research team will then randomly assign four schools to control and four schools to the intervention group.
The Classroom Teacher will be primarily responsible for the delivery of the program during normal lessons. E.A.S.Y. Minds will involve the modification of a stage 3 unit of work that will be developed from the NSW Board of Studies k-6 syllabi to maximise and create opportunities to integrate physical activity and enhance learning.

All  schools will provided with all lesson plans and a physical activity equipment pack containing all teaching resources (balls, drill ladders, stop watches, tape measures).
Allocation concealment will be  carried out by an independent researcher using a simple computer algorithm. </concealment>
    <sequence>A simple computer algorithm allocation will be conducted to allocate schools to either control or the treatment conditions. This method will ensure all schools have an equal liklehood of allocation to control or intervention.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data  obtained via accelerometers will be analysed using meterplus software and  Comparisons of the intervention and control groups will be made using the data from the pre -test and post- test assessments. Using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Data analysis will explore preliminary associations between key variables using bivariate correlations. To determine the treatment effect of E.A.S.Y. Minds analysis of co-variance will be used.
We are planning a study of a continuous response variable from independent control and experimental subjects with 1 control(s) per experimental subject.  In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 250.  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 100, we will need to study 132 experimental subjects and 132 control subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.9.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To produce an evidenced based physical activity intervention for classroom teachers that will integrate PA across the primary school curriculum as highlighted in the Auditor Generals Report June 2012. The Easy Minds intervention has run a successful feasibility trial that demonstrated that integrating PA into other subjects can lead to: Increased moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) within both the intervention session and the school day, reduce sitting time and improve classroom behaviour.</summary>
