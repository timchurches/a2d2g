  <interventions>
    <interventions>The drug being studied is called RO5310074, and it is administered intravenously (into a vein in the arm).
It is being studied for it's effectiveness in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
a) There are 3 dose groups (0.5 mg/Kg, 1.4 mg/Kg and 4.5 mg/Kg).
b) Doses will be administered every 2 weeks.
c) Each group will receive 6 infusions. (There will be a total of 12 weeks where study drug is administered; however, the total study duration is 29 weeks. The rest of the time will consist of the initial screening and post drug out-patient follow up visits).
There will be a minimum of 2 weeks between each infusion to allow for safety and tollerability assessments.
Only 1 dose group will be dosed at a time, once safety and tollerability are assessed and it is deemed safe to continue, the next dose group will be dosed.
d) The total amount of drug (dependant on patient weight) will be diluted in a 500mL bag of 0.9% saline (Sodium Chloride-NaCl) and infused over 1 hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Each patient that enters will have roughly a %28 percent chance of receiving non-active drug (placebo).
The active drug will be administered in the same fashion as the placebo to maintain blinding.
a) The placebo will be normal saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride-NaCl)
b) The placebo will be infused every 2 weeks (6 infusions in total). There will be a total of 12 weeks where placebo is administered; however, the total study duration is 29 weeks. The rest of the time will consist of the initial screening and post placebo out-patient follow up visits.
c) The placebo will be a 500mL bag of 0.9% saline, and administered over 1 hour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety and tollerability of multiple doses of RO5130074 in patients with psoriatic arthirtis.
The safety and tollerability will be assessed at every dosing visit with blood/urine tests, a physical exam (including a disease activity assessment), vital signs taken pre/during/post dosing, Electrocardiogram (ECG), an assessment of 66 joints for swelling and 68 joints for tenderness, and a series of questionnaires to be completed by the patient (patient's assessment of pain and disease activity, and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and one to be completed by the physician (physician's assessment of disease activity).</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are 3 dose groups, and within each dose group, there will be 6 infusions given.
Safety and tollerbility will be assessed after every dose (every 2 weeks-there must be a minimum of 2 weeks between doses to assess the safety and tolerability).
This will be measured by vital signs, an ECG, a phisical exam and a urine test done on the day a dose is given (from 0-3 hours pre-dose). Vital signs will be taken 15 minutes pre-dose, 45 minutes into the dose and 1.25hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24hr, 48hr, and 72hr post dose. Blood samples will also be taken 3 hr pre-dose, and 1.25hr, 6 hr, 12hr, 24hr, 48hr, and 72 hr post dose.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of RO5130074 (to see where the drug goes within the body and how the body metabolizes it).
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be assessed via blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>There are 3 dose groups, and within each dose group, there will be 6 infusions given.
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics will be assessed via blood samples taken at multiple times through out the study (3 hrs pre dose and 1.25, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs post dose).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eliglible patients will already have been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Providing patients meet most of the eligibility criteria, their specialist will approach them regarding the study. Patients will be given information and the informed consent form and will be asked to take this home and discuss it with who ever they choose.
If patients are happy to participate, they will be brought back to see the specialist who will sign the consent form with them, and then the patient can be screened.
The site staff will call an interactive voice response system called IVRS. The patient who will be screened will be entered into the system (date of birth, gender, initials). This IVRS system will randomly assign them (like flipping a coin) to a treatment group and will also assign them a study number. This information will be faxed and/or emailed to the site staff that logged the call. This IVRS system will also allocate the specified drug vials to be administered to the patient.
The site staff will not know the exact dose (or active drug versus placebo) that the patient is being given, they will however know which vials to select for treatment.
The sponsor will have full access to the exact treatment given to each patient.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once all screening procedures have been completed and results obtained, the information is put into an automated system which will assign the patient a number and will randomly assign them (like flipping a coin) to a treatment or placebo group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a type of inflammatory arthritis that presents with erosive joint disease (which may lead to joint deformity) and a psoriasis rash on the skin.
It is considered an auto-immune disease which means that the person's own immune system is responsible for the disease.
Within the blood of patients with PsA, there are lots of proteins called Inter-Leukin-17 (IL-17). These are inflammatory messengers, which cause inflammation. These messengers tell the body that the inflammation process should occur.
RO5130074 is an anti-body against IL-17 messangers. It is also a protein, and it binds to IL-17 making it inactive, and therefore stopping the inflammation process.
This study will aim to look at the safety and how well RO5130074 is tolerated in the body of patients with PsA.
Nonclinical data supporting IV administration of RO5310074 to humans were obtained from one single-dose and two repeated-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys.
RO5310074 was previously tested clinically in the Roche study PP22712 (a single assending dose study), to assess the safety and tollerability in healthy patients.
All doses were well tolerated, with no drug-related, clinically significant adverse events (AEs) reported.</summary>
