  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is intended to be a 12-week randomized control trial in older adults &gt;60 years. After a 1-week run-in period, participants will be randomly allocated to receive either:

1.	A 12 week prescribed and individualized energy restricted diet to promote weight loss involving high carotenoid fruits and vegetables and extra-virgin olive oil; OR
2.	A 12 week prescribed and individualized energy restricted diet to promote weight loss and low carotenoid fruits and vegetables, without extra-virgin olive oil
 
During the one week run-in period (occurring after baseline) participants will be instructed to consume 100% of their habitual dietary intake before commencing the diet.

The intervention diets are isocaloric (matched for energy and macronutrient distribution) with energy intake restricted by 30% of estimated requirements using the Mifflin equation. Diets are presented in the form of a checklist and are designed using energy bands ranging from 5000-8000KJ. Depending on the energy restriction, participants will be required to consume 225-375g high or low carotenoid vegetables per day. Specific examples of high carotenoid vegetables include, orange, red or yellow fruits and vegetables in addition to dark green leafy vegetables.

Despite the two diets being matched for energy and macronutrient distribution, the composition of dietary fat will differ. Participants randomized to receive high carotenoid fruits and vegetables will also be prescribed olive oil. Prescription of the oil will depend on the energy restriction, however this will range from 40-70ml per day. Participants randomized to receive low carotenoid fruits and vegetables will be prescribed an alternative oil (Rice Bran or Canola oil).  

Irrespective of which group participants are allocated, all participants will receive a fortnightly fruit and vegetable hamper that reflects the types of fruits and vegetables they are required to consume. Participants randomized to the high-carotenoid fruits and vegetables, plus extra-virgin olive oil group will receive the olive oil throughout the duration of the study. All other food(s) allocated in the diet is o be provided by the participant.    

Throughout the 12-week intervention, participants will receive fortnightly (individual) dietary counselling sessions by an Accredited Practising Dietitian (APD). Each of these sessions will run for approximately 30 minutes in duration and will be used to assess compliance of the dietary protocol. During each session, the dietary protocol will be adjusted (scaled up or down) whenever required, depending on the rate of weight loss and/or weight maintenance.

    <statisticalmethods>Previous literature has reported that exercise significantly attenuates the loss of FMM in older obese adults when placed on an energy-restricted diet (exercise + weight loss: 1.8 +/- 1.5; weight loss only: 3.5 +/- 2.1 kg; P = 0.02). Therefore, a sample size of n = 24 per group is expected to achieve this difference at 12 weeks at 80% statistical power and a significance level set at a=0.05. Assuming an attrition rate of ~20%, a total of n = 60 participants will be recruited (n = 30 per group).

All statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS. Unless otherwise stated, all descriptive statistics will be expressed as means and standard deviations. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to determine significant differences for all mean outcome measures between the two groups. Independent samples t-test will be used to determine differences for all outcome measures between the two groups at week 12. Dietary adherence will be assessed using dietary intake checklists with adherence presented as a percentage. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sarcopenic obesity is associated with an increased risk of frailty and loss of independence with advanced age. Management of sarcopenic obesity presents a complex challenge when prescribing dietary interventions; a conundrum is the potential harmful effects of energy restricted diets on the loss of skeletal muscle mass and the potential exacerbation of sarcopenia and associated functional decline. There is observational evidence supporting that higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and olive oil is inversely associated with muscle strength, physical performance and disability. 

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of diet induced weight loss on lean tissue mass in older overweight and obese adults. Moreover we aim to investigate the independent and combined effects of diet induced weight loss and carotenoid-rich fruit and vegetables plus extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on body composition, muscle strength, physical performance, physical activity and quality of life in overweight and obese older adults.
