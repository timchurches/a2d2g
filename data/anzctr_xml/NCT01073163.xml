  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in QT Interval as Corrected by the Fridericia Method (QTcF) at End of Infusion - On Day 2 of Cycle 1, three electrocardiograms (ECGs) were collected 15 minutes prior to any study drug administration. The baseline ECG interval value was obtained by averaging these 3 ECGs, and was compared to the average of the 3 ECGs taken on treatment with bendamustine at the end of the infusion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): 15 minutes prior to bendamustine infusion. Postinfusion ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): at the end of the 30-minute infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean Change From Baseline in QTcF at 1 Hour Postinfusion - On Day 2 of Cycle 1, three ECGs were collected 15 minutes prior to any study drug administration. The baseline ECG interval value was obtained by averaging these 3 ECGs, and was compared to the average of the 3 ECGs taken on treatment with bendamustine 1 hour postinfusion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): 15 minutes prior to bendamustine infusion. Postinfusion ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): 1 hour postinfusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With QTcF New Outlier Events at End of Infusion and 1 Hour Postinfusion - Participants were considered to have an outlier ECG value based on the most extreme value across each of the time points. "New" means not present at baseline and becomes present on at least 1 on-treatment ECG time point. A participant had a new outlier event (500) if the maximum QTcF was &gt;500 ms while their baseline was &lt;=500 ms, or had an outlier event (480) if the maximum QTcF was &gt;480 ms while their baseline was &lt;= 480 ms. QTcF in the 30-60 ms or &gt;60 ms categories were also considered outliers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): 15 minutes prior to bendamustine infusion. Postinfusion ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): at the end of the 30-minute infusion and 1 hour postinfusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With New Onset ECG Waveform Morphological Changes - The core ECG laboratory cardiologist assessed all leads in the ECGs and defined morphological changes. Changes from baseline (looking at each of the 3 ECGs at Day 2 Cycle 1 individually and the ECGs at all on-treatment time points individually) were noted for the following events: atrial fibrillation or flutter; second degree heart block; third degree heart block; complete right bundle branch block; complete left bundle branch block; ST segment depression; T wave abnormalities (negative T waves only); myocardial infarction pattern; any new abnormal U waves.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): 15 minutes prior to bendamustine infusion. Postinfusion ECGs (Day 2 of Cycle 1): at the end of the 30-minute infusion and 1 hour postinfusion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>

Participants may have reported more than 1 event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events were collected throughout the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The median number of 28-day cycles was 6.0. The median duration of the treatment period was 143 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in QTcF at Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of Bendamustine and Its Metabolites (M3 and M4) - Results from a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to show the relationship of the overall predicted change from Baseline in QTcF at the average Cmax of bendamustine and its metabolites M3 and M4.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Model-predicted Bayesian Bendamustine Clearance in the Presence of Rituximab - Boxplots of model-predicted Bayesian bendamustine clearance (CL) values in the presence of rituximab were generated based on the administered bendamustine doses, rate of infusion, and sample times.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 1 of Cycle 1: prior to start of bendamustine infusion, immediately postinfusion, 15 minutes and 30 minutes postinfusion. Day 2 of Cycle 1: 15 minutes prior to start of bendamustine infusion, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1, 3, and 5 hours postinfusion.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overview of Adverse Events - Adverse event (AE)=any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered study drug that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Treatment-related AEs=those that began or worsened after treatment with study drug. AE severity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (grade 1=mild, grade 2=moderate, grade 3=severe, grade 4=life-threatening, grade 5= death). Relationship of an AE to study drug was categorized as definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or not related. Serious AE (SAE)=one that occurred at any dose that resulted in any of the following outcomes or actions: death; a life-threatening adverse event; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; a persistent or significant disability/incapacity; a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or an otherwise important medical event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events were collected throughout the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The median number of 28-day cycles was 6.0. The median duration of the treatment period was 143 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status at Endpoint - The investigator assessed each patient's ECOG performance status according to the ECOG scale at screening, on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, and at the end-of-treatment visit. Scale scores were: 0=fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction; 1=restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature; 2=ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work activities. Up and about more than 50% of waking hours; 3=capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of waking hours; 4=completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self-care. Totally confined to bed or chair; 5=dead. Any change in score to a higher value signifies worsening, and any change to a lower value signifies improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study. The median number of 28-day cycles was 6.0. The median duration of the treatment period was 143 days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Worst Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 Grades for Hematology Laboratory Tests Results Overall - Grade 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe/medically significant, 4=Life-threatening. Overall is defined as the worst postbaseline grade value for each patient and laboratory test across all cycles. Only postbaseline grades are summarized. If absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and neutrophils absolute (ABS) were both measured, the worse grade value from the two was summarized. Otherwise the worst ANC grade value or the worst neutrophils ABS grade value was summarized. WBC=white blood cell; LLN=lower limit of normal</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events were collected throughout the study and up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The median number of 28-day cycles was 6.0. The median duration of the treatment period was 143 days.</timepoint>
