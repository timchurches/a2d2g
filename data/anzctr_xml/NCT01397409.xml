  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Highest Tolerated Dose (HTD) of AGN-150998 - Stage 1 evaluated the safety of a single intravitreal injection of AGN-150998 with doses ranging from 1.0 to 4.2 mg.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 Weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 1: Change From Baseline in Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) in the Study Eye - CRT was assessed using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), a non-invasive diagnostic system providing high-resolution imaging sections of the retina. SD-OCT was performed in the study eye after pupil dilation. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 4</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 2: Time Between Baseline Treatment and Recurrence of Active Disease - Recurrence of Active Disease was based on Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), Central Retinal Thickness (CRT) values as evaluated by the Central Reading Center (CRC) and the investigator assessments of haemorrhage.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 3: Change From Baseline in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stage 2: Time Between Second Treatment and Recurrence of Active Disease - Recurrence of active disease is defined as the time in days to escape to standard of care. Time is calculated as (date of Escaping to Standard of Care/Censoring minus the date of the Second Injection) +1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>32 Weeks</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is conducted in 3 stages. Stage 1 is an open-label, dose-escalation assessment of
      the safety of AGN-150998 administered as a single intravitreal injection to patients with
      advanced exudative Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Stage 2 and Stage 3 are
      randomized, double-masked, comparisons of the safety and treatment effects on retinal edema
      and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of AGN-150998 and ranibizumab in treatment-naive
      patients with exudative AMD. Study medication is administered as needed in Stage 2 and with a
      fixed-dosing schedule in Stage 3. The study objectives are (1) to identify the highest
      tolerated dose of AGN-150998, (2) to assess the safety and duration of treatment effects on
      retinal edema and BCVA, and (3) to characterize the systemic pharmacokinetic profile of
      AGN-150998.</summary>
