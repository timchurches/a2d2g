    <interventions>Activity pacing has been defined as the regulation of activity.  For the purpose of this research, activity pacing will be operationalized as seven activity pacing techniques which include - 
1.	Use self-monitoring to listening to your body
2.	Use short regular rests during the day and during activities 
3.	Find a sustainable baseline and then gradually increase activity
4.	Break tasks into manageable parts
5.	Plan tasks and set goals
6.	Alternate high energy tasks with low energy tasks
7.	Prioritise tasks and delegate where able
Occupational therapy with activity pacing will include-
a. An occupational performance review and the establishment of occupational performance goals-involves the standard occupational therapy initial assessment where a patients past and current occupational performance (personal, domestic and community) is reviewed and goals are determined to enable the patient to return to their home environment and participate in their previous lifestyle (30 mins at admission to the hospital)
b.  Occupational therapy interventions to achieve goals as directed by the treating occupational therapist- will be variable depending on the goals of the patient but could include occupational therapy assessment and interventions (facilitating the occupation/person/environment balance, education, service provision, equipment prescription) in the areas of personal care, domestic tasks (meal preparation, housework, gardening, laundry etc.), community tasks (shopping, leisure, banking, etc.), work, driving and a home assessment.  (Variable session length depending on goals set-4-7 hours, across the whole length of stay which could be 10-14 days)
c.  An initial individual education session about activity pacing and how this technique can be used to improve participation in daily occupations.  The session will be conducted using a standard iPad presentation and the content of the session will include what is deconditioning, what is a reconditioning program, what is activity pacing is and the activity pacing technique.  The patient will be given an activity pacing education booklet and orientated to the information in the booklet.  The booklet is for the patient to keep and read in their own time (30 mins, second day after admission)
d.  Five group sessions with the aim of building the level of participation, confidence and independence in occupation through the use of the activity pacing techniques in everyday tasks.  Four sessions will be activity based and each day will focus on different activity pacing technique as follows:
Day One-Use self-monitoring to listening to your body
Day Two-Break tasks into manageable parts and use short regular rests during the day and during activities 
Day Three-Find a sustainable baseline and then gradually increase activity and plan tasks and set goals
Day Four-Prioritise tasks and delegate where able and alternate high energy tasks with low energy tasks 
One of the group sessions will be conducted as a group education session where the activity pacing techniques are reinforced.  The use of the activity pacing techniques will be generally applied to different occupations.  The education will refer to the booklet that was given in the individual activity pacing education session.  The group education session will follow a structured format (power point presentation) and will encourage group discussion and problem solving about independence in daily occupations (5 hours over 5 days, three or four days after admission)
e.  A final individual session reviewing the activity pacing intervention and how this applies to the patients usual daily occupations in hospital and in their home environment.  Occupation based handouts are used to reinforce the use of the activity pacing techniques in occupations post discharge.  Individualised agreed instructions for use of the activity pacing techniques will be written on these handouts. (30 mins, day before discharge)
Total number of OT sessions: between 12-15 times
Resources: patients will be provided with an Activity Pacing booklet and occupation based Activity Pacing handouts related to tasks done in their own environment
Adherence will be recorded attendance at each of the above sessions

To ensure this group is not disadvantaged, patients will receive 2 education sessions on the same day after outcome measures have been completed 2 days prior to discharge-
a.  Activity Pacing Education- The session will be conducted 1:1 using a standard iPad presentation and the content of the session will include what is deconditioning, what is activity pacing and the activity pacing techniques.  The patient will be given an activity pacing education booklet and orientated to the information.  The session will be personalised to the participants own occupations and environment.  Occupation based handouts will be used to reinforce the use of the activity pacing techniques in occupations post discharge.  Individualised agreed instructions for use of the activity pacing techniques will be written on these handouts (30 mins two days prior to discharge)
b.  Activity Pacing Education- The patient will be given the opportunity to practice the activity pacing techniques in meaningful tasks and the use of the activity pacing techniques in occupations post discharge will be reinforced (30 mins two days prior to discharge)
Total number of OT sessions: between 7-10 times
Resources: patients will be provided with an Activity Pacing booklet and occupation based Activity Pacing handouts related to tasks done in their own environment

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size calculation was completed based on an effect size d=0.8 with an a probability of 0.05 using a 90% power ratio (beta=0.1).  This estimated that 34 participants would be required in each of the groups. To accommodate withdrawal and lost to follow up numbers a sample size has been set at 100, that is 50 participants in each group.
All participants data will be analysed according to group allocation using an intention to treat approach.  Statistical analysis will be completed using SPSS software (version 22).  Differences between the base line characteristics of the two groups will be assessed using a t-test for continuous data and a chi squared for categorical data.  Missing data will be dealt with using a method of last observation carried forward (LOCF).
Primary Analysis
1.	Is there bias?
- use a histogram to check if the data and variance are normally distributed 
- test for skewness and kurtosis of data and convert these scores to z scores to evaluate their significance (greater than 1.96 then significant)
-use scatterplots to check linear model and check for outliers
-check for heterogeneity of data using Levenes test
-reduced bias by transforming the data appropriately 
2.	Is there a difference in the two groups on each of the outcome measures?
-calculate means and standard deviations for each of the outcome measure results for the two groups at each time interval
-calculate a standard error with 95% confidence intervals
-conduct a two-way ANOVA for OT with AP and OT without AP and difference in change scores for participation in occupation, quality of life/health status, self-efficacy for use of activity pacing techniques, self-efficacy in general, fatigue and pain 
3.	Does age, gender, comorbidities influence the outcome?
-conduct moderation and mediation analysis to determine the interaction effects of age, gender and level of comorbidities

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Activity pacing is an occupational therapy rehabilitation intervention commonly used with older adults who have deconditioned during an acute hospital admission.  Activity pacing involves teaching people different techniques to regulate their level of activity and how they do their daily tasks.  Activity pacing and energy conservation have been shown to have some effect with persistent pain populations and in people with chronic disease. Yet there is currently no evidence for use with the deconditioned older adult. For the purpose of this research, activity pacing will include seven activity pacing techniques - 
1.	Use self-monitoring to listening to your body
2.	Use short regular rests during the day and during activities 
3.	Find a sustainable baseline and then gradually increase activity
4.	Break tasks into manageable parts
5.	Plan tasks and set goals
6.	Alternate high energy tasks with low energy tasks
7.	Prioritise tasks and delegate where able
The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effectiveness of activity pacing with deconditioned older adults on their participation in everyday tasks.  This will be done by comparing two groups- 1) occupational therapy rehabilitation with activity pacing, 2) occupational therapy rehabilitation with no activity pacing.  A secondary aim will be to compare the effects of the two interventions on quality of life and well-being, knowledge of activity pacing techniques and symptom management (pain, fatigue and self-efficacy).
Deconditioned older adults who are admitted to a private hospital from the acute setting will be invited to participate.  A randomised controlled method will be used to compare the effectiveness of occupational therapy rehabilitation with activity pacing and occupational therapy rehabilitation with no activity pacing.  The activity pacing intervention will be multi-faceted with individual sessions, group education, written handouts and a practical group allowing practice of the above activity pacing techniques.  To ensure the second group (occupational therapy with no activity pacing) are not disadvantaged, patients will receive modified activity pacing education (two individual sessions- one education  and one practical, written handouts) 2 days prior to discharge and after the completion of outcome measures.
