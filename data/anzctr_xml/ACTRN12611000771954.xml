  <interventions>
    <interventions>To examine the effect of butyrylated high amylose maize starch on immune and microbiological parameters in 40 well trained athletes in a double blind placebo controlled parallel trial over 28 days. Butyrylated high amylose maize starch is non-digestible starch that promotes the growth of beneficial microbes in the gastrointestinal tract. In this case the starch has had butyric acid incorporated into its structure. Butyric acid is the primary fuel for colonocytes and promotes normal functioning of these cells. The supplement is in a powder form and will be mixed and consumed with a protein drink (musashi protein powder) twice daily for 28 days. A total of 40 grams per day of the butyrylated high amylose maize starch will be consumed per day. The expected outcomes are an increase in faecal short chain fatty acids (butyrate, acetate and propionate), an increase in total faecal bacteria and increases in salivary antimicrobial proteins and serum cytokines.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is low amylose maize starch. Using low amylose maize starch as a control ensures that participants allocated to the control group receive the same amount of resistant starch as the intervention group. The low amylose maize starch is a powder that will be incorporated into a protein drink (musashi). 40 grams per day will be consumed for 28 days.</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastrointestinal and upper respiratory symptoms will be determined by the self reported questionnaire. Symptoms of gastrointestinal illness include flatulance, stomach rumbles, diarrhoea, bloating. Symptoms of respiratory illness include scratchy throat, sore throat, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, blocked nose and headache. An episode will include two or more symptoms for 3 or more days.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Salivary antimicrobial proteins and antibodies including immunoglobulin A (SIgA), lactoferrin (Lf) and lysozyme (Ly). All salivary measures will be analysed by commercial enzyme linked immunoassay (SIgA - Stratech Scientific, Lf- Calbiochem and Ly - Saphhire Bioscience)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate 28 days of butyrylated resistant starch supplementation on faecal short chain fatty acids, faecal microbiology and immunity in well trained athletes. Well trained athletes undertaking prolonged endurance exercise suffer gastrointestinal dysfunction and suppression of immunity from heavy exercise training. This supplement is being investigated to examine whether it may reverse these issues.</summary>
