    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 78 women (i.e. 39 women in each group) is required to demonstrate a 30% increase in the proportion of women with PPROM still pregnant after seven days (from 19.7% of women still pregnant after seven days to 25.6% of women still pregnant after seven days; mean latency 5.2 days, SD 11.9 days), with 80% power and two sided significance level of 0.05%. The sample size was calculated using latency data for women with PPROM at RNSH prior to 34 weeks gestation, collected as pilot data for the PPROMT trial. 
Study groups will be compared with regard to their baseline characteristics. If significant differences are found, potential confounders will be adjusted for in the analysis of outcomes. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the outcome measure. If confounding factor adjustment is required, then logistic regression will be used. No subgroups analysis is planned.
Intention to treat analysis will be used on all data.

The analysis will be descriptive with the aim of estimating the parameters for sample size calculation in a large study. Data of patient drop out will not be included in the analysis.

With a categorical independent variable and a continuous dependent variable, the most appropriate test is a chi squared test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preterm birth is a leading cause of death and long-term neurological disability for infants, with PPROM accounting for over one-third of preterm births. Apart from perinatal morbidity, there is also maternal morbidity from PPROM related to infection, such as chorioamnionitis. This trial aims to provide evidence demonstrating that probiotic therapy in women with PPROM prolongs pregnancy duration, thereby delaying preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes. Delaying preterm birth will have a major impact on clinical practice and benefit the health of infants locally, nationally and internationally. 

New molecular techniques using DNA sequencing methods are increasing knowledge and understanding of the organisms and microbiome of women with PPROM and preterm birth. Biospecimens collected in the pilot trial aim to demonstrate the change in the intrauterine and neonatal microbiome to provide more information on the beneficial effects of probiotics for women at risk of preterm birth. This will build on the emerging medical literature on the changes in the intrauterine and vaginal biomes of the pregnant woman and the gastrointestinal biome of the baby associated with preterm birth, antibiotics and probiotics. The changes in the maternal and neonatal biome for women with PPROM may assist in understanding the causation of PPROM and preterm birth.</summary>
