  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist in a oral administration of  a commercially avaliable extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF) containing LGG (concentration was 2,50x 10 7 to 5x10 8 colony-forming units /CFU/g).
The amount of EHCF ranged from 500 to 1000 ml per day depending on the body weight and age of children.  Children enrolled will receive this dietary intervention untill tolerance will be acquired as demonstrated by oral food challenge (OFC)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND. Lactobacillus GG (LGG) modulates immune function and has been proposed in the prevention and treatment of pediatric allergic diseases. 

AIM. We investigated whether the addition of LGG to an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF) could be able to influence the time of tolerance acquisition in children affected by cows milk allergy (CMA).

METHODS. Children (1-24 months of age) affected by immunoglobulin E (IgE) and non immunoglobulin E (non-IgE) mediated CMA, confirmed by oral food challenge, were randomly allocated to two different dietary interventions: 1, EHCF (Nutramigen'Registered Trademark (R)', Mead Johnson, Italy); 2, EHCF containing LGG for at least 1x106 CFU/g of formula powder LGG (Nutramigen LGG 'Registered Trademark (R)', Mead Johnson, Italy). To investigate the possible tolerance acquisition an oral food challenge was performed every 3 months after diagnosis for 12 months.</summary>
