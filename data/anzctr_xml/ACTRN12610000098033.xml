  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women experiencing a distressing birth were randomised to counselling or parenting support.  The counselling or parenting support was delivered face to face within the first week after the birth and over the telephone at 4- 6 weeks.

Women in the study will also be offered a qualitative interview to explore their experiences upon completion of the study intervention, and this is a separate component of this particular trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Parenting support (active control) and usual care (matched control).  Usual care involved completion of a questionnaire at the point that the midwife visited after the birth and at 6 weeks postpartum. All groups received the usual follow-up as provided by the hospital.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trauma and depression will be measured through completion of questionnaires:
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS -21) at Q1 to Q5; 
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at Q1 to Q5; 
Post traumatic symptom scale (PSS) at Q1, Q3 to Q5</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants complete questionnaires at 5 time points: 
Q1 antenatally (i.e. 36 weeks in last trimester); 
Q2 within the first week after the birth; 
Q3 at 4-6 weeks after the birth; 
Q4 at 6 months after the birth; 
Q5 at 12 months after the birth</timepoint>

    <concealment>Women are recruited from antenatal clinics during the third trimester of pregnancy.  Women are provided with information sheets and given consent forms for participation.  Women consenting to participation are contacted after the birth of their child. After the birth women are randomised to either intervention or control groups if they indicate "distress" on the measures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The perinatal period is arguably one of the most important life stages for which the accurate detection and treatment of psychological distress is required. The first study (of 2) will look at the benefits of midwife-led counseling for distressed mothers following child birth, compared to distress controls and non-distressed mothers.  Study 2 will look at differences in narratives of distressed womens postpartum experiences. Findings from of this research will contribute towards early assessment of psychological risk in childbearing women, provision of effective emotional care by midwives, inform maternity service provision and policy; as well as contribute to a positive transition to motherhood for many Australian women</summary>
