  <interventions>
    <interventions>Whilst participants (n=12) are still sedated following cardiac surgery, a 10F pressure catheter will be inserted into the nasopharynx via the nose. Once awake and extubated, participants will be commenced on face mask noninvasive ventilation. Once settled on the therapy the pressure catheter position will be confirmed using end tidal CO2 monitoring. Pressure measurements will then be carried out at three different pressure settings: 3, 5 and 7 cmH20 with mouth open and then repeated mouth closed. Simultaneously, pressure in the face mask will recorded using a separate pressure catheter attached to a pressure monitoring port on the mask. The pressure catheter in the nasopharynx will be gently removed at the end of the study period. The measurements will take approximately 30mins to complete. The intervention is noninvasive ventilation at three different pressure settings. We are investigating the relationship between the pressure in the face mask and the pressure in the nasopharynx. We hypothesise that there is a difference between mask pressure and nasopharyngeal pressure and that this difference varies between patients.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate whether the pressure generated in the airway of a patient receiving noninvasive ventilation with a sealed face mask (used to assist breathing during respiratory failure / distress) is the same as the pressure generated in the mask. There is an assumption that the pressure in the mask is similar to the pressure in the airway. We think that it is likely to be lower in the airway due to resistance in the nose but the degree of difference will vary between individuals.</summary>
