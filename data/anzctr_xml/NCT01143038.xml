    <interventions>Other interventions - Romiplostim

Experimental: Romiplostim - Participants received romiplostim administered weekly by subcutaneous injection during the 12-month treatment period. The starting dose was 1 µg/kg with weekly dose increases continued in increments of 1 µg/kg/week to a maximum dose of 10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of = 50 x 10^9/L.


Other interventions: Romiplostim
Romiplostim will be administered weekly by subcutaneous injection

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Months With Platelet Response During the 12-Month Treatment Period - The primary endpoint was the number of months a participant achieved a platelet response during the 12-month treatment period. A platelet response for any 1 month was defined as the median of platelet counts measured in the month = 50 x 10^9/L. Platelet counts within 4 weeks following a rescue medication use or following splenectomy were considered non-response. Months without any platelet count measurement were considered as months with no platelet response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With ITP Remission - ITP remission was defined as maintaining every platelet count = 50 x 10^9/L for at least 6 months in the absence of romiplostim and any other therapies to treat ITP.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 24 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Splenectomy During the 12-month Treatment Period - If treatment with romiplostim was deemed ineffective or intolerable by the investigator, a splenectomy may have been performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events - An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial participant. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least one of the following serious criteria:  fatal  life threatening  requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  congenital anomaly/birth defect  other significant medical hazard. Whether an adverse event was treatment-related (TRAE) or not was determined by investigator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first dose date of romiplostim to end of study (up to 24 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Developed Antibodies to Romiplostim - The number of participants who developed antibody formation (defined as negative at baseline and positive at post-baseline, transient or persistent) to romiplostim, endogenous thrombopoietin (eTPO), and thrombopoietin mimetic peptide (TMP, the peptide component of romiplostim) was summarized.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at end of treatment (based on response to treatment, this could occur between 12 months and approximately 18 months)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
