  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment with artemether lumefantrine will be given orally in 6 doses twice daily over 3 days as per standard of care in Nepal.  Each tablet contains 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine. The number of tablets to be administered at each dose will be based on body weight (5-14 kg  = 1 tablet; 15-24 kg = 2 tablets, 25-34 kg = 3 tablets and, 35 kg and over = 4 tablets).  All patients will be confined in the hospital for three days and will return for efficacy and safety follow-up assessments at day 7, 14, 21 and 28 post-dosing.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of treatment failures (early treatment failure + late clinical failure + late parasitological failure) as defined in the latest WHO protocol for monitoring antimalarial drug efficacy (WHO 2009)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 28 following initiation of treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nature and incidence of adverse events that develops or worsens with the use of the medicinal product, regardless of whether it is related to the medicinal product.  Possible adverse events include dizziness, tching, vomiting, abdominal pain, flatulence, headache, body ache, diarrhoea, tinnitus, increased hair loss, macular rash, reduction in neutriophil counts, and convulsions. However, it is likely that many of these effects are disease-related rather than associated to the use of the antimalarial drug.</outcome>
