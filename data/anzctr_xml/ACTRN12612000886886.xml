  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention #1: BrainyApp

BrainyApp is a mobile device application designed to raise awareness of the link between brain and heart health, and to help users make positive lifestyle changes. Users complete a Brain Health Survey and then engage in the recommended activities to improve in areas where they have scored poorly. The duration of the intervention is four weeks, and the frequency of use is at the participants' discretion.

Intervention #2: The Brain-Heart Health+ Program

The Brain-Heart Health+ Program is an interactive web-based program designed to raise awareness of the link between brain and heart health, and to help users make positive lifestyle changes. Users complete a Brain Health Survey and then complete a series of online modules in order to improve in areas where they have scored poorly. The Brain-Heart Health+ Program is also designed to provide users with an overview of the scientific evidence supporting the link between brain and heart health, as well as giving users practical tips, resources, and updates. The duration of the intervention is four weeks, and the frequency of use is at the participants' discretion.</interventions>
