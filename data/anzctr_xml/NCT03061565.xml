Erythropoietin - Patients were treated with EPO during the EPO-TBI study in 2010-2014.

Placebo - Patients were treated with placebo during the EPO-TBI study in 2010-2014.


Treatment: drugs: erythropoietin
Patients were given erythropoietin during the EPO-TBI study in 2010-2014. In the current follow-up we will evaluate any possible long term differences between patients treated with etrythropoietin compared to placebo.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Traumatic brain injury is catastrophic event that commonly require treatment in an intensive
      care unit. Management is mainly supportive aiming at avoiding hypoxia, hypotension,
      hypoglycaemia and increased intracerebral pressure. Thus far efforts to find a specific
      pharmacologic therapies have been disappointing. Recently it was demonstrated that
      recombinant erythropoietin has been found to decrease mortality at six months from injury but
      without significantly improving functional neurological outcome (GOSe). Whether this survival
      benefit of EPO is sustained beyond 6 months is unknown.

      In the current study survival data will be collected centrally and patients alive or person
      responsible will be invited to participate in an evaluation of neurological function and
      quality of life. Factors associated with time to death as well as factors associated with
      long term quality of life will be determined with statistical methods.</summary>
