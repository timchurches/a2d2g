  <interventions>
    <interventions>Laser treatment will be given four times in the first two weeks of the quit attempt. Treatment will be given on acupuncture points on the ears, wrists and hands. Each point will be treated for one minute. Treatment will consist of a single diode laser with the following irradiation parameters: power output: 50mW; wavelength: 820nm; pulse repetition rate: 20HZ; radiant exposure: 24Jcm.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham laser treatment will be given with a sham probe on the same points as received by the verum group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking cessation measured by self report of smoking cessation at six months and one biochemical test of Carbon monoxide [CO] [less than 10 p.p.m. in expired air] a at six months from initial quit attempt</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be measured at 26 weeks from commencement of treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Smoking cessation at 12 weeks as indicated by self report of smoking cessation and one biochemical test of Carbon Monoxide , less than 10 p.p.m.in expired air.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Note that with smoking cessation the long term outcome of smoking cessation at 26 weeks or 6 months is the most desired outcome [the Russell Standard 6 months-RS6], and smoking cessation at 12 weeks is secondary to that. Hence outcomes will be measured at 1, 2, 6, 12 weeks and 26 weeks from commencement of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significant difference in  the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal questionnaire between the sham and verum group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>As noted above, the primary outcome is smoking cessation at 6 months. Secondary outcomes are reduced withdrawal symptoms at 1,2,6 12 and 26 weeks, and significant changes in the questionnaires [which also will be measured at 1,2,6,12 and 26 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significant difference between the laser and sham laser group on Minnesota Behaviour Self report questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>As noted above, the primary outcome is smoking cessation at 6 months. Secondary outcomes are reduced withdrawal symptoms at 1,2,6 12 and 26 weeks, and significant changes in the questionnaires [which also will be measured at 1,2,6,12 and 26 weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to access the results of using laser acupuncture to assist long term smoking cessation. Long term smoking cessation is assessed at 26 weeks after treatment commences. This trial has attempted to remedy the deficiencies of a previous laser acupuncture trials. It has been designed to address several questions: 1. Does true [verum] laser acupuncture have better outcomes of smoking cessation than  sham  laser acupuncture ?  This style of laser acupuncture treatment has been chosen because there is not enough evidence from trials of this type of treatment to assess its validity. The Cochrane Library Review, Acupuncture and Related Interventions for Smoking Cessation [White, Rampes et al, 2007] was updated in 2007 and stated that there is no consistent evidence that acupuncture, acupressure, laser therapy or electro-stimulation are effective for smoking cessation, but methodological problems mean that no firm conclusions can be drawn. Research has shown acupuncture is a safe therapy with few side effects. Using the drug therapy of nicotine replacement therapy and Bupropion therapy as aids to assist smoking cessation is not suitable for everybody. The outcome of this trial will be clearer information about the role of true [verum] laser acupuncture This will inform recommendations for interventions that will assist smokers wishing to quit. It will add worthwhile information to the debate concerning the use of acupuncture and may influence future meta-analysis and reviews concerning the efficacy of laser acupuncture treatment and its role in assisting people to cease smoking.</summary>
