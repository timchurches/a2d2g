You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or more who has completed treatment for testicular cancer between 6 months to 5 years ago, and have no evidence of disease recurrence. You will need to have access to computer at least weekly for up to 10 weeks. Study details All participants in this study will receive an online intervention to address the specific unmet needs of testicular cancer survivors (such as for help with fear of cancer recurrence, body image and sexual issues, financial issues and re-establishing a sense of normal), as well as general anxiety and depression.The intervention involves completion of 6 online modules in 10 weeks. On completion of the intervention at 10 weeks, participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires about the feasibility, acceptability, utility, comprehensiveness, relevance, helpfulness, and simplicity of the intervention.</summary>
