    <interventions>Brief Hassle-Free Mealtimes Triple P (Morawska &amp; Sanders, in press) is a Level 2 Triple P intervention based on the principles of behavioural family intervention and social learning. Parents attending the Hassle-Free Mealtimes program will receive one 2-hour group session on the causes of childhood feeding difficulties, establishing eating routines and ground rules, and various behavioural strategies including praise, positive attention, behaviour charts, modelling, planned ignoring, instructions and consequences. The program will be delivered by trained practitioners to groups of 10-12 parents. Teaching methods will include didactic instruction, active skills training and homework tasks so that parents may achieve mastery of skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>A waitlist control design will be applied whereby half of the parents will be randomly allocated to wait 4 weeks and complete measures again before receiving the program.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent-reported child mealtime behaviour on the Parent and Toddler Feeding Assessment (PATFA; Adamson, Morawska, &amp; Sanders, 2008). The PATFA is a 90-item measure of child feeding behaviour and corresponding parental strategies,  beliefs, emotions and knowledge related to feeding. Parents rated 21 child feeding items as to the frequency of each (on a 5-point Likert scale) and whether each is a problem (yes/no).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mealtime-specific parenting style, parenting confidence and beliefs, emotions and knowledge related to feeding, rated on the PATFA (Adamson et al., 2008). Parents rate how frequently they use 30 mealtime strategies on a 5-point scale (Parent Strategies), their agreement with 39 statements about feeding on a 5-point scale (Parent Cognitions), and their level of confidence in managing each of the 21 child feeding behaviours noted above on a scale of 1-10 (Parent Confidence).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child behavioural and emotional adjustment as measured by the Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (CAPES; Morawska &amp; Sanders, 2010). This measure consists of 30 items rated on a 4-point scale (0 = not true of my child at all to 3 = true of my child very much, or most of the time). Twenty six items assess behaviour concerns (e.g., My child rudely answers back to me) and behavioural competencies (Behaviour Scale; e.g., My child accepts rules and limits), and four items assess emotional adjustment (Emotional Adjustment Scale; e.g., My child worries).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parental efficacy as measured by the CAPES (Morawska &amp; Sanders, 2010). The Efficacy Scale measures parents' level of confidence in managing child emotional and behavioural problems and consists of 20 items rated on a 10-point scale (from 1 = certain I can't do it to 10 = certain I can do it).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parenting practices, parent adjustment, family relationships, and couple relationships, as measured by the Parenting and Family Adjustment Scale (PAFAS; Sanders &amp; Morawska, 2010). Parents rate each of the 40-items on a 4-point scale (0 = not true of me at all, to 3 = true of me very much, or most of the time).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Child anxiety as measured by the Childhood Concerns Survey (CCS; Edwards, Rapee, Kennedy, &amp; Spence, 2010), a 28-item parent-report measure of anxiety in young children.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Parent and child food neophobia (a reluctance to try new foods), as measured by the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS; Pliner &amp; Hobden, 1993) and Children's Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS; Cooke, Carnell, &amp; Wardle, 2006) which contain 10 and 6 items respectively and are rated by the parent.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measures will be administered upon entry to the study (Time 1) and then four weeks later (Time 2). For families in the start now group, this will be 4 weeks after their group session; families assigned to the start later group will receive no intervention for the same number of weeks (5 weeks) and then complete the measures before participating in the intervention. The families in the start now group will be assessed once more six months after the completion of the intervention for follow-up (Time 3).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will aim to test a single-session parenting group for parents of children with problem eating. It is anticipated that the group will improve child feeding, the strategies parent use at mealtimes, and how parents think and feel about mealtimes. The study will also seek to identify which types of feeding problems respond best to this intervention.</summary>
