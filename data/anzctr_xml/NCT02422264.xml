  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Infanrix hexa
Treatment: drugs - Prevnar13

Experimental: Boostrix Group - This group will consist of infants born to mothers belonging to the dTpa Group in study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] i.e. who received a single dose of BoostrixTM during pregnancy and a dose of placebo immediately post-delivery. All infants in this group will receive Infanrix hexaTM co-administered with Prevenar 13®.

Active Comparator: Control Group - This group will consist of infants born to mothers belonging to the Control group in study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047], i.e. who received a single dose of placebo during pregnancy and a dose of BoostrixTM immediately post-delivery. All infants in this group will receive Infanrix hexaTM co-administered with Prevenar 13®.


Other interventions: Infanrix hexa
 All subjects will receive Infanrix hexa at 2 and 4, at 3 and 5, at 2, 4 and 6 months or at 2, 3 and 4 months, depending on the immunisation schedule of the country. Infanrix hexa is administered intramuscularly to the right thigh.

Treatment: drugs: Prevnar13
 All subjects will receive Infanrix hexa co-administered with Prevenar13* at 2 and 4, at 3 and 5, at 2, 4 and 6 months or at 2, 3 and 4 months, depending on the immunisation schedule of the country. *In some countries/regions with an Infanrix hexa 3-dose vaccination schedule, Prevenar 13 could be administered as 2-doses or 3-doses primary vaccination schedule (according to the routine national immunisation schedule). Prevnar13 is administered intramuscularly to the left thigh.

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK Biologicals'
      Infanrix hexa, given in the primary vaccination schedule to infants born to pregnant women
      who participated in study 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047]. This study will help us evaluate if
      the presence of transplacentally transferred maternal antibodies interfere with the immune
      response to primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa and a co-administered pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine given as a part of this study in infants.</summary>
