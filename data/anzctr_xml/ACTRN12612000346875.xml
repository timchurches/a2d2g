  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resistance exercise intervention: 16 week resistance training intervention conducted 3 times per week for approximately 1 hour per session encompassing full body weight training.  Progressive resistance training (free weights and machines) will be administered by a qualified trainer (BSc, MSc exercise rehabilitation) in a group situation. The head trainer will be assisted by 3rd year students.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Natural killer cell activity measured as percent lysis at multiple target to effector ratios. Blood will be collected twice at week 0 and twice at week 17 to establish a true resting norm (mean of the two collections) for this measure and the secondary immune and inflammatory markers.  Blood will be taken by a certified phlebotomist.  Blood will then be analysed in the University laboratory and commercial pathology laboratories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and Week 17</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscular strength.  Muscular strength will be assessed via isokinetic dynamometry on the kincom.  Shoulder internal and external rotation and knee flexion and extension will be assessed.  3 trials will be implemented, with the highest measure recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0, Week 8, Week 17</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Additional immune and inflammatory parameters:  Full blood count, IL-6, lymphocyte proliferation, and lymphocyte subsets, CRP levels, blood lipids</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and Week 17</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life: As assessed by the FACT-G (cancer general scale), FACIT-fatigue (cancer fatigue scale), and the SF-36 health questionnaire</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed invasive cancer in women. Breast cancer patients often suffer from suppressed immune functioning as a result of the cancer and its therapies. The aim of this project is to examine whether resistance exercise can enhance immune functioning in breast cancer survivors. Participants will undergo a testing protocol consisting of measurements of immune function (blood sample), strength and quality of life (questionnaires). Participants will then be randomly assigned to undertake a 16 week resistance training intervention or to continue on as normal in a control group. At the completion of the 16 weeks the participants will undergo the same tests as at baseline. These tests (strength and quality of life) will also be completed at a 6 month follow up. Who is it for? The study is open to postmenopausal women aged 40-70 years who are recovering from stage I to IIIA breast cancer and its associated treatment. Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this trial can be found in the relevant sections of this form. Trial details This study involves participating in a 16 week resistance exercise intervention, conducted 3 times per week in groups for approximately 1 hour per session encompassing full body weight training and progressive resistance training consisting of the use of free weights and machines, under the supervision of a qualified trainer who is assisted by 3rd year students.</summary>
