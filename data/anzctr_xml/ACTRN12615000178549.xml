  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants with recent spinal cord injury will be given a single dose of doubly labelled water (99% deuterium and 10% 18O) based on body weight (1.35gm per kg). Urine samples will be collected pre-dose and at regular intervals over a two week period post dose.  Participants will also undergo bioimpedance analysis and dual x-ray absorptiometry.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Energy expenditure derived from mass spectrometry analysis of urine samples will be used to validate the Schofield Equation which is used clinically to estimate the basal metabolic rate and the total caloric intake required to maintain body mass. Fat mass and fat-free mass derived from the bioimpedance analysis will be correlated with the values obtained from dual x-ray absorptiometry (the current gold standard). The sample size of 20 participants is typical of that used to measure energy expenditure using doubly labelled water.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nutritional management of patients after spinal cord injury is complex and challenging.  Dietitians currently estimate a patients nutritional requirements using standard equations of normal resting metabolism, adjusted for activity and stress levels. These equations have never been validated in the spinal cord injured population. To do this, metabolic activity will be measured using a technique called doubly labelled water. Patients are given a single dose of water labelled with a stable isotope. The elimination of the isotope over time directly measures metabolic activity. 
Weight loss, commonly used to detect malnutrition, cannot distinguish between muscle wasting associated with paralysis and wasting from malnutrition. This study will therefore validate the use of an objective and non-invasive technique called bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure segmental body composition (muscle, fat and water) in acute spinal cord injury. With segmental BIA, muscle wasting due to paralysis can be distinguished from wasting due to malnutrition.  BIA measures will be validated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), the gold standard for analysing body composition. BIA can be conducted at bedside and is therefore more clinically feasible and cost-effective for on-going assessment in this population where nutritional needs change through different phases of recovery.
