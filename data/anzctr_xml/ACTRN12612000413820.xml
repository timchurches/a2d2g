  <interventions>
    <interventions>Millin prostatectomy for benign prostate enlargement. The approximate duration of the procedure is anticipated to be 60-90 minutes. Millin prostatectomy involves a transcapsular dissection of the prostatic adenoma, instead of a transvesical approach.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life before and after Millin prostatectomy. This is going to be assessed by a single question: "If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition the way it is now, how yould you feel about that? Delighted (0) / Pleased (1) / Mostly satisfied (2) / Mixed about equally satisfied and disatisfied (3) / Mostly disatified (4) / Unhappy (5) / Terrible (6)"</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urinary symptoms before and after Millin prostatectomy. This is going to be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Erectile function before and after Millin prostatectomy. This is going to be assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Irritative urinary symptoms before and after Millin prostatectomy. This is going to be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Obstructive urinary symptoms before and after Millin prostatectomy. This is going to be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of the most important prognostic factors for the outcome (age, tobacco use, dibetes mellitus, coronary disease, alcohol). This is going to be assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire, the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and performing statistical analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On day before the surgery and on 6 months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Benign prostatic enlargement is a common condition in men and one surgical approach in its treatment is Millin prostatectomy, especially for large adenomas. In this study we are going to evaluate urinary symptoms, erectile function and quality of life in men before and after Millin prostatectomy.</summary>
