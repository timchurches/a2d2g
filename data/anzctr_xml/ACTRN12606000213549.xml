  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Home-based pre-discharge occupational therapy assessment and education: Participants will receive a single home-based occupational therapy assessment, one-on-one education about safe performance of activities in and around their home, recommendations for home modifications, and observation of use of prescribed equipment. The home visit will occur at the address that the participant is to be discharged to after hospital. 
2. Hospital-based pre-discharge occupational therapy assessment and education: Participants will receive a single hospital-based occupational therapy consultation (initial assessment and interview addressing self-care, home duties, home and community mobility, social and leisure activities; observation, practice and education about safe performance where appropriate inside the hospital, and provision of equipment and information about available community services). Participants will not receive a home visit assessment from any member of staff prior to discharge.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial comparing two types of pre-discharge occupational therapy consultations for older adults: home-based versus hospital-based consultations.  In particular the study will test the feasability of trial procedures consent rates, and the acceptability of both forms of consultation. Individuals who are aged over 65 years and living in the community prior to admission will be asked to participate. Study participants (n=10) will be randomly assigned to receive either a hospital-based or a home-based pre-discharge occupational therapy assessment and education. The home-based consultations are more time-consuming and costly than hospital-based consultations, however it is unknown if patient outcomes differ. Participants will be tested before and during the study using standardised outcome measures by a qualified occupational therapist who is blind to group allocation.</summary>
