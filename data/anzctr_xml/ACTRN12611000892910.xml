  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention strategy is a modified version of the standard invitation and reminder letters sent from the Cancer Registry. The intervention letters are modified by incorporating specific changes to wording and formatting which have been identified as potentially increasing suitability, readability and legibility of written communication. Patients receiving the modified letters will make up the experimental arm of the study. Both the enhanced letter (intervention strategy) and the standard letter (control) were sent to participants via mail. Mailing of the invitation letters was carried out over several days. If participants had not responded to the invitation letter approximately 4 weeks after they were mailed a reminder letter (an enhanced reminder for the intervention group and the standard reminder letter for the control group) was sent to non-responders via mail. Again mailing of the reminder letters occurred over several days.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>800 survivors diagnosed with a blood cancer between 1st July 2007 and 30th June 2010 and aged between 18 and 80 were chosen from the Cancer Registry. Staff from the Cancer Registry randomly allocated 400 survivors to the intervention group and 400 survivors to the control group through random number allocation. Random number was generated by an external .exe file, while sorting and implementation of cutoff was done in excel. The researchers were not involved in the random allocation of survivors, so were blinded to this process until data was collected.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We have conducted a RCT sub-study within the recruitment phase of a larger project utilising an Australian Cancer Registry to recruit survivors of a haematological study. This sub-study aimed to test the effect of two different patient invitation and reminder letters on participation rates to the study from patients. The first invitation and reminder letters were the standard letters sent by the Cancer Registry. Patients receiving this letter acted as the control arm of the intervention. The second invitation and reminder letters were modified versions of the standard letters incorporating specific changes to wording and formatting which have been identified as potentially increasing suitability, readability and legibility.</summary>
