  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Stepathlon program involves recruitment of participants who are grouped into employer-based teams. Participants are provided with a pedometer, and are encouraged to measure the number of steps they take each day, with a goal of achieving 10,000 steps or more each day. The Stepathlon (https://www.stepathlon.com/) is conducted as a competition, with the objective of the event being to maximise step counts achieved by employer-based teams.  The program utilises mobile/web-delivered self monitoring of step counts as a support tool.
As part of the event, individual participants have the option of completing a standardized pre- and post-event survey web-based questionnaire. The survey items include step count, weight, days exercised, hours exercised, sitting hours, as well as a series of lifestyle questions.  These data have been entered by the Stepathlon organizers into a registry.

The project consists of an external analysis of these registry data. The duration of the Stepathlon program is 100 days. The study will be performed on pre- and post-event survey data.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group of participants. Paired analyses of participant outcomes prior to and following the Stepathlon participation will be compared.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The key inclusion criteria will be participants in the Stepathlon who are able to complete pre-event and/or post-event questionnaires.

    <statisticalmethods>The project will be conducted as analysis study of de-identified questionnaire data collected by Stepathlon organizers from their registry.

There is no pre-specified sample size or limits on the study. The expectation is that Stepathlon will make participant questionnaire data available on an annual basis at the completion of surveys. The anticipated sample over the 3 years may be approximately 50,000 participants. However, this is indicative only. The sample size may be larger or smaller, as this is an analysis of the Stepathlon intervention.

Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMM) with analysis for repeated measures will be conducted for continous variables. Ordinal variables will be compared with ordinal logistic regression.
