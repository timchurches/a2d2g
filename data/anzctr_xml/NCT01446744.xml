    <interventions>Treatment: other - Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy
Treatment: other - palliative radiotherapy

Active Comparator: Standard arm - Standard of care, palliative radiotherapy, and chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist

Experimental: Stereotactic arm - Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy, and chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist


Treatment: other: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy
Total dose and number of fractions will depend on the site of disease. Treatment will be given daily, or every other day, over 1 -3 weeks.

Treatment: other: palliative radiotherapy
Investigators should follow the principles of palliative radiotherapy as per the individual institution. Treatment recommendations are as follows:
Brain: Whole brain radiotherapy i.e. 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions
Lung: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.15 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction, 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions
Bone: Palliative radiotherapy as per 2011 consensus guidelines.16 i.e. 8 Gy in 1 fraction (most common), 20 Gy in 5 fractions, 30 Gy in 10 fractions
Liver: 20 Gy in 5 fractions if standard institutional practice

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) is a new radiation treatment that delivers
      high-dose, precise radiation to small tumors in 1-3 weeks of treatment. This new technique
      can potentially allow radiation treatments to be focused more precisely, and delivered more
      accurately than with older treatments. This improvement could help by reducing side effects
      and by improving the chance of controlling the cancer by more precisely treating the cancer.
      The purpose of this study is to compare SABR with current approaches of chemotherapy and
      conventional radiotherapy to assess the impact on overall survival and quality of life.</summary>
