  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will participate in a tailored (individualised) home based balance exercise program.  This exercise program is based on The Otago Program, a program shown to be effective in improving general balance in older people with mild to moderate balance dysfunction (Campbell, 1997), but will include additional exercises selected to improve aspects of balance impairment associated with impaired turning performance. Participants in the home based exercise group will be provided with an individualized set of exercises based on assessment findings of areas of impairment. Approximately 1-2 of the 6-8 exercises prescribed will be selected to improve turning ability. The home based exercise program is expected to take 20-30 minutes per session on average, including rests. Participants will be encouraged to continue the exercise program at least four times a week for 16 weeks. The dosage is consistent with recommendations from a meta-analysis of exercise interventions in reducing falls (Sherrington et al., 2008, 2011). At initial session, participant will be received a detailed description  of exercise program,exercise booklet and explanation of the purpose of each exercise from the researcher,  which will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes. Participants in the exercise intervention will return to the assessment laboratory for three occasions in the 16 week duration (one visit after 3, 6 and 9 weeks) to review the exercise program, modify exercises if required, and motivate the participant to persist with the exercises which will take approximately 45 to 60 minutes per session. Participants will receive 4 phone calls ( 5 to 10 minutes duration per call) over the 16 week period between these  laboratory visit from researcher to further encourage participants to continue with the exercise program, and answer questions about the program. Strategies to support adherence in this study include provision of the exercise booklet, review and feedback on performance at the three visits during the 16 week program, encouragement at phone calls between the visits, and having participants complete and return an exercise diary.   </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group  will continue their normal activities, and will receive the same number and timing of follow up social phone calls as the phone calls received by the exercise group (n =4).  Control participants will also be asked to provide details of any falls in the preceding 3 weeks at these phone calls. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through public promotion of the study, including via presentations and information fliers to older adult organisations such as University of the Third Age. Potential participants will be screened on a single occasion to determine presence of balance impairment on the selected balance task (turning), and if performance is outside of normal limits, they will be eligible for participation in the study. Group allocation will be concealed  by using sealed  opaque envelopes, and will be opened following the baseline assessment being completed.  Participants will be randomised to a control group (maintain usual activity) or a home exercise (intervention) group (randomisation sequence will be generated by a computerised random numbers table).  The researcher opening the envelope with group allocation will not have access to the results of the baseline assessment (concealed allocation).</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will include baseline and post intervention measures, which will be reported as means (m) +/- standard deviations (SD). Data will be analysed on an intention to treat basis.  Missing data (due to loss to follow up) will be imputed using the last value carried forwards method.  Change in the selected primary outcome measure and secondary outcomes will be evaluated using two way Repeated Measures ANOVA to determine group main effect, time main effect, and interaction effect between group and time. Level of significance will be set at P &lt; 0.05.  Participants in the exercise group will be grouped according to high adherence (above median adherence for the full group) and low adherence (equal or below median adherence level).  Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to determine whether there is a difference in the primary and secondary balance measures between the high adherence and low adherence group.
Power analysis were performed for the primary outcome measure (180 degree Step Quick Turn test on the Neurocom Balance Master), using the mean score for the Step Quick Turn test (sway-degs-1) results from a previous exercise intervention trial of older people with mild balance impairments (Yang et al., 2012).  It was estimated that 34 participants per group (68 participants in total) would be required, allowing for an anticipated 20% dropout rate, at least 80% power to detect a 15% improvement in the Step Quick Turn test using the turn sway measure on the Neurocom Balance Master long-plate (degs-1) (assuming 50% standard deviation improvement [sd=10.2, effect size=0.5] at p &lt; 0.05 (two-tailed).  Power analysis based on results reported in the Yang et al (2012) study, and with the same assumptions of improvement in the exercise group as described for the Step Quick Turn test, indicate this sample size should also be adequate for other secondary outcome measures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The present study aims to provide a basis for planning falls prevention interventions of relevance to specific identified risks in the Malaysian population. This study will be a randomised controlled trial that will investigate the effectiveness of a 16 weeks home based exercise approach in improving turning performance in the sample of community dwelling Malaysians aged 50 years and above participating in study. The results of this study will assist health practitioners in Malaysia to improve assessment of falls risk factors, especially balance impairment of older Malaysians, and to improve management of older Malaysians with identified balance impairment.  The hypothesis of this study is that there will be a significant improvement in turning balance performance in a   group undertaking a 16 week progressive home based exercise program targeting turning performance compared to a control group continuing with usual activity</summary>
