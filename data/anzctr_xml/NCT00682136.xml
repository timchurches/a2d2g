  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to establish the efficacy of local anaesthetic TAP (transversus
      abdominis plane) blocks in providing pain relief in the first 24hrs following open or
      laparoscopic elective abdominal colorectal operations.

      TAP blocks involve the injection of local aesthetic (ropivicaine) into the transversus
      abdominis plane in the abdominal wall. This injection takes place after induction of
      anaesthesia, but before the commencement of surgery. TAP blocks have been proposed as a
      potential safer alternative to epidural anaesthesia. The blocks have been extensively used in
      the Hunter New England system over the last 18 months. As yet there is no clear evidence for
      there efficacy, hence the need for this trial.

      This trial would establish the efficacy of this practice. If the technique proves effective
      it could be widely used and provide a simpler method of managing post operative pain.</summary>
