  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current standard treatment is to provide high flow oxygen to people with severe asthma. However high flow oxygen may be detrimental and few studies have looked at the use of high flow oxygen in asthma. An alternative treatment is one where the amount of oxygen received is varied depending on the oxygen level in the blood. This study compares these two treatments.</summary>
