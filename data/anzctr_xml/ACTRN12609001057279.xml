  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Village health worker will obtain blood from a child with fever via a finger prick test. The blood specimen collected from the child is applied to a dipstick containing nitrocellulose. After 15 minutes, the presence of specific bands in the test card window indicate whether the patient is infected with Plasmodium falciparum . The intervention program will last for the duration of the trial, that is 16 months, whenever a child presents with fever and is suspected of having malaria.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Village Health workers will use guidelines developed for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness to manage a child with fever. In the guidelines, a child with fever and no other clinical symptoms or signs is treated presumptively for malaria. The presumptive treatment of malaria using the guidelines will last for the duration of the trial, that is 16 months, whenever a child with fever presents to village health workers who diagnosis malaria clinically. The unit of randomisation is a village. Villages will be randomised so that all children in trial villages will be diagnosed using RDT or clinical guidelines. Treatment with Artemisinin Combination Therapy is part of the study. A child diagnosed with malaria will be treated with Arthemeter/lumefantrine (Coartem) oral tablets. Coartemether is a 1:6 fixed-combination drug consisting of two components with tablets containing artemether (20 mg) and lumefantrine (120 mg). Treatment will last for 3 days and the dosage for artemether/lumefantrine is as follows: 
6 months  35 months (day 1: 1 tablet twice a day; day 2: 1 tablet twice a day and day 3: 1 tablet twice a day)
3-5 years (day 1: 2 tablets twice a day; day 2: 2 tablets twice a day and day 3: 2 tablets twice a day)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project has been designed to assess the effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) used by village health workers in improving appropriate diagnosis and rational treatment of malaria under routine conditions of disease control. A cluster randomized trial with two arms has been proposed. In both the intervention and control arms of the study, village health workers manage febrile children according to nationally adapted IMCI guidelines. However, in the intervention arm, they will be trained to use RDTs to confirm the diagnosis of malaria before providing treatment. Eight villages (480 children) will be included in each arm of the trial to enable detection of a 25% difference in the proportion of cases of febrile children given ACT in the intervention villages (RDT) compared to the control villages (no RDT) during either the malarial or non-malarial seasons at the 5% significance level with 90% power.</summary>
