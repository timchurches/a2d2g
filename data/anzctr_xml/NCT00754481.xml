Active Comparator: 1 - 

Experimental: 2 - 


Other interventions: Normothermia
Patients randomized to the Normothermia arm (esophageal temp 36.5-37.5 ºC) will be maintained at an esophageal temperature of 36.5-37.5ºC for 48 hours. Patients who are hypothermic (temperature &lt; 35 ºC) when randomized to the normothermia group will be rewarmed slowly using the servo-controlled mattress. Patients who are hyperthermic following randomization to the normothermia group will be actively cooled to normothermia using the servo-controlled mattress. Neuromuscular blockers will be administered as needed intravenously in both groups of patients to prevent shivering.

Other interventions: Hypothermia
Patients randomized to the Hypothermia arm (esophageal temp 33º to 34 °C) will be cooled rapidly using the cooling protocol developed for the Hypothermia Paediatric Head Injury Trial. A temperature probe will be placed in the esophagus and its position confirmed using a chest radiograph. Patients will be placed on a servo-controlled cooling blanket and covered in crushed ice (in sealed plastic bags covered by pillow cases) and a second cooling blanket. Once the esophageal temperature reaches 34.0ºC, the ice and second cooling blanket will be removed and esophageal temperature will be maintained at 33º to 34 °C for 48 hours using the servo-controlled cooling mattress. Patients treated with ECMO will be cooled using the extracorporeal circuit cooling-device. Rewarming will be done at a rate of 0.5 ºC every 2 hours until an esophageal temperature of 36.5 ºC is reached. Thereafter temperature will be recorded but not controlled by surface cooling.
