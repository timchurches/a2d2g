  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) 12 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR12) - SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ; ie, 25 IU/mL) at 12 weeks after stopping study treatment. For the Observation/SOF+RBV group, SVR12 during the observational period was defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ for 12 consecutive weeks, any time during the observational period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Posttreatment Week 12 (SOF+RBV) and up to 24 weeks (Observation)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With SVR at 4, 24, and 48 Weeks After Discontinuation of Therapy (SVR4, SVR24, and SVR48) - SVR4, SVR24, and SVR48 were defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at 4, 24, and 48 weeks after stopping study treatment, respectively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Posttreatment Weeks 4, 24, and 48</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Experiencing On-Treatment Virologic Failure - On-treatment virologic failure was defined as:
Breakthrough (confirmed HCV RNA = LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while on treatment), or
Rebound (confirmed &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL increase in HCV RNA from nadir while on treatment), or
Non-response (HCV RNA persistently = LLOQ through 8 weeks of treatment)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 48 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Experiencing Viral Relapse - Viral relapse was defined as HCV RNA = LLOQ during the post-treatment period having achieved HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at end of treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values or last available post-treatment measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to Posttreatment Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) at End of Treatment - HVPG closely reflects the degree of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis. The end of treatment for the Observation group was defined as the end of the observation period. The treatment period for Group 2 was defined as the end of the observation period to the end of the treatment. Baseline values were the last available values on or prior to first dose date of any study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline; Week 24 (Observation) and Week 48 (SOF+RBV)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) Score - CPT scores, widely used to grade the severity of cirrhosis and to determine the need for liver transplantation, are calculated based on a combination of laboratory values and clinical features. CPT scores can range from 5 to 15, with higher scores indicating a greater severity of disease. Data are presented as improvement, no change, or worsening in CPT scores at Week 24 (Observation) and Posttreatment Week 4 (SOF+RBV groups).
Improvement in CPT score was defined as having a decrease in CPT score from baseline, no change in CPT score was defined as having no change in CPT score from baseline, and worsening in CPT score was defined as having an increase in CPT score from baseline.
Baseline values were the last available values on or prior to first dose date of any study drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline; Week 24 (Observation) and Posttreatment Week 4 (SOF+RBV)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Scores - MELD scores, used to assess prognosis and suitability for transplant, are calculated based on laboratory values only and can range from 6 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Data are presented as improvement, no change, or worsening in MELD scores at Week 24 (Observation) and Posttreatment Week 4 (SOF+RBV groups).
Improvement in MELD score was defined as having a baseline MELD score of 11-15 or 16-20 that changed to 0-10, or a baseline MELD score of 16-20 that changed to 11-15; no change in MELD score was defined as having no change in score group (0-10, 11-15, or 16-20) from baseline; and worsening in MELD score was defined as having a baseline MELD score of 0-10 that changed to 11-15 or 16-20, or a baseline MELD score of 11-15 that changed to 16-20.
Baseline values were the last available values on or prior to first dose date of any study drug.</outcome>

    <summary>This study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy of combination therapy with sofosbuvir (SOF)
      plus ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks in adults with compensated and decompensated chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Approximately 50 adults will be randomized (1:1) to
