    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed and the participant has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The participant will receive a study enrolment number and this will be documented in the participantâ€™s medical record and on all study documents.
Allocation concealment - central randomization by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Only women will be randomized at study visit 1 after they have met the randomization criteria.  At this visit the participant will be randomised (computer generated sequence) to study treatment with either oestrogen or tamoxifen. Letrozole treatment will always be given last to avoid any carry-over effects.
Men will always receive tamoxifen first, followed by letrozole treatment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to understand how oestrogen controls the use of fat in the liver. The hypothesis is that oestrogen is required to prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. The mechanism may be direct or mediated by other hormones such as growth hormone, which is regulated by oestrogen. 
We wish to study the effects of oestrogen compounds called Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators (tamoxifen) and a drug that prevents oestrogen production (letrozole) on the secretion of growth hormone from the special gland in brain and how they control the liver production and burning of fat in men and women. We wish to compare these effects with that of natural oestrogen itself in women.</summary>
