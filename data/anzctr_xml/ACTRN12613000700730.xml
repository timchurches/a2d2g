    <studytitle>Vitamin D for correcting deficiency in adolescents: a general
practice-based randomised controlled trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Vitamin D deficient adolescents randomised to 50000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3 given orally monthly or 150000 IU of vitamin D3 given orally 3-monthly or placebo given monthly and 3-monthly, assessed by correcting vitamin D deficiency, feasibility of recruiting adolescents using general practice, and obtaining pilot bone density outcome data. </scientifictitle>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy adolescents aged 15-17 years.

No clinical signs of rickets.

No reason known to GP to prevent participation or which makes making contact with the young person inappropriate (there may be cases where for reasons of patient confidentiality the GP will not wish a letter to be sent to a young persons parents for example).

    <statisticalmethods>Based on our previous pilot study, we expect near total correction of mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency by a dose equivalent of 300,000IU orally of vitamin D3 over 6 months and that only 16% of children receiving placebo would correct their vitamin deficiency.  Assuming 10% drop out (i.e. 10 children remaining in each group at 12 months) and with statistical significance set at p&lt;0.05 (two-tailed), we have power of 0.85 to detect a difference in prevalence of deficiency between each vitamin D supplemented group and placebo of 70% i.e. between 90% of children no longer being deficient in vitamin D groups and 20% of children no longer being deficiency in the placebo group.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adolescents are at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency and are also a group who may not take medications regularly. The optimal dosage regimen for adolescents to help them take vitamin D regularly enough to correct deficiency is not known. Therefore the main aim of this study is to test two different vitamin D dosage regimens to see if they can both correct vitamin D deficiency in adolescents. The study will also show whether vitamin D deficient adolescents can be successfully identified through general practice and provide preliminary pilot data on whether correcting vitamin D deficiency results in significant improvements in bone density.</summary>
