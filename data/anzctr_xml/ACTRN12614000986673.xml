  <interventions>
    <interventions>Antecedent hypoglycaemic episodes will be induced using a glucose-insulin clamp. An insulin infusion will be commenced based on body surface area at 125 mU/m^2/min then titrated over 10 minutes to a maintenance rate of 40mU/m^2/min and will remain constant for 60 mins. The rate of a concurrently run infusion of glucose (25%) will be varied to maintain blood glucose at the desired level. During this time blood glucose level will be monitored every 5 mins and every 15 mins following the hypoglycaemic episode. This will be repeated 4 times on the antecedent hypoglycaemic visit. Whereas during the euglycaemic visit there will only be one induced hypoglycaemic episode. Each visit will last approximately 27 hours and will take place at least 6 weeks apart.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To measure whether antecedent episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia attenuate the normal acceleration of gastric emptying induced by hypoglycaemia, a mixed standardised meal (consisting of 100g minced beef (25g protein, 21g fat, ~270Kcal) will be labelled with 20 MBq 99mTechnitium-sulphur colloid. Scintigraphy (radioisotopic) data will be acquired in 1-min frames for 180-minutes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Radioisotopic data will be acquired in 1-min frames for 180-minutes on two occasions on each study visit. This data will be collected at 0 and 24 hours when the test meal is given.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether antecedent episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia attenuate the 'normal' increased rate of glucose absorption induced by hypoglycaemia. Blood will be sampled intravenously and glucose absorption will be assessed using plasma 3-O-methyl-D-gluco-pyranose (3-OMG). Blood (total 100ml) will be collected following the test meal (beef patty). Intravenous blood will be collected and centrifuged and the plasma will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius until analysed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3-OMG samples will be taken every 15 minutes for the first hour and every half hour for the subsequent two hours during the scintigraphy.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether antecedent episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycaemia attenuate the 'normal' catecholamine, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide secretion induced by hypoglycaemia. Intravenous blood will be collected, centrifuged and the plasma will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius until analysed for catecholamines, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intravenous blood will be taken for catecholamines, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide at 30 mins intervals for an hour (T=-15, 15, 30) during each clamp (hypoglycaemic/euglycaemic episode).
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether antecedent episodes of hypoglycaemia effects autnonomic nerve function. Autonomic nerve function will be examined using blood pressure and electrocardiogram data (using R-R interval change in response to deep breathing).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Autonomic Nerve function will be assessed twice on each study visit during the first and fourth clamp.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether antecedent episodes of hypoglycaemia effects cardiac function. Cardiac function will be assessed using a 12 lead ECG will be performed twice on each study visit and 4-chamber view echocardiography, which will be performed every 30 mins during each clamp.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cardiac function will be assessed twice on each study visit during the first and fourth clamp.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The participant number for this study was determined based on statistical power from previous studies. Clinical and statistical assumptions for this study is based on Plummer et al. 2014 (Glucagon-like peptide 1 attenuates the acceleration of gastric emptying induced by hypoglycemia in healthy subjects; Diabetes Care) which assessed similar outcomes (P&lt;0.001). The sample size of 15 healthy volunteers was selected based on a power calculation using this data.  We believe that 15 volunteers will have the statistical power required to detect a significant difference between the groups (P&lt;0.05). Outcome variables will be analysed using an appropriate statistical methods.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes is a disorder of blood sugar and requires treatment for high blood sugar levels using drugs such as insulin. However, treatments like insulin can cause excessively low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia). If unrecognised and untreated hypoglycaemia can induce a coma. To protect against hypoglycaemia certain physiological responses occur. These include release of hormones that break down stores of sugar within the body and emptying the stomach quicker so that nutrient can be absorbed more rapidly. Both physiological responses will increase blood sugar levels. Recent evidence suggests that episodes of low blood sugar levels impair the hormonal response to subsequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, but the effect of these antecedent episodes of hypoglycaemia on gastric emptying rate during subsequent hypoglycaemia is unknown.

This study aims to investigate whether there are changes in gastric emptying following repeated hypoglycaemic episodes. In addition this study will assess changes in glucose absorption, autonomic nerve function, secretion of catecholamine, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide and cardiac function.

Null hypothesis:
Recurrent hypoglycaemia does not effect hypoglycaemia-induced acceleration of gastric emptying.</summary>
