  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) at 5 years - IBTR is defined as biopsy-proven reappearance of cancer in the treated breast. IBTR will be assessed at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Year 2, and then annually through ten (10) year follow-up. A non-inferiority comparison to whole breast irradiation will be made at 5 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Change from baseline reported at 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the rate of regional breast tumor recurrence (RBTR) - Regional breast tumor recurrence is defined as biopsy-proven reappearance of cancer in the axilla. Regional recurrence will be assessed at Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Year 2, and then annually through ten (10) year follow-up. Regional recurrence rates will be compared to the historical control of WBI at 5 and 10 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Report at 10 yrs</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Free Survival Rate (DFSR) and Overall Survival rate - Disease free survival (DFS) is defined as the length of time from IORT to any first recurrence. The incidence of disease free survival will be assessed at Month 1, Month 6, Month 12, Month 18, Year 2, and then annually through ten (10) year follow-up.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cosmetic Outcome - Cosmetic outcome will be recorded at baseline, Month 12, Month 18, Year 2, and then annually through ten (10) year follow-up. a. Physician evaluation will be done using the Harvard Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Report at 5 and 10 yrs</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Xoft Axxent eBx System
      when used for single-fraction IORT in early stage breast cancer. Hypothesis: IORT using the
      Xoft Axxent eBx System is no worse (non-inferior) than whole breast irradiation (WBI) when
      used as stand-alone radiation treatment in breast conserving therapy in women with early
      stage breast cancer.</summary>
