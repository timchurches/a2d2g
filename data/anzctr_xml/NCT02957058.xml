  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - SCAR technique

Active Comparator: SERT 0, SCAR (low risk) - Patients with Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool (SERT scoring) score 0. These patients will be invited to return for follow up at 18 months and will have thermal ablation (SCAR technique) of the endoscopic resection defect margin.

Active Comparator: SERT 1-4, SCAR (high risk) - Patients with Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool score 1-4 (SERT scoring). These patients will be invited to return for follow up at 4-6 months and will have thermal ablation (SCAR technique) of the endoscopic resection defect margin.


Treatment: surgery: SCAR technique
Thermal ablation of the EMR margin using ERBE Soft Coagulation (Effect 4, 80 watts) and the operator choice of endoscopic resection snare

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To prospectively validate the SERT (Sydney EMR Recurrence Tool) scoring system for adenoma
      recurrence rates around the endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) scar after wide field-EMR with
      thermal treatment applied to the defect margin. The primary aim of the study will be to
      ensure the safety of this approach and there will be constant monitoring to ensure that this
      is the case.</summary>
