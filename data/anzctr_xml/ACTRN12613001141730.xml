  <interventions>
    <interventions>Quantitative CT software provides the ability to measure airway wall thickness on chest CT images, which is a potentially useful measure of airway obstruction. We intend to analyse participants' CT images using quantitative CT to determine airway wall thickness and attenuation values in the individual lobes. We hope to add these variables to the conventional measures used to predict postoperative outcomes in order to determine if this will be a useful tool to contribute to the prediction of postoperative outcomes. The CT images which will be used include a preoperative CT scan as well as a low-dose CT scan 6 months postoperatively for each patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>All participants in this study will be receiving the usual standard of clinical care with respect to the treatment of their lung cancer. We will only be selecting patients who will be undergoing resection of their lung cancer. The use of quantitative CT measures will therefore be compared to the usual tests used to determine eligibility for surgery (pulmonary function tests and six minute walk distance). These tests will be performed preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical power was calculated by assuming that linear regression will be used to determine the association between Pi10, which is a measure of airway wall thickness, and quality of life, represented by the EORTC QLQ-C30 score. The estimated standard deviations for these variables were determined based on previous studies by other investigators. We determined that a sample size of 50 would be sufficient to provide 80% power at a significance level of 0.05.

We intend to employ multiple regression to determine the effect of multiple variables (such as pulmonary function tests, six minute walk distance, airway wall thickness) on quality of life scores and mortality. Linear regression will be used to determine the accuracy of prediction of postoperative lung function based on quantitative CT measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating whether quantitative computed tomography (CT) can enable us to more accurately predict postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer for which you will undergo lung resection surgery.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive standard care by their treating physicians and quantitative CT software will be used to analyse their CT images. Quantitative CT provides the ability to measure airway wall thickness on chest CT images, which is a potentially useful measure of airway obstruction. We hope to add these variables to the conventional measures used to predict postoperative outcomes in order to determine if this will be a useful tool to contribute to the prediction of postoperative outcomes, including quality of life and mortality. Prediction of postoperative outcomes following lung resection for lung cancer is important because it enables the selection of suitable surgical candidates.</summary>
