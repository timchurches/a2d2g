  <interventions>
    <interventions>ProSeal (TM) laryngeal mask airway.
The airway device will be inserted once the patient is anaesthetised, using a "railroad" technique over a bougie placed in the oesophagus by laryngoscopy.
The cuff will be inflated and the pressure adjusted to 60 cmH20 using a hand pressure gauge.
The airway device will remain in place for the duration of the surgical procedure.  The device will be removed from the airway immediately prior to emergence from general anaesthesia.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Mallinckrodt endo-tracheal tube.
Following the induction of general anaesthesia, the patient will have a laryngoscopy performed, and then a standard size 7mm endotracheal tube will be inserted into the trachea.  The cuff will be inflated and the pressure checked at 20 cmH20 using a hand pressure gauge.
The airway device will remain in place for the duration of the surgical procedure.  The device will be removed from the airway  immediately prior to emergence from general anaesthesia.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-operative pain
A verbal analogue scale (VAS) pain score will be recorded.
A quantitative assessment will be made of the consumption of analgesics prescribed on an as needed basis (prn) - morphine in the first two hours and oxycodone thereafter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours and 24 hours post-operatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-operative nausea and vomiting
The patient will be asked if they have suffered from nausea (yes/no) or vomiting (yes/no).  Also, whether they have required any antiemetic medications to be administered and whether they have been effective.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours and 24 hours post-operatively</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-operative sore throat
Patients will be asked whether they have a sore throat (yes/no)</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours and 24 hours post-operatively</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-operative hoarse voice
Patients will be asked if they have a hoarse voice (yes/no)</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 hours and 24 hours post-operatively</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial aims to assess whether in women undergoing simple gynaecological laparoscopy, the Proseal (TM) airway device reduces post-operative pain and/or nausea and vomiting.  We will also assess whether the device reduces sore throat or hoarse voice.</summary>
