  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 3 arms to this trial. Arm 1: 'Cascade', a cognitive-behavioural intervention. Arm 2: Peer Support Group (PSG) who will receive supportive counselling. Arm 3: will be randomised to a 6-month waitlist until the post-intervention assessments of the other groups are complete, at which point they will be randomly allocated to one of the other two arms. 'Cascade' will be delivered in 4 x 90-minute group sessions, delivered weekly over the internet using web-conferencing technology by a clinical psychologist. These sessions will focus on the acquisition and application of cognitive-behavioural skills, such as cognitive restructuring and problem-solving, and the experience of returning to normality post cancer treatment. Participants in the Cascade and PSG arms will receive a one hour, online booster session with the same facilitator who delivered their intervention. The intervention will be offered to parents and carers of children aged under 18 years who are post active treatment. For adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15-25 years 1-12 months post active treatment is registered here http://www.anzctr.org.au/ACTRN12610000717055.aspx </interventions>
    <comparator>The Peer Support group condition uses the same group format, delivered over the internet by a clinical psychologist for four, weekly, 90 minute sessions. This therapy includes nondirective supportive counselling that does not include any Cognitive Behaviour Therapy components, but will instead simply give parents and carers of young cancer survivors an open forum to discuss their experience, similar to that offered in facilitated peer support groups. The intervention will be offered to parents and carers of children aged under 18 years who have completed active cancer treatment. Participants randomised to both Cascade and the Peer Support Group condition will receive a one hour, online booster session with the same facilitator who delivered their intervention. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eligible participants will be parents/carers of children who are &lt;18 years old and have finished cancer treatment with curative intent. Parents will be (1) Fluent in English; (2) Able to access the internet; (3) Not at risk of self-harm/psychosis (assessed during the initial clinical screen). Only one parent/carer from each family will be eligible to minimise clinical/logistical challenges. Parents of children who have previously relapsed (and are finished treatment with curative intent) will be eligible. However, if a child relapses or dies during the study, their parents will be referred to individual support. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Individuals may not participate if they 
(1) cannot speak English;
(2) exhibit suicidal intent, psychotic features, or substance dependence;
(3) their child is receiving active treatment, or palliative care. This includes if a child has recently relapsed and is still in active treatment; they and their family will be excluded, as their needs will be difficult to manage within the protocol, and their inclusion might also negatively affect others in their group.</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential parents/carers will be sent a personalised invitation letter, consent form and opt-in card by their oncologist. The study coordinator will contact all parents who opt in to the study to conduct a brief validated screen related to self-harm and psychosis risk and request that they sign a written contract agreeing to use the provided equipment solely for the study and to address internet access issues (e.g. extending existing internet contracts/increasing download limits, claiming cost reimbursement). Participants will be randomly allocated to either Cascade, a peer support group, or a wait-list condition using an electronic randomiser implemented by independent personnel. Group allocation will occur at an off-site location, thus ensuring allocation concealment during the process of determining participant eligibility. Participants will be blinded to their intervention assignment, as both arms of the trial will be referred to as a 'peer support and education group for parents of young cancer survivors off-treatment'. This study will be managed in ‘blocks’ of 12 weeks, whereby participants are invited in groups, and managed through the program together. Participants will be sent a hired (insured) laptop two weeks before commencement of their group. This process will ensure equity (all participants receive identical equipment), minimise technical challenges (required software is pre-installed) and maximise security (security settings are pre-set by the technical support person). All equipment will be returned after study participation. Participants allocated to each of the three arms will complete their questionnaires on the same time schedule. </concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using an electronic randomiser (using a random number system) implemented by independent personnel located at a distant site from the primary researchers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of a psychological therapy designed to support parents and carers of children and young people with cancer to make a positive transition to life after treatment completion. Who is it for? You can join this study if you are the parent of a young cancer survivor aged under 18 years who has finished treatment for either a primary or secondary cancer. Trial details: Participants will be divided into three groups. One group will take part in 'Cascade', a cognitive-behavioural program designed to help people build skills to return to normality after cancer treatment. This will take place in four 90-minute group sessions, delivered weekly over the internet. The second group will take part in an open discussion forum with the same schedule. The third group will be allocated to a waitlist before participating in one of the interventions. The study aims to monitor the distress, psychological adjustment and coping after cancer treatment. Participants complete several questionnaires and will be followed up for 6 months after participating in the online groups. </summary>
