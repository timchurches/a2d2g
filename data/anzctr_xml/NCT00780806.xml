          -  A known hypersensitivity to any study vaccine components.

          -  A known or suspected disease of the immune system or those receiving immunosuppressive
             therapy, including systemic corticosteroids (excluding topical, inhalation and
             intra-articular corticosteroids).

          -  Bleeding diathesis or condition associated with prolonged bleeding time that would

          -  Any clinically significant chronic disease that, in the investigator's judgment may be
             worsened by blood draw.

          -  Received any investigational drug, vaccine or device within the 30-day period before
             study visit 1 and during the conduct of the study.
