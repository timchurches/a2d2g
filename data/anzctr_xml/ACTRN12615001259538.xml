  <interventions>
    <interventions>Four diets: (1) WeetBix (47.3 g)
(2) WeetBix (47.3 g) + Kiwifruit (200 g)
(3) WeetBix (47.3 g) + Guar gum (10 g)
(4) WeetBix (47.3 g) + Guar gum (10 g) + kiwifruit (200 g)

Duration: Participants were given 15 minutes to consume each breakfast.
Frequency: Participants consumed each breakfast one morning a week, over a period of four weeks.  Each breakfast (1-4) was only consumed once by each participant. 

The wash out period was one week for each participant, and they were asked to fast for 12 hours before each trial, to eliminate the effects of other food on glucose levels. </interventions>

      <outcome>Blood glucose concentration</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood glucose was tested at: 0 mins (pre=breakfast - Breakfast was consumed straight after the first blood glucose test). The following blood tests were taken post-breakfast at; 20 mins, 40 mins, 60 mins, 90 mins, 120 mins, 150 mins, and 180 mins. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive performance was tested using computer generated tests. The five cognitive measures used were: Choice Reaction Time, Stroop, Trail Making B, Word Recall, and Serial Sevens. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The first round of cognitive tests were assessed pre-diet at zero mins. The breakfast was consumed at 15 mins, and the second round of cognitive tests were completed at 90 mins, and the third at 180 mins. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial involves 20 subjects who each have to consume one breakfast per week over 4 weeks, in random order. The 4 breakfasts are: (1) weetbix, (2) weetbix + guar gum (a widely used food grade ingredient), (3) weetbix + kiwifruit, and (4) weetbix + kiwifruit + guar gum. They then have to have 7  small diabetic-type finger prick tests of blood glucose over a period of three hours and do three short cognitive tests of brain function. 
The aim of the study is to determine whether or not kiwifruit, and kiwifruit interacting with guar gum leads to an attenuation of the glycaemic response that helps sustain cognitive performance several hours after a meal.</summary>
