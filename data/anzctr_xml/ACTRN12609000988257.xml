  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a very common condition that interrupts
feeding and sleep routine in up to 30% of newborn infants. GOR disease affects
3-5% of newborns and is defined when more serious complications are associated
with GOR. Typical GOR disease symptoms include vomiting, failure to thrive, pain,
irritability/crying/back-arching), oesophagitis and respiratory disorders
(apnoea/coughing). The diagnosis and treatment of GOR disease in infants is
fraught with difficulty due to the wide range of clinical presentations and the lack of
diagnostic modalities and appropriate diagnostic criteria. These issues lead to
failure to accurately diagnose reflux disease, allowing more severe problems to
manifest, or alternatively, over-diagnosis of reflux disease leading to the
prescription of unnecessary and costly acid suppression therapies and surgical
interventions.
This research project will evaluate positioning as a simple,
non-pharmacological approach to the treatment of GOR related symptoms in
infants 0-6months of age. We believe that position control therapy (PCT) is simple for parents to perform and can be safely combined with pharmacological therapy for added efficacy.</summary>
