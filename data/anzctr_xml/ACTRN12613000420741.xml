  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention 1
The training with 6-10 senior care staff involves 5 sessions over 11 weeks. Session 1, 2 and 3 are run one week apart. Session 4 is 4 weeks after session 3 and the booster session is run 4 weeks after session 4. 
Session 1: Depression and Workplace Environment looks at screening, communication, referral and workplace strengths and challenges (2 hours)
Session 2: Challenging Behaviours looks at possible causes, and an Assessment and Management Tool for Staff (2 hours)
Session 3: Staff as Change Agents looks at key characteristics and behaviours for facilitating change (2 hours)
Session 4: Sustaining Mental Health in Aged Care looks at how to develop a workplace environment framework that supports mental health protocols (2 hours)
Booster Session: The content and activity will be driven by each individual facilitys needs, with the aim being to provide additional support and practice for the team leaders and participants driving the new initiatives (1.5 hours)

Intervention 2
The training will run exactly the same as in intervention 1. Once training is complete and care staff have completed their post-training questionnaires, a clinical psychologist, provided by the research project, will be situated with each facility for approximately one day per week for a six month period. Their role will be to provide clinical support to care staff to assist them with the roll out of the strategy to better recognise and manage depression and BPSD among care recipients. 


</interventions>
    <comparator>Over approximately 12 months facilities in the control group will participate in the research project and complete all the staff and resident measures and without staff training or additional clinical support. After all the measures are complete care staff will participate in the training program as outlined in Intervention 1.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>For analysis of differences in facilities at baseline, analysis of variance will be used, with Fishers Exact test for analysing categorical variables. For changes over time, repeated measures multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA; controlling for group baseline scores on outcome measures) will be used for our continuous measures associated with staff outcomes. Longitudinal Configural Frequency Analysis (CFA) will be used to analyse change in categorical variables such as number of depression and BPSD referrals prior, immediate post training, at 6-month and at 12-month training follow-up. CFA is a technique analogous to repeated measures MANCOVA that allows for the estimation of trends and group differences over time but for categorical variables. Allowing for a 20% attrition rate  a rate of attrition common in our past studies  we have calculated that we will maintain at least 28 staff and 96 residents per condition at 12-month follow-up. Based on our estimated sample size in each of the conditions at 12-month follow-up, and with the expectation of a small-to-moderate effect size d = .20, the power of the analyses for aged care resident data is calculated at 0.99, and for the staff data at .91 at the two-sided significance level of a = .05 for both our mean difference testing and categorical analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is designed to improve the skills of aged care staff in responding to mental health concerns, and to develop sustainable mental health management protocols within aged care facilities. The research project will assist us to assess the impact of a staff training program that aims to help staff to better detect and manage depression and the challenging behaviours associated with dementia. Hypothesis: Targeting core organisational barriers and staff screening skills to the provision of mental health care will improve implementation of strategies to better manage both depression and BPSD among older adults in aged care. </summary>
