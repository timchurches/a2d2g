  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomized to receive either a placebo or colchicine commenced between 24 and 72 hours  prior to surgery, decided at the clinical discretion of the treating physician. and continued for 1 month after surgery. Colchicine/placebo will be given as 0.5 mg once daily without a loading dose. Colchicine/placebo will be provided by gastric tube in unconscious postoperative patients in intensive care units. Adherence will be determined on the basis of counts of pills in dispensed boxes with a target of at least 80% adherence.  Blood samples  will be taken prior to and up to 3 days after coronary artery bypass surgery. They will then have one routine follow-up at 6 weeks to have a physical examination, an ECG and an echocardiogram. </interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be randomized  to receive placebo (Formulation: LACTOSE (SUPER-TAB), MAIZE STARCH, POVIDONE K, MAGNESIUM STEARATE) or colchicine 0.5 mg once daily. This will be commenced between 24 and 72 hours before surgery and continued for 1 month after surgery. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment groups by a central computerbased automated sequence. All participants and trial investigators will be blinded to randomized treatment. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of significant post-operative myocardial injury defined as high sensitivity troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels &gt; 10 x the upper limit of normal  assessed from plasma samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serial rise in Troponin I from pre-operatively, to 6-12 hours and day 1,2 &amp; 3 post cardiac surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The extent of post-operative myocardial injury defined as a) peak plasma hs-cTnI levels in the first 72 hours after surgery, b) mean plasma hs-cTnI levels in the first 72 hours after surgery and c) the area under the curve for hs-cTnI release within the first 72 hours after surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Serial rise in Troponin I from pre-operatively, to 6-12 hours and day 1,2 &amp; 3 post cardiac surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of post-pericardiotomy syndrome (PPS):

The diagnosis of PPS will be based on the presence of two or more of the following criteria 
(1) Fever without alternative causes lasting beyond the first post-operative week
(2) Pleuritic chest pain 
(3) Friction rub
(4) Pericardial effusion, and/or 
(5) Pleural effusion 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 3 months of cardiac surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The need for pericardial or pleural drainage

Clinically significant effusions will be the defined as those requiring drainage.
A semi quantitative assessment of pericardial effusion will also be documented
1. A small effusion will be considered as an echo-free space (anterior plus posterior) of less than 10 mm 
2. A moderate effusion will be an echo-free pericardial space of 10 to 20 mm, and 
3. A large effusion will be an echo-free space more than 20 mm. 
Pericardial effusion echo-free spaces will be measured at the onset of the QRS complex (end of diastole). The study will also assess the presence or absence of pleural effusion and the need for thoracentesis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 3 months of cardiac surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of new onset atrial fibrillation within 30 days of cardiac surgery in patients in sinus rhythm pre-operatively. 

Postoperative atrial fibrillation will be defined as atrial fibrillation lasting for more than 30 seconds. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring will be adopted for as long as the patient is in the intensive care facility. Twelve lead ECGs are recommended daily and more frequently at the discretion of the treating physicians for symptoms or clinically suspected arrhythmia. Clinical data (e.g., onset time, symptoms, treatments, and duration) and confirmatory rhythm strips or 12- lead ECGs will be collected for all postoperative arrhythmias of at least 30 seconds' duration.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>AIMS:
The aim of the vanguard Co-POC trial is to assess the safety and feasibility of the trial protocol and to obtain important preliminary data on the effect that colchicine 0.5mg once daily for up to 3 days pre-operatively and 30 days post-operatively has on the incidence and extent of post-operative myocardial injury after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

DESIGN AND METHODS:
The Co-POC vanguard trial is a RCT of colchicine v placebo nested in the Australian VISION Cardiac Surgery cohort. Eligible patients recruited into the VISION Cardiac Surgery study who are undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery will be offered the opportunity to participate in the vanguard Co-POC trial. We will recruit 204 patients into this pilot trial (1:1 recruitment).

Patients will be randomised to colchicine 0.5mg once daily or matching placebo. Treatment will be commenced 3 days prior to surgery (but can be commenced up to 24 hours pre-operatively if necessary) and will be continued for 1 month after surgery. Medications will be provided by Aspen Pharmacare Australia according to the US Food and Drug Administration current good manufacturing practice regulations. All concomitant medications will be provided at the discretion of treating clinicians and in keeping with clinical guidelines. Patients will have blood samples collected for hs-cTnI &lt;4 hours pre-operatively and post-operatively at 6-12 hours and on days 1 to 3 (in keeping with the VISION Cardiac Surgery protocol).

Analysis plan: All analyses will be by intention to treat. Groups will be compared using the Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests as appropriate. Kaplan Meier curves will be used to demonstrate event free survival and groups compared using the log-rank test.</summary>
