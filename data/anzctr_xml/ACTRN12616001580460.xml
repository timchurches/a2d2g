  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study treatment consists in a single intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral blood T-lymphocytes transduced with the anti-LeY-scFv-CD28-zeta vector.
The study involves initial pre-screening of tumour tissue for Lewis Y expression to assess patient eligibility for the study protocol. If eligible, the patient will undergo leukapheresis as soon as possible (within 14 days), followed by lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy and then infusion of LeY CAR T cells. Patients will then have follow up for assessment and management of adverse events and evaluation of response. 
## Leukapheresis (14 days from Infusion) Leukapheresis should be scheduled as soon as possible after registration (14 days of registration). Venous access is required for leukapheresis and should be determined according to institutional practice. For the MNC collection an initial apheresis cycle is to be performed to obtain sufficient quantity of PBMCs to generate LeY CAR T cells. If there is an insufficient yield of PBMC following the apheresis, initiation of the cell culture will not proceed. However, the patient may undergo further apheresis procedures. If a sufficient number of PBMC cannot be achieved with a maximum of five collections, the patient may be withdrawn from the study.The turnaround time for the transduction of the Tcells is 12 days
## Lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy (within 7 days from Infusion) this is not standard of care. To increase immunosuppression and improve persistence of engineered T-cells, patients will receive fludarabine before re-infusion of the transduced T-cells. Upon notification from the sponsor that LeY CAR T cells will be available, Lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy should be initiated so as to finish at least 48 hours prior to LeY CAR T cells administration. Patients will receive intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) for 2 consecutive days prior to cell infusion. Chemotherapy should be started within 7 days of re-infusion of the T-cell product (day 0).  Alternative lymphodepleting schedules may be investigated in discussion with the DSMC.
## Re-Infusion of LeY CAR T cell(Day0)
After the date of infusion of the LeY CAR T cells has been determined, generation of the LeY CAR T-cell product will proceed. LeY CAR T cells are an autologous cellular immunotherapy product containing T cells that have undergone ex vivo activation, gene modification, expansion and formulation in re-infusion medium (normal saline with 5% Albumex 20). LeY CAR T cells will be administered according to the dose level to which the patient is assigned.Decisions to modify the dose increments or the number of patients in each dosing cohort may be made at the discretion of the principal investigator in conjunction with the DSMC in the event of adverse events observed among any patients during dose escalation at an unexpected high incidence or severity. It may also be possible to explore additional dose levels.

##Concomitant treatment will consist of prophylaxis of hypersensitivity reactions to the infusion of the T-cell product by intake of 10 mg of loratadine (oral tablets) or Phenergan (25mg oral or IV) and 1g of paracetamol (oral tablets) 30 minutes prior to the infusion. Whether loratadine or phenergen is administered will be in the the opinion of the treating physician.


Only one patient can be treated with the T cell product at any given time point during the dose escalation. No additional patients can progress to T cell infusion until the current patient is 2 or more weeks post infusion during the dose escalation phase.
Initially 3 patients will be enrolled into a cohort, starting at dose level cohort 1.
#If 0/3 patients report a DLT within the observation period (28 days following infusion of LeY CAR T cells) then 3 patients will be enrolled at one dose level above. If current dose is dose level -1 or dose level 4 then a further 3 patients will be enrolled at the current dose level.
# If 1/3 patients report a DLT within the observation period then a further 3 patients will be enrolled at the current dose level.
#If 1/6 patients report a DLT within the observation period:
- If current dose level was a dose reduction or if it is dose level 4 then the current dose level will be declared the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
- If current dose level was not a dose reduction nor is dose level 4 then 3 patients will be enrolled at one dose level above
#If greater than or equal to 2/6 patients report a DLT within the observation period:
- If current dose level is dose level -1, the trial will be stopped
- If 6 patients were treated at one dose level below, declare one dose below as MTD.
- If 0 or 3 patients were enrolled one dose level below, then three patients will be enrolled at one dose level below.
If greater than or equal to 2/3 patients report a DLT within the observation period:
-If current dose level is dose level -1, the trial will be stopped
- If 6 patients were treated at one dose level below, declare one dose below as MTD.
-If 0 or 3 patients were enrolled one dose level below, then three patients will be enrolled at one dose level below.

    <statisticalmethods>Dose escalation phase: The sample size has been determined to allow completion of the escalation phase with a minimum of 3 patients per cohort. Allowance will be made for the possibility that adequate cell numbers will not be collected so escalation to a higher dose level will not occur until 3 patients have been treated at the current dose level with the intended number of T cells. In the event of all four dose levels being tested, there could be at least 12 patients with adequate cell numbers in the dose escalation phase (3 patients at each of 4 dose levels).
If patients are treated with fewer cells than intended, they will still have all study related assessments, but will not be included in the assessment of that dose level. If the patient has greater cells than a previously tested dose level, they will be summarised as part of that dose level cohort for the statistical analysis reporting at the conclusion of the study.If 0 of 4 patients treated at a dose level is able to achieve the specified cell number the feasibility of that dose level will be reviewed by the DSMC and enrolment at a lower dose level will be considered. Dose expansion phase: Following determination of the maximum tolerated dose, further patients will be accrued. The sample size is limited by technical and logistic reasons, so the maximum number of patients to receive the T-cell product is limited to 30. If, for example, the MTD is determined from 12 patients, up to 18 patients may be in the expansion phase. It is possible that the dose escalation phase may require &gt;12 patients, depending on the occurrence of DLTs and inadequate cell numbers being collected from some patients, therefore leaving a sample size of &lt;18 for the expansion phase.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test the safety, tolerability and effectiveness of an experimental treatment called LeY CAR-T cell therapyin treating solid tumours that carry the Lewis Y marker. 
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have an advanced solid tumour that is positive for the Lewis Y antigen.
Study details
The Lewis Y antigen is a molecule that coats the surface of a cancer cell and is not usually detected by T-cells. The LeY CAR-T cell therapy may help the T-cells to find and destroy the cancer cells more easily. In this study, the T-cells will first be collected using a procedure called Apheresis that takes part before the study treatment. Apheresis collects some of the white blood cells (also called Leukocytes) including T-Cells from the blood. The collected T-cells will then be modified in the laboratory by a viral vector, to specifically target the cancer cells that have the Lewis Y marker on their surface.
After T-cells have been modified, the viral vector will be separated from modified T-cells and removed. Modified T-cells can now be called CAR-T cells. The finished LeY CAR-T cells will then be infused back into the body, without the viral vector.
As well as the LeY CAR-T cell therapy, patients will receive by lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy as intravenous fludarabine for 2 consecutive days prior to cell infusion to increase immunosuppression and improve persistence of engineered T-cells.
LeY CAR-T cell therapy is an experimental treatment. This means that it is not an approved treatment for LeY expressing solid tumours in Australia.
