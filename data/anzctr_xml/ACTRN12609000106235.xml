  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment Group patients will be assessed on a single occasion by a physiotherapist within a few hours of their inclusion into the study. This physiotherapist will provide appropriate treatment based on their assessment findings. This treatment may include education/advice, provision of mobility aids, prescription of exercises and organising appropriate community equipment/resources. This assessment/treatment intervention will last as long as the physiotherapist deems necessary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group patients will receive the usual medical/nursing care provided to Emergency Extended Care Unit (EECU) patients and allowed to go home, or be admitted to hospital if deemed appropriate, with no alteration to the usual discharge/admission plan formulated by medical/nursing staff in EECU.</comparator>

    <concealment>After satisfying the selection criteria, potential participants will be approached by the principal investigator regarding participation. The principal investigator will explain the project aims and format to them, provide them with the written information sheet and, after allowing them time to consider whether or not they wish to participate, obtain informed written consent from those patients willing to participate. Once consent has been obtained, patients will be assigned to the treatment or control group by referring to sequential sealed opaque envelopes kept in the Physiotherapy Department.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated random numbers table will be used to generate group allocations.</sequence>
