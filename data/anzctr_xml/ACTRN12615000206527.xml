  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nasal high flow oxygen therapy has been widely investigated in many areas of in-hospital patient care. It can deliver up to 60L/min of humidified air and oxygen. Documented mechanisms of action for high flow include dead space clearance and washout, splinting of the upper airway and maintaining pulmonary conductance and compliance. Participants undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy will be deemed 'high' or 'low' risk by treating anaesthetist, as per standard practice at this institution.

'Low' risk participants will receive light sedation and local anaesthetic for their bronchoscopy. Participants in this group will be randomised to receive either High Flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy at 60L/min or standard practice low flow oxygen therapy via nasal cannula or bite block (decision on nasal cannula vs. bite block will be at the discretion of the treating physician) for the duration of their bronchoscopy procedure and in recovery. Observational 'High' risk participants will receive general anaesthesia and a dedicated airway (LMA). Standard oxygen therapy will be administered during recovery. Study period will be approximately two hours for procedure and recovery time. Time will vary depending on bronchoscopy findings.

Continuous haemodynamics, pharyngeal pressures and electrical impedance tomography, specifically end expiratory lung volumes, will be monitored. Additionally, time in and out of recovery will be documented as well as patient/staff satisfaction survey recorded. </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator 'Low' risk participants will receive light sedation and local anaesthetic for their bronchoscopy. Participants in this group will receive standard practice low flow oxygen therapy at 6L/min via nasal cannula or bite block for the duration of their procedure and recovery.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High flow oxygen therapy has been successfully trialled in a multitude of clinical scenarios. High flow oxygen therapy is known to provide more support than standard methods of oxygen delivery. This study aims to trial and assess the use of high flow as respiratory support during bronchoscopy as an alternative method to standard practice. We aim to establish whether high flow maintains end expiratory lung volume and improves other physiological parameters. </summary>
