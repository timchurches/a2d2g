  <interventions>
    <interventions>Training was done with a virtual reality system (IREX) in a standing posture to work balance, reaching and mobility. Participants completed 10 sessions (roughly 1 hour long) which provided them with 10 to 33 minutes of actual playing time due to rests. Sessions were booked daily throughout the week for 2 consecutive weeks. Games were selected to challenge standing weight-bearing and transfer as well as controlled shifting of the centre of mass. For example, participants were in a virtual soccer net and were instructed to save the virtual soccer balls that appeared on the screen by leaning side to side and reaching to save the balls. Participants were supervised by a registered kinesiologist who ensured proper training levels and closely monitored participants by standing arms reach away from the physio belt around the participants waist at all times to ensure no falls. Daily VR training sheets were completed to monitor progression in the games, amount of time spent playing games as well as adherence to the program.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group completed daily (Monday-Friday) sessions for 2 weeks for a total of 10 sessions (each roughly 1 hour long) with the same virtual reality system (IREX) as the intervention group, but participated in a seated position. Interactions with virtual objects by participants in the control group did not challenge balance and was limited to movements that did not shift the base of seated support. Sessions were monitored by a registered kinesiologist to ensure limited movements but yet and enjoyable, safe time for participants. Daily VR training sheets were completed to monitor progression in the games, amount of time spent playing games as well as adherence to the program.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The recruitment process involved the introduction of the study to a suitable patient by the admitting physician and/or primary care nurse. The patient then gave verbal permission to be contacted by the study’s research associate (RA) to hear further details about the project. Written consent was obtained after detailing the study’s protocol and requirements and the patient’s chart was consulted for relevant medical and demographical information. The participant's information was then sent through email to an off-site researcher for central randomisation. The group allocation was then only sent to the kinesiologist that would be doing the training. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization of the first 37 participants occurred using the coin flip method while the second half were additionally randomized using age and Berg Balance Scale score to minimize of group differences. Both the RA and the participants were blind to the study’s group allocation to safeguard against any potential bias. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Virtual reality exercise therapy  similar to participating in a video game, only using the whole body  has been used for rehabilitation of stroke, spinal cord injury, Parkinsons disease and traumatic brain injury. It has been shown to improve balance in patients with traumatic brain injuries and older adults. Studies of virtual reality training in stroke patients have shown similar benefits for balance and walking. The objective of this study is to compare the effects of training in a virtual environment in two positions (seated vs standing) while participants are also doing in-patient stroke rehabilitation. We hypothesize that virtual reality exercise therapy improves balance, weight bearing on the affected side, walking tolerance and certain aspects of function for those that train standing up. We also hypothesize that it is a safe and enjoyable activity for addition to the stroke rehabilitation program.</summary>
