  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Patients Experiencing at Least One Adverse Event (AE) - The incidence of patients experiencing at least one AE during the randomized treatment and follow-up periods was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0) to end of the follow-up period (Week 14)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Patients Experiencing AEs That Resulted in Discontinuation of Investigational Product (IP) - The incidence of patients experiencing AEs that resulted in discontinuation of IP during the randomized treatment or follow-up periods was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0) to end of the follow-up period (Week 14)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Patients Experiencing Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) - The incidence of patients experiencing SAEs during the randomized treatment and follow-up periods was calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0) to end of the follow-up period (Week 14)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms Questionnaire (PAC-SYM) - The PAC-SYM questionnaire is a 12-item questionnaire that evaluates the severity of symptoms of constipation in 3 domains (stool, rectal, and abdominal symptoms) on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 4 (very severe) in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items (ie, symptoms). The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'absent' for each item) to 4 (response is 'very severe' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to treatment) to last on-treatment assessment (up to Week 12)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL) - The PAC-QOL scale is a 28-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the burden of constipation on patients' everyday functioning and well-being in the 2 weeks (14 days) prior to assessment. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). The instrument can be used to generate an overall score, but is also reported to assess 4 specific constipation-related domains including: 1) Worries and concerns (11 items), 2) Physical discomfort (4 items), 3) Psychosocial discomfort (8 items), and 4) Satisfaction (5 items). Each domain score is the mean of the non-missing items for that domain. The total score is the mean of all non-missing items. The range of the domain or total score is 0 (response is 'not at all' for each item) to 4 (response is 'extremely' for each item). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to treatment) to last on-treatment assessment (up to Week 12)</timepoint>
