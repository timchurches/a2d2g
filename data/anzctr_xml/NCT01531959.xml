  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesize that midodrine treatment of refractory hypotension in patients otherwise ready
      for discharge from the ICU shortens duration of receiving IV vasopressors and SICU length of
      stay without increasing MGH length of stay or putting the patient at risk of being readmitted
      to an ICU.</summary>
