  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Safe and Sound Protocol (developed by Dr. Stephen Porges, UNC) is a 5-day auditory-based intervention that involves listening to electronically modified/filtered music. The SSP was theoretically designed to reduce auditory hypersensitivities by recruiting the anti-masking functions of the middle ear muscles to optimize the transfer function of the middle ear for the processing of human speech. Vocal music was selected based on frequency range and prosodic features, then electronically filtered based on algorithms developed by his lab. These algorithms are proprietary but were developed based on an exercise model that uses computer altered acoustic stimulation to modulate the frequency band passed to the participant. The frequency characteristics of the protocol were theoretically selected based on the documented frequency band and weights associated with speech and language.

 The Protocol is delivered through headphones for 6o minutes for 5 consecutive days. An important aspect of the protocol is that the children feel safe and supported, so the environment is non-threatening and the main caregiver remains present with the researcher. The children can freely engage with manipulatives/books/drawing while listening. </interventions>
    <comparator>This research will utilize an active control group.
The active control group will receive the nonfiltered music intervention- participants will listen to the same music selections as intervention group but the music has not been electronically filtered/modified.

 PROSODY is a recently developed measure.
Participants will be asked to tell a short (at least 20 seconds) story of a positive experience (in school, work or home); the story will be recorded using a microphone.  Participants will then be asked to tell a story of a negative experience (once again, to capture at least 20 seconds of dialog). Prosodic features of the recording will be measured by a multi-stage quantitative analysis.

Using G-Power 3.1 software; running a t-test with effect size of 0.5, alpha at 0.05; a total sample size of 34 per group is required for a power of .80. Two intervention conditions are employed requiring a total of 68 participants.

Statistical analysis will employ different methodology for within subject and between group analysis.
QEEG Analysis
EEG raw recording will be uploaded to NeuroGuide (http://www.appliedneuroscience.com/research.htm) for editing (reliability level of 0.9) and analysis. Analyse includes across frequency bandwidths, (delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma), in 1 htz bins for power, magnitude, phase and connectivity across cortical areas. Topographical power maps are generated:
NeuroStat: software will process repeat measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and paired t-tests, pre-vs- post intervention.
NeuroBatch: processes group comparison statistics. Differences between groups will be analzed.
ECG will be assessed with Biopac MP150 Nomadic physiological acquisition (Biopac Systems, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA).
The ECG and heart period data will be visually inspected and edited offline with CardioEdit software (Brain-Body Center, University of Illinois at Chicago). Editing will consist of integer arithmetic (i.e., dividing intervals between heart beats when detections of R-wave from the ECG were missed or adding intervals when spuriously invalid detections occurred). RSA will be calculated with CardioBatch software (Brain-Body Center, University of Illinois at Chicago) consistent with procedures developed by Porges (1985). The Porges method quantifies the amplitude of RSA with age specific parameters that are sensitive to the maturational shifts in the frequency of breathing. 
Voice Prosody
Data will be assessed via Prosody software (Brain-Body Lab). Prosodic features of speech will be measured by a multi-stage quantitative analysis of the digitized voice recordings.
SPSS software will be utilized for repeat measures ANOVA for within and between group comparisons. Comparative analysis will include:
1.	Motor measures to RSA to answer the question of is there a relationship between vagal regulation of the heart (state regulation) and motor skills?
2.	Motor measures and social scales to answer the question of is there a relationship between pro-social behaviours and motor skills?
3.	Frontal asymmetry and pro social and motor skills?
4.	Connectivity and prosocial social
5.	Auditory sensitivities and motor skills

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies are increasingly exploring the neurobiology of Neurodevelopmental Disorders and linking atypical neurophysiological patterns to clinical behaviour. The ability to regulate emotional state has been identified as a core feature of many psychopathologies including anxiety, attention problems, depression neurodevelopmental delays and autism (Beauchaine, 2001). The Polyvagal Theory (PVT) provides a framework for interpreting physiological systems in relation to emotional regulation for adaptive prosocial behavioural responses (S. W. Porges, 2001). 
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) present with primary dysfunction in social interactions, communication impairments and restricted and repetitive patterns of interests and behaviours (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although not typically part of diagnostic criteria, auditory processing or hyperacusis are often evident in ASD and can impact emotional regulation and prosocial behaviours. 

ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder and therapeutic interventions typically employed utilize behavioural strategies to address the range of behavioural difficulties presented.  The Safe &amp; Sound Protocol (SSP) is a novel intervention intended to impact neural systems supporting psychological experience and behaviour.
Hypothesis
That the Safe and Sound Protocol results in decreased auditory hypersensitivities and improved auditory processing, with associated improved autonomic and cortical neural regulation enabling prosocial behaviors.
