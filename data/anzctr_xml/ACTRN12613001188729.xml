Baseline phase: 
Participants complete a baseline phase of 1,2, or 3 weeks.  During the baseline phase cigarette consumption, mood and withdrawal symptoms are monitored daily. 

Capsule intervention phase: 
Participants swallow up to a target dose of 12 capsules of DEN or placebo a day divided into three doses of 4 pills each dose for a total of 16 weeks. Participants will begin by taking one capsule, 3 times each day, increasing the dose by three capsules every two days up to a target dose of 12 capsules per day: 4 taken at 3 different intervals. Compliance will be monitored with diaries and pill counts. Cigarette consumption, mood and withdrawal will be monitored during week 1 and 4 of this phase.  

Smoking Cessation phase: 
After 4 weeks of taking the capsules participants begin a smoking cessation intervention following Quitline New Zealand's five step program (with the exclusion of step 4 nicotine patches and gum).  Standard Quitline care coincides with the continuing consumption of the capsules.  Participants monitor mood and withdrawal symptoms for the first month after quit date, then for the last week of the consecutive 2 months using a diary that they carry with them.  Every 2 weeks participants complete withdrawal, dependence, depression, anxiety sensitivity and a side effects questionnaire.  Participants come in to the laboratory every 4 weeks for 3 months to receive more capsules, complete questionnaires and talk about smoking cessation.  Participants take the capsules for 3 months during the smoking cessation phase.  Adherence to protocol during the smoking cessation phase is monitored with self report diaries, and pill counts.  All participants will then be followed up 3 months after the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo consists of riboflavin, fiber acacia gum, Maltodextrin, and cocoa powder. Patients swallow 12 capsules a day divided into three doses of 4 pills each dose for a total of 16 weeks. Participants randomized to the placebo condition follow the same protocol as the DEN group. Participants take the placebo capsules throughout the 4 week capsule intervention phase and for the three month smoking cessation phase. </comparator>

    <concealment>Provided that an individual meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet exclusion criteria, the person is allocated the next available participant number. Baseline length has been predetermined by a research assistant outside the laboratory.  Baseline length is revealed by opening an envelope when the consent form is signed.  Ramdomization to active ingredient or placebo was done by a research assistant outside of the laboratory and given to a pharmacist.  All capsules (ie active ingredient or placebo) have been pre-packaged by a pharmacist who holds the randomization code. A sealed envelope is contained within each pill package only to be opened in an emergency (ie patient deteriorates significantly).</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization for pill allocation and baseline length was completed by a research assistant.  The research assistant used block randomization.  A pharmacist received a list of placebo or active ingredients with participant number.  The research assistant kept a list of the multiple baseline length but gave the researcher the envelopes with a participant number on the front and baseline number inside.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Demographic Information
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for demographic measures of the participants. 

Withdrawal Measures 
Time series graphs will be constructed to show intensity and trajectory of change in withdrawal patterns during smoking cessation overtime.  Single case research design visual analysis will compare the DEN group and placebo.  Computer generated trend and level lines will be used to further analyse data.  

Individual Differences 
Hierarchical multiple regression will be used to evaluate how individual differences in anxiety sensitivity, nicotine dependence, depression, cigarette consumption, physcial symptoms and mood effect withdrawal symptoms during the smoking cessation.  It is understood that the small sample size will limit the number of predictor variables that can be entered in the analysis.

Effect Size 
Effect size measures will be calculated from one of the nine non-overlap effect size estimators of single case research design e.g., percent of all non-overlapping data (PAND) or Percent Exceeding the Median (PEM). 

Sample Size
In the single-case research design tradition participants are not regarded as samples from some putative population and the aim of the research is not to draw inferences from sample statistics to population parameters. Issues of power, in the statistical sense of the adequacy of the sample size to support statistical inferences (in particular, to avoid Type II error), do not therefore arise. Single-case research supports inferences about the effects of the intervention via a process of Replication, where the question is the degree to which the pattern of results observed in one participant (or one condition, in the case of some designs) is replicated across other participants, given that each participant has been exposed to the same intervention under comparable circumstances. The more successful replications achieved the stronger the support for the inference that the treatment caused the observed changes. How many replications are needed. THe Institute of Education Science commissioned an expert group to formulate standards for single-case research design (Kratochwill,  et al., 2010). They provide the following advice in the case of the multiple-baseline design:
 
The multiple baseline design involves an effect replication option across participants, settings, or behaviors. Multiple AB data series are compared and introduction of the intervention is staggered across time. In this design, more valid causal inferences are possible by staggering the intervention across one of the aforementioned units (i.e., sequential introduction of the intervention across time). The minimum number of phase repetitions needed to meet the standard advanced by Horner et al. (2005) is three, but four or more is recognized as more desirable . Adding phase repetitions increases the power [of the design], similar to adding participants in a traditional group design.  Among the characteristics of this design, effect replication across series is regarded as the characteristic with the greatest potential for enhancing internal and statistical-conclusion validity. (p7, emphasis added)
 
The current trial is aiming for 12 replications per condition (active vs placebo treatment), which is considerably more than the four recommended by the Institute of Education Science Technical Documentation cited above.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 20% of the New Zealand adult population are current tobacco smoking.  Tobacco smoking has many adverse consequences.  An individual continues to smoke as tobacco contains the addictive substance called nicotine. Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) has been used in previous studies to help with the symptoms of withdrawal from drugs, however there is very little research on nicotine withdrawal and CAM.  The aim of the current study is to assess the effect that the consumption of a micronutrient formula has on withdrawal symptoms when incorporated in a tobacco smoking cessation intervention (Quitline New Zealand's five step program).  This study will use one micronutrient formula called Daily Essential Nutrients (DEN), a revision of EMPowerplus(EMP+) which is sold in NZ, has received international attention as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, depression and ADHD. Our research team has published results using a variety of designs including open label, case studies and RCTs, showing that EMP+ has significant positive effects on mood, anxiety, hyperactivity, impulsivity and emotional lability. Given the encouraging results to date, this study seeks to conduct a randomized controlled trial using this revised formula, DEN, for current smokers 18 years and over.  The primary outcome assessed is the change of withdrawal symptoms during initial smoking cessation and withdrawal symptoms of the placebo group compared to the nutrient group.  </summary>
