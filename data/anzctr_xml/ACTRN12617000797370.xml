  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study of sedentary behaviour and sleep patterns in pregnant women attending an outpatient maternity services clinic. Participation involves wearing two small lightweight devices (a sleep monitor and an activity monitor) for a period of 7 days in a 4-week window before the recommended oral glucose tolerance test to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus. The activity monitor (ActivPal) will be worn on the thigh and will provide information on times spent sitting, standing and walking. The sleep monitor (Actigraph) will be worn on the wrist and will provide information on sleeping duration and sleep quality. Participants will choose the timing of the 7-day period within the 4-week window before their oral glucose tolerance test providing that the 7-day period is reflective of their normal weekly schedule.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Using data from the UK Pregnancy Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), we estimate that 74 individuals will be required with a minimum power of 80% and a type 2 error probability of 0.05 (two-sided test) to determine whether the association of objectively assessed sedentary time and 2-hour glucose differs from zero. To account for participant attrition and potential for missing devices, we will over-sample by 35% and recruit 100 participants.
Multiple linear regression will be used to assess the association between sedentary time (and its interrelationship with sleep) and glucose outcomes (continuous outcome variable), after adjustment for potential confounders (e.g., age, monitor wear time, pre-pregnancy BMI and pregnancy weight gain).
Binary, multivariate logistic regression models, including confounders (age, monitor wear time, pre-pregnancy weight, pregnancy weight gain) and physical activity time, will be used

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of gestation diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide, with current Australian prevalence rates estimated to be between 13-16%. Little is known about how to prevent GDM in high risk individuals. Strategies to date have largely focused on structured exercise programs. However, the results from these trials have shown little success possibly due to low adherence rates. Recently, studies suggest that sedentary behaviour during pregnancy is associated with increased risk for abnormal glucose tolerance, gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. This suggests that strategies that target a reduction in sedentary time could be an additional, or alternative approach to GDM prevention. However, before such interventions are developed, it is important to investigate the associations of objectively measured sedentary time and sleep patterns on blood glucose and GDM risk. This study aims to examine various descriptors of sedentary behaviour (total sedentary time, prolonged sedentary bouts, number of breaks in sitting) which will help to inform the design of early targeted sedentary behaviour interventions to reduce GDM incidence. 
Hypothesis: We hypothesise that measurement of sedentary time in pregnant women at 18-28 weeks gestation will be associated with higher fasting and post-challenge glucose levels during the screening test for GDM
