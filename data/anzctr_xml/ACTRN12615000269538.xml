  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups.

Group 1 Multimodal Manual Therapy (Control):  Participants in this group will receive Multimodal Manual Therapy treatment (MMT) only.  MMT refers to treatment that is centred around manual therapies but also employs best practice primary care and is supported by therapeutic exercises.  The manual therapy component of MMT may involve high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulation, non-thrust joint mobilization, or soft tissue massage.  The high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust techniques will involve a carefully directed, gentle but quick thrust through the mechanical plane of the spine or pelvic joints that may or may not be accompanied by an audible pop or cavitation sound.  These techniques may be performed with the therapists hands or with the assistance of a device such as a drop-piece table.  The non-thrust mobilization techniques will involve passive oscillatory movements of the spine or pelvic joints through normal ranges of motion.  Soft tissue massage techniques will be directed at the muscles of the back and pelvis and perfomed with the therapists hands or a vibrating massage device.  All participants will receive components of best practice primary care that involves reassurance, advice about symptom management and encouragement to remain active.  MMT may be supported by exercises that may include general physical conditioning, or specific exercise programs that address; symptom management, or mobility, strength or motor control impairments.  Other treatment modalities that are used by chiropractors and physiotherapists that are not endorsed by practice guidlines (e.g. therapeutic ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical nerve simulation, heat therapy, etc) will not be included in the definition of MMT. 

All participants in the MMT group will receive manual therapy.  The selection of other supportive treatment modalities will be determined by the chiropractor or physiotherapist according to their clinical judgment.  Treatments will either be performed by a registered chiropractor or physiotherapist who has more than 5 years of clinical experience.  Participants will receive up to 12 treatments over a period of 8 weeks. The practitioner may elect to use fewer treatments in cases where the participant has experienced significant improvement or has developed adverse effects that warrant stopping care.  The definition of an adverse effect (event) is either:  1) a new related complaint which was not present at baseline or previous visit, or  2) a worsening of the presenting complaint.  Adverse events will be measured using a similar questionnaire as in the side effects of chiropractic treatment study by Leboeuf-Yde et al. and will be carried out at the 8 week follow up interval.

Group 2 MoodGym combined with Multimodal Manual Therapy (Intervention):  Participants in this group will receive the same MMT as Group 1; however, this group will also complete the MoodGYM program. Participants will complete one module of the MoodGYM program per week over a five week period. The content of MoodGYM involves the completion of five modules of 20- to 40-minutes duration. The modules use various tools such as interactive games, mood assessments, and downloadable relaxation audio file. The modules focus on aspects of cognitive behaviour therapy, including cognitive restructuring, the relationship between thoughts and feelings, behavioural activation, relaxation, and problem solving. Participants are encouraged to continue their leanings in their daily life by applying principles taught in the modules. Participants in the MoodGYM group will set up a username and password at the time of enrolment and will be given an instruction manual for their five-week online MoodGYM program.

Participants will also receive a weekly telephone reminder, to enhance adherence with the MoodGYM program and avoid attrition.  Attrition has been identified as an issue in similar studies and higher completion rates were achieved with occasional telephone or email contact.  No additional counseling or treatment advice will be provided with the reminder telephone calls. Participants who report distress as a result of using MoodGym will be offered referral to a clinical psychologist.

Participants in both groups will be given a follow-up appointment schedule for their 8-week course of MMT.  The MMT will be provided by a chiropractor or a physiotherapist using techniques listed above which are inaccordance with International Clinical Practice Guidelines for chronic LBP.

The primary data analyses will be conducted using linear mixed models to test for between group differences in post-treatment PSEQ and RMDQ.  A covariance structure will be selected that provides the best fit and then will be included as a random factor to adjust for a possible cluster effect of site. A group by time interaction will be included to allow least significant difference (LSD) contrasts to be obtained between groups at each time point.  Because linear mixed models allow for missing data points, no imputation of missing data values will be required.  Analysis will be by intention-to-treat with the statistician blinded to patient group allocation. 
In secondary analyses, analysis of covariance will be used to test whether regression to the mean has occurred, that is whether the patients response is related to baseline values.  In this, separate analyses will be conducted to determine the effects of treatment at -8, -26 and -52 weeks. 

Sample size calculations
With an estimated moderate post-treatment between-group effect size (Glasss delta) of 0.60 SD, a sample size of 46 per group would be required to show statistical significance (power of 80%, alpha = 0.05) using a LSD post hoc test in a linear mixed model (equivalent to an independent samples t-test).  Allowing for a 15% dropout, 108 participants in total will be recruited.  We are assuming that the potential loss of power as a result of a cluster effect will be balanced by the use of linear mixed models to negate the effects of missing values and the increased power gained by adjusting for between visit correlations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial outlines the design of a randomised controlled trial that investigates the potential benefits of adding a widely available and inexpensive intervention to standard Multimodal Manual Therapy (MMT). 

Numerous chronic low back pain (LBP) Clinical Practice Guidelines have recommended that patient management for LBP should consist of MMT and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  MMT and CBT are effective interventions for LBP as standalone treatments. Furthermore; they have the potential to be combined as a secondary intervention for prevention of LBP related disability.

It is also known that higher levels of patient self-efficacy correlate with improvements in disability.  CBT is known for its effects on improving self-efficacy.  The primary aim of this trial is to assess the effects of combining MMT with MoodGYM on self-efficacy and disability .  This study is the first to investigate the secondary prevention of problems in a chronic LBP population using this combined intervention approach.
If this approach shows signs of being effective in reducing long-term disability, it will allow patients, practitioners and other stakeholders who dont have access to a multidisciplinary team, access to a best practice care tool for the management and secondary prevention of chronic LBP.  Furthermore, the outcomes of this trial may produce the beginnings of a tailored interner-based CBT program that can be added to MMT for patients that are at medium risk of developing  LBP related disability and pain.
