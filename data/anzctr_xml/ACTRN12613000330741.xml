  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patient will recieve a controlled exposure of UVA using a Spectraline wand (A pencil lamp source of UVA light placed in the oral cavity) with the oral photosensitiser 8-Methoxypsoralen (MOP) at a dose of 0.6mg/kg or 5 MOP at a dose of 1.2mg/kg given two hours before each treatment. 
Exposure to the UVA light starts at 15 sec and increments by 15 secs once a week to a total of 60 secs. All patients will be offered a total of 40 treatments with an average of four treatments per week. Patients complete the treatment using the same oral photosensitiser they start with, and supply/ availability of the drug determines which one the patient uses.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patient will recieve a controlled exposure of UVA using a Spectraline wand with a an oral photosensitiser such as 8 MOP or 5 MOP.  Exposure to the UVA starts at 15 sec and increments by 15 secs once a week to a maximium exposure of 60 secs. All patients will be offered a total of 40 treatments of the combined therpay. Patients will be evaluated by their specialist at treatments 1, 10, 20 and at treatment 40 or termination/withdrawal. Early conclusion or treatment or temporary interuptions are permitted if remission is attained. </summary>
