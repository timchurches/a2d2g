  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS2) is a Nicotine Replacement Therapy System. The dosing period consists of one day with approximately 21 mg of nicotine delivered transdermally using the CQSS2.  Doses of 5.4% nicotine formulation are delivered transdermally via the CQSS2 worn either on the upper arm or mid-thigh at programmed intervals of T0, T0.5, T1, T7, T7.5, T13 hours. Participants are required to stay in the clinic for the one day treatment and required to wear the CQSS2 for approximately 24 hours for a full PK parameters evaluation. The CQSS2 treatment will be administered by the health care provider.  A strap (i.e., Comfort Band), will be the primary method used to attach the CQSS2 to the body.  </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PK concentration profile of nicotine delivered by the Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS2) system</outcome>
      <timepoint>PK analysis over 30 hours:
blood samples will be collected approximately 15 mins prior to the first dose, every 20 minutes for the first 2 hours, at Hour 2.5, hourly from Hour 3 through Hour 16, then every 2 hours thereafter through Hour 30.  
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of the Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS2) system
Vital signs will be monitored periodically throughout the active period of dosing for possible adverse events of: Bradycardia (resting pulse rate &lt;40 beats per minute [bpm]); Tachycardia (resting pulse rate &gt;120 bpm); Blood pressure &lt;90 or &gt;165 mmHg systolic; Blood pressure &lt;45 or &gt;105 mmHg diastolic. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be collected from the time of the application of the CQSS2 through the Follow-up visit (within 14 days of discharge).

</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerability of the Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS2) system
Skin irritation at the CQSS2 application site will be assessed on an 8-point Skin Irritation Assessment scale </outcome>
      <timepoint>Skin irritation at the CQSS2 application site will be assessed on an 8-point Skin Irritation Assessment scale (0 to 7) up to 30 minutes prior to placement of the system, immediately after removal of the system at the 30 hour time point, and at the Follow-up visit.  Any score more than or equal to 3 will be reported as an AE and documented with photographic evidence.  All application site AEs will be followed until the event is resolved, returns to baseline, or the Follow-up visit (within 14 days of discharge), whichever occurs first. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase 2, open-label, PK study to assess the PK profile of nicotine over a 30 hour period in healthy Caucasian male volunteers who are smokers, using the Chrono Quit Smoking Solution (CQSS2) system.  All subjects will receive the CQSS2.
A strap (i.e., Comfort Band) will be the primary method used to attach the CQSS2 to the body.  Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to wear the CQSS2 in one of two application site locations, the upper arm (n = 5) or mid thigh (n = 5), for approximately 30 hours.  Application site location, safety, and tolerability will be evaluated.
