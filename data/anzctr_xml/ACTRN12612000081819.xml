  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose to see every child, under the age of 16, who has been found in a Clandestine Methamphetamine laboratory, or who is known to have been in this illegal site in the last 7 days.  As the Clan Labs are raided we will liaise with WA Police and Department for Child Protection to assess these children.  Each child will receive a thorough physical examination, urine toxicology screen, general bloods including liver function test, and a developmental or cognitive assessment.  It is our aim to describe the health effects that potentially arise in children exposed to the methamphetamine and toxic chemicals that are used in the illegal manufacture of this drug.  We will describe symptoms, abnormal examination findings, developmental and cognitive functioning and report on positive toxicology screens in these children so that we can better understand the health and medical needs of this population, which is unfortunately on the increase as more illegal labs are found around WA.  We ultimately plan to devise a protocol for asessment of these children that can be followed Australia wide.</summary>
