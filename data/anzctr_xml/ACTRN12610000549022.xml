  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measurement of pharyngeal pressure and work of breathing of children receiving nasal high flow oxygen over a period of one to two hours.

For those children on low flow oxygen, measurements will be made on low flow. High flow nasal cannulae will be applied, and flow applied at 1L/kg/min, then 2L/kg/min, then 3L/kg/min, then 4L/kg/min.  Measurements will be taken after 10 minutes on each flow rate. Before increasing to a new flow rate, flow will be decreased to 1L/kg/min for 2 minutes. The flow will be delivered to a maximum of 60L/minute.

For children already receiving nasal high flow oxygen, the measurements will be made on high flow oxygen, then on low flow oxygen at 2L/minute if deemed safe by the treating team. 

Children on continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) will have nasal high flow oxygen prongs applied, then will have the measurements made as above.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Work of breathing calculated from oesophageal pressure measured by oesophageal catheter with air filled pressure balloon inserted nasogastrically or orogastrically, and lung volume change measured by respiratory inductance plesmography bands around the thorax and abdomen.  Both measurements made with the Bicore II device.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children/Tamariki with lung problems often need help with their breathing. There are several ways of doing this, but the problem with the current methods is that they involve uncomfortable straps on the face which children/Tamariki do not like.

We have a new and better-tolerated method of delivering oxygen, which helps babies and children/ Tamariki breathe more easily.  It uses nasal prongs very similar to that used for standard oxygen delivery but modified to be able to use a faster flow of oxygen. It has been used successfully in babies and children/Tamariki worldwide. We would like to better understand how this treatment works and how best to adjust it for individual patients. 

We will give different flow rates of oxygen and measure how much easier it is for the child/Tamariki to breathe. To do this we use a modified feeding tube, a very fine tube in the nose to measure the pressure there, loosely apply stretchy bands to the chest and abdomen to measure breathing, and we stick a dot to the skin to measure gas levels. These have minimal risk.  This work will help us determine how much oxygen is best for each child/Tamariki.</summary>
