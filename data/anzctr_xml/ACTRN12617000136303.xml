  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be provided with 30g of alcohol (in the form of wine) on each of the two testing evening. Participants will have 15 minutes to consume the wine. A randomly allocated set of snacks (intervention or control) will then be provided 30 minutes after the end of alcohol consumption. The washout period between testing evenings (i.e. the provision of different snacks) is a minimum of one week.
 
Intervention: Uncommon snacks and dip

Participants will be provided with a set of less commonly eaten savoury food snacks after drinking the moderate dose of alcohol and will consume the snacks until they are comfortably full. Participants will be asked to rate their liking of the uncommon snacks and their characteristics. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control: Common snacks and dip

Participants will be provided with a set of commonly eaten savoury food snacks after drinking the moderate dose of alcohol and will consume the snacks until they are comfortably full. Participants will be asked to rate their liking of the common snacks and their characteristics. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the impact of consuming alcohol on the liking and characteristics of two different sets of savoury food snacks (newly developed food snacks, uncommon food snacks and common food snacks). 

Participants in this study will attend the study on two testing evenings and will be randomly allocated to a different set of snacks on each evening. Participants will drink a moderate dose of alcohol and then consume the provided snacks until they are comfortably full. They will be asked to complete questionnaires on their liking of the different snack foods including the flavour, appearance, mouth-feel and texture. Other data that will be collected from participants on each testing evening include multiple appetite and hunger ratings, blood samples collected to observe changes in biomarkers and breath alcohol concentration measurements.

The results from this study will assist with the potential development of new food snacks to have when consuming alcohol for social drinkers.</summary>
