  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is:

        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of performing an international multi-centre
           randomized control trial of early and prolonged hypothermia to improve outcome in
           children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

        -  To determine whether in children with severe traumatic brain injury, prolonged initial
           hypothermia (minimum 72 hours at 32-33 degrees) improves the proportion of good outcomes
           12 months after injury when compared to initial normothermia (36-37 degrees).</summary>
