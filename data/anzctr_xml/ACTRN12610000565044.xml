  <interventions>
    <interventions>to study the effect of dietary supplementation with Soy Isoflavones, Lycopene, Resveratrol, Gingerol Sage, Rosmarine and Curcumine and their combinations on diabetic foot ulcers in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study product is to be administered once daily, by mouth, with the evening meal in a hard gelatin capsule for a sixty day period. The gelatin capsule contains the recommended therapeutic dosage(based on subject inclusion criterion of weight 60-80kg) of oral lactolycopene, Lactolycopene/LaFlavon, Resveratrol, Gingerol, Curcume, Sage and Rosemarine.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>regression of diabetic ulcer rate in this patient population with an associated increased plasma level of phytochemicals (Lycopene, Soy Isoflavones, Resveratrol, Gingerol, Curcume, Sage, Rosemarine and their combinations) after daily intake of nano-formulated capsules/tablets for sixty days by assessing morphometry of the ulcer and by utilizing the foot pressure study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after beginning  treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased plasma concentration of phytochemicals (Lycopene, Soy Isoflavones, resveratrol, Gingerol, Curcume,Sage, Rosemarine and their combinations) after daily intake of a single phytochemical capsule in patients with diabetic foot syndrome measured by blood sample at baseline and at the two month conclusion of the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction and/or elimination of pyo-necrotic complication in the ulcers by assessing serum and urine concentrations of creatinine, protein, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha antibody,( TNF-a).</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of c-reactive protein (CRP) and degree of granulocytosis via blood hematology and chemistry assessment  of these factors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and plasma lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) via serum chemistry evaluation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of plasma fibrinogen level via chemistry analysis of serum sample.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>improved rate of foot pressure test using the barefoot plantar foot pressure test at baseline and at the two month conclusion of the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>reduction of cytokine levels in the discharge from diabetic ulcers will be assessed by collecting 100 microliters of serous discharge and performing assay for cytokines.</outcome>
      <timepoint>timeframe- 60 days after treatment initiation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
