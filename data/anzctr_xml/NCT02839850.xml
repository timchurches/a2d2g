    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient-reported Outcome: Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Activities of Daily Living (KOOS ADL) - The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 42 questions and include the WOMAC Osteoarthritis index. The KOOS consists of 5 subscales: pain, other symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), sport and recreational function and knee related quality of life. Each question has 5 Likert-like response options. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Minimum 2 years (670-1033 days after surgery)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient-reported Outcome: Pre-surgical/Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) - The Pre Surgical and/or Post-surgical Patient's Knee Implant Performance (PKIP) questionnaire is a patient self-administered questionnaire that consists of 25 questions relating to the patient's awareness of their knee. Questions include the patient's self-confidence about the current status of their knee performance, stability, and overall satisfaction. Each question has a 5, 6 or 10 Likert- like response option.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to examine the change from pre-operative baseline to
      two year postoperative functional performance improvement for the ATTUNE primary, cementless
      TKA RP system as measured with the KOOS questionnaire (KOOS-ADL sub-score). This will be
      carried out for two configurations: cruciate retaining rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless
      CR RP) and posterior stabilized rotating platform (ATTUNE Cementless PS RP).</summary>
