    <scientifictitle>In patients with comorbid depression and problematic use of alcohol, cannabis and/or amphetamines, is computer-based cognitive behaviour therapy as efficacious as an equivalent therapist-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy program and/or superior to a brief intervention control group in reducing symptoms of depression and levels of substance use?</scientifictitle>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following provision of formal consent, all eligible participants completed an initial assessment.  Each participant then commenced the treatment phase of the study, which started with a brief (one-session) intervention.  Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatment allocations at the conclusion of the brief intervention: no further treatment (treatment as usual/control condition), nine further sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy delivered by a psychologist, or nine further sessions of cognitive behaviour therapy delivered by a computer (with brief 10-15 minute weekly input from a psychologist).  The research clinicians were blind to treatment allocation until the conclusion of the initial brief intervention session.  Allocation involved contacting a centrally-located administrative assistant who was not involved in the assessment or treatment phases of the study, nor the research project in general.  Treatment allocations were transferred from an externally generated randomisation list by the Administrative Assistant and concealed in individual opaque envelopes labelled with the relevant participant code. Prior to the brief intervention session for each participant, the research clinicians were issued with a new randomisation envelope by the Administrative Assistant, which displayed the participant number on the outside of the envelope, and with the treatment allocation sealed inside.  The envelope was opened by the participant at the conclusion of the brief intervention session.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation list was generated by the Research Manager of the Centre at which the study was conducted, and was linked to a unique participant identification code (i.e. 1-120).   The Research Manager was not involved with the assessment or treatment phases of the study.  A permuted block randomisation approach was used so that the distribution of participants across treatment conditions could be maintained regardless of the final sample size.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aimed to develop and pilot test a computer-based psychological treatment for co-occurring depression and alcohol/other drug use problems.  Computer-based treatment was compared with a therapist-delivered treatment that was identical in content, and both of these treatments were compared with a brief treatment control group of one-session.  It was hypothesised that people with co-occurring depression and alcohol/other drug use problems would attend and report benefits from a computer-based psychological treatment targeted at their conditions; that people in the therapist- and computer-delivered treatments would report similar reductions in depression and alcohol/other drug use over time, and that participants in both of these treatments would report superior reductions in depression and alcohol/other drug use problems than the brief intervention control group.</summary>
