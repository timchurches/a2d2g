  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mode of Administration will be oral capsule.
 
Part 1- Cohort 1: Rising single dose SCH900931 (Period 1:20mg, Period 2:100mg &amp; Period 3:550mg). 
The duration of each Period will be 6 days, in between doses for Part 1 will be at least 7 days between Period 1 and Period 2 and at least 21 days between Period 2 and Period 3. 
Part 2- Cohort 2 &amp; 3 : Rising multiple dose SCH900931 of 2 cohort in a parallel study design (Cohort 2: 150mg &amp; Cohort 3:250mg).
For Part 2, dosing will be once daily for 14 consecutive days for subjects in either Cohort 2 or Cohort 3.
Subjects will participate only in Part 1 or in one of the 2 cohorts in Part 2.
 
The first part of the study will determine PK dose proportionality by using 3 single doses. The second part of the study will allow for determination of steady-state PK and accumulation ratio by once daily administration for 14 days.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 1: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rising single oral doses of SCH 900931 administered to healthy adult Japanese subjects. (Assessed via vital sign measurements, standard laboratory safety tests, urinalysis &amp;/or physical examinations)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed throughout the study at each study visit up to Day 6 of period 3.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rising multiple oral doses of SCH 900931 administered to healthy adult Japanese subjects. (Assessed via vital sign measurements, standard laboratory safety tests, urinalysis &amp;/or physical examinations)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed throughout the study at each study visit up to Day 21.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 1: To compare the single dose pharmacokinetic of SCH 900931 in healthy adult Japanese subjects to those obtained from healthy adult non-Japanese subjects (historical data from previous studies). (Assessed via  pharmacokinetic blood sampling)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed throughout the study at each study visit up to Day 6 of period 3 (part 1)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part 2: To obtain preliminary plasma pharmacokinetic data of SCH 900931 following multiple oral dose administration in healthy adult Japanese subjects.
