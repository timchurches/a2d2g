  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete 5 lessons of an Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) treatment focusing  on the management of pain, anxiety, depression and disability. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with chronic pain, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive automatic email and weekly reminder phone calls by a clinical psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails and phone calls is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, and at 3-months post-education. These will take about 10-20 minutes to complete. Participants will be invited to receive generic SMS prompts and consenting participants will start receiving these prompts from week 3 of the course.  The SMS prompts will be brief, limited to 1 a day on week days, and designed to remind participants to practice the skills during the day.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program to develop and evaluate an Internet-based education and treatment program for people with chronic pain. This project examines the efficacy and acceptability of a treatment program to enhance management of pain, anxiety, depression and disability amongst people with chronic pain, when augmented with daily SMS prompts reminder participants to practice self-management skills. We expect that participants will experience improvements across the measures and will rate the SMS prompts as acceptable and helpful.</summary>
