  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with suspected or proven MPE undergoing a standard CT scan examination as part of routine clinical management will be included in this study. Immediately after the first standard CT scan an artificial air-pleura interface will be created by introducing 500mL of air via an in-situ chest drain [such as intercostal catheter (ICC) or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)]. The air is introduced using a syringe connected to the chest drain. A second CT scan will be performed immediately afterwards. The approximate duration for the procedure and scan will be approximately 15 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>The abnormal findings on pleura detected by the two CT scans will be compared. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To confirm the safety of creating an artificial air-pleura interface by introducing air into the pleural space via a previously inserted chest drain.

All adverse events relating to the trial procedure occurring during the course of the clinical study (i.e., from signing the informed consent until death or the end of the study follow up period (whichever comes first) will be collected and documented by the investigator according to the specific definitions and instructions detailed in the Adverse Event Reporting section of the Trial Master File. Cases will also be reported if a causal link between the AE and the trial procedure is suspected but not confirmed.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks post-CT scan</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the effectiveness of a CT scan in the presence of an air-pleura interface with standard CT scan to detect small pleural nodules/other pleural abnormalities.

The control for the study CT scan will be first contrast-enhanced CT scan, the current best available standard of care imaging. Each CT will be divided into two studies to report - "supine pleural phase CT with no air-pleura interface" and "prone CT with air-pleura interface". 2 chest radiologists will independently read the CTs to assess for the presence of pleural nodules, thickening or other abnormalities. The reporting radiologists will not be blinded to the type of CT but in order to reduce bias they will report the CT scans with and without air-pleura interface in a random order. As it is a new technique the degree of inter-rater agreement between the radiologists is important and therefore kappa statistics will be used to assess concordance between categorical outcomes and Bland Altman plots for continuous outcomes. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the use of an artificial air-pleura interface by introducing air into the chest for a computed tomography (CT) scan to detect abnormalities in patients with known or suspected malignant pleural effusion. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have known or suspected malignant pleural effusion and have a chest drain in-situ. 
Study details: All participants will have two CT scans: one standard CT scan and one CT scan with an artificial air-pleura interface. The artificial air-pleura interface will be created by introducing 500mL of air via an in-situ chest drain [such as intercostal catheter (ICC) or indwelling pleural catheter (IPC)]. The air is introduced using a syringe connected to the chest drain. The findings on pleura detected by the two CT scans will be compared. No previous studies have specifically assessed pleural abnormalities through this technique. We hypothesize for this study that artificially creating an air-pleura interface will make the small pleural nodules (~1cm) more conspicuous and will allow significantly better detection of previously undetectable pleural abnormalities/ nodules by CT scan.</summary>
