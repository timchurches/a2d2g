        Cohort 2:

          -  Individuals with moderately impaired and normal hepatic function.

          -  Individuals with moderate hepatic impairment must have a score of 7-9 on the CPT
             Classification at Screening without evidence of worsening clinical and/or laboratory
             signs of hepatic impairment within 2 months prior or within the screening period.
