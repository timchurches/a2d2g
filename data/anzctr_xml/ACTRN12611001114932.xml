  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study One will involve conducting a cross-sectional, correlational study of self-compassion amongst practising psychotherapists (including trainees), and using Structural Equation Modelling to explore the relationship between self-compassion and stress, as well as the potential mediating role of happiness and emotion regulation in this relationship. Measures for Study One will be administered online, and  the study will be open to participants at least until the requisite sample size is reached (&gt;155). Upon completion of the online measures for Study One, eligible participants will be given the opportunity to register for Study Two.
In Study Two, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the utility of a self-guided, self-compassion-based intervention delivered via the Internet for increasing self-compassion, and promoting psychological well-being and resilience to stress amongst postgraduate trainee psychology students currently engaged in clinical work. In Study Two, if participants are randomly allocated to the intervention group, treatment will be based on Germer and Neff's (2011) Mindful Self-Compassion program, adapted for online administration and tailored for postgraduate students. This program is a combination of mindfulness- and self-compassion-based meditations, written and behavioural exercises, psychoeducation, self-monitoring, and feedback aimed at increasing self-compassion, increasing psychological wellbeing, and reducing psychological distress. The program will be provided through the website "Self-Compassion Online". A time period of 8 weeks will be allocated to all participants to complete the program (a total of 8 modules). It is anticipated that each module will take approximately 2 hours to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>If participants are randomly allocated to the control group, they will be placed on a no-intervention waitlist for 4 months. At the end of this period, they will receive access to the Self-Compassion Online in the same format as the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-Compassion Scale (SCS; Neff, 2003a). The SCS is a 26-item self-report measure comprising six subscales (self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification) designed to assess the different facets of self-compassion proposed by Neff (2003a, 2003b). It employs a five-point Likert-type response format, ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, post-test, 2-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>21-Item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995b). The stress subscale of the DASS-21 will also be used to measure stress. The DASS-21 is a 21-item self-report measure with three subscales that measure depression, anxiety and stress. It employs a four-point Likert-type response format to assess how often respondents experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress over the past week, with possible responses ranging from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most the time). The Depression scale assesses dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia, and inertia. The Anxiety scale assesses autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The Stress scale assesses levels of chronic non-specific arousal, such as difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, and being easily upset/agitated, irritable/over-reactive and impatient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, post-test, 2-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Authentic Happiness Inventory (AHI; Peterson &amp; Park, 2008). The AHI will be used to measure happiness. The AHI is a 24-item updated version of the Steen Happiness Index (SHI) developed by Seligman et al. (2005). Similar to the SHI, the AHI is designed to measure Seligman et al.'s (2005) conceptualization of happiness, which divides the construct into three dimensions: pleasure, meaning, and engagement. Each item consists of five statements that range from negative (I feel like a failure) to extremely positive (I feel I am extraordinarily successful). Respondents are asked to indicate the statement that best described them during the previous week. Preliminary data support the validity of the authentic happiness construct (Kaczmarek, Stanko-Kaczmarek, &amp; Dombrowski, 2010), and the reliability of this scale, with Cronbach's alphas  &gt; .92 for each subscale and the total scale score reported in the literature (e.g., Schiffrin &amp; Nelson, 2010; Silberman, 2007).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). The DERS will be used to measure emotion regulation. The DERS is a 36-item self-report questionnaire designed to measure problems with emotion regulation according to Gratz and Roemer's conceptualization of adaptive emotion regulation as involving four key capacities: (1) emotional awareness and understanding; (2) emotional acceptance; (3) the capacity to control impulsive behaviours when experiencing unpleasant emotions and to behave in accordance with desired goals; and (4) the ability to use appropriate emotion regulation strategies. The DERS uses a five-point Likert-type response format (1 = almost never to 5 = almost always) to measure difficulties with emotion regulation along six dimensions: (1) non-acceptance of emotions; (2) difficulties engaging in goal-directed behaviour; (3) impulse control difficulties; (4) lack of emotional awareness; (5) limited access to emotion regulation strategies; and (6) lack of emotional clarity. The DERS has exhibited good validity (Orgeta, 2009), test-retest reliability, overall internal consistency ( .93) and adequate subscale reliability, with Cronbach's alphas &gt; .80 for each subscale (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, post-test, 2-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen, Kamarck, &amp; Mermelstein, 1983). The PSS will be used to measure stress. The PSS is a 10-item self-report measure of cognitive appraisals of stress. Respondents are asked to rate the frequency of stressful events in the past month on a 5-point Likert-type response scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The PSS has adequate construct and discriminant validity, and good reliability, with Cronbach's alpha of .85 reported in the literature (Cohen, et al., 1983; Cohen &amp; Williamson, 1988; Roberti, Harrington, &amp; Storch, 2006).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-test, weekly during intervention period, post-test, 2-month follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Forms of Self-Criticising/Attacking and Self-Reassuring Scale (FSCRS; Gilbert, Clark, Hempel, Miles, &amp; Irons, 2004). The FSCRS is a 22-item scale that measures individual's tendencies to be self-critical or self-reassuring when things go wrong. The scale measures two forms of self-critical cognitions: self-inadequacy and self-hatred, and one form of self-reassurance. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 0 = not at all like me, to 4 = extremely like me). Cronbach's alphas were 0.90 for the inadequate-self scale and 0.86 for the hated-self scale and reassured-self scale respectively. In the proposed study, the wording of the FSCRS will be changed to reflect how much the respondents experienced the various cognitions in the past week.</outcome>

    <concealment>STUDY ONE: Study One is a cross-sectional, correlational study to test a structural equation model of self-compassion, emotion regulation, happiness, and stress amongst currently practising psychotherapists, including postgraduate students who are currently engaged in clinical training. Participants will be recruited via word-of-mouth, snowball recruitment via email, and advertisement on online psychology groups and websites. All measures will be administered online. Following completion of the online survey, eligible participants will be given the opportunity to register for Study Two.
STUDY TWO:  During registration, participants will be asked to read the Participant Information and Consent Form, and asked to indicate whether they consent to participate in the study. Participants will then be administered a demographic screen and the SCS screen, using an online Qualtrics survey, to see if they are eligible for the study. Qualtrics skip logic will be used to direct ineligible participants to the end-of-survey page.  Once eligible participants have completed screening measures, they will be asked to complete the remainder of the pre-test measures and to nominate a password. Participants will then be contacted via email/SMS with an identification number and their password. Identification numbers will remain the same throughout the duration of the program, and will be requested for program access, and at each data collection point.  The nominated password will be used to access the introductory section of the website (i.e. program overview, structure, instructions for baseline assessment, opt-out information), and will remain active for the duration of the baseline period. At the close of the registration period, an online randomization tool will be used to randomly assign participants to either the waitlist control group, or the intervention group. Participants will be contacted via email/SMS to let them know which group they are in.</concealment>
    <sequence>Saghei's (2004) Random Allocation computer software will be used to generate random number lists, which will be used to randomly assign participants to either the intervention or waitlist control group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research suggests that psychotherapists tend to report higher levels of work-related stress- and burnout- spectrum conditions than many other occupational groups. Work-related stress has serious implications for the mental and physical well-being of psychotherapists, and may lead to professional impairment, thus compromising the provision of care. As a result, researchers have highlighted the importance of identifying variables that (a) enhance psychotherapists psychological wellbeing and resilience to stress; and (b) are capable of development through training. In particular, it has been argued that the development of interventions to improve resilience and psychological health amongst trainee psychologists is of paramount importance, given the elevated levels of stress amongst this sub-group.  Recent research suggests that self-compassion is a promising construct for psychotherapists in terms of its ability to promote psychological well-being and resilience to stress; however, the potential benefits of self-compassion are yet to be thoroughly explored amongst this occupational group. Study One will involve conducting a cross-sectional, correlational study of self-compassion amongst practising psychotherapists (including trainees), and using Structural Equation Modelling to explore the relationship between self-compassion and stress, as well as the potential mediating role of happiness and emotion regulation in this relationship. In Study Two, a randomized controlled trial will be conducted to investigate the utility of a self-guided, self-compassion-based intervention delivered via the Internet for increasing self-compassion, and promoting psychological well-being and resilience to stress amongst postgraduate trainee psychology students currently engaged in clinical work.</summary>
