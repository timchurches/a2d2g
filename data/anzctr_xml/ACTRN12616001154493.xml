    <interventions>12 week e-health lifestyle intervention, focusing on living well with type 2 diabetes for mid life and beyond females.  (incorporating diet management, appropriate individually tailored  exercise,  management of menopausal and other symptoms associated with midlife and beyond.)  3 virtual consultations with an experienced nurse and access to a specifically designed web-site, I-Book and hard copy book. On assessment for eligibility for the study participants receive access to a specifically designed web site with information relating to type 2 diabetes, podcasts, discussion board and news board. They are also able to record their biophysical measurement, activity, and dietary and other changes on a secure. site. each participant has three consultations with an experienced clinical nurse at baseline, week 6 and week 12 as a minimum to assess individual need around management of appropriate diet and exercise and provide strategies for developing positive changed behaviour. To encourage adherence participants will receive email contact at week 3 and 9. Each participant is provided with a hard copy book incorporating information around diabetes management and wellness (developed in conjunction with diabetes Queensland and Kings College London and based on previous Women's Wellness materials - Women's Wellness after Cancer Program and Younger Women's Wellness after Cancer Program).

    <statisticalmethods>Calculation for the feasibility study is 90 participants through G power,  The study will also provide initial parameter estimates for the primary endpoint (HRQoL) from which sample size calculations can be performed for sufficient power for a larger RCT. Descriptive statistics will collect measures and participant characteristics and will also explore trends in the data over time. Collection of data is via on-line survey and research assistant measures. Data will be downloaded into IBM SPSS following completion of data collection week 12 for analysis. Measures used: SF36v2; self reported weight and height. Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS); Pittsburgh, Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); Diabetes Management Self Efficacy Scale (DMSES20).
