  <interventions>
    <interventions>The exposed group is the group of patients undergoing THR with ERAS principles of care (October 2015 to April 2016). 
The ERAS 'bundle' consists of several measures to be implemented
1. Preoperative patient information regarding the ERAS bundle. A leaflet will be given to patients by the surgeon at the time of booking for surgery.
2. Reduced fasting from clear fluids preoperatively (from midnight of the day of surgery, to 2 hours preoperative)
3. Reduced fasting from clear fluids postoperatively (from 4 hours after surgery, to 'as soon as awake and tolerating oral fluids').
4. Anaesthetic technique to reduce postoperative drowsiness (spinal and propofol sedation or general anaesthesia)
5. Intraoperative antiemetics (dexamethasone 4mg intravenously and granisetron 1mg intravenously)
6. Use of forced air warmer ('Cocoon' forced air warming blanket over nonoperative part of patient) and fluid warmer ('Hotline' fluid warmer to warm intravenous fluids) intraoperatively. 
7. Cefazolin 2g intravenously at least 15 minutes preincision
8. Regular postoperative multimodal oral analgesia (Panadol Osteo 2 tablets 8 hourly, meloxicam 15mg daily, Targin 10/5 or 20/10 twice daily) until no longer required for postoperative pain relief. Other oral analgesics as required. 
9. Regular postoperative antiemetics for 24 hours (5HT-antagonist of choice - either granisetron 1mg intravenously twice daily or ondansetron 4mg intravenously twice daily).
10. Regular postoperative aperients (coloxyl with senna 2 tablets orally twice daily) until no longer required. 
11. Clexane 40mg subcutaneously daily, for 21 days postoperatively. 
12. Standardised mobilisation physiotherapy plan:
	Day 0  mobilise on frame with physiotherapist
	Day 1  mobilise on elbow crutches with physiotherapist, sit out of bed, shower with/without assistance
	Day 2  independently mobilise with elbow crutches &gt;50m, independent self-care activities
	Day 3  independently transfer and mobilise with elbow crutches &gt;100m, have a clear understanding of post-discharge progression of ambulation/exercise program and hip precautions. If applicable, independent with stairs and car transfers.
* duration of each session is approximately 20 minutes, however will vary according to patient's ability to mobilise (varies with pain, nausea, dizziness). Data regarding factors that inhibit mobilisation will be collected. 

We will measure the implementation of  the ERAS bundle (data collection as a process outcome on the Case Report Form) and whether implementation has improved patient recovery (Quality of Recovery-15 score). </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group is the group of patients undergoing THR with standard care (January to September 2015). 

Standard care received:
1. Inconsistent preoperative patient information
2. Fasting from oral fluids from 6-18 hours preoperatively.
3. Postoperative oral intake commencing from 4-6 hours postoperatively.
4. Occasional use of intraoperative antiemetics
5. A wide range of prescribed postoperative analgesia, e.g. paracetamol and antiinflammatories only as required, intramuscular or intravenous morphine
6. Postoperative antiemetics given as required, but infrequently.
7. Postoperative laxatives given too late e.g. postoperative day 5.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR15) score - a commonly used and validated score to assess global domains of early postoperative quality of recovery. It consists of 15 questions on the patients health status in the past 24 hours, each answered by patient self-report on a scale of 0-10 to give a total score out of 150. The questions are able to breath easily, been able to enjoy food, feeling rested, have had a good sleep, able to look after personal toilet and hygiene unaided, able to communicate with family or friends, getting support from hospital doctors and nurses, able to return to work or usual home activities, feeling comfortable and in control, having a feeling of general well-being, moderate pain, severe pain, nausea or vomiting, feeling worried or anxious, and feeling sad or depressed.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>This is a prospective interventional study using a before-and-after design, with two groups of patients. The first group of patients receiving the existing standard of care (pre-intervention group) will act as a historical control group for the second post-intervention group of patients.

Data was collected from the preintervention (comparator) group from January to September 2015. Data from the post intervention group will commence in October 2015.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using contemporary regression methods intended for longitudinal data, allowing for potential confounders such as age, gender and possible differences between the groups. Logistic regression will be employed for binary outcomes such as whether or not day 0 mobilization was possible, robust or median regression for variables with skewed distributions such as length of stay. Tests of statistical significance will be 2 tailed, and employ a criteria of p &lt;= 0.05. 95% confidence intervals will be reported throughout. 
No interim analysis is planned.

The sample size of each group is estimated to be 100 per group, assuming 80% statistical power, 0.05 level of statistical significance and a standardized difference between the pre and post-ERAS groups on mean QoR-15 at 6 week follow-up (where maximum change would be expected) of 0.40 of a standard deviation, slightly under the effect size conventionally regarded as medium.. Calculations were performed using SAS Power and Sample Size 13.1. The expected effect size is a conservative one, suggested by examination of the literature and discussion with the developer of the QoR-15. A 6 point difference in QoR-15 at 6 weeks postoperatively is a clinically significant difference, with an estimated standard deviation of 15 (data from the first phase will be used to calculate SD). Allowing for 10% attrition 111 patients, conservatively rounded to 115, per group would be required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients who undergo total hip replacement surgery traditionally have long surgical incisions, routine urinary catheters and wound drain tubes. Anesthesia involves 12 hours of oral restriction before and after surgery, a combination of local anesthetic blocks, spinal anaesthesia and sedation or general anesthesia. After surgery, patients have varying degrees of immobilization to avoid the risk of early hip dislocation and opioid pain relief which results in slow recovery and hospital discharge at day 4-6.
Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) principles for joint replacement surgery involve patient education, less invasive surgery, reduced fasting, regular oral analgesia and early ambulation. These principles are packaged together in a bundle individualised for a particular hospital unit to account for local practices and preferences. Most ERAS programs have shown a remarkable improvement in patient recovery after joint replacement as measured by decreased hospital length of stay, improved mobilisation and patient satisfaction, with no increase in complications.
This study aims to implement and evaluate a tailored ERAS program at Epworth HealthCare, a large private hospital with patients undergoing one-sided THR surgery by a single surgeon. Patients enrolled in the study will be evaluated from the time they are seen in the hospital preoperatively to discharge and followed up by a telephone call at 6 weeks. WHODAS 2.0 and QoR-15 questionnaires will assess patients return to health. The recovery of this group of patients will be compared to the recovery of a group of patients who underwent THR before the ERAS program was implemented.
