  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interactive stepping exercises on purpose-built stepping mat connected to television. Participants will perform stepping in a random manner as indicated on the screen. Time to complete that task will be recorded (similar to a wii game). Data on exercises will be transmitted wirelessly to database for future analysis. Participants are requested to practice 30 minutes/day, 3 times/week for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>normal care involves strengthening exercises  for lower limb muscles, stretching, and balance exercises. Type and number of exercises are individualised by a physiotherapist, who provides home visit, depending on participants condition and ability. Frequency: 3 x/week, 30 minutes/session</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Choice stepping reaction time (CSRT): on a mat with 6 rectangles, 4 in lower row and 2 at front row, participants start by standing with the feet inside the middle 2 rectangles in lower row. Participants are instructed to step randomly to the right side or left side or to front with either left or right foot. Tester uses a standard list of instructions. Time to complete list is recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>STROOP stepping test (Participants stand in the centre of the dance mat used for training and in the centre of a computer screen an arrow will be presented pointing in one of four directions (up, down, left, right). Inside the arrow is a written word in a high contrast colour indicating a different direction. Participants are instructed to step according to the word and by doing that to selectively attend to one stimulus and inhibit the response indicated by the arrow's shape)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 and week 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Co-ordinated stability: Participants perform the coordinated stability test (2 attempts) barefoot trying to control a swaymeter strapped around the waist to trace a 'butterfly' shape. The number of corner and side errors are recorded from. The better attempt in the outcome measure is recorded.</outcome>

    <concealment>50 participants will be recruited from those with multiple sclerosis living metropolitan Sydney, Australia.  A block-randomisation procedure will be applied to form two groups with similar size.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In our recent study we found that ~ 60% of people with MS experienced one or more fall during 6-month follow up and 31% fell 3+ times. This is consistent with previous reports. High rates of falls in MS are significantly associated with poor performance in clinical balance tests, especially stepping ability. There is limited information on balance training in MS. Here, we propose to use an interactive step training system as a home-based exercise program to improve balance and consequently prevent fall risk in MS. The interactive system has been developed by our group and has been shown to have beneficial to older adults. This will be a pilot study to prepare for a larger randomised controlled trial to formally evaluate potential fall-related health benefits of interactive step training system use by people with MS.</summary>
