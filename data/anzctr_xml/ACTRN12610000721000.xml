  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a first-in-man Phase 1, partly double-blind, randomized, single oral dose study with two arms: The first arm is a dose escalation of both PF329 and hydromorphone hydrochloride by cohorts. Subjects in the dose escalation cohorts will be fasted overnight from 11:00 PM the night prior to dosing until 4 hours after administration of study medication.  All subjects in the dose escalation cohorts will receive oral naltrexone to block the opioid effects of PF329 and hydromorphone hydrochloride.  Three doses of naltrexone (50 mg each dosing) will be administered orally with 240 mL of water each at approximately the following times relative to study drug administration:  14 hours before, 2 hours before, and 12 hours after.
The starting dose of PF329 was determined using safety data obtained from nonclinical animal studies, and applying the algorithm for estimating the maximum safe starting dose in initial clinical trials as set forth in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance on the topic.  The hydromorphone hydrochloride starting dose is a fraction of the PF329 dose.  Doses will be escalated by cohort based on safety and pharmacokinetic assessments, either 2 or 4 fold from the previous cohort dose.  The maximum number of cohorts in this arm is 7, since the smallest increment of dose escalation from the starting dose of 1 mg to the maximum dose of 48 mg is two.  If the initial cohorts yield measurable plasma levels of PF329, PF329 doses for each of the 7 cohorts would be:  1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg and 48 mg.  The doses of hydromorphone will start at 0.5 mg, and thereafter will be adjusted to yield plasma concentrations equivalent to the PF329 dose in the next cohort, based on results of hydromorphone plasma assays in previous cohorts.
In the second arm of the study, a separate crossover cohort will receive a dose of PF329 without naltrexone, but 50 mg naltrexone will be given orally with 240 ml water 12 hours after dosing as an added safety precaution.  There will be no hydromorphone doses given in the crossover cohort.  The PF329 dose for this crossover cohort will be chosen based on data from the dose escalation cohorts in the first arm and will be a dose that is not expected to produce adverse opioid effects.   In one treatment session of this cohort, the group will be given a standardized high fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the meal), high-calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal to be started 30 minutes before study drug dosing, and in another treatment session, the cohort will be fasted until 4 hours after dosing.  Pharmacokinetics under both conditions will be compared.   The subjects may be asked to return for a third treatment session to received half the dose of PF329 as in the previous 2 sessions, to obtain additional pharmacokinetic data.  Thus, in this crossover cohort, there is a minimum of two treatment sessions, and a maximum of three treatment sessions.  The crossover treatment sessions will be separated by a washout period of at least one week.
The study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PF329 as well as the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone at doses sufficient to characterize the extent to which plasma hydromorphone is produced and maintained following oral ingestion of PF329.</interventions>
    <comparator>In study arm 1, the dose escalation cohorts, there will be a parallel study treatment of oral hydromorphone HCl as an active comparator.  In study arm 2, the crossover cohort, the effect of a high fat meal versus fasting on the pharmacokinetics of PF329 will be compared.</comparator>
