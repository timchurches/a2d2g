  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study of genotypes and phenotypic correlates of pigmentation and naevus characteristics in melanoma patients, in a one-off appointment for each participant. The participant fills out a questionnaire about sun exposure and medical history, and a research assistant records skin, hair and eye colour, skin reflectance, weight and height, before taking a series of full body images and dermoscopic images of all naevi over 5mm in diameter. This process usually takes between 1 and 2 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the links between melanoma risk and the genetics controlling skin, hair and eye colour and mole type and distribution. 

Who is it for?

You may be eligible to join this study if you are a resident of southeast Queensland or northern NSW who is able to attend an appointment at the Princess Alexandra Hospital and who has had a melanoma (group 1) or who has not had a melanoma (group 2). People of any age are eligible. 

Study details

All participants in this study will attend a one-off appointment where they will fill out a questionnaire about their sun exposure and medical history and give a saliva sample for DNA testing. A research assistant will record the participant's skin, hair and eye colour, weight and height and take full body images of the participant in their underwear as well as dermoscopic (close-up) images of moles larger than 5mm in diameter. This usually takes between 1 and 2 hours. We hope that this research will contribute to better melanoma screening procedures and identify people who would benefit from more frequent skin checks. </summary>
