  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention arm: outpatient management (early discharge from ED) of low risk pulmonary embolism. Upon diagnosis of a low risk PE and provided they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients randomized to the intervention arm will be discharged to hospital in the home (HITH) without an admission to or review by the respiratory team. Treatment for PE with enoxaparin (1mg/kg SC twice a day (bd), or 1mg/kg once a day (od) CrCl&lt;30ml/min) and warfarin (5-5-5) is standardized at this hospital and HITH and will not be altered for the purposes of this study. Those patients diagnosed with PE after hours (2030-0800) will be admitted to the ED observation ward until referral to HITH can be made the following morning. Discharge analgesia is left to the doctors discression, however a requirement of IM/IV analgesia after discharge from ED is an exclusion criteria to the study. Patients in the early discharge arm will all receive standard HITH treatment / management. All early discharge patients will receive an outpatient respiratory appointment at one week. On discharge from HITH the early discharge group will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction survey.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control arm (current standard of practice): delayed outpatient management (after admission to a respiratory ward from ED) of low risk pulmonary embolism. Upon diagnosis of a low risk PE and provided they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients patients randomized to the control arm will be admitted to the  respiratory team. Treatment for PE with enoxaparin (1mg/kg SC bd, or 1mg/kg od CrCl&lt;30ml/min) and warfarin (5-5-5) is standardized at this hospital and HITH and will not be altered for the purposes of this study. Admission analgesia is left to the doctors discression, however a requirement of IM/IV analgesia after discharge from ED (to the ward) is an exclusion criteria to the study. Patients in the control arm will all receive standard HITH treatment / management once they have been discharged from the respiratory ward. The necessity of an outpatient respiratory appointment will be left to the admitting teams discression. On discharge from HITH the delayed discharge group (control group) will be asked to complete a patient satisfaction survey.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A 2011 multicentre randomized control trial, undertaken by Aujesky et al, has supported recent changes to European and American Guidelines, and  provides convincing evidence that the outpatient management of low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), is non-inferior to standard inpatient management.
EDPED is a comparative cost analysis (randomised control feasability study) between outpatient and delayed outpatient management of low risk PE diagnosed in the emergency department (ED). This study aims primarily to quantify the savings to the Health Department (cost per patient and cost per institution), and qualify patient satisfaction as a result of early discharge from ED. We hope to identify potential areas where health resources may be better directed in the management of low-risk PE. Secondary outcomes will address safety issues of managing PE in the Outpatient Setting (HITH).
Patients who are discharged directly from ED (the intervention group) will be closely monitored for complications of their PE / venous thromboembolism or anticoagulation by HITH until their INRs have been stabilized. They will all receive a Respiratory Outpatient appointment 1 week after discharge from ED. Patients who are admitted to Respiratory Medicine from ED will be discharged to HITH in the conventional way (the control group).
EDPED will examine primary and secondary outcomes within 90 days of patient arrival to ED.</summary>
