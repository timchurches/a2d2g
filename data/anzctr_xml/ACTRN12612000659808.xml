  <interventions>
    <interventions>Foot massage involving long gliding, rhythmical strokes of the entire foot and ankle, and light pressure massage by a certified therapist before the start of each of the staff participant rostered shifts over 4 weeks. All foot massages will be conducted in a quiet, separate room with a closed door displaying a Do not disturb sign to enhance privacy and create a more conducive, therapeutic environment. The intervention consists of 5 minutes massage for each foot and depending on the number of shifts each participant works per week, participants will receive between 12-20 massages over the 4 week period. Following a 2-week washout period of no activity, intended to reduce potential treatment carryover effects, participants will then cross-over into the opposite treatment group and the protocol will be repeated for another 4 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group (silent resting) will not receive foot massage but, instead, will sit with their eyes closed and legs slightly elevated off the floor resting on a stool/beanbag. This procedure will assist in the interpretation as to whether the foot massage specifically is having the hypothesised effects on participants or whether the effects reflect special attention and the opportunity for silent resting. To mirror the foot massage condition, the control activity will also be conducted in a quiet, separate room with a closed door displaying a Do not disturb sign. Similarly, depending on the shift pattern of recruited care staff, silent resting will be experienced by each participant between 12-20 times over the 4 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in stress level - Perceived Stress Scale version 10 (PSS-10); a 10-item scale asking participants to rate, on a scale from '0-never' to '4-very often', the frequency with which they have experienced a number of instances of stress over the last month.</outcome>
      <timepoint>a) Pre-massage/rest intervention period (baseline)
b) Post-massage/rest intervention period (before cross over/wash-out)
c) Post-cross over treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in mood states - The Profile Of Mood States- Bipolar (POMS-Bipolar) 15: a 72-item measure that makes up 6 bipolar subscales measuring both positive and negative affects. Participants rate each item on a 4-point scale that ranges from '0-much unlike this' to '3-much like this'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>a) Pre-massage/rest intervention period (baseline)
b) Post-massage/rest intervention period (before cross over/wash-out)
c) Post-cross over treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in somatic symptoms - Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) 17: a 15-item somatic symptom instrument that asks participants to rate the bother-someness of 15 symptoms on a scale of '0-not bothered at all' to '2-bothered a lot'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>a) Pre-massage/rest intervention period (baseline)
b) Post-massage/rest intervention period (before cross over/wash-out)
c) Post-cross over treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in staff experience - Staff Experience of Working with Demented Residents Questionnaire (SEWDRQ) 18: a 21-item assessment of staff experiences and satisfaction, and their relationship with other staff and relatives of residents with dementia.  In the proposed study, the instrument will be modified to include culturally appropriate wording (i.e., 'patient' changed to 'resident').</outcome>
      <timepoint>a) Pre-massage/rest intervention period (baseline)
b) Post-massage/rest intervention period (before cross over/wash-out)
c) Post-cross over treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physiological data - blood pressure and heart rate using an Omron HEM-7070 electronic sphygmomanometer,  and temperature using a No Touch Temporal Artery Thermometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre- and post- each massage intervention and rest period</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>To ensure allocation concealment, a member of the research team not associated with data collection, will use a computer-generated program to randomly allocate participants to the order in which they will experience the intervention and control activities (i.e., foot massage [A] then silent resting [B] or silent resting [B] then foot massage [A]). A system of sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes will be used to maintain allocation concealment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random order generation using a computer generated program</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Firstly, all members of the research team will be blinded to group allocation, as will be contracted Research Assistants (RAs) undertaking all aspects of data collection. Secondly, whilst it is not possible to blind the participants themselves to the treatment they receive, they will be blinded to study hypotheses and proposed outcomes. Finally, other staff working at the LTC facility but not involved with the RCT will be blinded to group allocation, with participants asked not to discuss which treatment group they are in.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has the primary aim of comparing the effect of foot massage versus a control activity of silent resting on perceived stress levels of care staff caring for people with dementia in long-term care. A secondary aim is to explore the effects on participants: physiological indicators of stress, including blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and temperature (T); anxiety levels; mood state; somatic symptoms; and experiences of working with people with dementia.</summary>
