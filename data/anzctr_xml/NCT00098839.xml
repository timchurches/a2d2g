  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Remission Re-induction (CR2) Rate - The proportion of patients who achieved complete response at the end Block 1 of re-induction therapy. Complete Remission (CR) - Attainment of M1 bone marrow (&lt;5% blasts) with no evidence of circulating blasts or extramedullary disease and with recovery of peripheral counts (ANC &gt;1000/uL and platelet count &gt;100,000/uL). Partial Remission (PR) - Complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of M2 marrow status (5% or &lt; 25% blast cells and adequate cellularity). Partial Remission Cytolytic (PRCL) - Complete disappearance of circulating blasts and achievement of at least 50% reduction from baseline in bone marrow blast count. Minimal Response Cytolytic (MRCL) - 50% reduction in the peripheral blast count with no increase in peripheral white blood cell count.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This Phase II trial is studying how well giving epratuzumab together with an established
      chemotherapy platform works in treating young patients with relapsed acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as epratuzumab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and
      help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Chemotherapy drugs work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing them or by stopping them
      from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy in combination chemotherapy may kill cancer
      cells more effectively.</summary>
