  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a phase Ib study with the primary purpose is to estimate the MTD and/or RDE for the
      triple combination of PIM447, formerly LGH447, plus ruxolitinib and LEE011 as well as for the
      doublets, PIM447 plus ruxolitinib, and LEE011 plus ruxolitinib, in patients with
      myelofibrosis (MF). Each regimen will be assessed for safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) and pharmacodynamic effects, and preliminary anti-myelofibrosis activity, including
      changes in spleen volume, JAK2V617F allele burden, and hematologic response.</summary>
