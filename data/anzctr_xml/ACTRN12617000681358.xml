  <interventions>
    <interventions>Schools allocated to the intervention condition will implement a multi-component physical activity intervention (PA4E1). Secondary schools will be supported to  implement seven practices to enhance physical activity opportunities within the school environment. Practices span the domains of the Health Promoting Schools Framework:
1. Curriculum practices: teach practical physical education (PE) lessons using practices to enhance PE quality and increase student moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) levels, development of personal physical activity plans for students, and a ten-week enhanced sport program; 2. School environment practices: regular scheduled and supervised recess and lunchtime physical activity opportunities, and the development of a school physical activity policy;
3. Community and parental practices: school promotion of physical activity to families, and promotion and engagement of community physical activity providers.  
Schools will be provided with support to implement practices over two years using strategies outlined below.
  
A PA4E1 efficacy/ effectiveness trial involving 10 secondary schools (5 intervention, 5 control)  (ACTRN 12612000382875) showed the program delivered over two years resulted in an improvement in daily minutes of MVPA and a reduction in adiposity.  Schools were supported to implement the seven physical activity practices with six support strategies, including location of a change agent within the schools one day per week.

This implementation trial will involve scaling up the intervention to a larger number of schools. Several amendments to the support strategies to better suit implementation in a larger number of schools have been made based on: i) literature reviews; ii) focus groups with school executives and PE teachers involved in the effectiveness trial; and iii) observations of secondary school PA practices identifying  further barriers and enablers to practice implementation which were then addressed by an expert advisory group applying the Theoretical Domains Framework and selecting appropriate, evidence based implementation support strategies and delivery modes (e.g. face to face, telephone support, online learning, apps). The implementation trial will consist of seven support strategies:

1. Establishment of an in-school champion  Instead of the external consultant model used in the initial PA4E1 trial, an existing in-school teacher will be appointed by the school executive to be the program champion. This influential teacher will be allocated half a day per week for 24 months to lead the planning and implementation of the physical activity (PA) practices within the school (funding to allow this release is provided by the project).
2. Obtaining executive and leadership support - As per the initial PA4E1 trial, a school sport and PA committee will lead and oversee the implementation of the intervention within each school.
3. Teacher professional learning - The face-to-face training offered in the PA4E1 effectiveness trial to all PE teachers will be replaced by accredited education sector courses where these are available. Representatives from each school will participate in professional learning in three areas: 1) a course on enhancing PA by developing a policy/procedure that provides students with opportunity to participate in 150 minutes/week PA (12 month on-line course, approx 1 x 1 hour modules per month for 12 months, combination of practical and theory based learning run through Department of Education (DOE), School Sport Unit  accredited. Templates to assist schools in developing a school physical activity policy will be provided); 2) a course covering delivery of an enhanced school sport program (1 day face to face training offered through the DOE School Sport Unit, accredited. Training notes and resources required to deliver the enhanced school sport program such as circuit cards will be provided to participants. It is anticipated that 3-4 staff from each school will attend the training course to enable delivery at the school level. Training courses will be scheduled by the DOE School Sport Unit, across NSW, with school booking in to the most convenient location.); and 3) training on enhancing activity in practical PE lesson (specifically developed for trial and delivered through an Online Portal). Teachers will be asked to complete 2 short modules/presentations (15 minutes per module) per school term over the first year of intervention. Online training will be supplemented with group discussions at PE staff meetings following each online training). Via the in-school program champion, PE and other teachers will be provided with facilitated online training in the PA components relevant to their role, e.g. delivering active PE lessons and implementing personal physical activity plans in to their lesson. 
4. Tools and resources  Based on the PA4E1 trial, physical activity equipment (e.g. balls) will be provided to the intervention schools, and curriculum materials (e.g. templates for personal PA plans), sport program manuals, and sample policies and planning templates will be provided through an Online Portal developed specifically for the program.
5. Prompts and reminders - The school champion and Project Support Officer (see below) will provide prompts to schools and teaching staff to undertake intervention strategies. Prompts will also be built into school communication processes through the Online Portal and documents such as electronic calendar reminders and agenda items in meetings. 
6. Implementation support - Each school will receive support from health district staff for the duration of the intervention (Project Support Officer). At least monthly contacts (via email, telephone or in person) will  support schools to develop their sport and physical activity procedures (this support was not provided in initial trial).  
7. Implementation performance monitoring and feedback - School PA policies and practices will be audited termly by Health District support staff through the Online Portal, with feedback reports regarding implementation progress towards  compliance being provided. The school champion will be prompted to develop an action plan for the following term to meeting the PA4E1 program targets.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The study region spans four Local Health Districts in New South Wales, Australia, namely Central Coast, Hunter New England, Mid North Coast and South Western Sydney. Secondary schools within the study region that meet the following criteria will be considered eligible: Government and Catholic schools, that enrol students in Grades 7-10;  classified as being disadvantaged by the SEIFA Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (suburb in lower 50% of NSW); are not fully selective/sports/performing arts/agriculture/boarding schools; are not participating in other major whole school physical activity intervention studies/initiatives and have the capacity to release a teacher to implement the intervention (school champion role). 

All eligible secondary schools will be invited to participate in the study.. The list of schools will be put in random order for contact within their strata using a random number function in Microsoft Excel by a statistician not involved in contacting schools or in the study delivery. The list will be stratified by local health district and school sector.   A letter inviting schools to be involved in the project, detailing all levels of potential involvement dependent upon allocation will be sent to schools. Approximately one week after the invitation letter is sent, School Principals will be contacted by phone by a member of the research team and invited to participate in the study. A face-to-face meeting will be offered with both the Principal and the Head PDHPE teacher to outline the requirements of the study and gain consent. The Principals of co-educational schools will  be asked to provide separate consent for student level measures.  

Consenting schools will be randomised to intervention or control conditions using a random number function in micro-soft excel by a statistician not involved in contacting schools or in the study delivery. Block randomisation (1:1) will be undertaken within strata based on local health district (4 districts) and sector (Government, Catholic). Principals will be notified of their allocation following baseline collection of primary outcomes.  Schools consenting to student level data will be selected at random for participation in this aspect, within their strata  and notified of involvement when notified of group allocation.
 
PE staff will be provided with study information and consent letters that outline the purpose of the study and level of involvement.  

Allocation will not be known by Principals, PE teachers or research staff at the time of baseline data collection. 

Parents of  students in the relevant Grade in 30 schools (15 per arm) participating in study measurement will be provided an information package and a consent form  asking for their child to participate in the study measurement. The letter will describe the study, but will not indicate to which group the school has been allocated.

    <statisticalmethods>Student and school characteristics will be summarised separately for intervention and control schools. The analysis will follow the intention to treat principles, with multiple imputation the primary method of dealing with missing data. Per protocol analyses will also be performed.

Differences between treatment groups in the primary outcome at 12 months and 24-months (collected from 76 schools recruited to the implementation intervention) will be assessed using logistic regression models (a separate analysis conducted at both time-points), the stratification variables will be included in the models as covariates.

For secondary student level outcomes (collected from a nested sample of students attending 30 schools; n=1200 students), analysis of minutes of MVPA per day (overall, and within school hours) will be undertaken using a linear mixed model (LMM ), including a school-level random intercept to model the clustering (30 clusters, 15 intervention and 15 control). Separate analysis will be conducted at 12 and 24-months.

The target sample is 76 secondary schools recruited to the school physical activity implementation intervention, with secondary outcome measures collected in a nested sample of 30 randomly selected secondary schools (n=1200 students).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To address adolescent PA, Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1) is a multi-component secondary school PA intervention recently trialled in New South Wales (NSW), Australia in a study involving 10 disadvantaged secondary schools (5 intervention schools, 5 control schools). The program involved schools implementing seven PA strategies, which schools were supported to implement The intervention delivered over two years resulted in significant improvements in adolescents daily minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and adiposity at 24 months. The program was cost-effective and acceptable to stakeholders. There is currently little evidence to guide the successful scale-up of effective programs, such as PA4E1, to a larger number of secondary schools. Without adequate implementation at scale of such programs, their benefits cannot be realised. A larger trial of the PA4E1 intervention will be conducted in secondary schools located in disadvantaged areas in four NSW Local Health Districts.

The primary aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in increasing school implementation of seven practices designed to facilitate student PA levels (PA practices). The effectiveness of the intervention in improving adolescent PA and preventing adiposity, and its cost effectiveness in doing so, will also be assessed in a sub-sample of schools (secondary outcome). 
The study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (38 intervention schools and 38 control schools). An implementation support intervention adapted for scale up from the support provided to schools in the PA4E1 effectiveness trial has been designed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). A nested sample of 30 schools (15 per group) will collect student level measures to assess the secondary outcomes.
