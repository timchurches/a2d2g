    <summary>This Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-ranging study
      will compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cicletanine hydrochloride (HCl) to
      placebo in subjects with PAH. Study drug will be administered alone, or on the background of
      stable PAH therapy. The study will consist of 3 periods: a screening period, a 12-week
      placebo-controlled treatment period, and a long-term, blinded extension period.</summary>
