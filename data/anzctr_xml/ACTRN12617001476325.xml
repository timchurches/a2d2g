  <interventions>
    <interventions>A 12 month randomised control study will be conducted. Participants randomised to the intermittent energy restriction (IER) group will be required to follow a very low energy diet of 2100kJ (500kCal) for two days per week and allowed ad libitum eating for the other five days per week. They may choose any days of the week for their fasting days based on their individual preferences and will be encouraged to eat sensibly on their non-fasting days. Participants will receive education and written information developed by the study Dietitian on how to adhere to the fasting days, information on calorie content of foods and sample meal plans for the 2100kJ days also developed by the study Dietitian. Women who are breastfeeding will be allowed extra calorie allowance of up to 2100kJ per day to allow for the energy cost of human milk production and the study dietitian will advise protein intake of 67g per day, adequate hydration and advise that fasting days must not be consecutive. Additionally, breastfeeding mothers will be required to weigh themselves weekly (scales will be provided) to ensure that weight loss does not exceed 0.5kg per week. These participants will have fortnightly follow up with the study Dietitian via phone call, email or university visit if needed for the first 3 months then a minimum of monthly follow up through email, phone call or university visit while they continue to breastfeed. Phone calls or visits would take between five and fifteen minutes.
Participants will attend the clinic on 7 occasions over the 12 months (baseline, 1, 2 3,6, 9 and 12 months). At each visit they will be seen by the study dietitian who will check their compliance with the diet through weighed food diaries and diet checklists, weigh the participant and answer any questions. They will also receive email follow up monthly for the first 3 months (2, 6 and 10 weeks) then every six weeks for the remainder of the study (4.5, 7.5 and 10.5 months). Weight will be taken at every visit. CSIRO Healthy Eating Score survey and a physical activity survey (Active Australia survey) will be administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Fasting blood samples will be taken on five occasions (baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months) and will test fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1C and lipids. A 2-hr oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will also be administered at baseline and 12 months.
Visits to the clinic at baseline and 12 months will take between 2.25 and 2.5 hours due to the 2 hour OGTT. All other visits (1,2,3,6 and 9 months) will take 15-20 minutes.
Women who achieve a weight loss of 7% of their body weight or reach a BMI of 21kg/m2 will be asked to maintain their body weight and be given advice on how to do this. Participants will be encouraged to meet physical activity recommendations of 30 minutes moderate physical activity per day on most days of the week.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will follow a continuous energy restriction diet (CER) over the 12 month study. They will be allowed 5500 kJ (1300kCal) each day. They will be given education on how to adhere to their diet, verbal and written information on the calorie content of various foods and sample meal plans. They will be encouraged to consume a healthy diet to make up their daily calorie allowance and limit consumption of discretionary foods and drinks. The diet materials are developed by the study Dietitian and based on the CSIRO Total Wellbeing Diet. Breastfeeding women will be allowed up to an extra 2100kJ per day as per the IER group and will be required to weigh themselves weekly to ensure weight loss does not exceed 0.5kg per week. All visits, tests and procedures will be the same for the CER group as the IER group for both breastfeeding and non breastfeeding women.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A non inferiority power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size needed for the study to identify if a difference does exist between the intervention and control groups using weight loss as the primary outcome.  With 90% power and significance set at 5%, 130 participants would be needed. To allow for a potential dropout rate of up to 20%, we will aim to recruit a total of 156 participants for the trial (n=78 for each group).

Data tabulation and descriptive analysis of all independent and dependent variables will be conducted. Summary statistics, such as means, variances, and standard deviations, will be reported for each variable. Data will be tested for normal distribution using Q-Q plots and Kolomogorov-Smivov tests. Pearsons chi-squared tests for categorical variables, and independent t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum for continuous variables will compare differences between intervention and control groups at baseline and over time for weight, BMI, fasting glucose, 2-hr glucose, HbA1C, insulin resistance and HOMA-IR, dietary intake and lipids.  Participants will be stratified according to age and weight and for the intervention studies an intention-to-treat method of analysis will be adhered to. Statistical significance will be set to p&lt;0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In 2015 at least 10.9% of pregnant women in Australia were diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) (1, 2). GDM creates risk of complications to both mother and baby during pregnancy, labour and delivery, and although GDM usually disappears shortly after birth, the mother remains at high risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) in the future (3). The health risks and complications associated with T2DM are well known and include development of other chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease (CVD), heart attack, stroke and kidney disease making diabetes a major health concern in Australia and globally (4). Lifestyle interventions involving diet and/or exercise that result in weight loss can reduce the risk of developing T2DM (5), however research has shown weight loss is not easily achieved or maintained (6-8). Keeping women engaged in a weight loss program can be difficult when they have a baby or young children to care for given the time constraints and lifestyle adjustments associated with looking after their children (9). Intermittent Energy Restriction (IER) is a form of calorie restriction which requires periods of severe calorie restriction or fasting) followed by periods of non-restricted eating each week. Previous research shows IER can result in weight loss at a comparable rate to daily energy restriction (10, 11). 
This study will test if the IER diet strategy commonly known as the 5:2 diet provides a suitable regime for women with a history of GDM who have a young family at home by creating  less burden and interruption to daily life by restricting energy intake for short periods and advising usual but not excessive eating the rest of the week. This will be the first study that examines an IER pattern for weight loss and T2DM prevention following GDM. Results from this PhD have the potential to benefit Australian women and families by improving their health and potentially reducing the financial burden associated with diabetes to individuals and the community.
