      <outcome>Acute respiratory illness (ARIs) and acute gastrointestinal (AGE) illness rates per 10,000 child-days in healthy children in the first two years of life - This measure will be calculated using counts of ARIs and AGE in study children during the first two years of life as the numerator, and person-time in child-months on the study as the denominator.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pathogen-specific rate of episodes of ARI and AGE per 10,000 child-days in healthy children in the first two years of life - Viral and bacterial testing will allow to calculate pathogen-specific rates: This measure will be calculated using counts of pathogen-specific ARIs and AGE in study children during the first two years of life as the numerator, and person-time in child-months on the study as the denominator.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, the investigator will be approaching pregnant women to undertake 2 years of
      weekly respiratory and nappy specimen collection from their healthy new born infant. These
      specimens will be mailed to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases (Qpid) Laboratory
      where they will be stored and batched tested for viruses and bacteria. As well as this,
      parents will keep a simple daily symptom diary for their child, allowing us to match
      detection of viruses and bacteria to periods when the study child did or did not have
      symptoms. This will help our understanding of what finding these viruses and bacteria in
      specimens from children really means.</summary>
