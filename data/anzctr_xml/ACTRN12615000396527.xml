  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel intervention trial.  A total of 128 individuals aged 50 to 70 years will take part in the study with an intervention period of 90 days. 

Participants will be required to complete four testing sessions (day 0, day 7, day 30 and day 90), and one screening session.  At each session participants will be required to complete a series of measures assessing cognitive function. 


Following visit 1 participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of the two treatments (administered in capsules)

- Proprietary spearmint extract (900 mg/day)
-  Matched placebo (of microcrystalline cellulose)

The study product (two capsules) will be administered orally (self-administered at home) daily for 90 days.  Compliance will be assessed by capsule count at each study visit.

- Subject has a history or presence of cancer in the prior 2 years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer.
- Subject has an active infection or signs/symptoms of an infection at clinic visit. Clinic visits will be rescheduled to allow subject to be symptom-free of any type of systemic infection for at least 5 days.

    <concealment>Participants will be stratified to the intervention or control group based on their age, gender, and smoking (current user of tobacco or non-user of tobacco (no tobacco use for 6 months or more). </concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator was used to perform permuted block randomization.

Randomization codes will be kept in a sealed envelope in a secure filing cabinet. While the study is a double blind trial, study investigators will know the location of, and have access to, the sealed randomisation code envelope. This is in the event of an emergency where the content of the treatment is needed to be known. In the event that the code break envelope is opened, the ethics committee and the Sponsor will be informed. Each participants unblinding is considered on a case-by-case basis following authorisation by the Safety Committee which includes the Research Nurse, Chairman of the Safety Committee (General Practitioner [GP]) and the Principal Investigator.
