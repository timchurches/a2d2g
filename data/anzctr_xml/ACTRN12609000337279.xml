  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fat emulsions are an essential part of parenteral nutrition (PN) combining a high energy load with an essential fatty acid (EFA) intake.The primary purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of new fish oil based intravenous fat emulsion (SMOFlipid) as compared to traditional olive oil based intravenous fat emulsion (Clinoleic). This study will specifically look at plasma and red cell fatty acid levels particularly Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) which plays an important role in development and vision of newborn babies and also oxidative strss levels (F2-isoprostanes) before and after the intervention in a randomised controlled trial.</summary>
