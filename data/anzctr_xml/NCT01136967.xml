Experimental: Cohort 1 (V600E BRAF negative) - Cohort 1 (V600E BRAF negative) enrolled participants not harboring the V600E BRAF mutation with disease progression following up to 2 prior systemic anticancer regimens (excluding anti-VEGF) for unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma.

Experimental: Cohort 2 (V600E BRAF positive) - Cohort 2 (V600E BRAF positive) enrolled participants harboring the activating BRAF mutations (mainly the V600E mutation) with disease progression following BRAF V600E-targeted therapy.


Treatment: drugs: Lenvatinib
Participants received lenvatinib 24 mg orally, once daily continuously in 28-day cycles until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) - ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in each cohort who had a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 for target lesions and assessed by magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography (MRI/CT) scans, as determined by independent radiologic review (IRR). A BOR of CR required confirmation by a subsequent CR assessment at least 4 weeks later. A BOR of PR required confirmation by a subsequent CR or PR assessment at least 4 weeks later. CR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) had to have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeters. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. ORR = CR + PR.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of study drug until all participants completed a minimum of 6 cycles (28-day cycles) or discontinued treatment prior to end of Cycle 6 by the date of data cutoff (Jan 2012 and Apr 2013 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) - PFS was measured as the time from the date of first administration of study treatment until the date of first documentation of disease progression or date of death from any cause (whichever occurred first), as determined by IRR and Investigator based on RECIST v1.1. Disease progression per RECIST v1.1 was defined as at least a 20% relative increase and 5 mm absolute increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (taking as reference the smallest sum on study) recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred first) or up to data cutoff (Jan 2012 and Apr 2013 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively), up to approximately 2.9 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS was defined as the length of time in months from the date of first administration of study drug until the date of death from any cause, and was based on the data cutoff date for each cohort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of study drug until date of death from any cause or up to data cutoff (Jan 2012 and Apr 2013 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively), up to approximately 2.9 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) - DCR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a BOR of CR or PR or stable disease (SD). To be assigned a BOR of SD, the time from the first administration of study drug until the date of documented SD needed to be greater than or equal to seven weeks based on IRR and Investigator's assessment. DCR = CR + PR + SD</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred first) or up to data cutoff (Jan 2012 and Apr 2013 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively), up to approximately 2.9 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) - CBR was defined as the percentage of participants who had a BOR of CR or PR or durable SD (SD lasting greater than or equal to 23 weeks) based on IRR and Investigator's assessment. CBR = CR + PR + durable SD rate</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of study drug until documentation of disease progression or death from any cause (whichever occurred first) or up to data cutoff (Jan 2012 and Apr 2013 for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, respectively), up to approximately 2.9 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)/ Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as a Measure of Safety and Tolerability of Lenvatinib - Safety was assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs including all Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grades and SAEs; regular monitoring of hematology, clinical chemistry, and urine values; physical examinations; and regular measurement of vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans or echocardiogram.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each participant, from the first patient first dose till 30 days after the last dose of study drug, up to approximately 2.9 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics - Due to the sparse PK sampling in this study, the data were pooled with data from other Phase 1 studies conducted in participants with solid tumors.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Predose and 2 to 12 hours postdose at Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 15, and Cycle 2 Day 1</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
