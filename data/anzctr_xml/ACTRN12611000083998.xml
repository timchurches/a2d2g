  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a progressive disorder which affects muscle strength in boys and results in the loss of the ability to walk between 9 and 13 years of age. Along with muscle weakness the boys often also experience muscle tightness, particularly in their calf muscles. This in turn causes them to walk on their toes, which makes standing and walking balance more precarious. 
Boys with DMD undertake physiotherapy prescribed stretching programs and use night splinting to address this muscle tightness but commonly these are not sufficient to overcome the muscle shortening. Surgical lengthening has been shown to have a beneficial effect on ankle contracture in boys with DMD. This is very invasive and has not been shown to be associated with any improvement in strength or function. Below knee serial casting is used in some overseas centres as a treatment option for calf shortening.

This project aims to assess the effectiveness of below knee serial casting on the length of calf muscles and walking ability in boys with DMD. We hope to assess whether short periods of serial casting will maintain calf muscle length, improve gait, and maintain or improve motor function. The boys gait, muscle length and motor function will be assessed before and after serial casting and then at 3 monthly intervals for a twelve month period.</summary>
