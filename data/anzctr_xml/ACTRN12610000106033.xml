    <studytitle>The ICE Tea Study: Dietary compensation capabilities in individuals resistant to obesity (expenders) and susceptible to obesity (conservers)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>An 8 week randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel dietary intervention to compare the effects of consuming additional calories on the dietary compensation patterns of individuals who maintain a healthy body weight with relative ease (expenders) and those who struggle to maintain a healthy body weight (conservers).</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>This will be a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind parallel intervention.  The study will be carried out to assess the effect of consuming additional calories of the dietary compensation capabilities on individuals who maintain a healthy body weight with relative ease (expenders) and individuals who struggle to maintain a healthy body weight (conservers).  Initial respondents will be screened using a pre-tested tool to identify expenders (at least 60) and conservers (at least 60).  Participants will then be randomly assigned to receive either 600ml of a sugar-sweetened beverage (1000kJ) or 600ml of a non-caloric beverage per day, for a period of 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group (30 expenders, 30 conservers) will consume 600ml of a non-caloric beverage per day for 8 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body weight.  This will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 8 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition.  This will be measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and 8 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood cholesterol levels.  Plasma total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and plasma triacylglycerol will be measured by enzymatic methods using a Cobas Mira Plus analyser.  Plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration will be calculated by the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al., 1972).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most obesity research has focused on the characteristics of overweight and obesity both at the individual and population level in an attempt to determine the cause of excess weight and to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.  An alternative approach is to investigate the characteristics of those who manage to maintain a healthy body weight with relative ease (expenders), despite living in an obesogenic environment.  Information from this group may allow us to develop novel strategies to benefit those who continually struggle to maintain a healthy body weight (conservers).  In addition, it may allow us to intervene in early childhood to promote sustainable obesity-preventing lifestyles.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the dietary compensation capabilities of expenders and conservers in response to additional calories over an 8 week period.</summary>
