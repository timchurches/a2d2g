  <interventions>
    <interventions>Indigenous students from three secondary schools who participate in the Sporting Chance Program will be invited (n=80-90). Once per week, for a period 90-120 minutes, consenting participants will participate in a pre-service teacher-led 6-week intervention that will aim to increase their physical activity levels in those sessions, whilst meeting program outcomes. These sessions will be underpinned by the Social Cognitive Theory, and will include student choice of activities, goal setting, time to practice new sport/physical activity skills, pre-service teacher instruction, modelling, and feedback and social peer support/reinforcement.</interventions>
    <comparator>Indigenous students who did not consent to the intervention (but did consent to being assessed) will be considered the control.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is academic performance 2 years post intervention.
Academic outcome will be assessed using the Wide Range Achievement Test -4th edition (WRAT-4). The WRAT-4 includes subtests that assess reading (single word decoding), sentence comprehension, spelling and math computation.  Additional information regarding literacy and numeracy, academic performance, grade repetition and integration assistance will be sought from parents and teachers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years post intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Working memory will be assessed subtests from the Working Memory Test Battery for Children (WMTB-C): 
- Verbal short-term memory will be assessed with Digit Recall and Word List Recall which requires the child to immediately recall verbal information. 
- Visual-spatial short-term memory will be assessed with Block Recall and Mazes Memory which involves the child to immediately recall visual-spatial information. A subtest from the Automated Working Memory Assessment (AWMA) known as Mister X will also be used to assess visuo-spatial working memory. 
- Verbal working memory will be assessed with Backward Digit Recall which involves the child to recall sequences of digits in the reverse order to that presented. 
- Visual-spatial working memory will be assessed with Backward Block Recall which involves the child to recall sequences of tapped blocks in the reverse order to that presented.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks, 12 months and 24 months post-intervention commencement</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research project is to create partnerships with Indigenous local community agencies and three local high schools to increase the physical activity levels, educational interests and goals, and life skills of their Indigenous students. Additionally, this will provide University of Sydney preservice physical education teachers with a sociocultural teaching experience that increases and deepens their competence and knowledge of Indigenous youth, their current health, physical inactivity levels and educational goals.</summary>
