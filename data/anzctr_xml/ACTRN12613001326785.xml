  <interventions>
    <interventions>The procedural component of the research will involve insertion of the implantable loop recorder under the skin in the left front chest wall region. This will take approximately 15-20 minutes and is performed under local anaesthetic. The recorder will be implanted for 2 years over which the participant will be monitored on a continuing regular basis.
</interventions>
    <comparator>A control group for comparison consisting of patients (who may or may not have CKD) with an implantable loop recorder inserted (up to 1 year prior to participation in this study) for routine clinical indications such as lightheadedness or palpitations for investigation will also be followed up.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sudden cardiac death will be determined by a consensus adjudication committee after assessment of electrocardiogram records of the implantable loop recorder, autopsy reports, holter recordings or telemetry tracings and hospital discharge documentation/medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at 12 and 24 months from insertion of implantable loop recorder.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Significant Arrhythmias will be determined by a consensus adjudication committee after assessment of electrocardiogram records of the implantable loop recorder, holter recordings or telemetry tracings and hospital discharge documentation/medical records.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to study the abnormal processes in the heart that can occur in people with chronic kidney disease.  These processes may lead to significant heart rhythm disturbances. In this study we will assess people with chronic kidney disease who may be at high risk of developing these disorders. By doing so we aim to identify factors in chronic kidney disease that may lead to development of life-threatening heart rhythm disorders and determine potential measures to prevent sudden death.
