  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is aimed at assessing how ginseng red berry supplementation (24 hr post-consumption) influences glucose metabolism and cognitive function. The trial is a double-blinded parallel design. This design was selected since this is a preliminary study and the time-dependent bioactivity of ginseng red berry metabolites within the body is currently unknown; a parallel trial design will eliminate any potential problems from a cross-over design. 
Participants will be randomised into 2 groups; group 1 will consume a single dose of ginseng red berry supplement containing 750 mg ginseng red berry extract, whereas group 2 will consume a matched placebo containing a cellulose food filler equivalent to the amount of ginseng red berry extract.  These supplements are prepared commercially by Natural F&amp;P Corporation (South Korea) and meet both Korea and New Zealand food safety requirements for human consumption and administered to the participants in the form of 3 tablets (each containing 250 mg ginseng red berry extract) with water. 
The trial will take place in designated clinical facilitates within PFR and will be conducted by experience trial co-ordinators, who are also First Aider and trained phlebotomist. 
This trial will consist of 3 sessions, each of which will be carried out over 3 days; session 1 (familiarisation session) and session 1 and 2 (main trial sessions. Briefly, in session 1, participants will be asked to consuming a sugar drink (containing 60 g sucrose) and at specific times over the next 2 hrs blood sugar metabolites will be measured. In session 2, participants will initially be asked to complete a mood questionnaire (POMS), followed by consuming a sugar drink (containing 60 g sucrose). At specific times over the next 2 hrs blood sugar metabolites will be measured. In addition, after 15mins, the participants will be asked to complete a series of computerised mental tasks (takes about 7 mins). After the 2hrs, participants will then be asked to consume a ginseng or placebo supplement and asked to return 24 hrs later to complete session 3. In session 3, participants are asked to repeat the assessments of session 2 without the consumption of ginseng.
</interventions>
    <comparator>In this trial we propose to use a matched placebo. This is prepared by the same company that made the ginseng red berry supplement (Natural F&amp;P Corporation, South Korea). The control (placebo) supplement contains the same basic ingredients as the ginseng red berry supplement but an equivalent amount (750 mg) of crystalline cellulose 101 (common food filler) replaces the ginseng red berry extract. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sugar metabolism parameters: Collected blood samples will be processed and analysed for glucose, lactate and HbA1c using point-of-test biosensors. Plasma samples collected will also be measured for ATP, insulin, glucagon using commercial ELISA kits.    
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sugar metabolism parameters. This will be measured in all three trial session; (session 1 - familiarisation, session 2- pre ginseng consumption and session 3 - 24 hrs post ginseng consumption). Specifically HbA1c prior to consumption of the sugar (60 g sucrose)drink, whereas the other indices will be measured at specific times after the consumption of the sugar drink over 2 hrs; 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 &amp; 120 mins.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Computerised cognitive tasks: This computerised test (commerically available /validated and known as  'Joggle')  will be performed by the trial participants using an iPad. The 'joggle' cognitive function test composes of 8 individual tasks, which assesses the following skills; motor praxis, visual object learning, working memory, abstract matching, line orientation, digital symbol substitution, balloon analogue risk and psychomotor vigilance. These tasks are randomised to prevent a learning effect. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Computerised cognitive tasks: This will be measured in sessions 2 (pre-ginseng consumption) and 3 (24 hrs post-ginsneg consumption). Specifically  particpants will be asked to complete a series of computer taks on an iPad 15 min after the consumption of the sugar drink. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived physical and cognitive assessment POMS): Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire assessing PoMS</outcome>
      <timepoint>Perceived physical and cognitive assessment POMS): Particpants will be asked to complete this form at the beginning of sessions 2 (pre-ginseng consumption) and 3 (24 hrs post ginseng consumption). </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood biochemical measurements: Collected venous blood will be used to measure brain wellness biomarker BDNF.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood biochemical measurements: BDNF will be measured in venous plasma samples collected before the start of sessions 2 (pre-ginseng consumption) and 3 (24 hrs post ginseng consumption).  </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>All trial data will be captured on trial specific visit worksheets and transcribed to an access database (Dotmatrix), held at PFR. The data will be analysed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 for Windows (version 5.1.2600). Using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), comparison between supplementation groups over time for each measure (independent variable) will also be determined, providing levels of significance for trial effect, treatment effect, and interaction effect between feeding conditions. Post-hoc tests will also be performed to identify significant differences at each time point. Values will be presented as means +/- standard deviation (or standard error) at a 95% significance level (p = 0.05). Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficients may also be assessed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows to investigate if there are any relationships between certain variables by giving an R-value between 0.0 and 1.00 (or -0.0 and -1.00).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scientific evidence shows that ginsenosides (saponin compounds) naturally present in ginseng species (Korean ginseng Panax ginseng and other Panax species) can confer multiple health benefits, including support for optimal sugar regulation and cognitive performance. However this research has been done on the ginseng root, and
whilst ginseng berries (red or yellow) show a variety of potentially bioactive ginsenosides, similar to those found in the root, it is unclear whether ginseng berries possess any health properties. In this preliminary feeding study, we hypothesis that consumption of a single dose of a supplement containing a ginseng red berry extract will upon gut digestion / metabolism generate bioactive ginsenosides (similar to those found in root and/or novel bioactive compounds) that exhibit health properties that supports sugar regulation and cognitive wellbeing.</summary>
