  <interventions>
    <interventions>Temporary withdrawal of modified-release oral fampridine (4-aminopyridine) 10mg twice daily (bd) in patients who are taking the drug, in order for clinical and electrophysiological testing of upper limb function to be carried out and compared on and off the drug.  The drug does not require to be weaned prior to withdrawal.  Adherence will be monitored by participant self-report.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparison will be made within patients on and off drug.  Patients will require to be off drug for a minimum of 10 days prior to "off drug" measurements being made, and "on drug" for a minimum of 10 days.  Most patients will then continue on drug indefinitely, depending on response.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between clinical (9-hole PEG test, fatigue impact score, manual muscle strength assessment, strength measured using hand-held dynamometer) and electrophysiological findings (i.e. change in motor threshold, motor evoked potential recruitment curves, paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, central motor conduction time, somatosensory and visual evoked potentials) in patients on compared to off drug.</outcome>
      <timepoint>On treatment (patients currently taking treatment prior to enrolement and will restart again once "off treatment" measurements hav been taken) compared to off treatment for a minimum duration of 10 days.

NB Patients will be enrolled into the trial at a screening visit.  They will attend for three additional visits over the course of the study, and the examiner will not know whether patients are currently on or off medication.  This will be managed by the study co-ordinator in conjunction with the patient.  Therefore some patients will be studied initially "ON" drug and subsequently come off drug, be re-studied again after being off drug for at least 10 days; subsequently patients will resume drug and be studied again (after a minumum of 10 days).  Thus the order of testing (ON, OFF, ON; OFF, ON, ON; ON, ON, OFF) will vary between patients without the examiner's knowledge.  </timepoint>

    <concealment>Patients will already be taking fampridine and will be asked to cease treatment for at least 10 days.  Three sets of measurements will be made, two while on treatment and one while off treatment.  Measurements will include clinical tests of upper limb function (including 9-hole PEG test, sensory discrimination testing) and electrical tests of nerve function including evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation.  The patient will know whether they are taking the drug or not but the tester will be blinded.  </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The electrophysiological  studies and clinical assessments will be assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. Correlations between changes in electrophysiology parameters and performance on the 9-hole peg test will be examined using Pearson correlation coefficients. One-way ANOVA will be used to compare the measures at baseline between fampridine responders and non-responders. This will be repeated after medication. Post hoc analysis with pairwise paired t test and Bonferroni correction will be used to compare all significant interactions.  This study is designed as an adjunct to a placebo-controlled clinical trial of fampridine in upper limb function (ACTRN12613000331730) for which a sample size calculation has been included (40 patients).  The magnitude of effects of fampridine on upper limb function (clinically or electrophysiologically) has not previously been systematically studied.  Therefore the data in the current study may augment those of the associated study.  In addition, the patient pool of the current study is limited to patients already taking fampridine, of whom there are around 40-50 in our service, hence the target number of 30 patients which has been chosen.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Modified-release fampridine is licensed in Australia for the symptomatic treatment of walking disability in multiple sclerosis (MS).  However, many patients with MS have reported beneficial effects on other areas such as fatigue, vision and upper limb function.  These benefits have not been formally studied in a trial.  In addition, it is not known how modified-release fampridine works and why it seems to work better in some people than others.  
Electrophysiological techniques such as nerve conduction studies, evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation can be used to study the nervous system and the effects of drugs on it.  These techniques can be used to identify where particular drugs might exert their effect and help to uncover more information about how the drugs work, with the eventual aim of developing new symptomatic treatments for MS.  The aim of this study is to use these techniques to examine the nervous system in study participants on and off fampridine and to compare the findings between responders and non-responders to the drug.  </summary>
