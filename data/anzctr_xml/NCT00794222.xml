  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The mobiletype program is a mental health assessment and monitoring tool that runs on mobile
      phones.

      The program assesses the general mental health of young people in real-time and transmits
      this data to a website to be reviewed by their general practitioner (GP) in consultation with
      their patient. The website consists of individualised feedback reports for each participant,
      and graphical displays of the monitoring data. The primary aims of the current project are to
      examine: (1) whether the process of self-monitoring via the mobiletype program increases
      young people's awareness of their mood and reduces depressive symptoms and (2) whether
      emotional self-awareness mediates the relationship between self-monitoring and depressive
      symptoms.</summary>
