    <interventions>Diagnostic test: Circulating tumour cells are isolated from blood (10 ml in EDTA) by ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumour Cells using filtration) technology and analysed within one week before treatment (baseline) and at 3 months after treatment cycle commenced and at least 3 weeks after treatment cycle ceased (follow-up) - primary outcome measure
Follow-up at 6 months, 9 months and 12 months, if applicable (secondary outcome measures)

Screening test: Early detection in patients with a family history of cancer or patients with chronic disease, or as part of a health check. The ISET-ED (early detection screening) test has the potential to detect potentially malignant cells, and other illness causing rare cells.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatment effectiveness:
This study will determine whether there is a difference between the number and type of circulating tumour cells in cancer patients before and after treatment. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18-80 years, diagnosed with any cancer and have received treatment at least 3 weeks ago or will receive treatment within one week. 

Study details 
The study aims to establish the Circulating Tumour Cell (CTC) detection method using the ISET (Isolation by Size of Epithelial/Trophoblastic Tumour Cells) device (Rarecells, France) in conjunction with cancer therapies offered at National Institute of Integrative Medicine. There will be no changes to the participants cancer treatment plans. Participants will be required to provide a blood sample at the beginning of their treatment and 3 months after commencement of treatment. The blood will be processed using the ISET technology to determine the number and types of circulating tumour cells.

Early detection screening:
This component of the study aims to determine whether the ISET-ED screening blood test can be used for early detection of cancer.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this part of the study if you are aged between 18-80 years and have a family history of cancer, or have been diagnosed with chronic disease, or are attending a health check.
Study details:
Participants in this part of the study will undergo a blood test at baseline and at 3 months.
The ISET-ED (early detection screening) test has the potential to detect potentially malignant cells, and other illness causing rare cells. </summary>
