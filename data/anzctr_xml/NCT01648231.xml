             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator feels that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures..

        replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a
        protocol approved contraception method if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
        Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior
        to study enrollment. For mostforms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

        methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
        investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy
        at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 14 days post-last dose
        of amlodipine/losartan.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of two fixed dose
      combination tablet formulations of amlodipine and losartan in healthy volunteers. Subjects
      will receive each of the following three treatments administered in a randomized three-way
      crossover design: a reference treatment consisting of a 5mg amlodipine tablet and 100mg
      losartan tablet; a fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg
      losartan; and another fixed dose combination tablet consisting of 5mg amlodipine and 100mg
      losartan; all three treatments will be administered once orally and in a fasted state. Serial
      blood samples will be obtained at pre-defined timepoints for pharmacokinetic analysis of
      amlodipine, losartan and carboxylic acid (this is the primary active losartan metabolite).
      Safety assessments will include measurements of orthostatic vital signs, electrocardiograms
      (ECG), collection of adverse events (AE) and clinical laboratory tests.</summary>
