  <interventions>
    <interventions>We have studied two group of patients comparing intensive treatment versus standard treatment :  In the intensive treatment group we used a combination of several drug including: Angiotensin converting  enzyme inhibitor,  (Ramipril;oral capsules dose- range 5-10 mg daily for 36 months prescribed by physician based on clinical variables) and Angiotensin  receptor blocker (Irbesartan oral capsules: dose-range 150-300 mg daily for 36 months, prescribed by physician based on clinical variables ) to achieve a blood pressure  goal of less than 130 /80 mm/Hg;  Atorvastatin oral capsules (dose-range 20-40 mg daily for 36 months, prescribed by physician based on clinical variables  ) to achieve low density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol level less than 100 mg/dl; spironolactone, oral capsules (dose-range 25-50 mg daily, for 36 months,prescribed by physician based on clinical variables )  titrated to maintain serum potassium level less than 5.5 mEq/l.
Patients in this group receive all 4 drugs on a daily basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the control group we used the following combination: (Ramipril;oral capsules dose- range 5-10 mg daily for 36 months prescribed by physician based on clinical variables) to achieve blood pressure value  goal of less than 130 /80 mm/Hg; Atorvastatin oral capsules (dose-range 10-40 mg daily for 36 months, prescribed by physician based on clinical variables  ) to achieve low density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol level less than 130 mg/dl.
Patients in this group receive all 2 drugs on a daily basis.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients with membranous glomerulonephritis and minimal change disease were excluded because of the possibility of spontaneous remission and the unpredictable response of these patients to treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus, renovascular or malignant hypertension, secondary glomerular disease, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, malignancies, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident within the 6 months preceding the study, congestive heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, serum potassium &gt;5 mEq/l, eGFR&lt;30 ml/min/1.73m2, and a history of intolerance to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs) . We excluded patients treated with steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or immunosuppressive agents within 6 months preceeding the study and patients previously treated with these drugs and achieving long period of remission.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study was to compare effects on proteinuria and  renal function of two different therapeutic regimens: The first, was based on intensive therapy, which comprised  a combination of  renin angiotensin system  inhibitors (Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors plus angiotensin  receptor blocker spironolactone) and  a dose of statin to achieve a low density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol target less than 100 mg /dl. The second regimen (representative of a more conventional therapy) was based only on  an angiotensin convertin enzyme inhibitors plus   a dose of statin to achieve a low density lipoprotein ( LDL) cholesterol target less than 130 mg/dl</summary>
