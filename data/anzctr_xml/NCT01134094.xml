  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Open reduction internal fixation of the ankle
Treatment: surgery - Non Operative

Active Comparator: Non-Operative - Patients who are treated non-operatively will be treated with a walking boot and allowed WBAT. Discharge from hospital will be determined by the patient walking 25m unaided by standby assistance. All patients will be reviewed between 7 and 14 days post injury with repeat x-rays by the treating surgeon.

Active Comparator: Operative - The specific procedure for each patient managed operatively, both in the observational study and the RCT, will be determined by the operating surgeon. Any adverse intra-operative or post-operative event will be recorded. This includes but is not limited to death, infection and neurovascular injury. Post operatively, all patients will be NWB (non weight bearing) and placed in a POP (plaster of paris) below knee cast or walking boot. Discharge from hospital will be determined by the patient walking 25m unaided by standby assistance. The treating surgeon will review the patients after 10-14 days for a wound review, removal of sutures and change of cast to a fibreglass cast or walking boot (cam walker). The patient will be WBAT (weight bearing as tolerated) for a further 4 weeks.
