    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A Simons Mini-max 2-stage design will be used to conduct the trial. This trial design will optimise safety by exposing fewer patients to a potentially inactive treatment. 
With this study design a total of 25 patients are needed to achieve 80% power with an alpha of 0.05. 
The null hypothesis is that &lt;10% of patients respond to the DCA i.e. H0: patients achieving ORR &lt; 10% of study participants. 
The alternative hypothesis is that at least 30% of patients will have a response to the DCA: Ha: patients achieving ORR = 30% of study participants
The decision to terminate the study and reject the drug after the first stage of the study will be based on the number of responses observed. If at least 1 of the first 15 evaluable patients in stage 1 achieve a response as defined above, the study will continue to stage 2 until a total of 25 evaluable patients have been recruited.  
If in the final analysis more than 5 patients have an ORR then the null hypothesis will be rejected i.e. confirming evidence of the efficacy of DCA in deepening responses in plateau phase patients.
The primary efficacy analysis of ORR will be performed when the required number of evaluable patients has been enrolled. The study population is defined as all registered patients who have received at least 12 weeks of treatment. A final evaluation of the proportion of patients achieving ORR will be calculated and a corresponding 95% CI reported.
The expected enrolment period is 12 months. To account for potential non-adherence or early dropout, we envisage that up to an additional 5 patients may be enrolled in the first stage and that these additional enrolments may continue, only until such time as 15 patients have successfully completed the 3 month exposure to the study drug. Once the first 15 patients have completed this treatment period, no further enrolment will occur until the initial efficacy analysis is complete.


Simple descriptive statistics will be used to measure efficacy (proportion of patients achieving a response). 

Secondary analyses of response according to myeloma characteristics (cytogenetics where available, prior treatment type etc) will also occur</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether 3 months of treatment with oral dichloroacetate can supress multiple myeloma. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a diagnosis of Plasma Cell Myeloma which is in a 'Plateau-Phase', i.e. a period of neither progression nor response at least 28 days following the last change in myeloma treatment. 

Study details: All participants in this study will be treated with a drug called dichloroacetate. This will be taken orally (by mouth) daily for 3 months A number of blood samples will be taken throughout treatment in order to determine how the body responds to treatment. This information will help us determine how well dichloroacetate is tolerated, and whether it has the ability to suppress multiple myeloma.
