  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomly assigned to have 10% lidocaine spray (approximately 30mg)  or normal saline in their throat on arrival, approximately 3 minutes before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.</interventions>
    <comparator>normal saline is sprayed onto patients throats before endoscopy</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The overall ease of the endoscopy assessed by endoscopists via rating scales.
Rating scales are used to assess by endoscopists. The parameters include patients' ability to follow verbal command, show somatic response after anesthesia, have any coughs, hiccups, or gag reflex on esophageal intubation and also the overall ease of esophageal intubation and satification of the procedure by endoscopists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at the end of the endoscopy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemodynamic changes during endoscopy (eg heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, oxygen saturation on 3L oxygen nasal prong, BIS index) and the requirement of airway maneuver</outcome>
      <timepoint>The hemodynamic values (HR, BP, BIS, SpO2) are recorded on arrival, then every 2 min afterwards during endoscopy and again on departure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of topical pharyngeal anesthesia has long been controversial among the anesthetists and no evidence has well supported the use of the spray. The use of lidocaine spray is not without adverse effects, which include aspiration pneumonia, methemoglobinemia and anaphylaxis. Most of the patients undergo endoscopies under general anesthesia and theoretically should not require pharngeal spray to suppress pharyngeal reflexes during the procedure. The aim of the study is determine whether the use of the spray is necessary in patients under deep sedation/general anesthesia. Deep sedation is achieved by total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol.</summary>
