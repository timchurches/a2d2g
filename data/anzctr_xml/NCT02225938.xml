  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increasingly patients with critical illness requiring life support in an intensive care unit
      are surviving their hospital admission. Currently the investigators do not know what effect
      the ICU admission, and the life support, has on their long-term quality of life and whether
      they can return to their pre-illness level of function following ICU.

      The investigators aim to test telephone follow-up of ICU survivors in assessing function and
      quality of life six months after ICU admission. Additionally, the investigators will identify
      if there are factors that lead to poor recovery. The investigators hope this can influence
      and change current ICU practice to improve recovery and long-term outcomes for patients.

      The investigators aim to select a total of 300 patients from ICU, 75 patients from each of
      the four ICUs. If they survive to hospital discharge, patients and their relatives will
      receive a telephone questionnaire at 6 months after the ICU admission that aims to assess
      their long-term outcomes, including physical, cognitive and emotional function, quality of
      life, and whether they have been able to return to work following ICU.</summary>
