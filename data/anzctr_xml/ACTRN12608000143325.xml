  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be randomised to a) either closure or non closure of the subcutaneous fascia and b) closure of the skin with a subcuticular monofilament non absorbable versus absorbable suture. For both aspects of the procedure these are 2 currently used techniques so there is no true intervention only randomising to 2 currently used techniques. The design is therefore 2 x 2 factorial with resulting 4 possible groups. Follow up will be until 6 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Caesarean section is a common operation and for different parts of the operation techniques vary widely between surgeons. Information is lacking about the best techniques and how different techniques may affect the mother's health. We propose to evaluate two methods of stitching up or closing the skin and whether to close or not to close the fatty layer beneath the skin. We want to know if these different methods cause differences in wound problems after birth and also whether there is a difference in pain and the mothers general physical and emotional health. We aim to examine these methods in approximately 700 women over a 2 year period and will follow them until 6 weeks after the birth.</summary>
