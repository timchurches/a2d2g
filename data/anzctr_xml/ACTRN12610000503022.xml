  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cross-sectional study with a sample of convenience of 30 participants. Single session with 2 hours assessment will be performed. Photogrammetry method will be used to evaluate the posture of the volunteers. Pictures will be taken on the same session in the sagittal and frontal plane. A few anatomical points will be marked out, including the occipital protuberance, C4, C7, T7, T12, L3 and L5 spinous processes, greater trochanter, anterosuperior iliac spine (ASIS), posteroinferior iliac spine (PIIS), tibial tuberosity (TT), head of the fibula, lateral malleolus, and head of the 5th toe. These markings will be made with red 0.9mm-diameter PIMACO labels and green-colored styrofoam balls will be fixed in place with double-sided tape. The images will be analyzed with the application SAPO (Postural Evaluation Software) version through measures of the angles formed by lines drawn between the previously marked anatomical points. This analysis identifies and quantifies possible asymmetries and vertebral curvature angles. The volunteers will be divided in three groups with 10 participants:
1- First Trimester 
2- Second Trimester
3- Third Trimester</interventions>
