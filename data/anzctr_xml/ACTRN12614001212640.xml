  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are randomized to receive either a 30-60min telephone session of Psychoeducation and Assessment Feedback, up to 8 weekly 30-60min sessions of Befriending, or up to 8 weekly 30-60min sessions of the Social Well-being and Engaged Living (SWEL) intervention. 
(i) SWEL is delivered in 30-60min telephone therapy calls for up to 8 weekly sessions. Sessions may be broken into two shorter calls per week if the participant prefers. Using the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) five areas framework the manual ensures a predominant focus on social functioning and includes modules on problem solving, self concept, behavioural activation, emotion regulation and interpersonal effectiveness. Drug and alcohol use is addressed from a stepped care model.  The core targets of the intervention are emotional self efficacy (affect regulation) and social self efficacy (problem solving, sense of self and interpersonal effectiveness). Core modules are delivered in the first four sessions to maximise impact early on. The intervention is delivered by provisionally and generally registered psychologists.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>(ii) Befriending: participants receive up to 8 weekly 30-60min telephone calls of a manualised control intervention developed in earlier clinical trials to address the non specific elements of psychotherapy. The Befriending intervention controls for therapist contact time, client expectancies, therapeutic alliance and therapist factors such as warmth and understanding. It does not apply any therapeutic techniques specific to major models of psychotherapy but rather is a conversational approach with a friendly focus on everyday events and topics without problem solving or examination of emotions. The intervention is delivered by provisionally and generally registered psychologists. 

(iii) Single-Session Psychoeducation (including assessment feedback): this is a single 30-60min session of telephone counselling where participants receive personalised assessment feedback on their mental health functioning, social and role functioning, and level of drug and alcohol problems. Participants will then receive conversational psycho-education regarding issues considered relevant from their assessment feedback including mental health functioning, social and role functioning and level of drug and alcohol problems. The intervention is delivered by provisionally and generally registered psychologists. </comparator>

    <concealment>Researchers will determine a participant's eligibility through the telephone screening procedure; if participants are eligible they will complete the baseline assessment including a telephone assessment with the researcher and an online self-report questionnaire. At this point, the researcher notifies the Goji Trial Management Software (through the click of a button) that the participant is at the point of randomisation and the participant is allocated to one of the three treatment conditions. This randomisation procedure is an automated process generated by a software program inaccessible to the researchers hence the researchers determining eligibility of participants only become aware of the treatment condition to which a participant is allocated after completion of screening and baseline.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be generated with permuted blocks and will be stratified by referral centre (Rural, Semi-rural, Urban), age group (12-18 years and 19-25 years), gender (male or female) and Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status (yes or no).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Allowing for a 25% loss to follow-up, the total sample size for this study will be 294 youth. With complete data for 73 youth per group, the study will have 80% power to find a difference between groups of 0.4 standard deviations at the 1.7% significance level. The significance level is adjusted by a factor of 3 to control the overall type I error rate at 5% for the 3 pair-wise comparisons that are required to test the primary hypotheses. The calculation assumes that the analysis will be conducted using ANCOVA, and that the correlation between an individuals measure at baseline and follow-up will be 0.65.

The primary outcome in this study will be engagement in education, training or employment. These will be measured at baseline, end of treatment (2 months) and at the two follow up assessments (6 and 12 months post treatment). The primary hypothesis is that the overall engagement score (to be calculated as a proportion of time engaged, i.e. time engaged in school/work/training as a function of the time they are expected to be engaged) of youth who are randomised to active treatment will be higher than youth who are randomised to either Befriending or Psycho-Ed. Differences between treatment groups will be tested using ANalysis of COVAriance (ANCOVA). The outcome in the model will be the individuals total engagement score at 14 months, the main predictor variable in the model will be treatment group, with baseline engagement score and the two stratifying variables included as a covariates. All analyses will be based on the intention to treat principle with consideration given to potential bias from loss to follow up.

Differences between groups in the secondary outcomes will be tested using the same approach (ANCOVA) as the primary outcome variable. Generalised linear mixed models will be used to test for a difference between treatment groups in the trend of each of these outcomes from baseline to 14 months using data from all time points. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to examine the similarity of the treatment effect across rural and urban areas and across age groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a single-blind three-arm randomised controlled trial examining the efficacy of a telephone-delivered social well-being and engaged living (SWEL) intervention for improving the social engagement and emotional well-being of disengaged youth. A total of 294 young people aged 12-25 years will be randomised to receive either (i) up to 8 sessions of SWEL, (ii) up to 8 sessions of Befriending (non-directive supportive contact), or (iii) Single-Session Psycho-Education. It is hypothesised that disengaged youth in the SWEL group will achieve significantly higher levels of reengagement in social, occupational and/or learning areas. It is also hypothesised that the SWEL group will achieve significantly better results on the secondary outcome variables of social and occupational functioning, social activity; perceived social self efficacy; sense of self; satisfaction with life; and relationship quality. 

The recruitment of participants will be conducted primarily through youth employment, educational and vocational training services in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Recruitment will also occur through self-referrals. SWEL and Befriending groups receive 8 weekly therapy calls lasting 20 to 50 minutes. Core components are delivered in the first 4 sessions to maximise impact early on, though participants are encouraged to complete all 8 sessions. Follow-up assessments occur 2, 8 and 14 months post-Baseline.</summary>
