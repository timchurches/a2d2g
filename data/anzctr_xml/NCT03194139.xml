  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be a double-blind, randomized, crossover, single-dose assessment of
      IV-administered GC4711 compared to GC4419 in healthy volunteers.

      Consenting subjects will undergo screening procedures within 28 days of the start of dosing.
      Pharmacokinetics (parent drug and major metabolites) will be assessed in plasma and urine
      from all subjects.

      Initially, a sentinel cohort of 4 subjects, will be enrolled; each eligible subject will
      receive single dose of GC4711 IV at dose of 30 mg over one hour. Following a clinical safety
      review by the Galera study team , if no safety concerns are identified after the last subject
      completes study participation, enrollment will continue in 2 stages to a crossover study
      design. In stage 1, 12 subjects will be enrolled and in stage 2, if no safety concerns are
      identified in stage 1 following a clinical safety review by the Galera study team, 20
      subjects will be enrolled. In both enrollment stages, eligible subjects in the crossover
      design will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment sequences: Test (GC4711) -&gt;
      Ref (GC4419) or Ref (GC4419) -&gt; Test (GC4711). On Day 1, subjects will receive the first
      treatment they were randomized to, and on Day 4 (following a washout), they will receive the
      second treatment. Subjects will be followed up for 2 days after the second treatment.</summary>
