  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Influenza (flu) viruses change continuously, therefore also the parts of viruses used in
      influenza vaccines can vary from year to year. The current study is a phase III A clinical
      trial with a commercially available vaccine (Influvac®) supplied in pre filled syringes. The
      objective of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety and tolerability of
      the changed influenza vaccine virus composition in two groups of subjects in good health:
      subjects aged &gt;= 18 and &lt;= 60 years and subjects &gt;= 61 years of age (elderly).</summary>
