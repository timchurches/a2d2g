  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bay of Plenty DHB is one of five District Health Boards currently trialling the use of a new assessment tool, the Minimum Data Set-Home Care (MDS-HC). The MDS-HC is used to determine the level of need and services required for older people (65+) living in the community.  In conjunction with a well-executed care plan, the use of the MDS-HC is expected to improve the quality of care that DHBs can provide.  DHBs across the country need information on the best way to implement the tool and this study is the first step towards providing the information and evidence for national implementation, should it prove to be beneficial in the medium to long-term. 320 older people who are referred for assessment through Support Net will be recruited to take part, half will receive standard NASC assessment whereas the other half will receive the MDS-HC assessment. Interviews with the older people will occur at baseline before the assessment and at one, four months and twelve month follow-up.  Comparisons will include functional and social measures, cost of services as well as the differences in care plans and services recommended between the two assessment systems.</summary>
