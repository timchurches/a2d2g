    <scientifictitle>For subjects with and without sciatica with active trigger points (TrPs) within the gluteus minimus muscle as compared to non-TrPs participants, does Thermovision Technique of Dry Needling (TTDN) support the clinical criteria set by Travel and Simons and, thus, objectively confirm trigger points presence?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty TrPs-positive sciatica subjects (group A ) and twenty TrPs-negative (group B) and twenty healthy volunteers as a control (group C) will be recruited to the study. Each of the sciatica participants will draw his/her pain on a diagram and will define the pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS). The healthy volunteers will skip that part. All subjects will receive TTDN two consecutively days: on the first day  one session and on the second day  two sessions with one hour break. TTDN consist of: Infrared thermovision camera (IRT) side-to-side comparison of the lower limbs, dry needling (DN) session (2x5 minutes with the break on around 30s) and post-dry needling observation at rest (six consecutive minutes; without break after DN) under IRT control. The participants will be asked to report the area of referred pain (thigh, calf, foot) during the DN session. The participants and IRT camera operator will not be aware of the trigger point confirmation. During IRT session, a dry needling specialist will not be aware of the IRT camera results.
Diagnostic criteria of active TrPs for sciatica subjects: active TrPs will be confirmed if referred pain typical of the gluteus minimus muscle (anterior/posterior fibers) will be evoked digitally and by needle from tender points within that muscle and the patients will recognize that referred pain as their daily complaint. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator: the control group will be non-TrPs healthy volunteers. They will receive TTDN in the most tender point, which will not fulfil the criteria for TrPs confirmation and will be needle silent.</comparator>

      <outcome>Vasomotor response to TTDN (group A, B and C)

The calculation of expected vasomotor response in cm2 is assumed for the size above maximum skin temperature -vasodilatation and under minimum skin temperature -vasoconstriction (Thermography Studio 2007 Professional) . The size of each vasomotor response will be recalculated from cm2 to the percentage value.

    <concealment>Forty sciatica subjects (n=20 TrPs-positive and n=20 TrPs-negative) will be recruited to the study from Poznan GP doctors and the University Pain Clinic. Twenty healthy volunteers will be recruited by press announcement.
Sciatica subjects will be re-diagnosed by a neurologist towards radicular origin of sciatica on the basis of bedside examination, extensive neurological screening examination accompanied by a positive straight leg test, and magnetic resonance imaging results. Then, re-examination towards TrPs presence within the gluteus minimus muscle will be performed. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>According to William Cochrans assumption for x2 test, to conduct the test the quantity of n=5 is required. It is assumed that in the examined group three subgroups will be analyzed, namely group I: TrPs-positive sciatica, group II: TrPs-negative sciatica, group III: healthy volunteers. As a result, the information about the minimal size of the sample will be obtained (3 features* 2 gender categories* 2 types of vasomotor responses* the quantity of n=5 per subgroup; n=60). 
For the strong evidence of data presented, the significance level will be set based on exact tests, not on the default asymptotic method. Exact two-way Mann-Whitney U tests will be performed in order to ensure that data are representative of the whole population of possible data values. Tests will be applied to compare the differences for maximum, minimum and average skin temperatures and the percentage size of expected autonomic phenomena for the state after dry needling and, secondly, for the post-observation state. Pearson correlation with a two-tailed significance test will be applied to define the dependency of the autonomic phenomenon occurrence. All comparisons will be completed, with trigger points co-existence being the differentiating criterion. 
Secondly, the data from three TTDN sessions will be analyzed towards sensitivity and specificity of the obtained results (skin temperature changes and percentage size of vasomotor responses).
Values, figures and tables in the text will be expressed as + standard error of the mean (SEs). Significance level will be set at p

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The presence of the vasomotor reactions in the area where trigger point refer pain was presented. The new method for objective TrPs confirmation called TTDN was patented and awarded on the International Exhibition of Creativity and Innovation (among other awards). The method allows to record skin temperature changes and the size of the iso-area with vasomotor changes. 
The aim of this study is to validate TTDN
