    <interventions>The enhanced non-pharmacological intervention group (ENPT) experience a 60 minute educational session on management of dyspnoea run by a registered nurse.  Patients are then followed up with weekly phone calls for 3 weeks.  The instruction is supplemented with a range of resources to reinforce intervention delivery and promote self managment.</interventions>

    <concealment>Using a computer generated table of random numbers, all recruited patients will be allocated randomly within each site to one of two conditions. Research staff at the hospital site identify eligible patients through consultation with clinicians and administer baseline (T1)questionnaires.  After completion of baseline questionnaires, a central project manager randomly allocates the patient to intervention or control groups. Staff involved in baseline and follow up assessments are different to those delivering the interventions.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to test the effectivenss of a patient education program whixch includes breathing exercises and psychosocial support for helping patients with lung cancer to control their dyspnoea.  The study will test whether the intervention reduces a patient's feelings of breathlessness, improves their ability to funtion and minimises their emotional distress and in addition the study will examine the effectiveness over time.  The information gained will provide more specific guidance to practitioners for targeting intervention approaches to each individual patient's needs.</summary>
