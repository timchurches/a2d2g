  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Symptomatic Patent Foramen Ovale</healthcondition>
    <healthcondition>The Coheres FlatStent Patemnt Foramen Oveale (PFO) Closure System will be implanted when closure of a Patent Foramen Ovale is clinically indicated.  Each patient who receives an implant will be followed for six months after the the FlatStent is implanted.  Enrollment will continue for six months or until 50 patients have been enrolled.</healthcondition>

      <conditioncode1>Cardiovascular</conditioncode1>
      <conditioncode2>Other cardiovascular diseases</conditioncode2>
    </conditioncode>
  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Coherex FlatStent Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) Closure System is a implant placed percutaneously by an interventional cardioligist into a patent foramen ovale to close the congenital defect.  Patients will be observed for 6 months post intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>No Comparator.  This is a registry feasibility study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.  The safety of the Coherex FlatStent PFO Closure System as measured by adverse events reported during and up to 30 days post procedure.
2.  The efficacy of the Coherex FlatStent PFO Closure System as measured by the closure of the patent foramen ovale at 3 months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.  Adverse event at 30days.
2.  PFO closure at 90 days.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.  Adverse events at 3 and 6 months.
2.  Procedural success defind as successful deployment and release of the Coheres FlatStent into the patient's PFO.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.  Patient follow-up at 3 and 6 months for a total post-procedure observation period of 6 months.
2.  End of the procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

4.	Patients who require a trans-septal puncture to access the left atrium.
5.	Patients who had sepsis within one month prior to implantation, or any systemic infection that cannot be successfully treated prior to device placement.
6.	Patients who have demonstrated intracardiac thrombi on echocardiography.
7.	Female patients who may be pregnant.
8.	Patients with any active bacterial infection.
9.	Patients with coronary disease or other structural heart disease.
10.	Patients with known sustained arrhythmia.
