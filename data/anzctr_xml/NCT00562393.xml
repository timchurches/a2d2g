  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of obesity has reached epidemic proportions and is associated with the
      development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A unifying theme has emerged
      over the past few years suggesting that lipid oversupply to metabolic organs responsible for
      glucose regulation leads to insulin resistance. Fitting with this, we and others have shown
      that increased lipid accumulation within skeletal muscle and/or liver is associated with
      impaired glucose uptake. However, the underlying mechanisms that mediate changes in muscle
      lipid metabolism are not yet known. The overall aim of this project is to examine metabolic
      effects of experimental weight gain in lean and overweight individuals with and without a
      genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes. We hypothesise that lean subjects will increase
      fatty acid oxidation and upregulate mitochondrial oxidative capacity in muscle following
      overfeeding to protect against body weight gain and insulin resistance, but overweight
      subjects with a genetic predisposition to T2DM will have a defect in this ability.</summary>
