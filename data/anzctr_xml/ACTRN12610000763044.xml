  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will examine the effect of compression during active exercising using a facilitating apparatus, on arm lymphedema resulting from breast cancer treatment, with a difference in volume of 200 mL between arms compared with the normal arm, diagnostic criterion (clinical) for lymphedema. The compression used is made national material-polyester and cotton, low elasticity (&gt;15mmHg) involving whole member (arm and forearm). It is put on the arm immediately before starting exercise. The method for performing each step of study with compression and without compression. Will randomly enrolled in the study patients from a rehabilitation group. The apparatus that will used is denominated 'pulley system' and is a vertical iron wheel fixed to a 30 cm-high support on a metal bench placed at a distance of 10 cm from the patient's body. The patient revolves the wheel and thus elevates the shoulder and stretches the arm. The patients will submitted to two series of active exercises separate by a duration of 1 week, using this facilitating device, one session with compression and one session without compression in a random order. The total time for evaluation using compression will be one hour, divided into four intervals of 12 minutes of exercise using the device and three minutes of rest. For activity without compression is the same test time. The patient will remain seated with the spinal column properly aligned.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purposes of the current study will to evaluate the effect of compression during active exercising using a facilitating apparatus, on arm lymphedema resulting from breast cancer treatment. 30 Subjects with edema of the arm resulting in a difference in volume of more than 200 mL compared to the contralateral arm . An apparatus denominated 'pulley system' will utilized. The participants, in the seated position with the spinal column properly aligned, submitted to two series of four 12-minute sessions (separated by 3-minute intervals to rest giving a total of one hour) of active exercises using this facilitating apparatus. A compression garment, made of a cotton-polyester material, will used on the lymphedematous limb for one of the series of exercising sessions but for the other series no compression will used. Volumetry by water displacement will performed before and after each series of exercises in lymphedematous and healthy limbs. The displaced water will weighed on calibrated weighing scales. The paired t-test will employ for statistical analysis with an alpha error of 5% (p-value &lt; 0.05) being considered acceptable. The expected for clinical practice is that the association with the mechanism of restraint device facilitator for activity exercise  can decrease limb volume in lymphedema and provide a supportive element for the treatment of this disease.</summary>
