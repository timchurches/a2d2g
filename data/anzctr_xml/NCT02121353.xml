  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF582 - To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PF582, compared to that of Lucentis (registered trademark) in patients with neovascular AMD. This will be done by assessment of vital signs, physical examination, laboratory blood tests and adverse events. Possible adverse events include: eye irritation/discomfort, redness/itching eye, eye dryness, abnormal sensation in eye; lens clouding; pain/irritation at injection site; increased tear production; 'floaters'; sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, joint pain, flu, fatigue, breathlessness, dizziness, pale skin, anxiety, cough, nausea and allergic reactions. Because PF582 is very similar to Lucentis it is expected to have similar adverse effects.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate the biosimiliarity between PF582 and Lucentis based on PK - To demonstrate the biosimiliarity between PF582 and the reference compound (Lucentis) based on pharmacokinetics (PK). This will be done by collection and analysis of PK blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To demonstrate biosimilarity between PF582 and reference compound (Lucentis) - Preliminary analysis of efficacy, as evaluated by mean change in visual acuity between baseline and Day 80 assessment, and proportion of patients with a change in visual acuity of 15 letters or more</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to test if PF582 (ranibizumab) is safe and similar to Lucentis
      (ranibizumab). Participants will have a screening visit to check for eligibility. Eligible
      participants will receive either PF582 or Lucentis, by injection into one eye on study Day 1,
      28 and 56. Visits will be conducted on Day 2, 7, 14 80 and at 6 and 12 months. During the
      study participants will undergo the following procedures: height, weight and vital signs
      (blood pressure, pulse, temperature, breathing rate) measurement; medical and surgical
      history and concomitant medications; adverse event monitoring; physical examinations; eye
      tests (reading chart, measurement of retinal thickness [via pictures of the retina] and
      examination of the eye's blood vessels, via pictures taken following injection of a dye into
      the arm), blood collection and a urine pregnancy test, where applicable.</summary>
