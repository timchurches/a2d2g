  <interventions>
    <interventions>If mask ventilation is required prior to elective intubation, it will be performed using either the 35 or 42mm silicone Fisher &amp; Paykel neonatal resuscitation masks. Infants less than 26 weeks post menstrual age will be allocated the 35mm mask and infants 27-32 weeks post menstrual age will be allocated the 42mm mask. The positive pressure ventilation will be performed by a Paediatric doctor.

      <outcome>Difference in leak measured between the mask and the infants face between the control and intervention groups.

A Florian Respiratory Function monitor (Acutronic Medical Systems, Zug, Switzerland) will be used to measure inflating pressures and gas flow via a flow sensor between the mask and the Neopuff. Tidal volumes, and expiratory leak will be measured by the flow sensor. Expiratory leak will be calculated from the volume of gas that does not return back through the flow sensor on expiration, expressed as a percentage of the inspired volume.

    <statisticalmethods>A series of 20 infants were recently studied before elective intubation at the Royal Womens Hospital (unpublished data). Mean leak was found to be 43.5% (SD 30%) Assuming a leak of 50% in the control group, a sample size 128 (64 in each arm) would give a power of 80% to detect a 15% absolute difference in leak between the groups (50% versus 35%)

Data will be analysed by Stata software (Intercooled 10, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA). The data will be presented as mean (standard deviation) for normally distributed variables and median (interquartile range) when the distribution is skewed. The clinical characteristics and outcome variables will be analysed by using the Student t test for parametric and Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric comparisons of continuous variables and Chi squared for categorical variables. P values will be 2-sided and P values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preterm infants often need breathing support delivered through a mask placed on their faces (mask ventilation). Studies have shown that mask ventilation can be complicated by leak around the mask causing it to be less effective. Australian Resuscitation Council guidelines
state the appropriate size of face mask must seal around the mouth and nose but not cover the eyes or overlap the chin. A standard 50mm diameter soft round silicon mask (Laerdal 0/0) has been the mask of choice historically used at the Royal Womens Hospital. However a recent study has shown that a smaller mask may comply better with guidelines. 
The aim of this study is to compare leak using a 50mm diameter mask compared to either 35mm (infants 26 weeks or less corrected gestational age) or 42mm ( 27 weeks or greater corrected gestational age) diameter masks (Fisher &amp; Paykel neonatal resuscitation masks extra small or small).
The study is a randomised controlled trial. The population is preterm infants less than 33 weeks gestation who require intubation while inpatient in the neonatal intensive care unit. The term intubation refers to the insertion of a breathing or endotracheal tube into the infants airway, so that they can be supported by a ventilator. Before the insertion of the tube, the infant receives premedication that sedates and gives pain relief but will cause the infant to stop breathing necessitating a predictable period of mask ventilation. The intervention group will receive either the 35 or 42mm mask to deliver mask ventilation, the control group the 50mm mask. The primary outcome is the difference in leak measured between the mask and the infants face between control and intervention groups.</summary>
