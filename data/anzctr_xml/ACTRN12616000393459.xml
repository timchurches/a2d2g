  <interventions>
    <interventions>The  women participated in this study will be reported to the laboratory for one visit lasting 2-3 hours. They all will be assessed by one physiotherapist, which will perform standard ortopeadic manual tests and standard physiotherapeutic functional assessment of lumbopelvic complex. Then the quality and symmetry od motion between right and left side will be measured during gait and during functional tascs e.g ascending/descending stairs. Simultaneously with the motion analysis the muscles bioelectrical activity of lumbar, abdominal and lower limbs muscles will be assessed. After it, in supine lying position the pelvic floor muscles activity during Glazer test and deep muscles evaluation by transabdominal ultrasonography will be performed. All subjects will recieve one 20 minutes session of trunk and pelvis muscles exercise, which may stimulate the normalisation of neuromotor control during contraction of muscles in lumbopelvic complex. All exercise will be administrated by one physiotherapists during one-on-one consultation. All measurements will be performed at baseline and immediately after the exercise.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The presence of deep muscles asymmetry at rest and during movement is considered as sign of lumbopelvic region dysfunction. Very often severe asymmetry between right and left side is one of the criteria of the eligibility of the patient for surgery.  The asymmetry in muscles work, strength and length is also considered as strong risk factor of musculosceletal injury. Moreover the standard rehabilitation applicated in those patients is not always successful. The reason of this failure may be the misdiagnosis based on traditional interpretation of  pelvic floor muscles ultrasonographic evaluation, without consideration of evaluated deep muscles function, and motion in which they are active. Therefore it is important to extend the functional evaluation of deep lumbopelvic muscles by simultaneous assessment of their bioelectrical activity in specific functional tascs, their shape and symmetry at rest and during movement visible in ultrasonography and the influance of deep muscles contraction quality on motion symmetry in lumbopelvic region visible e.g. during gait. 
The aim of this study is the evaluation of the relationship between deep muscles asymmetry of lumbopelvic region and the quality of motion kinematics in pelvis, spine and lower limbs. We also would like to assess the influence of trunk and pelvis muscles exercise on the quality of movement and on muscles activity in lumbopelvic complex.
