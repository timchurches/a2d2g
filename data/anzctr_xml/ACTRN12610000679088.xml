  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve an initial appointment where the participant will be randomised to either of the treatments (10% formalin or the placebo) and screened for eligibility. The participants will then have the area of their plantar wart debrided (this is where the dead skin overlying the wart will be scraped away) the primary investigator will apply the 10% Formalin treatment solution topically over the wart using a cotton bud, which has been dipped into the solution (this will occur at monthly appointments to a maximum of six months).The participant will then be given instructions (both written and verbal) where they will sand the wart area with 120 grit sand paper and topically apply the 10% Formalin treating solution to the wart. The participant will do this every night for a month (maximum treatment period of 6 months). At any of the monthly appointments if the participant is deemed to no longer have the plantar wart i.e. it has been cured, the participant will cease to use the treatment and they will attend a final follow-up appoinment where they will be clinically examined to assess reoccurance of the plantar wart. The initial appoinment is estimated to take between 30-45 minutes. Thereafter the monthly appoinments are estimated to take between 15-30 minutes and the final follow-up appointment would take about 15 minutes.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>effectiveness- plantar warts presence or eradication measured via clinical examination this is where two independent podiatrists will examine the plantar wart and determine whether it is present or eradicated using the following criteria: present- interruption to skin lines, presence of central core with punctuate haemorrhages, on the plantar surface of the foot. Eradicated- return of skin lines and no central core with punctuate haemorrhages. Other measurment tools will be pre and post photographs of the wart, with a fixed focus camera.</outcome>
      <timepoint>this will be done at monthly appointments, with a maximum time period of 6 months. Monnthly appointments starting at enrolment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reoccurance of the plantar wart post treatment, measured via clinical examination using the following criteria: present- interruption to skin lines, presence of central core with punctuate haemorrhages, on the plantar surface of the foot. Eradicated- return of skin lines and no central core with punctuate haemorrhages and pre and post photographs of the plantar wart.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 week follow-up appointment (post treatment)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain, measured with the visual analogue scale for participants 12 years and up, and the Faces Pain scale- revised for participants between 4-11 years of age.</outcome>
      <timepoint>measured with the primary investigator at monthly appointments for a maximum of six months and every night in a diary after application of treatment at home for a maximum of six months. The monthly appoinments begin at enrolment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The time taken (measured in months) for the patients to recover from the plantar warts.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participants will be recruited via an email through University of South Australia, advertisement in The Athletes stores (City, Modbury and Elizabeth) Also an advertisement through the Messenger Press. Any participants that enquire through the Podiatry clinic via telephone will be sent an information sheet etc. They will then be randomly assigned to either of the treatment groups where they will be assessed, via 2 independent clinicians and a podiatry student, who are unaware to which treatment group the participant has been assigned to. The clinicians and the podiatry student and participants will be blinded to which treatment group contains the particular treatment. Allocation will happen as follows: the randomisation list will be generated by an independent person where the participant will receive a numbered container that could have either the 10% formalin in or the placebo. The containers will all be in same sized, brown bottles with just numbered labels.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation will be done via random number generation through microsoft excel by an independent person. This will be done before the participants to ensure that they are randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. The two treatment groups will be allocated and assigned either treatment A or B and will remain coded until the discussion and conclusion are required to be written.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate how effective 10% Formalin is as a topical treatment for eradicating plantar warts. Our hypothesis is that 10% formalin will be more effective in curing plantar warts then the control over a maximum of 6 months.</summary>
