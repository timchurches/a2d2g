  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot, phase II trial studies the side effects of giving bortezomib together with
      combination chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating young patients with
      relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bortezomib may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with combination
      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
