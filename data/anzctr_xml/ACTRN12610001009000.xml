  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers diagnosed with sub-acute or chronic stroke and having upper limb hemiparesis will train using a novel non-robotic and bilateral upper limb training device (BUiLT) coupled with computer games that provide therapeutic exercise. Each participant will train for 6 weeks and undergo 4x45 min sessions per week and the BUiLT training will be in addition to standard therapy. Training will be administered/supervised by specifically trained BUiLT operators and/or physiotherapists.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard therapy: As directed by hospital or community-based physiotherapists and occupational therapists. Total time spent in therapy and upper limb specific therapy time will be recorded for 6 weeks. Specific techniques will not be recorded.
After the 6 month assessment the original control group will be offered BUiLT + VR therapy using the same regime in order to ascertain the effects of the therapy in this (now chronic) group. They will be assessed at the completion of that therapy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research study will trial the Bilateral Upper Limb Trainer incorporating virtual reality (BUiLT + VR) system to establish its effectiveness as therapeutic table-top rehabilitation for the weakened upper limb of subjects who have suffered a stroke. VR is where a computer displays task-based games that direct and prompt the user to exercise whilst providing feedback on performance. This will be done by comparing the outcomes of 6 weeks of 4 sessions per week BUiLT + VR therapy in a randomly selected group of sub acute and chronic stroke participants against a matched group of participants who will receive only their usual conventional therapy regime over that time. Assessment using established physical outcome measures and a questionnaire will occur before and after the 6 weeks of therapy and then again 6 months later. After the 6 month assessment the original control group will be offered BUiLT + VR therapy using the same regime in order to ascertain the effects of the therapy in this (now chronic) group. They will be assessed at the completion of that therapy.</summary>
