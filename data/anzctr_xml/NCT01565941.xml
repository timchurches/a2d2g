  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ICU-Free Days - 28-day hospital mortality-adjusted ICU length of stay</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study day 28</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>90-day Hospital Mortality - In order to enable direct comparisons between data gathered in HALF-PINT and the prior adult NICE-SUGAR trial, we will collect data on 90-day hospital mortality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>90 days after randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accumulation of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) - Accumulation of MODS during the 28 days following randomization will be measured. MODS is defined as the concurrent dysfunction of two or more organ systems (e.g., acute lung injury and renal failure). The clinical relevance of MODS as a surrogate outcome measure is well recognized in the intensive care community, and there is a clear relationship between the number of dysfunctional organ systems and the risk of death in critically ill children.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days after randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ventilator-Free Days - Ventilator-free days during the 28 days following randomization encompasses both reduction in the duration of ventilation and improvement in mortality. The end of the subject's duration of ventilation is defined as the date/time of extubation for subjects who are intubated, or the date/time of the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation for subjects with tracheostomy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>28 days following randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Nosocomial Infections - We will use Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) most recently published definitions for the following nosocomial infections attributable to the ICU stay: total bloodstream infections including Central Venous Line (CVL)-associated bloodstream infections (BSI), respiratory tract infections including ventilator-associated pneumonias, urinary tract infections, and wound infections that occur in the ICU or within 48 hours of discharge to the non-ICU inpatient unit. Device-related infections will be counted per 1,000 device days, and non-device-related infections will be counted per 1,000 ICU days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 48 hours after ICU discharge</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin Algorithm Safety - Hypoglycemia will be tracked and reported according to three ranges: severe (SH; &lt;40 mg/dL), moderate (40-49 mg/dL), and mild (50-59 mg/dL) per subject and per subject per insulin day. Lipid activation and metabolic stress during SH will be measured by urgently drawing and sending blood to the local central laboratory for determination of serum glucose, serum triglycerides, free fatty acids, lipoprotein profile, and lactate. As insulin infusion can cause slight changes to serum potassium concentration, hypokalemia &lt;2.5 mmol/L will also be tracked.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be followed for the duration of ICU stay, an expected average of 8 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Developmental Neurobehavioral Outcomes - Reliable, reproducible measures of adaptive functioning, behavior, and quality of life will be used to determine outcomes at baseline (CBCL, PedsQL) and at one year after ICU discharge (Vineland-II, CBCL, PedsQL). The goal of baseline data collection is to assess pre-ICU health and quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 1 year after ICU course</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nursing Workload - The cognitive burden placed upon bedside nurses when managing a patient on TGC will be described. Bedside nurses will be randomly selected to complete an anonymous survey describing their perceptions of workload burden associated with managing a patient on TGC. Nurses' perceptions of their capacity to complete both TGC-related and non TGC-related nursing activities over several intervals of the study period will be described via qualitative and summary statistics.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Multiple intervals during the study period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Insulin Algorithm Performance - Performance of the algorithm across diverse ages, weights, and disease processes will be critical to measure and compare to other published algorithm performance. Ideally, the algorithm will minimize time to glucose target range and maximize time spent in the glucose target range. We will track the overall glycemic profile using time-weighted glucose average because it is uniquely unaffected by the increased frequency of BG determinations that occur when glucose is abnormally low or high. Based upon insulin requirements, we will calculate insulin sensitivity index (ISI) in the first 24 hours of the protocol, as well as glucose variability index in the first 72 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Until study discharge, up to 28 days following randomization</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stress hyperglycemia, a state of abnormal metabolism with supra-normal blood glucose levels,
      is often seen in critically ill patients. Tight glycemic control (TGC) was originally shown
      to reduce morbidity and mortality in a landmark randomized clinical trial (RCT) of adult
      critically ill surgical patients but has since come under intense scrutiny due to conflicting
      results in recent adult trials. One pediatric RCT has been published to date that
      demonstrated survival benefit but was complicated by an unacceptably high rate of severe
      hypoglycemia. The Heart And Lung Failure - Pediatric INsulin Titration (HALF-PINT) trial is a
      multi-center, randomized clinical treatment trial comparing two ranges of glucose control in
      hyperglycemic critically ill children with heart and/or lung failure. Both target ranges of
      glucose control fall within the range of "usual care" for critically ill children managed in
      pediatric intensive care units.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of tight glycemic
      control to a target range of 80-110 mg/dL (TGC-1, 4.4-6.1 mmol/L) vs. a target range of
      150-180 mg/dL (TGC-2, 8.3-10.0 mmol/L) on hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU)
      length of stay (LOS) in hyperglycemic critically ill children with cardiovascular and/or
      respiratory failure. This will be accomplished using an explicit insulin titration algorithm
      and continuous glucose monitoring to safely achieve these glucose targets. Both groups will
      receive identical standardized intravenous glucose at an age-appropriate rate in order to
      provide basal calories and mitigate hypoglycemia. Insulin infusions will be titrated with an
      explicit algorithm combined with continuous glucose monitoring using a protocol that has been
      safely implemented in 490 critically ill infants and children.</summary>
