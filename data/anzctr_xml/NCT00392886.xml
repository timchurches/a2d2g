  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: drugs - methotrexate
Treatment: drugs - temozolomide
Treatment: drugs - thiotepa
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Treatment: surgery - autologous bone marrow transplantation
Treatment: surgery - autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
Treatment: surgery - peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Regimen C - Patients receive induction therapy of vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1-3, oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5, and carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive consolidation therapy of carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to -6 and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3, undergo reinfusion of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0, and receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover. Beginning within 6 weeks after transplantation, some patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity and some patients undergo radiotherapy if there is evidence of tumor remaining after completion of induction chemotherapy.

Experimental: Regimen D2 - In courses 1, 3, and 5, patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3, high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 4, vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 (in courses1 and 3), and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. In courses 2 and 4, patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5, oral etoposide once daily on days 1-10, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 11 and 12, vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 (in course 2), and G-CSF SC beginning on day 13 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients receive consolidation therapy as in regimen C in combination with etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3 and undergo autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, receive G-CSF, and undergo radiotherapy as in regimen C.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A bone marrow or
      peripheral stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to
      be given so that more tumor cells are killed.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy with or
      without etoposide followed by an autologous stem cell transplant works in treating young
      patients with previously untreated malignant brain tumors.</summary>
