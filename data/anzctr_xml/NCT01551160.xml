  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients in hospital can have unexpected clinical emergencies. When this occurs the Medical
      Emergency Team (MET) are called with the intention of resolving the problem. Previous
      investigations have found that patients who have more than one call during their admission
      have worse outcomes than patients who only have one call. But it has not been established
      why.

      The aim of this research will be to examine these repeated calls and why patients subject to
      them go on to have worse outcomes. A predictive model will be developed to identify potential
      sources of risk. One potential source is poor communication between health care providers. An
      intervention to improve communication around MET calls may provide benefit to patients and
      improve outcomes.</summary>
