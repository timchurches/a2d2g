  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Health Steps study is a trial to establish the efficacy of a pedometer-based Green Prescription (a step-based physical activity script to engage and maintain low-active older adults in regular health-related physical activity) compared with the conventional time-based Green Prescription. As well, the cost-effectiveness of the pedometer-based Green Prescription will be compared with that of the conventional Green Prescription to understand the potential cost and benefit of such an innovation.</summary>
