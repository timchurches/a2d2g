  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study addresses the issue of disability among our ageing population. Preservation of function among our older citizens, and their capacity to live independently, is of significant social, public health and economic benefit. The aims of this study are to (1) test the efficacy of Tai Chi in delaying disability among older people, prior to its onset, (2) investigate the mechanisms by which Tai Chi intervenes in the disability pathway, (3) determine the cost-benefits of Tai Chi for older people. The study will recruit 500 people over 70 years of age and randomly assign them to receive either Tai Chi, or a stretching and relaxation program, for a period of 48 weeks. The groups will then be compared to determine if there is any difference in the development of disability as well as a range of functional outcomes such as strength, balance, depression, arthritic symptoms, life satisfaction, and falls.</summary>
