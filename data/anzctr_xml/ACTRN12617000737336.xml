  <interventions>
    <interventions>At time of enrolment, all participants will have already been attending exercise groups, and will have been given an individualised home exercise programme. 
During the 20-week intervention period, participants will continue to attend the exercise groups that they were attending at time of enrolment in the study.  They will also be given the option to attend a second exercise group per week for this period.
Exercise duration is 45 minutes, at the hospital.
Groups are run by an experienced Physiotherapist, with up to 15 participants per group.
Groups are stratified to participant ability, and, to some extent, health condition.
All groups offer functional strength training, and balance training, and participants are encouraged to work at an effort of 6-8/10 for the duration of the class.
Choice of exercises is tailored to the ability and needs of the group members.
Parkinson's Disease- specific groups focus on exaggerated amplitude movements.
Attendance is recorded at each group.
Patients are also encouraged to exercise at home, at least 3 times per week in addition to the exercise group(s).</interventions>
    <comparator>Cross-over control. In  the control phase, participants are to cease group attendance for 20 weeks, but are encouraged to continue with their home exercise programme.</comparator>
