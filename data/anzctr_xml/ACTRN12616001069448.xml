  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial. Each arm of the trial will last for 4 weeks, with a 2-week washout period in between. The total trial period is 10 weeks.
- Two doses of Bovine Lactoferrin (BLf) will be tested, with and without modification
- Participants will receive modified Bovine Lactoferrin, or non-modified BLf in a capsule. These capsules will be equivalent for BLf content. Those on the higher dose will simply take more of the capsules as a dose. Participants will be asked to take their required dose of capsules after breakfast each morning.
- Intervention will be delivered by an Advanced Accredited Practising Dieititian (AdvAPD).
- All participants will have fasting blood tests taken at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks after intervention commencement.
- Participants will attend face to face appointments at the School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, University of Queensland at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after intervention commencement. This will be repeated on week 6 (after washout) and week 8 and 10. Note: week 6 pertains to baseline of the second arm; week 8 and week 10 pertains to week 2 and week 4 respectively.
- Intervention adherence will be assessed by collecting used lactoferrin supplement containers and supplement record forms from participants.</interventions>

    <concealment>Third party (A PhD scholar at the School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, The University of Queensland, who is external to this research team) will perform the randomisation of treatment allocation and coding of products. Participants will be randomised to receive a particular dose (known to the randomiser but not the principal investigator through packaging differences), then randomised to the order of product presentation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Subjects will be randomly allocated to dose using a permuted block randomisation design by an external party. Subjects will then be randomised to receive either the modified lactoferrin, or the non-modified lactoferrin for the first arm of the trial. They will then be given the other product for the crossover.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lactoferrin is a protein involved in protection against microbial infections and the prevention of systemic inflammation, and is found in milk, saliva and other secretions. 

The study is designed to measure how well the lactoferrin absorbs into the digestive system, compared to a modified lactoferrin product. We will also be looking at how well the immune system is functioning before and after taking the lactoferrin/modified lactoferrin product.

The purpose of the study is to improve understanding of the absorption and efficacy of bovine lactoferrin with a view to the creation of new functional food products in the future.
