  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is composed of sleeping apnea and hypopnea. It also accompanied with fatigue, daytime sleepiness and poor concentration and memory in such patients. The standard treatment for it is usage of continuous positive airway pressure during sleeping. In this study, we want to know condition of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution in patients with OSAS, and to see if treatment of CPAP improves patients' TCM constitution.</summary>
