  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive tailored technology use in addition to usual care.  The research physiotherapist will determine the most appropriate intervention based on discussion with the clinical physiotherapist, baseline assessment, participant goals, and the technology suitable in accordance with the intervention protocol.   In addition to usual therapy each participant will be asked to use the intervention technologies between 30 and 60 minutes daily for five or more days per week. The total duration of the intervention will be six months after randomisation and will incorporate both inpatient rehabilitation and post-discharge settings. 

The prescription of technology to target mobility and physical activity problems will include, but will not be limited to, the use of video, computer and tablet programs and applications to encourage structured exercise and other forms of physical activity as well as pedometers to monitor activity levels. The chosen technologies are all relatively low cost and will provide feedback on mobility task or physical activity performance or dose. Some of the technologies involve games. The research physiotherapist will choose the most appropriate technology/ies for an individual patient by following a protocol refined through pilot testing. The exercise protocol guide will be reviewed quarterly and any new technologies will be added throughout the trial.

Each technology used 1) provides feedback about task performance; 2) facilitates individualised tailoring and progression of exercise or physical activity; 3) enables progress towards a functionally relevant goal(s) to be recorded and graphed; and 4) is relatively inexpensive. 

The research physiotherapist will teach participants to use the technology and will develop individualised exercise procedures to enable participants to use the technology safely outside of therapy times. If judged by staff to be safe to do so, participants will exercise unsupervised or with the supervision of family members/friends, nursing staff and hospital volunteers. 

After discharge from the inpatient stay, participants will be encouraged to continue using the technologies at home. Participants will be loaned necessary equipment (stand-alone devices or games consoles, installed by study staff) and trained in the safe use and progression of the games/exercises during a home visit by the research physiotherapist. Weekly support via telephone, email or videoconference will be provided during this phase of the study. This support will aim to assist study participants to maintain motivation and will identify and address any barriers to technology use at home. Up to five home visits will be provided to manage technology issues and/or progression.

Goals will be set collaboratively with each participant and recorded and reviewed throughout the intervention phase. Practice sheets and information from some of the devices (e.g. game play time, number of steps walked) will be used to monitor the dose of the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual rehabilitation care as prescribed during admission to hospital and post discharge from hospital according to current practice.

Participants in both groups will receive usual rehabilitation care (inpatient and outpatient). All participants will be assessed by a physiotherapist who will prescribe a series of repetitive exercises (e.g. practise of standing up or stepping). The conduct of these exercises will be supervised by the physiotherapist, a physiotherapy assistant or family member. Participants will also receive assessment and management by medical specialists, nurses, occupational therapists and speech pathologists, social workers, nutritionists, orthoptists or other health professionals as required. At the time of discharge, participants will be referred to follow-up outpatient therapy and/or prescribed a home exercise program in accordance with usual practice at the study sites.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
A total of 300 participants (150 per group) will provide 90% power to detect as significant, at the 5% level, a 15% between-group difference in both the primary outcome measures. The sample size calculation was undertaken using the sampsi command in Stata 13 and data from our pilot studies (manuscripts under preparation). The calculation assumed one pre-randomisation measure, one follow-up measure and analysis using linear models with baseline scores entered as covariates and a correlation between pre- and post measures of 0.65. For the continuously scored Short Physical Performance Battery score the intervention group mean was assumed to 1.89, the control group mean 1.64 and the standard deviation 0.75. For the activPAL the intervention group upright minutes per day was assumed to 223, the control group mean 194 and the standard deviation 90. We have allowed for a 20% dropout rate. This sample size will be sufficient to detect between-group differences of 10-15% in most of the secondary outcomes.

Statistical Analysis Plan:
Between-group comparisons for each of the continuously-scored outcome measures will be made using linear models with baseline scores entered as a covariate. The dichotomous outcomes will be compared between groups using log binomial regression. Fall rates between groups will be compared using negative binomial regression. Interaction terms will be used in the models to assess whether effects of the intervention differ according to age or a neurological versus non-neurological cause of the mobility impairment. Primary analyses will use an intention-to-treat approach. All analyses will be overseen by the study statistician.

Health and community service usage data collected from participant-completed calendars, hospital databases and medical records (length of stay, procedures, reasons for re-admission or emergency department visit) will be used to calculate health service utilisation and costs to inform the conduct of an economic evaluation. The cost of the intervention (staff and equipment) will also be calculated from trial records and used in the cost-effectiveness analysis. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio will be calculated to assess the relative costs and benefits in terms of gain in mobility (SPPB score change) and quality of life (using the SF-6D and the EQ5D-5L). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mobility limitation is common in rehabilitation patients and can be improved by well-designed exercise programs. Exercise in people with mobility limitation is associated with better functional outcomes if the exercises relate closely to functional movements required for daily task independence.

The broad aim of this project is to enhance mobility outcomes for people undergoing aged care and neurological rehabilitation. The specific hypothesis of this trial is that the addition of technology-based interactive exercises involving feedback to usual care will lead to better mobility outcomes than usual care alone for people admitted to aged care and neurological rehabilitation wards with mobility limitations.

This study also aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with usual care, establish predictors of greater use of the technologies and enhance understanding of participant experiences of technology use with qualitative methods.

Participants will be randomised into a control and intervention group (n=300). Both groups will include hospital patients undertaking a usual rehabilitation program and the intervention group will receive one extra 30 to 60-minute session per day of video and computer or tablet-based interactive exercises. 

After discharge from the inpatient stay, participants in the intervention group will be encouraged to continue using the technologies at home. The total duration of the intervention will be six months after randomisation.  Participants will be loaned necessary technology and trained in the safe use and progression of the games/exercises during a home visit by therapy staff. Weekly support via telephone, email of videoconference will also be provided during this phase of the study. This support will aim to assist study participants to maintain motivation and will identify and address any barriers to technology use at home.
A baseline assessment will be conducted and follow-up assessments will occur at 3 and 12 weeks and 6 months after randomisation.</summary>
