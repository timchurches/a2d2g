    <interventions>A First-in-Human, Randomised, Double-Blind, Controlled, Dose-Ranging, Phase 1 Study in Healthy Volunteers aged 18 to 39 years.
A total of 20 healthy male and female participants will receive two intramuscular doses of STX-100/Alhydrogel  vaccine (dose level 4.6 mcg, and 18.4 mcg) or control (Placebo EV71VLP/Alhydrogel which is Bis-Tris sterile buffer solution, 150 mM NaCl, at pH 6.5 mixed with aluminium hydroxide) at Day 1 and Day 28.
Participants will be recruited in two sequential dosing groups:
Cohort 1: 8 participants will receive 4.6mcg STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine and 2 participants will receive placebo
Cohort 2: 8 participants will receive 18.4mcg STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine and 2 participants will receive placebo

The investigational study vaccine, the STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine will consist of two fractions: one, the liquid fraction containing the recombinant EV-A71 VLP (labeled EV71 VLP DP), and two, the adjuvant, aluminium hydroxide, Al(OH)3 (diluted Alhydrogel). The recombinant EV-A71 VLP will be absorbed to the adjuvant to prepare the finished product for injection. 
The study control will be a Placebo, comprising of the Placebo product mixed with the adjuvant Aluminium Hydroxide (Placebo EV71 VLP/Alhydrogel). 

As this is a first-in-human study, 2 sentinel participants (1 placebo and 1 STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine) in each cohort, will receive the first dose and be monitored for 24hrs. If dosing of the sentinels proceeds with no clinically significant adverse events, the remaining participants will be dosed.

Following the first vaccination, all participants will be monitored at the clinic for at least 60-90 minutes, after which they will return to the clinic on day 7 and day 28 to be monitored. At day 28, the 2nd vaccination will be given and participants will be monitored at the clinic for 60-90 minutes. Participants will return to the clinic at day 7 and 28 after the 2nd vaccination (study day 35 and 56) for monitoring.

A soft-lock will be placed on the database after the Day 56 visit at which point the data will be unblinded and an interim preliminary report will be written.

All participants will attend the clinic at 3 months and 6 months post-vaccination for follow-up visits (open-label).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study is the assessment of the safety and tolerability of the STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine, administered at 2 dose levels in healthy adults, compared to the placebo. This will be tested by clinical laboratory testing, physical examination, vital signs assessments, noting the frequency and types of AE and the use of concomitant medication</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Secondary outcome of this study is the assessment of the immunogenicity of STX-100/Alhydrogel vaccine administered at 2 dose levels in healthy adults, compared to placebo. Immunogenicity will be assessed by analysis of serum samples collected at visit 1, 4,7,8 and 9; testing for the presence of EV-A71 antibodies.</outcome>

4.	WOCBP must use highly effective, double barrier contraception for at least one month prior to Visit 1 (first vaccination) and up to Visit 7 (28 days after second vaccination; i.e. during Part A).  Double barrier contraception is defined as a condom AND one other form of the following:
a)	Established hormonal contraception (with approved oral, injected or depot regimen) for at least 2 months prior to Screening.
b)	Depot or injectable birth control. 
c)	Intrauterine device or intrauterine system in place for at least 2 months prior to Screening. 
Documented evidence of surgical sterilisation at least 6 months prior to Screening visit. i.e., tubal ligation or hysterectomy for women or vasectomy for men (with appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in semen) provided the male partner is a sole partner.
5.	Males must not donate sperm for at least 1-month post-dose of the last study treatment. Male partners of female participants and female partners of male participants must also use contraception, if they are of childbearing potential. WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Screening and a negative urine pregnancy test on Day 1, Day 28. Women not of childbearing potential must be post-menopausal (defined as cessation of regular menstrual periods for at least 12 months), confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level more than 40 mIU/mL if in doubt.
6.	Rhythm methods will not be considered as highly effective methods of birth control. Participant abstinence for the duration of the study and 1 month after the last study treatment is acceptable.
7.	Adequate venous access in their left or right arms to allow collection of a number of blood samples.
8.	No birthmarks, tattoos, wounds or other skin conditions on both forearms which could reasonably obscure injection site reactions.
9.	Able to communicate effectively with study personnel and is considered reliable, willing and cooperative in terms of compliance with the protocol requirements.
