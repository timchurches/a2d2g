  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are reasons to believe that medical grade-honey applied directly to skin may be an effective treatment for rosacea. In this study 10 adults with rosacea will apply honey to their face for 30-60 minutes twice daily for 2 weeks.

After two weeks the rosacea will be assessed to look at changes in severity. Participants will also be asked about their experience of using honey.

This trial will provide useful information on the practicalities of topical honey as a treatment for rosacea. It will also give an initial signal as to whether honey may be effective.</summary>
