  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will employ a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, four way cross-over design.

Participants will be required to attend one practice session followed by four testing sessions. 
During the practice session particpants will sign the consent form and practice the multi-tasking assessment and be familiarised with the mood scales and other procedures. 

The testing sessions will see participants taking one of four interventions:

(1) Caffeine drink (40mg caffeine)
(2) Caffeine and Glucose Drink (25mg Glucose, 40mg caffeine)
(3) Caffeine and Glucose Drink (60mg Glucose, 40mg caffeine)
(4) Placebo

All four treatments will be administered as carbonated drinks and will be matched for colour, smell and taste.

On the testing days participants will complete baseline testing (consisting of the multitasking framework, mood) after which they will be administered their randomly assigned treatment. 30 minutes post dose participant will complete the testing again (multitasking framework, mood). 

20 participants will additionally complete the fMRI component which will take an additional hour and a half at the end of each treatment arm (60 minutes post dose). Once in the scanner participants will have a structural scan followed by the functional scans in which they will complete two cognitive tasks.

There will be a seven day washout period between each testing session.

Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either treatment (1) or (2) or (3) or (4) on their first testing day. This will be done by a randomised computer number sequence generator. Over the course of the investigation, they will complete all four treatments with treatment order counterbalanced across participants. A disinterested third party will be responsible for the blinding procedure.</interventions>

The computerized MTF comprises four cognitive and psychomotor tasks that are undertaken simultaneously using a 4-way split screen. Responses to all of the tasks are made using the mouse and cursor.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>People who meet the following inclusion criteria will be included in the trial:
1. Male or female.
2. Aged 18-55 years.
3. Willing and able to provide written informed consent.
4. Understands and is willing and able to comply with all study procedures.
5. Are in good general health with no history of psychiatric disease.
6. Regular caffeine consumers (between 1-4 cups of coffee per day or equivalent i.e. soft drinks, energy drinks)
7. Must have corrected to normal vision
8. Participants who take part in the fMRI subcomponent must be right handed. This is for ease of analysis of the neuroimaging data. There are hemispheric differences in terms of structure between right and left handed individuals that prove to be problematic when analysing the output. Given that this investigation will employ a method where participants need to press buttons as a response (in turn involving the motor cortex), it is wise to use an all right handed population.</inclusivecriteria>

3.	Any significant concurrent illness including any bleeding disorders, heart conditions, diabetes, glaucoma, high blood pressure or osteoporosis.
4.	Individuals who suffer from Diabetes Mellitus.
5.	Any known or suspected food allergies (this would cover all ingredients in the investigational product).

9.	Have undergone an MRI scan within the previous 7 days.
10.	Those diagnosed with Phenyketonuria (PKU).</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>A unique screening number will identify all subjects screened for study participation.  Screening numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order as each subject signs their consent form.  Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised according to the randomisation schedule.  Randomisation numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site on the day subjects are randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation schedule will be generated using computer software and will also be stratified for subjects performing the fMRI:-  The two strata will be :-
i)	Subjects undergoing fMRI
ii)	Subjects NOT undergoing fMRI
A randomisation schedule will be prepared for each strata and will be provided by the Biostatistics Department, GSKCH.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aiming to determine the effects of glucose and caffeine on cognitive function, stress and mood. Both caffeine and glucose are said to play a role in improving attentional resources with attending to activities with a high cognitive demand.

This project will assess the effectiveness of various levels of caffeine and glucose combination drinks on performance of a multitasking battery and mood measures. Further measures for a subset of participant will include an MRI scan where performance on attentional tasks will be evaluated.

Participants will be required to attend four testing sessions (and one practice session). Each session will see participants taking one of four drink interventions;
(1) Caffeine drink (40mg caffeine)
(2) Caffeine and Glucose Drink (25mg Glucose, 40mg caffeine)
(3) Caffeine and Glucose Drink (60mg Glucose, 40mg caffeine)
(4) Placebo</summary>
