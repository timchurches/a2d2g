  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients with recurrent or metastatic gynaecological cancers. The specific subgroups are outlined below. All patients will have central review and analyses of ER/PR at a later date to confirm receptor status, but entry to the study will be based on hormone receptor positivity according to local hormone receptor analyses.
A. Epithelial Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Cancers and Cancers of the Fallopian Tube
(i) Asymptomatic patients with a rising CA125 after first line chemotherapy and GCIG defined CA125 progression (these patients should either have no measureable disease or small volume recurrence and the expectation they would not require chemotherapy within the next 12 weeks)
(ii) Borderline ovarian tumours, micro-invasive ovarian tumours and well differentiated low grade ovarian cancers. Apart from surgery, treatment options are very limited for these patients as these tumours are usually chemotherapy resistant but are also relatively indolent
(iii) Platinum resistant or refractory ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer in patients in whom further chemotherapy is not indicated
B. Endometrial Cancer  patients that have measurable disease
C. Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas: patients that have measurable disease
D. Miscellaneous Sarcomas: Includes leiomyosarcomas, adenosarcomas, carcinosarcomas and undifferentiated uterine sarcomas with measurable disease and relapse following standard treatment such as chemotherapy or patients in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated.
E. Granulosa Cell Tumours and other Sex Cord Stromal Tumours: patients that have measurable disease and/or an elevated inhibin (total inhibin and/or inhibin B) level and in whom chemotherapy is not clinically indicated

All patients must have ER and/or PR positive tumours by immunohistochemical evaluation based on the assessment at individual sites. Hormone receptor staining should be carried out on the original tumour. If not available, but the recurrent tumour is hormone receptor positive, then these patients will also be eligible

Post-menopausal as defined by: (i) age 60 or more, or (ii) age 4559 and satisfying the following criteria: Amenorrhoea for at least 12 months and FSH in postmenopausal range with an intact uterus, or (iii) age equal to 18  or more and having had a bilateral oophorectomy

Evaluable disease defined as; (i) measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1, OR (ii) CA125 as per GCIG criteria (for ovarian cancer subgroup) OR (iii) elevated total inhibin and/or inhibin B (for granulosa cell sub-group)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is compelling evidence to support a study of aromatase inhibitors in selected patients with potentially hormone sensitive recurrent or metastatic gynecological cancers. Hormonal therapy is an attractive option in patients with recurrent gynecological cancers where the objective of treatment is palliation and prolongation of survival rather than cure.  Aromatase inhibitors are generally well tolerated and in contrast to chemotherapy can be administered for prolonged periods with relatively little cumulative toxicity. The degree of activity and response rates reported in previous studies has varied considerably. This variability almost certainly reflects the heterogeneous populations treated, which have included women with advanced chemotherapy and hormone resistant tumours and those with a poor performance status where response rates are generally low. There is a clear need to investigate the role of hormonal therapies, particularly AIs, in women with potentially hormone responsive recurrent gynaecological cancers. Studies are required to establish the response rates, clinical benefit and quality of life as well as to identify predictors of response.</summary>
