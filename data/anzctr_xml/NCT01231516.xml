  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 Copies/Milliliter (c/mL) at Week 48 - The percentage of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 c/mL at Week 48 was assessed using the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "snapshot" algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA at Week 48 as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant ART prior to Week 48 as follows: background ART substitutions non-permitted per protocol (one background ART substitution was permitted for safety or tolerability); background ART substitutions permitted per protocol unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA assessment while the participant was on-treatment in the randomized phase of the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants (Par.) With Detectable Virus That Has Genotypic or Phenotypic Evidence of Treatment-emergent INI Resistance at Time of Protocol Defined Virology Failure (PDVF) - For par. meeting one of the criteria for PDVF, plasma samples collected at the time point of virologic failure and Baseline were tested to evaluate any potential genotypic and/or phenotypic evolution of resistance. PDVF was defined as (A) virologic non-response: a decrease in plasma HIV-1 RNA of &lt;1 log10 copies/mL by Week 16, with subsequent confirmation, unless plasma HIV-1 RNA is &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;=400 copies/mL on or after Week 24 or (B) virologic rebound: confirmed rebound in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels to &gt;=400 copies/mL after prior confirmed suppression to &lt;400 copies/mL; confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA levels &gt;1 log10 copies/mL above the nadir value, where nadir is &gt;=400 copies/mL.Treatment-emergent IN mutations are those detected at the time of PDVF but not at Baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until PDVF up to Week 48</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 c/mL at Week 24 - The number of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;50 c/mL at Week 24 was assessed using the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "snapshot" algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA at Week 24 as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant ART prior to Week 24 as follows: background ART substitutions non-permitted per protocol (one background ART substitution was permitted for safety or tolerability); background ART substitutions permitted per protocol unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurement through Week 24 (within window) while the participant was on-treatment. The result below corresponds to the Week 24 interim analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;400 c/mL at Week 24 and Week 48 - The number of participants with Plasma Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) &lt;400 c/mL at the visit of interest was assessed using the Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure (MSDF), as codified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "snapshot" algorithm. This algorithm treated all participants without HIV-1 RNA at the visit of interest as nonresponders, as well as participants who switched their concomitant ART prior to the visit of interest as follows: background ART substitutions non-permitted per protocol (one background ART substitution was permitted for safety or tolerability); background ART substitutions permitted per protocol unless the decision to switch was documented as being before or at the first on-treatment visit where HIV-1 RNA was assessed. Otherwise, virologic success or failure was determined by the last available HIV-1 RNA measurment (within window) for the timepoint of interest while the participant was on-treatment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Absolute Values and Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation 4+ (CD4+) Cell Counts at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 - The absolute value for CD4+ cell count (cells per millimeters cubed [mm^3]) was assessed at Baseline (BL), Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 24, Week 32, Week 40 and Week 48. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Indicated Post-Baseline HIV-associated Conditions, Excluding Recurrences, and Disease Progressions - Clinical disease progression (CDP) was assessed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) HIV-1 classification system.

CAT C: the clinical CON listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition. Indicators of CDP were defined as: CDC CAT A at Baseline (BS) to a CDC CAT C event (EV); CDC CAT B at BS to a CDC CAT C EV; CDC CAT C at BS to a new CDC CAT C EV; or CDC CAT A, B, or C at BS to death.</outcome>

DTG predose concentration (C0) at Week 4, Week 24, and Week 48 as well as the average C0 (C0_avg) , Cmax and Cmin were estimated and reported here.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ING111762 is a 48 week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel
      group, non-inferiority study. The study will be conducted in at least 688 HIV-1 infected
      antiretroviral experienced, integrase-na√Øve subjects. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive GSK1349572 50 mg once daily or raltegravir (RAL) 400 mg twice daily, each added to an
      investigator selected background regimen consisting of at least one fully active agent plus
      no more than one second single agent which may or may not be active. Antiviral activity,
      safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and development of viral resistance will be evaluated.</summary>
