  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects with early diabetic nepropathy who are overweight and randomized to receive a high protein weight loss diet. The protein content will be 30-35% of total energy. Diet will last for 12 months. Protein will be mainly by red meat consumed four times a week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Overweight diabetic nephropathy subjects who will receive a low glycaemic index diet. This will involve high fibre carbohydrate sources such as high fibre cereal, vegetables and fruit. The diet will last for 12 months.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Type 2 diabetics with microalbuminuria (30600 mg/24 h  or an albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 3.030 mg/mmol) with or without mildly impaired renal function (estimated GFR 40-75 ml/min/1.73m2, as calculated  from serum creatinine).

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects responding to advertisements will be screened for suitability and then divided into two matched groups according to age, sex, and weight by a participant not involved medically with the trial. One group will be assigned the low glycaemic index diet and the other the high protein weight loss diet at this point. Allocation concealment  has been followed in that the person responsible for the allocation schedule will be a trial manager who does not decide who is eligible for the trial and has no input into medical or dietetic decision making in the trial.</concealment>
