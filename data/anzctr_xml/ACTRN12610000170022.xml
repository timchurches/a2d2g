  <interventions>
    <interventions>NV-NG is an online intervention which consists of two parallel programs - one for the adolescent and one for their parent. Both programs consist of a set of fully self-directed modules (sessions), six sessions for parents and five sessions for adolescents, to be completed online over a period of six weeks. Each session takes approximately 30-45 minutes to complete. The adolescent program uses a cognitive behavioural approach to encourage adolescents to develop strategies to manage the challenges of normal adolescent development, their disease demands, and the interface between the two. Sessions focus on increasing knowledge about the interface between adolescent development and diabetes; understanding and developing strategies to increase psychological wellbeing; building and maintaining relationships with friends and family; problem solving and managing conflict; health promoting behaviours and body image. The parenting program is designed to support parents to optimise the resilience and wellbeing of their adolescent children by strengthening family relationships. Key components of the program include: 1) increasing parents knowledge of diabetes and its associated effects on mental health, behaviour, body image, and transition to adult care; 2) parenting strategies, focusing on autonomy granting and limit setting, development of responsibility and monitoring, connecting, communication, problem solving and managing parent-adolescent conflict, and 3) parent support associated with self-care, grief/loss, responsibility for, and care, of other family members. The intervention is delivered wholly online in a self-directed format, therefore the same content is available to all participants, however the degree to which participants access all the content within program sessions varies. Dosage is estimated based on the percentage of available content that each participant accessed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary adolescent outcome: Improved adolescent wellbeing (as indicated by lower depression and anxiety and improved parent reportof chid wellbeing) compared to the wait/control group. These constructs will be measured through questionnaires, including the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale Short Form(RCMAS), and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Furthermore, parents' perceptions of their childs wellbeing will also be measured by the Child Health Questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The time points for data collection for both the the intervetnion group and the wait list control group are T=0 (Baseline), T=6 weeks, and T=6 months. Of note, the wait list control group will be offered the intervention at a later date, however, their data will not be used in the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Parent Outcome: Improved parent wellbeing as measured by reduced negative affect, increased self efficacy and reduced fatigue compared to the wait/control group. Questionnaires will be used to assess these constructs. To assess parent self-efficacy,  the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale will be used, while negative affect will be assessed via the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21), and parent fatigue will be measured through the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time points for data collection for both groups are T=0 (Baseline), T=6 weeks, and T=6 months. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary adolescent outcome: Improved (lower) glycylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) measures (objective measure of diabetes control). HbA1c is assessed via a blood test that forms part of the child's routine clinic visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>HbA1c results for adolescents will be reported by their endocrinologist at T=-3months (retrospectively), T=0 (baseline); T= 3months; and T= 6 months for both the intervention and wiatlist control groups.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Adolescent outcome:  Improved diabetes relevant self care. This will be assessed via questionnaires. These willl include the Diabetes Self Care Inventory (SCI-R) and the Stanford Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time points for data collection for both groups are T=0 (Baseline), T=6 weeks, and T=6 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved parent child relationship. The parent-child relationship will be assessed through several questionnaires. From the child's perspective, this will include the Parent- Adolescent Communication Scale, the family sharing of responsibility for diabetes care, and the Diabetes Conflict Scale. 
To assess the parent's perspective, questionnaires assessing family sharing or responsibility for diabetes care and  communication, as measured by the the Parent- Adolescent Communication Scale - parent report form, will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The time points for data collection for both groups are T=0 (Baseline), T=6 weeks, and T=6 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A rolling recruitment strategy will be applied. Adolescents with Type 1 diabetes will be recruited through The Royal Childrenâ€™s Hospital Diabetes Outreach service as well as Monash Medical Centre. Adolescents will be given an Information Statement and Consent Form at their regular clinic visit and asked to return consent forms (adolescent &amp; parent) to the researchers if they wish to participate. Upon receipt of the consent forms the researcher will email them a computer login. When the families register online, the computer will automatically randomly allocate them to either the intervention or wait list control group. Thus, allocation to the different groups is concealed through the use of central randomisation by a computer. </concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation of participants to the intervention or waitlist groups will occur randomly using a computer random number generator during the registration process, which will be based on date and time of registration.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Evidence suggests that young people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) are vulnerable to a range of mental health difficulties, including depression and anxiety. Furthermore this vulnerability can be heightened when these young people are isolated from support services, such as is the case for those living in rural areas or experiencing social isolation. The study aims to assist adolescents with T1D and their parents to manage the psychosocial impact of their condition, improve their mental and physical health outcomes, and reduce their risk taking behaviour. The study has two phases. Phase 1 is an interview study of parents (n=10) of adolescents with T1D who are prepared to discuss their experiences of parenting a child with diabetes in relation to their preferences and needs for treatment and internet based interventions. Findings from the parent interviews and an earlier needs analysis study of rural adolescents with T1D and their parents, conducted by the researchers, will be used to revise and supplement the prototype NV-NG adolescent intervention with a parenting intervention. The parent component will be based on an existing parenting program and associated web-resources and will result in an integrated adolescent and parenting program, which will be evaluated in Phase 2 (the Evaluation Phase). The evaluation phase will comprise a randomised control trial (with a wait group control) to evaluate the effectiveness of the NVNG program with a sample of approximately 120 (60 intervention, 60 wait group) adolescents aged 13-18 and one of their parents (n=120, 60 intervention, 60 wait group control). Adolescent/parent dyads will be recruited by a rolling recruitment strategy through The Royal Childrens Hospital Diabetes Outreach Clinics and Monash Medical Centre, in Victoria. Pre-Post intervention/wait measures will be administered via online questionnaires at baseline (t=0), on completion of the program (t=6weeks); and 6 months after completion of intervention/wait. Online questionnaires completed by adolescents and their parents will assess a range of psychosocial factors including: negative emotions (e.g. depression, anxiety), quality of life, diabetes self efficacy, resilience, availability of social support, risk taking behaviours, diabetes self care, and perception of parent/adolescent conflict. Parent questionnaires will assess negative emotions, self efficacy, parent perception of child well being, and family conflict. In addition the adolescents glycylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) results at pre-intervention and follow-up will be used as an objective measure of diabetes control. We aim to establish the extent to which positive outcomes are achieved for both adolescents and their parents. </summary>
