  <interventions>
    <interventions>An Australianised Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) based on the traditional Cretan Mediterranean diet, providing 100% of energy requirements for weight maintenance for 6 months in an elderly population (age 65 years or older).

The MedDiet will consist of a high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, virgin olive oil, non-refined bread and cereal products and nuts; a moderate intake of low fat dairy products and lean poultry; a low intake of red meat, added sugar, salt and saturated fat, and moderate intake of red wine (if alcohol is habitually consumed) according to the NHMRC guidelines (2 drinks or less per day).

The diet will aim to provide 35-40% energy from fat with &gt;50% coming from monounsaturated fat, 15% energy from lean protein and 40-45% energy from carbohydrate. This should achieve a ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat of 2.

Physical activity will remain unchanged throughout the trial.

This is a 6 month study and volunteers will undergo outcome assessments at baseline and again at 3 and 6 months. Each assessment timepoint will be conducted over 2 mornings (approx. 2hrs in duration) separated by a week.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be provided for each treatment arm with respect to baseline characteristics. For categorical variables, counts and percentages will be provided.  For continuous variables, means and SEMs will be provided (or non-parametric equivalents).  NonNormally distributed variables will be transformed appropriately before analysis.  If this is not possible then non-parametric procedures will be considered.  We will analyse on an intention to treat basis. A linear mixed model will be used to assess change in neurocognitive outcome after adjusting for baseline levels.  In the case of any imbalance in baseline characteristics between groups, these characteristics will be included in the analysis. Statistical significance will be set at P = 0.05. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS for Windows (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) and Stata (version 11, Statacorp, College Station, Texas).

A systematic review by Norman GR et al (2003) identified 38 studies which resulted in 62 effect sizes.  For all but 6 studies the minimally important difference for health-related quality of life instruments was close to one half a standard deviation (mean =0.495).  Based on this effect size, we calculate that 128 subjects (two groups of n=64) will provide 80% power to detect a significant (P&lt;0.05) 0.5 SD difference in change in cognitive outcomes.  A 0.5 SD improvement in cognitive outcomes is both clinically relevant and socially relevant as it would represent an annual cost saving of approximately $28 million.  An additional 38 volunteers (19 per group, total n=166) will be recruited to account for a 30% subject withdrawal rate. Generally our centre has a less than 20% withdrawal rate.  For flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and cerebral blood flow (TCD) we calculate that 32 participants would give 80% power to detect a statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) 40% improvement, with an effect size of 1 in either FMD or TCD. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a 6 month dietary intervention trial, we aim to investigate the effects of an Australianised Mediterranean Diet on cognitive functioning, cardiovascular health and wellbeing in an elderly Australian free-living population. We will assess memory, executive functioning, verbal fluency and speed and accuracy, psychological well-being, weight, changes in body composition, blood lipids, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, blood glucose and insulin, and vascular endothelial function. We expect to find that an Australianised Mediterranean diet will show greater improvements in these outcomes when compared to a habitual diet. </summary>
