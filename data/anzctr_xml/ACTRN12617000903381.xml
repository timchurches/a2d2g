  <interventions>
    <interventions> Short chain fatty acid (butter 40 gram ), medium chain fats (coconut 40 gram ) and long chain fats (lard 40 gram ). Test food will be delivered in the form of biscuits. Biscuits will be made using wholemeal flour, cornflour, icing sugar and 40 gram lard or coconut or butter.  Different flavours like orange, lemon and vanilla will be used to prepare biscuits. Participants should consume 6 biscuits (40gram fats) within 15 minutes in front of study staff. Participants will stay in the research area for at least 6-7 hours.  All participants will participate for consuming 3 test food with a week wash out period.</interventions>

Blood (approximately 440 µL) will be collected from the subject's middle and ring finger in the non-dominant hand using capillary collection tubes before and after  2, 3, 4 and 6 hour of test food consumption.

The effect of test foods on blood lipids and glucose will be determined by using repeated measure ANOVA with post hoc comparisons (Tukeys honestly significant difference). Baseline data will be used as covariates and changes from the baselines will be determined using paired t-test. Data will be presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) as appropriate, a p-value = 0.05 will be considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In both scientific and public domain, dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are linked with adverse health effects. However, epidemiological and interventional studies have produced contradictory results. Although negative views about SFAs have prevailed, there is increasing evidence to suggest that SFAs are not as harmful as they appear to be and may not be the prime cause of elevated blood lipid levels. Some studies have shown that SFAs induce beneficial effects on blood lipid profiles and that not all SFAs have the same effect on cardiovascular health. SFAs are classified as short (SCFA), medium (MCFA) and long (LCFA) chain fatty acids. SCFA range between 2 to 4 carbons atoms and are found in milk and dairy products. MCFA contain 6 to 12 carbons atoms and are found in coconut oil, palm kernel oil and citrus seeds. LCFA are 14 or more carbons long and are found in animal products like lard, tallow and suet. The digestion, absorbtion and metabolism of fatty acid depends on their chain length. SCFA and MCFA are easily broken down and  undergo rapid beta-oxidation for energy production. However LCFA are not easily digested and are deposited in the peripheral tissues. Thus it is convincing to suggest that consumption of SCFA and MCFA, because of their unique structural, absorption and metabolic characteristics can lower blood fat levels and result in less accumulation of fat in the adipose tissues. Evidence from pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that short and medium chain fatty acids do not contribute to obesity, improves blood lipid profiles and other cardiovascular risk factors. If the same is true for humans, naturally occurring SCFA and MCFA intake might help prevent cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Thus, we hypothesize that short chain saturated fats (butter), medium chain saturated fats (coconut oil) may not be hyperlipidemic as long chain saturated fats (lard).  </summary>
