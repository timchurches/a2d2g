      <outcome>a)	the louse free rate at Day 21 for PP subjects treated with KP24 Medicated Foam verses MOOV Shampoo or MOOV Lotion.   
b)	the presence of head lice at Day 1, as diagnosed by dry-combing of the hair and scalp, for intention-to-treat and per-protocol subjects treated with KP24 Medicated Foam verses MOOV Shampoo or MOOV Lotion.</outcome>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>	Male or female primary school-aged children.
	Presence of live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp.  The presence of live lice will be determined from a visual inspection of the hair and scalp, and dry-combing of the hair.  Combing will stop immediately once live lice are detected. The presence of lice eggs alone is not a sufficient condition for inclusion in the trial.  
	Available for the duration of the trial. 
	Parent / Guardian have given written informed consent to their childs participation in the trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>	History of allergies or adverse reactions to head lice products or the components of the specific products being tested.
	Treatment with any head lice product in the 4 weeks prior to participation in this trial.
	Treatment with any head lice product during the trial.
	Treatment with a head lice comb during the trial if the subject is found to be louse free at Day 21 for any of the three treatment arms.
	Presence of scalp disease(s). 
	If the subject has a sibling in Grade 1-7, who lived at the same residence during the treatment period the sibling must be examined for lice and if infested, enrolled in this study or wet combed out on days 0, 7 and 14, relative to the subject.  
	Subjects must have one fixed place of residence during the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>All head lice products will be applied on Day 0, Day 7 and Day 14.  The combing procedure normally used in combination with KP24 Medicated Foam will not be performed in order to compare the efficacy of the components of each product without confounding the efficacy measurements by physically removing head lice by combing.   
 
The louse free rate (see glossary) at Day 21 after 3 applications of all three treatments will be determined by wet combing for the Intention to Treat population (primary outcome measure) and the Per Protocol population (secondary outcome measure). The louse free rate at Day 1 will be determined by dry combing (secondary outcome measure).</summary>
