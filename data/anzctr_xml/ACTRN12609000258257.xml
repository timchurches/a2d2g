  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves a high protein diet for 26 weeks (6 months) following surgery. The intervention diet has been designed to provide approximately: 4500-5000kJ, 90-100g protein, 110g carbohydrate and 30g fat per day. This provides a macronutrient composition of approximately 35% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 25% fat. Participants will commence the intervention within 3 weeks of having surgery and according to clinical assessment. The intervention includes high protein food and drink choices and a powder-based whey protein supplement. Participants will be asked to have 3 level tablespoons of the supplement daily, providing approximately 12g of protein per day. The supplement can be mixed with regular foods and drinks and either consumed as a dispersed dose (eg one tablespoon three times per day) or as one 3 tablespoon dose, determined at the convenience of the participant. Participants will also continue to receive usual dietetic care in addition to the research intervention. Usual dietetic care consists of regular follow-up with a gastric banding dietitian, who provides individualised advice on food, nutrition and activity as appropriate for gastric banding. This will be administered via face-to-face and telephone consultations (of approximately 30 minutes duration) which will occur approximately every 2-6 weeks after surgery. Specific frequency and duration of consultations is determined by the gastric banding dietitian according to individual need.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in body composition (fat mass, fat free mass).  
Body composition will be assessed using Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar Prodigy, GE Healthcare) in a subset of participants who meet the weight limitation criteria for the DXA equipment (134kg).  All participants will also have body composition measured via bioimpedance analysis (BIA) using BIA scales (Tanita BF-310).</outcome>
      <timepoint>DXA will be undertaken at baseline, six and 12 months.
BIA will be undertaken at baseline, three, six and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in body weight.  Weight will be measured using digital scales correct to one decimal place (Tanita BF-310). Changes will be calculated as percentage difference from baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, three, six and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resting energy expenditure.  This will be measured by indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, six and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood lipid profile [total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs)].  This will be analysed from fasting blood samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, three, six and 12 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glucose metabolism (fasting insulin and glucose levels).  This will be analysed from fasting blood samples. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) will be calculated from fasting glucose and insulin values as a surrogate index of insulin resistance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, three, six and 12 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the usefulness of a high protein diet for obese individuals who have undergone gastric banding. It is a pseudo-randomised control trial comparing a high protein diet with usual dietetic care after surgery. The intervention period will be of six months duration with a further six months of follow-up. This study will help to inform best practice nutritional management for individuals who have had gastric banding.</summary>
