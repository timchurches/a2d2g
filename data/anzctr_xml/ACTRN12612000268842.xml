  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Perceptually-regulated exercise training on a treadmill.  Exercise intensity will be supervised at and perceptually-regualted at a rating of percieved exertion (RPE) 13, for 8 weeks, three times a week for 30 min. Training will be in groups of up to 5.
Arm 2: Perceptually-regulated exercise training on a treadmill.  Exercise intensity will be supervised to be at RPE 15, for 8 weeks, three times a week for 30 min.  Training will be in groups of up to 5.
Arm 3: No treatment control.  Participants will continue their typical behaviour</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>maximal aerobic capacity assessed with breath by breath on- line gas analysis during a graded treadmill exercise test.  Participants will perform a graded exercise test.  Treadmill speed will be fixed at 5.3 km/hr with the gradient commencing at 0% for the first minute and increased by 1%/min thereafter. The test will terminate when there is 1) a plateau in oxygen consumption; 2) a heart rate within 10 beats / min of age-predicted maximum; and 3) an RER of 1.15.</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months post-training</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Motivational processes will be assessed with the use of self-report questionnaires: Markland and Tobin's (2003) Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2; McAuley et al's (1991) Intrinsic Motivation Inventory: Competence and Interest-enjoyment items; and Markand and Hardy's (1997) locus of causality for exercise scale.</outcome>

      <outcome>Affect using Hardy and Rejeski's (1989) Feeling Scale and Thayer's (1989) Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cholesterol: A small sample of capillary blood collected from a finger prick will be applied to a disposable test strip and used to measure total cholesterol via a hand-held, portable blood analyzer (Cardiochek P.A. &amp; PTS PANELS test strips, Polymer Technology systems Inc., Indianapolis, USA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months post-training</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean arterial pressure: Blood pressure will be measured using an automatic blood pressure monitor (UA-767, A&amp;D Company, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturers guidelines. After a 10 minute period of sitting on a hardback chair with both feet on the floor and their left arm supported at heart level, the air hose of the arm cuff will be aligned with the brachial artery at a point 2-3 cm above the elbow. The mean arterial blood pressure, from two separate measures (with a minimum of 10-min between each measure) will be calculated.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The American College of Sports Medicine has highlighted that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the utility of perceptually-regulated exercise as a primary method of exercise prescription.  We have provided evidence that sedentary participant can use percpetually regulated exercise to increase fitness.  This trial will: 1) test the efficacy of an 8 week perceptually-regulated program on aerobic fitness; 2) test the efficacy of an 8 week percpetually-regulated program on motivational processes.  It is hypothesised that perceptually-reguated exercise at RPE 15 will lead to greater increases in aerobic fitness, compared to theRPE 13 and control, but that these will not be sustained over the 6 month follow-up period.</summary>
