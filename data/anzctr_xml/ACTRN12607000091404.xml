  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial investigated the effectiveness of opportunistic referral of smokers by their GP to telephone cessation counselling by a trained nurse to improve quit rates and shifts in stage of change at six and twelve months.  The trial also investigated the acceptability of the intervention to patients and GPs.  Intervention group patients were offered a telephone-based program delivered by a nurse comprising assessment and stage-based behavioural advice, written information and follow-up.  Control group patients received usual care.</summary>
