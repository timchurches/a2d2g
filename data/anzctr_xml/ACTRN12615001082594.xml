  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the acceptability, usability and comprehensibility of a decision aid which aims to help parents make a decision about nutrition support to treat malnutrition during their child's cancer treatment. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are the parent, carer or clinician of a child who has been diagnosed with cancer or a haematological condition at the Kids Cancer Centre at Sydney Children's Hospital, and have had to consider nutrition support in the past five years. 
Study details: All participants recruited in this study will be asked to read the decision aid and then complete a questionnaire regarding its acceptability, usability and comprehensibility. It is hoped that the findings of this pilot study may be used to support the implementation of the decision aid to inform parents and carers facing choices regarding their children's nutrition support during cancer treatment.</summary>
