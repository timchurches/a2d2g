  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surface electromyography (EMG) exam of facial muscles (masseter, temporal and upper and lower mouth orbicular muscles during rest and isommetry of labial and masticatory muscles. The duration of the EMG was about an hour. Each signal was recorded during 10 seconds.</interventions>
    <comparator>The data were compared between the control group (nasal breathing children) and study group (mouth breathing children)</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Diagnosis / Prognosis</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The outcomes showed that the EMG activity did not differ between nasal and mouth breathers. The respiratory mode did not interfere in the muscular activity behavior.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The evaluation of the children was performed during three months and the outocomes was obtained after this period.</timepoint>
