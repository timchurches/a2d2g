  <interventions>
    <interventions>participants (patients attending a single 20 minute consultation with an endocrinologist where they have a bone density scan and are told they have osteoporosis) in the intervention group will be shown two 3D plastic bone models during this consultation. One will be of a healthy bone and the other model will be of an osteoporotic bone. These models will be used by the endocrinologist to demonstrate the difference between a healthy bone and a normal bone; to show how osteoporotic bones are more porous and brittle and more likely to fracture. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants intentions to take medication for osteoporosis and perform health behaviours as recomended by an endocrinologist. This will be assessed in a questionnaire by asking the participants the following question which they will rate on a scale of 1-10 from not likely to extremely likely. "What are your intentions to engage in the following health behaviours to improve your bone health?" this will be asked for the following health behaviours: 

-  Diet  eating food high in calcium
-  Managing your stress
- Exercising regularly 
- Taking medications that may be recommended by your    doctor  
- Taking calcium supplements
-  Taking vitamin D supplements

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to determine whether visualising and interacting with 3D models of a healthy and osteoporotic bone helps patients better understand osteoporosis and hold greater intentions to take their medication compared to receiving verbal information about osteoporosis. 

To do this, patients who are attending the School of Medicine Clinical Research Centre and have confirmed osteoporosiss are being asked to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. 

It is hypothesised that participants who receive the bone models in their consultation will gain a better understanding of osteoporosis, form better beliefs regarding this illness, and have better intentions to engage in treatment compared to the patients who just receive the verbal description of osteoporosis. </summary>
