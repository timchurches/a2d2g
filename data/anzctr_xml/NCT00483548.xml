  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment regimen of ziprasidone plus a mood
      stabilizer is safe and effective in the short term treatment of Bipolar I Depression.
      Ziprasidone will be added to lithium, valproate or lamotrigine after the patient has been on
      a therapeutic dose of one of these mood stabilizers for at least 4 weeks.</summary>
