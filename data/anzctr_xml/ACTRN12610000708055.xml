  <interventions>
    <interventions>20 men and women with features of the metabolic syndrome and 20 age and gender matched healthy controls will enter a 4 week trial of parallel design. All participants will be asked to take 4 x 1g fish oil capsules daily (Omega Daily, Blackmores Ltd, Australia) supplying approximately 2.4g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), for 4 weeks. They will be asked to take 300mg aspirin/day in addition to the fish oil, during the last (4th) week. fish oil capsules and aspirin tablets will be taken orally. Blood samples will be taken at week 0 and at weeks 3 and 4.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Men and post-menopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, aged 20-70 years, will be recruited from the general population by newspaper advertisements. Subjects will recruited on the basis of being untreated but having features of the metabolic syndrome using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP: ATP III). They will be invited to participate if they have a waist circumference &gt;102cm for males and &gt;88cm for females and systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;130 mmHg,
Age and gender matched healthy control subjects will be recruited from the general population. Subjects will be included if in the age range 20 to 70 years with a waist circumference &lt;102cm for males and &lt;88cm for females and no other defining criteria for the metabolic syndrome.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis is that in humans dietary omega-3 fatty acids and aspirin augment the formation of the potent anti-inflammatory metabolites resolvins and protectins. We aim to measure resolvin and protectin levels in individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome compared with matched healthy controls, after omega-3 fatty acids alone and in combination with aspirin;</summary>
