  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mortality from severe malaria remains ~15% despite use of the most effective parasiticidal antimalarial therapy, intravenous artesunate. Adjunctive treatments in combination with anti-parasitic agents have the potential to improve outcome. Our overall goal is to determine if adjunctive treatment with L-arginine is safe and improves outcomes in severe malaria. In early phase studies to date, we have shown that L-arginine is safe in moderately severe malaria, increases nitric oxide (NO) production and improves endothelial function. In a pilot study in severe malaria (ARGISM 1 trial; NCT00616304), L-arginine infusion was safe. We now propose to extend these studies to larger numbers of patients with severe malaria to determine the safety, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of L-arginine infusion in severe malaria.</summary>
