  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) A pulsed Nd:YAG Laser (The American Dental Laser, Sunrise technologies Inc., California, USA., model, dLase300)had an emission wavelength of 1064nm, at 150 microsceond pulse duration. The mean average power of 1.1+ 0.2W, 15Hz; 60-87mJ energy pulse; energy density: 73-107J/cm2; total energy: 211- 312J.
2)0.5mg of 5% EMLA cream (2.5% lignocaine and 2.5% prilocaine), was applied to the buccal mucosa via a plastic syringe and secured in place with oral bandage for 20mins.
These two interventions happen during the same, single session.

For each subject, a pair of bilateral premolar teeth was randomly allotted as i) the Laser plus Sham EMLA or ii) Sham Laser plus EMLA groups by an independent person who neither operated the Laser nor tested the analgesic effects. Analgesia was assessed by cutting a standardised-cavity and recorded by EPT and carried out by an operator not applying Laser nor assessing the VAS score. 

The sham EMLA participants will always receive the real-Laser. And the the real-EMLA participatants will always receive the sham-Laser

Subjects wore ear headphones with no sound and Laser-protective goggles to maintain double-blindedness and for safety. Baseline EPT was measured and recorded prior to treatment. The buccal sulcus adjacent to the test tooth was dried, and 0.5mg of EMLA or Sham EMLA cream applied via a syringe, secured and isolated with an Orahesive bandage (Convatec, Victoria, Australia).

15 minutes after EMLA or Sham EMLA sulcular application, Laser or Sham Laser, was applied in a focus (1mm away) scanning-motion at 3mm/sec over cervical half of the buccal and the lingual/palatal tooth surfaces to a total of 240sec (120sec/surface) and the EPT reading recorded immediately. After five minutes, a standardised cavity was cut at the cervical half of the buccal surface with a high-speed-diamond-bur. Subjects indicated sensitivity by raising their hand and drilling and EPT recording terminated immediately and VAS (0-100mm) recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>1)Sham laser (1mW, He:Ne laser aiming beam).
2)Sham EMLA consisted of the cream ingredients with no EMLA. Both creams were prepacked and coded by Astra Pharmaceuticals (NSW, Australia).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study showed a mean increase of 10.1 EPT units for the Laser group compared with 11.7 EPT units for the EMLA group. 81% receiving either Laser or EMLA treatment showed increased in EPT readings from the baseline. The paired-t Test showed a statistically significant increase in pain thresholds assessed by EPT after Laser or EMLA treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>Electric pulp testing was carried out to assess the analgesic effects immediately after the application of the intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Thirty cavities (68%) were completed in the Laser group and twenty-six (59%) in the EMLA group. Where cavities were not completed, VAS scores were 22+21/100mm for the Laser group and 23+18/100mm for the EMLA group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cutting a standardised cavity on the test tooth to assess the analgesic effects immediately after the application of the intervention. The assessment was terminated when the subject first felt sensitivity. VAS scores were then recorded.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised, double-blind and standardised clinical trials investigated the clinical effectiveness of pulsed Nd:YAG Laser induction of pulpal analgesia compared with 5% EMLA The current study strengthens other reports of the clinical effectiveness of Nd:YAG Laser induction of pulpal analgesia in a carefully planned and standardised, blinded controlling manner. Further studies are however needed to define the optimal Laser parameters, the reversibility of the analgesic effect and the follow-up induced changes on tooth morphology and the pulp for Laser-induced pulpal analgesia. Of particular significance is that Laser-induced pulpal analgesia is effective, minimally invasiveness and therefore, has significant implications world-wide particularly in underdeveloped countries. anaesthetic cream.</summary>
