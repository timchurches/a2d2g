  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo a 1-hour multi-screen exposure, during which they will watch TV while having access to a smartphone and an iPad computer. During the 1-hour exposure, participants will also have access to a variety of food (e.g. chocolate, yoghurt, and fruit) and drink (water and soda). The study will take place in a laboratory room situated at the University of Auckland, Tamaki campus. The participant will be alone in the laboratory room (i.e. there will not be any other participants in the room with them).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake (kcal consumed) during the 1h exposure. 
Energy intake will be calculated by multiplying the grams consumed by the energy density (kcal/g) for the different food and drink types. Energy densities will be those provided by the food manufacturers (as stated on the labels of snack food) or from standardised food composition tables (FOODfiles).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 hour from start of single screen or multi-screen exposure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Amount of food (g) and drink (mL) consumed during 1 h exposure.
Food will be weighed before and after the exposure period, with differences in weights being the number of grams of food consumed.
Drink volume will be measured before and after the exposure period, with differences in volumes being the number of mLs of drink consumed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 hour from start of single screen or multi-screen exposure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-exposure measures of appetite, hunger, satiety, and fullness. Assessed using a 100-mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 1 hour from start of single screen or multi-screen exposure.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>We intend to recruit 78 participants. A total of 78 participants will provide 80% power at the 5% level of significance (two-sided) to detect a difference of 150 kcal between conditions, assuming a standard deviation of 234 kcal. We have based this on existing studies comparing TV watching with rest conditions.
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary NC). All statistical tests will be two-sided at a 5% significance level. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective, randomised, 2-arm, parallel design study will investigate the effects of single-screen (SS) and multiple-screen (MS) exposures on energy intake in adolescent males. Participants will participate in one of two conditions: (1) SS exposure, which will involve watching TV for 1 hour, and (2) MS exposure, which will involve watching TV for 1 hour while having access to a smartphone and an iPad computer. During each exposure, a variety of food and drink will be available for the participant to consume, with the amount and type of food and drink consumed calculated at the end of the session. Study participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess the home screen environment and attitudes towards screen-based activities. Prior to the condition and immediately after the condition the participant will rate subjective measures of appetite, hunger, satiety, and desire to eat something sweet, salty and fatty, using visual analogue scales. Energy intake for the remainder of the study day will be assessed. </summary>
