    <interventions>Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasound
The Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) Doppler ultrasound will be used to determine the timing of second and subsequent fetal blood transfusions where one intrauterine fetal transfusion has been performed for anaemia due to red cell alloimmunisation.
This is an ultrasound examination where the speed of blood flow in the fetal brain is assessed, and is performed during pregnancy. It is used to identify if the fetus is at risk of anaemia. The ultrasound examination takes approximately 10 minutes to perform. Because of the nature of red cell alloimmunisation it is often necessary to perform these ultrasound examinations several times over the course of a pregnancy.
Women who participate in the study will be followed to four months after birth.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard nomogram

The standard nomogram is a chart which takes into account the gestation of the pregnancy, the amount of blood transfused to the fetus, the haemoglobin concentration before and after the transfusion. It then charts the expected fall in haemoglobin and using this information it is possible to time the second transfusion.

Because of the nature of red cell alloimmunisation, several blood transfusions for the fetus are often required during the course of the pregnancy.
At present the standard nomogram is used each time a woman undergoes an intra-uterine fetal blood sample. The precise number of transfusions varies for each pregnancy.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess in the fetus where one intrauterine fetal transfusion has been performed for anaemia due to red cell alloimmunisation, whether fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) Doppler can be safely used to determine the timing of second and subsequent fetal blood transfusions, without increasing the risk of adverse fetal and neonatal health outcomes. 

Red cell alloimmunisation is estimated to affect 0.1 to 0.6% of all live births. Treatment of the resultant fetal anaemia with intrauterine fetal blood transfusion has been associated with survival rates in excess of 90%. However, intrauterine fetal blood sampling and transfusion is an invasive procedure, with recognised complications, which may result in the need for early birth, and rarely mortality. More recently, reports have emerged utilising Doppler ultrasound to measure the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) to determine the presence of fetal anaemia.</summary>
