Other interventions - Standard outpatient care

Active Comparator: Multi-Disciplinary clinic - 

Placebo Comparator: Standard Gastrointestinal clinic - 


Other interventions: Multi-disciplinary clinic model
Clinic model incorporating multiple disciplines for the treatment of functional gut disorders. Disciplines include: gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, hypnotherapists, behavioural therapists and dieticians. End of clinic case conference involving clinical disciplines will also occur to coordinate care.

Other interventions: Standard outpatient care
Standard care provided in outpatient clinics staffed by GI doctors only

    <summary>Randomised controlled trial comparing standard outpatient clinic treatment with
      multi-disciplinary clinic treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders. Patients will
      be followed up to end of clinic treatment and 12 months beyond the end of treatment.
      Symptoms, quality of life, costs to the healthcare system and psychological outcomes will be
      assessed.</summary>
