  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventions are products that offer different approaches to making tablets/capsules easier to swallow. Each participant will be required to swallow three placebo tablets (microcellulose tablets) using three of the following seven randomly allocated interventions:

(i) Pilgo (Registered Trademark)
Description: A pill swallowing cup with a mouth piece that is angled back away from the user to assist individuals in pill swallowing. Its design allows thorough mixing of the pill and liquid before reaching the oral cavity and reduces tilting of the head for a more comfortable motion.
Instruction of use: Swallow a whole tablet using this pill swallowing cup filled with water to the indicator according to the manufacturer's instruction.

(ii) Medi-Straw (Registered Trademark)
Description: A pill swallowing straw with a shelf inside for the pill to rest on. It suspends the pill in liquid as it enters the mouth. It allows the head to remain level and provides a flow of liquid to carry the pill into the mouth. The sucking action also triggers the swallowing reflex, which avoids the gag response.
Instruction of use: Drink water through this pill swallowing straw with a whole tablet pre-placed on the shelf inside the straw (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

(iii) Pill Glide (Registered Trademark)
Description: A non-prescription, water-based, flavored mouth/throat lubricating spray to facilitate pill swallowing by creating a slippery surface on the tongue and throat and masking unpleasant bitter taste of pills. It does not contain any active ingredients.
Instruction of use: Spray 2-4 sprays in the mouth according to manufacturer's instructions and then swallow a whole tablet with water (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

(iv) MedCoat (Registered Trademark)
Description: A disposable pill coating device designed to facilitate pill swallowing by coating the entire pill with a slippery layer and stimulating saliva production, which makes pills easier to swallow. It does not contain any active ingredients.
Instruction of use: Swallow a whole tablet coated using this device with water (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

(v) Gloup (Registered Trademark)
Description: A thick, slippery lubricating gel that makes pills easier to swallow. It is capable of effectively moistening the mouth and throat. It does not contain any active ingredients.
Instruction of use: Swallow a whole tablet encased in a heaped tablespoon of this lubricating gel. If the participants need it, they may follow this with water (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

(vi) Ensure Original Pudding (Registered Trademark)
Description: A nutritious alternative to other snacks or desserts that is suitable for individuals on consistency-modified diets or with swallowing difficulties. It does not contain any active ingredients.
Instruction of use: Swallow a whole tablet encased in a heaped tablespoon of this pudding. If participants need it, they may follow this with water (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

(vii) Water
Description: Water is a commonly recommended as the liquid when swallowing pill.
Instruction of use: Swallow a whole tablet with water (a cup containing 200-250 mL is provided).

There is no minimum duration of break between each swallowing aid and participants may take as much time as they require to break between each swallowing aid.

All interventions will be delivered face-to-face by healthcare professionals with expertise in the field of medication and/or swallowing difficulties.

    <comparator>Asking participants to swallow a sip of water before commencing the swallowing task will be used to calibrate the ease of swallowing rating for each of the randomly allocated pill-swallowing aid. The perceived ease of swallowing whole tablets using the intervention will be compared against other interventions being investigated.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of the study is to explore the perceived ease of swallowing whole tablets, when using different pill-swallowing aids, by people who self-report disliking swallowing them. This study consists of two parts: a questionnaire and a tablet swallowing task. Participants will be enrolled into the study once they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
