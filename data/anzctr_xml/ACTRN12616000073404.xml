  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trial of uptake, acceptability and use of stop-smoking intervention in elective surgical patients who smoke 10+ cigarettes/day. Invitation for a free 5-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT patches) mailed to participants. Invitation to participate in surgical quit-text program. The 5-week course of NRT will be based on the following regimen: 3-weeks 21mg/24hr patch (Step 1), 1-week 14mg/24hr patch (Step 2) and 1-week 7mg/24hr patch (Step 3). Each patch will be worn for a 24 hour period and replaced by a new patch every 24 hours. The course of patches will be mailed to participants at the time they are placed on the elective surgical wait-list. Monitoring adherence to NRT will be by telephone interview 2 days and 5-weeks after posting the course of patches.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The wait-list population of smokers (10+ cigarettes/day) will be randomised such that 1 in 4 will not be offered program (control group) and 3 in 4 will receive offer for the program. This is done to ensure the "get offer" population is sufficiently large to determine the uptake and acceptability of free mailed NRT program to smokers having elective surgery.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot program for uptake, acceptability and outcome of a new mailed NRT service for surgical patients. Previous published data at our institution showed the printed quit-pack intervention resulted in the primary outcome (quit &gt;4-weeks before surgery) in 18.8% of smokers. The same intervention will occur in all patients in this study, but adjusting for quitting in non-nicotine dependent patients (i.e less than 10 cigarettes/day), the underlying quit rate (&gt;4-weeks) will be assumed to be 14.3% for smokers of 10 or greater cigarettes per day at Peninsula Health. Lee et al. recently published an effect size for free NRT in their study of 168 smokers of 18% increased abstinence at 30 days and 17% at 1 year. Assuming an effect size of 17% (32.3% of smokers quit for &gt;4-weeks), 92 patients will be required per group (alpha=5%, beta=20%). 150 per group will allow for patients who may be lost to follow-up. Descriptive statistics will be used for baseline demographic data, stopped before/after surgery will be calculated as a proportion (categorical variable) and analysed with Fishers exact test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tobacco remains a major cause of death in Australia &amp; NZ, with 20,000 annual deaths. Approximately 300,000 smokers have elective surgery each year in Australia &amp; NZ. Smoking increases anaesthetic and surgical risks; particularly respiratory complications and wound infections. Stopping smoking for &gt;4 weeks before surgery significantly reduces these risks, but there is little data on the best ways to help patients quit before surgery. Many smokers make unassisted quit attempts prior to surgery but relapse is common so most arrive in hospital having smoked that day.

The use of nicotine patches and engagement with telephone Quitlines significantly increase quitting success in community settings, but have been little studied in surgical populations. Despite strong evidence in their favour, few smokers having surgery use patches and fewer have Quitline contact. There are no studies looking at using these measures at the time patients go onto the surgical wait-list. More research is important because:
(1)Stopping before surgery, especially &gt;4-weeks reduces surgical &amp; anaesthetic complications.
(2)There is often a significant period of time on the surgical waiting list to allow such quit times to be achieved
(3)Surgery is recognised as a teachable moment for behaviour change; a period in ones life when there is reflection upon health behaviours and increased motivation for positive change.
(4) A significant proportion of patients quitting before surgery remain a lifelong non-smoker. Given the large numbers of smokers having surgery each year, efforts to increase abstinence may be a significant public health benefit.

This is health services research to evaluate if an offer of a stop-smoking program will increase quitting before surgery. Smokers of 10 or more cigarettes per day (nicotine dependent) will be offered a free 5-week course of free nicotine patches shortly after they go onto the waiting list. The 5-week nicotine patch supply will be mailed to patients in order to make their use as easy and convenient as possible; eliminating many of the barriers to use.

Patients who were smokers at time of waiting list placement will be approached on their day of surgery by a data collector and asked for verbal consent for a short interview (&lt;4-minutes). This will ask if they have quit smoking, or made quit attempts before surgery. For those that claim to have quit (&gt;24 hours), we will ask for written permission to confirm this by exhaled carbon monoxide testing plus to make brief telephone contact at 3 and 6 months after surgery to see if they are still quit. 

A comparison group of patients who smoke will not have this quit package promoted or offered to them. </summary>
