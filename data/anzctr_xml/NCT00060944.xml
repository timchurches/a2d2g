Experimental: Yondelis weekly schedule - Yondelis weekly schedule: 0.58 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour i.v. infusion on Days 1 8 and 15 of each 28-day treatment cycle. Patients will be pretreated with 10 mg of dexamethasone i.v. 30 minutes prior to each infusion.

Experimental: Yondelis once every 3 weeks schedule - Yondelis once every 3 weeks schedule: 1.5 mg/m2 administered as a 24-hour i.v. infusion on Day 1 of every 21-day treatment cycle. Patients will be pretreated with 20 mg of dexamethasone i.v. on Day 1 of each treatment cycle 30 minutes prior to each infusion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Progression- Independent Review - Time to Progression was defined as time between randomization and the first documentation of disease progression or death due to progressive disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to progressive disease, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Objective Response - Independent Review - Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as greater than or equal to 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study greater than or equal to 4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to progressive disease, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Independent Review - Duration of response based on assessment of confirmed CR or confirmed PR according to RECIST. Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as greater than or equal to 30 percent decrease in sum of the LD of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study greater than or equal to 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. Kaplan-Meier estimation of response duration was used to account censored participants with ongoing response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to the first documentation of disease progression or death due to progressive disease, whichever occurs first, assessed up to 5 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - Independent Review - The below table shows Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to death from any cause or first observed disease progression.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival - The below table shows Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median time from randomization to death from any cause or first observed disease progression.</outcome>
