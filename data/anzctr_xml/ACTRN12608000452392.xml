  <interventions>
    <interventions>use of varying proportions of low glycaemic index food intakes to determine what proportion of the meal needs to be low GI for benefit to glycaemic outcome using CGMS measured blood glucose response and standard bolus dose feature on insulin pump. The criteria for varying glycaemic index intake was based on 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the carbohydrate food choices within the meal being low GI in content. An individual test meal is given for breakfast each morning, fasted from the previous night. The duration of the study is 5 half days within one week.  Each subject acts as their own control when comparing the CGMS measured blood glucose response to the differing test meals. </interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All participants will be patients managed by the diabetes team at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne and potential participants will be identified using the department’s records (eg patient database, records of patients using insulin pump devices etc). Preliminary information about the trial will be provided in the form of information sheets sent to all potential participants by mail; a letter from all researchers inviting participation will accompany this written information. As all researchers are members of the diabetes team at the Royal Children's Hospital, participants may be personally known to the researchers but this will not necessarily be the case. Information about the study (verbal and written information) will be available to potential participants at points of contact with the diabetes team – at outpatient clinic, nurse educators or dietetic visits and at insulin pump user support group meetings. All information will be accompanied by a statement that participation is voluntary and subject's decision on whether or not to participate will in no way influence the care received from the diabetes team. Subjects will be randomly allocated to the order in which they receive each test meal. This is a simple random allocation procedure performed prior to recruitment by the statistician using Stata10 statistical package with allocation assignment placed into a sealed opaque envelope that is not opened until each subject has been recruited and consented to the study.  Each subject acts as their own control as is a cross-over trial </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed using simple random allocation derived from the computer statistical software Stata supplied by the hospital's statistical department Centre of Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit (CEBU).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is hypothesised that consideration of glycaemic index (GI) knowledge and the deliberate use of GI foods to modify low/high GI meals will improve post-prandial glycaemia in patients on insulin pump therapy. Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of clinical dietary advice regarding use of GI knowledge to improve PPG in pediatric patients with T1DM on insulin pump therapy; 1. To assess the clinical effectiveness of the dietary advice regarding the addition of a low GI food to a high GI meal to determine what proportion of the meal needs to contain low GI carbohydrates to improve postprandial glycaemic outcome.  </summary>
