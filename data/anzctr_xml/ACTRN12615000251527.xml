  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Focus Pocus (version 2) neurocognitive training software was developed by NeuroCog Proprietary Limited incorporating intellectual property licensed from UOW.  The software consists of a series of wizard-themed, computerised, mini-games targeting inhibitory control (IC), working memory (WM) and state control (SC).    During use of the software, participants are required to wear a portable EEG headset; the NeuroSky MindWave. The headset records EEG from a single, dry, sensor resting on the forehead referenced to an ear-clip electrode.   

During SC games, participants are instructed to focus, relax or induce a state of zen' (i.e. focused and relaxed), and the corresponding EEG pattern is used to control elements of the game (e.g. the speed of the player in a broomstick race).  During WM and IC games, EEG is passively monitored and categorised according to attention level during the game, with attention level then used as a multiplier for game points.  Game difficulty adapts constantly based on performance to ensure that games are challenging but not too difficult.  Participants receive on-screen feedback about performance following each game.

In the present study, participants will be required to complete 25 sessions of the neurocognitive training, at a rate of 5 sessions per week.  Each training session will consist of 6 SC, 4 WM, and 4 IC games, and will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.  Participants will self-administer the training in their own homes, using their own personal computer or iOS device and a loan headset.  Data regarding training compliance and performance will be sent to an online server, so that researchers can monitor progress.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in a waitlist control condition will be offered the neurocognitive training program after the 6 week follow-up period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of a neurocognitive training program for improving executive function and arousal state modulation in adults with traumatic brain injury. It is expected that compared to a waitlist control, those who complete the training will show improvements on a rang of cognitive and behavioural measures of executive function, as well as improvement in their ability to regulate arousal state of the brain (brain activity measured by EEG).</summary>
