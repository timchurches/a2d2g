    <interventions>Antibiotic therapy will be as follows:
Amoxycillin 500mg and clavulanic acid 125mg twice daily for 2 weeks, oral capsule

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be the relative change in urge incontinence, measured on 24 hour pad test. Cure will be defined as &lt;8mL on a 24 hour pad test </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 Months after randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome measure will be frequency of micturition on 3 day Bladder diary. Cure on 3 day bladder diary is defined as &lt; 8 voids per day. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients will be female, over 50 years of age who present with a main complaint of urge incontinence.
Urodynamic testing will show a primary diagnosis of detrusor overactivity (DO).
Patients will have failed to respond to bladder training with at least 2 anti-muscarinic therapeutic agents over 2 years.
Participants must leak urine at least 1 episode per 3 days on frequency volume chart.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>a. Neuropathic DO (such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, Parkinsonism) b. Voiding dysfunction, defined as urinary flow rate less than 15 ml per sec for volume greater than 200ml with residual volume greater than 100ml c. Insufficient English language skills, or dementia, ie unable to complete questionnaires unaided. d. elevated creatinine,  renal failure, e. allergy to more than penicillin</exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, who give informed consent, will have a screening midstream urine culture and a 2 week wash out of previous anti-muscarinic drugs, then will be randomized to active treatment or placebo.

Allocation concealment procedure = Sealed opaque envelopes
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be dynamic (adaptive) random allocation methods. Patients will be randomised to the placebo or antibiotic group, using method minimisation stratified for severity of incontinence (based on 24 hour pad test, less than 75mL per 24 hours, equal to 75mL per 24 hours) and proven history of classical bacterial cystitis. </sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>None</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Previous studies suggest that approximately 20% of women would no longer suffer from severe urge incontinence (greater than 9 visits to the toilet per day) after 6 months of standard treatment. An increase of this rate to 35% with antibiotic treatment would provide sufficient activity. Based on the Simons 2 stage design, 80 patients receiving antibiotic treatment would have &gt;80% power with 95% confidence to rule out an estimate of benefit of 20% in favour of a rate of 35%. 

The primary outcome will be estimated as the proportion of patients experiencing a cure at 6 months post randomization together with 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables will be described using mean and standard deviations; categorical variables will be summarized using percentages and time-to-event outcomes by the Kaplan-Meier method. Where exploratory analyses are performed these will be compared using t-tests or chi-squared tests as appropriate together with regression methods (logistic, proportional hazards) as required.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women with severe urgency of micturition and urge incontinence, who have not responded to treatment with bladder training and appropriate tablets for two years, will be invited to join a study whereby they will receive a highly effective tablet (darifenicin) as well as either 6 weeks of antibiotics, or 6 weeks of placebo. Followup of clinical outcome will occur over 6 months.</summary>
