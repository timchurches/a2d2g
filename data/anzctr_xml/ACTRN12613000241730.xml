  <interventions>
    <interventions>One of these study drugs (Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Meropenem, Vancomycin, Imipenem and Lizezolid) will be chosen, administered and dosed as per standard administration guidelines respective to the hospital. Participants will complete a full course of intravenous study drug for approx 7 days or as required by the site doctor to treat the associated infection. Study samples will be taken once on a dosing interval on days 1-2 and then again during a dosing interval between days 3-6. Serial samples of plasma, effluent and urine collections will be measured over either a 6, 8 or 12 hour study period to describe PK changes and potential resolution of infection as follows (assumes a 30-minute infusion for Meropenem or Piperacillin-Tazobactam and a 60-minute infusion for Vancomycin). Study samples will also be analysed to assess RRT clearance of drugs including sedatives and analgesics as well as micro nutrients (e.g. vitamin c , selenium). </interventions>

    <concealment>Patients will be screened for potential eligibility by the ICU research coordinator (RC) or Principal Investigator (PI). If deemed eligible the patient will be provided with information about the study and the consent form, if they are unable to provide their own consent the patientâ€™s authorized representative will be approached. The patient/authorized representative will be asked to consider participation in the study, ask any questions and inform the study team of their decision. 

All five study drugs (Piperacillin-Tazobactam, Meropenem, Vancomycin, Imipenem and Linezolid) will be administered and dosed as per standard administration guidelines respective to the hospital. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Problematic to all available single-centre pharmacokinetic studies in intensive care units is a lack of statistical power caused by a low throughput of patients per intensive care unit as well as extreme interpatient pharmacokinetic variability. For this reason, multiple intensive care units with experience in pharmacokinetic studies need to be coordinated to enroll patients to achieve acceptable statistical power. The significant variability of antibiotic exposures in intensive care units patients receiving renal replacement therapy is due to the complex interaction of multiple renal replacement therapy modalities and setting and patient factors. A robust analysis of a large data set of patients receiving different forms of renal replacement therapy and the associated clinical and pharmacokinetic changes over time will enable description of the pharmacokinetic distribution and variability in this patient population. 

As the fundamental requirement in this study is to determine the distributions of pharmacokinetic parameters, the power analysis is aimed at establishing the confidence boundaries of individual pharmacokinetic parameters under different renal replacement therapy modalities and settings. To construct a 95% confidence boundary of clearance with standard deviation as high as 2.5 L/Hr with 80% power, we need 45 patients data for a particular renal replacement therapy modality. For the three modalities, we need a minimum of 150 patients per antibiotic. Our total sample is 450 patients to allow for potential attrition. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inadequate antibiotic therapy is a critical determinant of survival in patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with overwhelming infection requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT).  Guidelines for effective dosing are not available because RRT can be vastly different between ICUs, resulting in significantly different antibiotic pharmacokinetics. Developing an evidence-based antibiotic dosing guideline is of global significance and should be considered a priority to improving clinical outcomes for patients requiring RRT that have infections.</summary>
