    <interventions>ARM 1-1 gr of paracetamol (Perfalgan 10mg/ml 100 ml Flacon Bristol-Myers Squibb Labarotories, Renaudin Itxassou France) administered to 20 patients (Group I) by intravenous infusion in 15 minutes during the closure, and 1 gr of intravenous paracetamol administered at every 6 hours during the following 24 hours postoperatively.Paracetamol was not dilueted, as it is  produced as a solution  and marketing in bottles of 100ml.
ARM 2-Dexketoprofen trometamol 50 mg/2 mL (Arveles 50 mg/2 ml Menarini International Italy) diluted in 100 mL of saline and administered to 20 patients(Group II),  in 15 minutes by intravenous infusion during the closure and dose repeated at every 8 hours during the following 24 hours of postoperative period.After surgery, patient controlled analgesia equipment (Abbott Pain Management Provider, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL, USA) will be provided to every patient enrolled in this trial (60 patients) as resuce analgesia. It will be programmed for a bolus dose of 1mg of morphine then locked for 10 minutes (morphine concentration is 0.2mg /ml).
The follow up period of the study was 24 hours as we evaluated acute postoperstive pain control</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary aim of this study was to compare by means of differences in cumulative 24-hour morphine consumption among groups. A total sample size of 57 (19 per group) was required to detect at least 15.5 mg difference between any of two groups with a power of 90% at the 5% significance level. The difference of 15.5 mg was taken from literature. 6 Sample size estimation was performed by using NCSS and PASS 2000 software.
Normal distribution of continuous variables was assessed by Shapiro Wilk test. Significance of differences between groups was analyzed with One Way Analysis of Variances for means and with Kruskal Wallis for medians. Nominal data were evaluated by Pearsons Chi-Square test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aimed to evaluate analgesic efficacy, opioid-sparing and opioid-related adverse effects of iv paracetamol and iv dexketoprofen trometamol in combination with iv morphine after abdominal hysterectomy. Double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, prospective study was designed.Sixty ASA I-II patients scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled to study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups as paracetamol, dexketoprofen trometamol and placebo (0.9% NaCl). Intravenous patient-controlled analgesia morphine was used as a rescue analgesic in all groups. Pain scores, hemodynamic parameters, morphine consumption, patient satisfaction and side effects were evaluated.
Normal distribution of continuous variables was assessed by Shapiro Wilk test. Significance of differences between groups was analyzed with One Way Analysis of Variances for means and with Kruskal Wallis for medians. Nominal data were evaluated by Pearsons Chi-Square test. 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores werent statistically significantly different among the groups in all evaluation times, but decrease in VAS scores was statistically significant after the evaluation at 12th hour in all groups. Total morphine consumption (morphine concentration=0.2mg/ml) in group paracetamol (72.3+/-38.0 ml) and dexketoprofen trometamol (69.3+/- 24.1 ml) was significantly lower than group placebo (129.3+/- 22.6 ml).
Conclusions: Dexketoprofen trometamol and paracetamol didnt cause significant change on pain scores but increased patients comfort. Although total morphine consumption was significantly decreased by both drugs, side effects were similar among the groups.
According to results of the present study routine addition of dexketoprofen trometamol and paracetamol to PCA morphine after hysterectomies is not recommended.
