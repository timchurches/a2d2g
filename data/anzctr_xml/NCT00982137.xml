    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Japanese Encephalitis Seroconversion Following ChimeriVax-JE or STAMARIL® Alone or the Co-administration of ChimeriVax-JE and STAMARIL®, or Placebo Vaccination. - Neutralising antibody titer against homologous Japanese encephalitis (JE), yellow fever (YF), and other relevant wild type JE strains were determined using a 50% serum dilution plaque reduction neutralisation test. Seroconversion post-vaccination was defined as the appearance of neutralising antibody titer when not present at Day 0, or at least a four-fold rise in neutralising antibody titer between the pre-vaccination (Day 0) and the post-vaccination samples.
The 30 Days post-JE seroconversion is: Day 30 for Group 1 (ChimeriVax-JE then STAMARIL®) and Group 3 (Co-administration of ChimeriVax-JE and STAMARIL, then Diluent); Day 60 for Group 2 (STAMARIL® then ChimeriVax-JE) and Group 4 (Diluent then Co-administration of ChimeriVax-JE and STAMARIL).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to obtain safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity data on the
      co-administration or sequential administration of Chimeravax-JE vaccine and STAMARIL®.

      Objectives:

      Safety:

        -  Obtain safety and tolerability data of a single, fixed dose of ChimeriVax-JE
           administered concurrently, one month before or one month after STAMARIL® to adult
           volunteers (= 18 to = 55 years) without prior Japanese encephalitis (JE) or yellow fever
           (YF) vaccination.

      Immunogenicity:

        -  Obtain data on the antibody response to a single, fixed dose of ChimeriVax-JE
           administered concurrently, one month before or one month after STAMARIL® to adult
           volunteers without prior JE (or YF) vaccination.

        -  Assess the durability of the immune response in adult volunteers 6 months after
           administration of ChimeriVax-JE and STAMARIL®.</summary>
