    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - SOF
Treatment: drugs - RBV
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to match SOF
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to match RBV

Experimental: SOF+RBV+placebo - Participants were randomized to receive SOF+RBV for 12 weeks followed by placebo to match SOF plus placebo to match RBV for 4 weeks.

Experimental: SOF+RBV - Participants were randomized to receive SOF+RBV for 16 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: SOF
Sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg tablet was administered orally once daily.

Treatment: drugs: RBV
Ribavirin (RBV) tablets was administered orally in a divided daily dose according to package insert weight-based dosing recommendations (&lt; 75kg = 1000 mg and = 75 kg = 1200 mg).

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to match SOF
Placebo to match SOF was administered orally once daily.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to match RBV
Placebo to match RBV was administered orally twice daily.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving SVR12 - SVR12 was defined as HCV RNA &lt; the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ, ie, &lt; 25 IU/mL) 12 weeks after cessation of therapy.

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Viral Breakthrough - Viral breakthrough was defined as HCV RNA = LLOQ after having previously had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ while receiving treatment, confirmed with 2 consecutive values (second confirmation value could be posttreatment), or last available on-treatment measurement with no subsequent follow-up values.

      <timepoint>Up to 16 weeks</timepoint>

    <summary>This study was to assess the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin
      (RBV) administered for 12 or 16 weeks in participants with genotypes 2 or 3 hepatitis C virus
      (HCV) infection as assessed by the proportion of participants with sustained virologic
      response (SVR) 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy (SVR12).</summary>
