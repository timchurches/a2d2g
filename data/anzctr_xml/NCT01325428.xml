    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Part A: Clinical Benefit (CB) Assessed by Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) for at Least 6 Months Using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1). - Tumour response was assessed separately for Part A and Part B according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The primary endpoint of this study was confirmed clinical benefit, as assessed by Stable Disease (SD) for at least 6 months (defined as &gt;182 days), Partial Response (PR), or Complete Response (CR) according to RECIST version 1.1 (only confirmed responses were considered).</outcome>
      <timepoint>This endpoint was assessed between the from first administration of trial medication in Part A and the earliest of PD, death or start of next treatment (either Part B combination therapy or new anti-cancer therapy) up to 929 days.</timepoint>

    <summary>The general aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of afatinib alone and
      in combination with weekly vinorelbine (in patients who progress on afatinib monotherapy
      within this trial) as treatment in patients with HER2-overexpressing, locally advanced or
      metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. The study will include patients who have and have not
      failed prior trastuzumab treatment.</summary>
