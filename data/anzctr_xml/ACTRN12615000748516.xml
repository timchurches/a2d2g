  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a microscopically confirmed P. falciparum or P. vivax infection on day 0 will be administered a fixed dose combination of artemether (20 mg) and lumefantrine (120 mg) (CoartemTM, Novartis) as a six-dose regimen twice a day for three days according to body weight under direct supervision by the study team.  The mode of administration is oral dosing as follows: 5 to &lt;15 kg bodyweight: 1 tablet per dose; 15 to &lt;25 kg: 2 tablets per dose; 25 to &lt;35 kg: 3 tablets per dose; =35 kg: 4 tablets per dose. In addition, the Pv group will also receive oral primaquine once daily for 14 days (0.25 mg base/kg/day), starting on Day 28 after completion of the 28-day follow-up. The study patients will be observed for 30 min after drug administration for adverse reactions or vomiting. Any patient who vomited during this observation period will be re-treated with the same dose of AL and observed for an additional 30 min. Patients are requested to return to the clinic on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 for clinical and parasitological assessment as per protocol follow up schedule, or whenever they did not feel well.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: To assess the therapeutic efficacy  of artemether-lumefantrine (AL, Coartem Trademark) combination therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infections in an area of Solomon Islands. The efficacy of AL in the two groups are compared by the number of patients cured of their infection over a 28-day follow-up period. Recrudescence of infection will be determined by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. Early treatment failure (ETF), late parasitological failure (LPF), late clinical failure (LCF) and late parasitological failure (LPF) as defined in WHO (2003: Assessment and monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Geneva: World Health Organization. 68 pp). Note: Primaquine was administered after Day 28, hence the effect of artemether-lumefantrine combination therapy was solely evaluated in this group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Absence of parasitaemia on day 28 irrespective of axillary temperature without previously meeting any of the criteria of Early Treatment Failure (ETF) or Late Clinical Failure (LCF) or Late Parasitological Failure (LTF).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety </outcome>
      <timepoint>Absence of side effects up to 28 days post-treatment 
All patients will be asked about old symptoms and new symptoms emerging since previous visit during the follow-up. Known possible side effects include stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Where clinically indicated patients will be evaluate and treated appropriately. All adverse events will be recorded on the case reporting form. For a patient who vomits twice, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and he/she will given rescue treatment.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming an expected treatment failure rate of 5% with artemether-lumefantrine, a power of 80%, and a 5% level of significance, 59 subjects will need to be enrolled in each of the Pf or Pv group. A 15% drop-out (or loss to follow-up) can be expected during a 28-day study, so a total of 70 patients should be enrolled in each of the Pf or Pv group</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>PRIMARY PURPOSE
To assess the efficacy of artemether- lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax infections in Solomon Islands using the WHO 28-day protocol. 

The null hypothesis is that patients who take artemether-lumefantrine (CoArtem) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax infections have similar clinical and parasitological outcomes.
