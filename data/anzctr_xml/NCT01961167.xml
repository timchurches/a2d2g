    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patient has a life expectancy of less than 1 year;

          -  Patient has a known allergy to stent graft components, including stainless steel or
             heparin;

          -  Patient has a known intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic

             stent delivery;

          -  Patient has a target lesion situated in such a way that an implanted device will
             prevent blood flow or perfusion to the internal iliac artery if patent</exclusivecriteria>
