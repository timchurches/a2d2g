    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK2256098

Experimental: Part 1 - Part 1 - dose escalation; starting dose 80 mg BID

Experimental: Part 2 - Part 2 - Dose expansion phase of the study at the maximum tolerated dose and schedule identified in Part 1 in patients with tumors known to over express FAK

Experimental: Part 3 - Part 3 - Characterize the biologically active dose range by analysis of PD markers in skin, hair and in tumor tissue in subjects with solid tumors amendable to biopsy and know to over express FAK

Experimental: Part 4 - Part 4 - Explore further the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

Experimental: Part 5 - Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098 at Day 15 and later time points.


Treatment: drugs: GSK2256098
GSK2256098 is a potent focal adhesion kinase inhibitor that will be administered orally as 20, 100 or 250 mg capsules. The starting dose in Part 1 is 80 mg twice daily. The dose will continue to be increased until the maximum tolerated dose is identified.

             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from the first dose of study drug and
             until 21 days after last dose of study medication,

          -  or is surgically sterile. NOTE: Male subjects must use contraception to prevent
             pregnancy in a female partner and prevent exposure of any partner to semen by any
             means (refer to Section 8.1).

          -  A female is eligible to enroll in the study if she is of:

          -  Non-child bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant)

        bilateral tubal ligation oIs post-menopausal (total cessation of menses for = 1 year)

          -  Childbearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screening, and agrees
             to one of the following from at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a Phase I dose escalation study in subjects with solid tumors. Part 1 will
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) using a dose-escalation procedure. Following
      identification of the MTD, enrollment into Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 may be concurrent. Part 2 will
      explore further the safety, PK, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in
      subjects with tumors known to overexpress focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Part 3 will
      characterize the range of biologically effective doses by assessing pharmacodynamic (PD)
      markers in hair, skin and tumor tissue at doses that will not go lower than 80 mg or above
      the MTD dose levels tested during the Phase 1 dose escalation. Part 4 will explore further
      the safety, PK, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098 in subjects with relapsed
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098. Secondary objectives are to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GSK2256098; to identify a range of biologically active doses; to
      explore the anti-tumor activity of GSK2256098, and to explore relationships between
      GSK2256098 PK, PD and clinical endpoints. Part 5 will investigate the time course, the extent
      of an apparent change in the PK of GSK2256098 following repeated dosing, and screen for
      potential CYP3A induction as a possible mechanism of reduced systemic exposure of GSK2256098
      at Day 15 and later time points. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      safety, tolerability, and MTD of GSK2256098.</summary>
