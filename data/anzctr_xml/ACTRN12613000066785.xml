  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1. Cognitive training. This will be conducted in small groups by a research assistant, 1 hour sessions 3x per week for 4 weeks. It will involve tasks dedicated to executive function training, especially as it relates to driving ability. Most tasks will be computer-based. Goal: 	To provide training and strategies that focus on executive control of movement.
Arm 2. Physical activity. This will be conducted in small groups by a research assistant, 1 hour sessions 3x per week for 4 weeks. It will involved Jazzercise, a dance-based physical activity program specifically tailored to this age-group, and designed to be cognitively challenging exercise (e.g., remembering patterns and steps, pattern changes etc).</interventions>

4. Using the MMSE, a cut-off score of 21 will be used to identify people with a suspected cognitive impairment. These participants will be excluded from participation in the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Information forms about the project will be distributed to a retirement village. These information sheets will include contact details of researchers for those who wish to participate in the study. Once participants have indicated their interest, provided signed consent and found eligible for the trial according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be randomly allocated to one of three conditions by an independent researcher.</concealment>
    <sequence>Simple randomisation by using a randomization table created by a computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation). After administration of the baseline measures and providing consent to participate, each individual will be randomly assigned to one of the three conditions according to their sex. This stratification to condition will help to ensure approximately equal numbers of males and females in each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Normal cognitive ageing is characterised by slowing of information processing and a decline in a range of cognitive abilities that involve problem solving, attention, working memory, episodic memory and executive function. Cognitive ageing only interferes with daily activities when there are complex cognitive demands occurring jointly with sensory and physical demands. 

In order to improve everyday function in older adults, we aim to develop an intervention targeting both complex cognitive demands and physical demands. As a pilot study, we aim to compare executive function training with a physical activity intervention (Jazzercise), compared with a comparison group receiving no intervention, on everyday function outcomes including a driving simulator task.</summary>
