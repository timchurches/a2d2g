  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Switch-off 4 Healthy Minds intervention will run for two full school terms, in 2014, and will aim to promote and improve psychological wellbeing in adolescents. The intervention will include a range of evidence-based and innovative strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour in adolescents. The eHealth intervention will include push notifications and text messages promoting a reduction in screen-time. Participants will receive 25 push prompt messages throughout the intervention. Participants will receive these prompts once weekly and will have the opportunity to choose how the messages will be delivered. Delivery methods such as: Facebook, Twitter, Email, Snap Chat and SMS have been chosen due to their popularity in the age group of (i.e.11-12 years). The push-prompt messages (i.e., text messages) will be designed to address the consequences of excessive screen-time and the importance of self-management. The intervention is grounded in self-determination theory and strategies have been designed to influence motivation to limit screen time and potential environmental determinants. An information session will be delivered by a member of research team during school hours. The session will outline the intervention and requirements of the students. Students will be given the opportunity to ask any questions during this session. The intervention will also include a range of strategies for parents to manage their childrens screen-time: (a) screen-time behavioural contract, (b) newsletters focusing on: household screen-time rules, consequences of excessive screen-time, strategies to manage parent/child conflict arising from screen-time rules and home challenges to reduce screen-time. The intervention period will last for 6 months which includes baseline and follow-up assessments. Attendance at workshops will be monitored using class attendance lists. Other strategies used to monitor adherance to the program will be included in the process evaluations conducted at 6-months. Process evaluation questionnaires will determine how many newsletters were read, number of text messages received and satisfaction of the intervention in relation to the different methods of delivery. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be sourced from approximately 8 Catholic schools from the Hunter region.   
The School Principal from Catholic schools will be sent an Information and Consent Letter describing the study. If the School Principal declines the study invitation we will contact another school. Once we have recruited a school, participants will learn about the study through a range of mediums including:
- announcements at school assembly
- announcements in PE classes

All students in year 7 at the study schools will be invited to complete a screen-time eligibility questionnaire. Students who report greater than or equal to 2 hours/day in screen-based recreation will be invited to participate in the study. 

Eligible students will be invited to an information session at the school describing the study. At this session, interested students will be provided with an Information Letter detailing each intervention, their anticipated benefits, their required commitment level, and a Consent Letter. Our researchers will distribute information sheets and consent forms.
Allocation is not concealed for this study. 

</concealment>
    <sequence>Once baseline assessments have been conducted, schools will be randomised to one of two study arms (i) Switch-off 4 Healthy Minds intervention or (ii) Wait list control group. Schools will be randomly allocated to one of the two intervention groups using a computer-based random number-producing algorithm. This method ensures an equal chance of allocation to each group. All participants will be assessed at baseline and at the completion of the intervention (6 months).</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes will be conducted with linear mixed models using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (2010 SPSS Inc., IBM Company Armonk, NY) and alpha levels will be set at p &lt; 0.05. The models will be used to assess the impact of treatment (S4HM or control), time (treated as categorical with levels baseline and 6-months) and the group-by-time interaction, these three terms forming the base model. The models will be specified to adjust for the clustered nature of the data and will include all randomised participants in the analysis. A power calculation was conducted to determine the sample size required to detect changes in the primary outcome [i.e., recreational screen-time from the Adolescent Sedentary Activity Questionnaire (ASAQ)]. Calculations were based on 80% power with alpha levels set at p &lt; 0.05, using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.03 and a standard deviation of 91 minutes, based on our previous school based studies. Using methods that account for the clustering of effects at the school level, it was calculated that a study sample of N = 320 students (i.e., 40 students from 8 schools) will provide adequate power to detect a between group difference of 48 minutes of recreational screen-time. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this group randomised control trial is to evaluate the impact of an innovative multi-component intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour (i.e. time spent sitting) on health and psychological well-being in adolescents. 

The project will address the following research questions:

i)	What is the impact of the intervention on the primary outcome of recreational screen-time?
ii)	What is the impact of the intervention on the secondary outcomes of psychological wellbeing, obesity, physical activity and sleep time?
iii)	What are the factors responsible (i.e., mediators) for sedentary behaviour change? 
iv)	What is the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among students, parents and teachers?

The  study will include a range of different strategies including: 
(a) e-Health delivered intervention messages and an,
(b) Information session.   
The intervention will also include a range of strategies for parents to manage their childrens screen-time: 
(c) screen-time behavioural contract, and
(d) newsletters focusing on household screen-time rules, consequences of excessive screen-time, strategies to manage parent/child conflict arising from screen-time rules and home challenges to reduce screen-time.
Recreational screen-time will be the primary outcome of the study. Secondary outcomes include: psychological well-being,  physical self-concept, psychological distress, weight, height and physical activity. Social cognitive and environmental mediators of sedentary behaviour change will be also  be assessed.  
Assessments will be conducted at baseline and 6-months. </summary>
