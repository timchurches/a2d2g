    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, prednisone, methotrexate, and
      leucovorin calcium (LCV), work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they
      stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet
      known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective in treating acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone to see how well it works
      compared to prednisone during induction therapy. This trial is also studying methotrexate and
      leucovorin calcium to see how well they work compared to methotrexate alone during
      maintenance therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</summary>
