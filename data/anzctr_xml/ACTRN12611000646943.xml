  <interventions>
    <interventions>ProDisc-C implant (replacement of diseased disc), Cervios (cage) for fusion post discectomy. These are two separate implants used for comparison in the trial.  Subjects are randomised into either the ProDisc-C arm or the Cervios arm just prior to the surgery.   

ProDisc-C is a device based on a ball and socket design. It is made up of 3 parts -  the 1st is the inferior cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy plate with a midline keel which is anchored into the endplate of the inferior vertebral body. The 2nd component is an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene insert that is snap-locked into a tray detail in the inferior alloy plate and provides the inferior convex bearing surface. The 3rd component is a cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy plate with a midline keel that anchors to the superior vertebral body and has a highly polished concave bearing surface that articulates with the convex spherical dome. 

The implant is permanent and surgical intervention is a one-off procedure, which requires 2 to 3 hours of surgery time.

After removal of the diseased cervical disc, the alternative procedure for PRODISC-C is the insertion of a device called a Cervios cage into the space to fuse the adjacent vertebrae together.  Cervios is a radiolucent interbody fusion implant made of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) which has either a curved or wedge-shaped profile to fit into the inter-vertebral cervical disc space for anterior interbody fusion. The implant has a large round window in its middle to allow for bone through-growth or, the spacing can be packed with bone substitutes.  The implant is conventionally referred to a "cage".

Compared to Cervios, the ball and socket design of ProDisc-C is for motion preservation, that is, the implant offers the potential of allowing for disc removal without increasing the stress and strain on adjacent cervical segments.</interventions>
    <comparator>Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (using Cervios)

The most common treatment to alleviate the pain and neurological deficits caused by degenerative disc disease is an anterior discectomy, which involves the surgical removal of soft disc herniations that press against the spinal nerve roots.  Following cervical discectomy a bone graft is inserted into the disc space in order to fuse the adjacent vertebrae together. This is known as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). 

Cervios is the comparator implant used in the trial to fuse the adjacent vertebrae together. ACDF is a simpler procedure which requires less surgery time since bone graft or Cervios insertion requires less surgical technique than ProDisc-C.  However, ACDF procedures require postoperative immobilization of the neck and can result in abnormal loading of adjacent discs of the spine. Over time, these stresses may contribute to accelerated degeneration of the adjacent discs.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint is the overall success rates in the two treatment groups, to determine the device's effectiveness and safety for patients implanted with the ProDisc-C compared to ACDF.

Success is assessed by:
1. The patient's NDI score improves by at least 20% from baseline;
2. The patient's neurologic parameters (motor, senory and reflexes) are maintained or improved;
3. No removals, revisions, re-operations or additional fixation were required to modify any implant;
4. No adverse events occur which are probably or definitely related to the implant.

The potential medical risks associated with implanation of the ProDisc-C are unknown, but would be expected to be included in the general risks of anterior interbody treatments of the cervical spine including the following :

* Injury to the nerves including the nerve roots and spinal cord resulting in pain, weakness or paralysis;
* Dysphagia, dysphasia, dysphonia, fistula formation, tracheal, oesophageal and pharynheal perforation, dural tears and leasking of spinal fluid;
* Instability of the spine;
* Failure to restore or maintain intervertebral disc height;
* Implant migration, subsidence, loosening, disassembly or breakage that would require revision;
* Wear debris generation either plastic or metal leading to an adverse reaction of the local tissues that may either lead to implant loosening or failure;
* Failure of the implant to maintain or improve range of motion;
* Chance that the surgery will not reduce the pain or disability felt before the surgery and, in fact, the pain or disability may be worse than before.

Adverse events will be collected from -
* Monitoring visits when trial subjects' medical records are reviewed; 
* Clinic assessments by the treating surgeon by reviewing X-rays and clinical diagnosis; 
* Direct report from trial subjects.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The PRODISC-C is intended to replace diseased and/or degenerated intervertebral discs of the cervical spine in patients with SCDD.  PRODISC-C is intended to significantly reduce pain by allowing for the removal of the diseased disc while restoring disc height and providing the potential for motion at the affected vertebral segment.   
The primary hypothesis of this study is that, in regard to key clinical outcomes, the PRODISC-C implant is not inferior (non-inferior) to ACDF surgery.</summary>
