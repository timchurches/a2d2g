    <interventions>This study is a pilot evaluation of an intensive parenting programme delivered to Maori and Pacific parents.  The programme (Hoki ki te Rito) is based on the methods from an established intervention called Mellow Parenting  (MP) which is a 14 week programme (1 day, 5 hours a week) designed to support families with relationship problems with their infants and young children. It combines personal support for parents with a video and direct work with parents and children on their own parenting problems. Overseas, it has proved effective in recruiting and engaging families with a variety of severe problems. It aims to improve maternal well being, parent-child interaction, child behaviour and child development. The programme has been developed by a team led by Christine Puckering in UK.</interventions>
    <comparator>We intend to run a two-stage evaluation. In the first phase, we will run a small open trial with up to 10 families. Formative feedback from this stage will be used to refine the programme and the delivery methods for phase 2. In the second phase, we will compare the programme against treatment as usual (a parenting course Whakatokia te Rongomau) with up to 20 families (10 per arm).Whakatokia te Rongomau is a routine care treatment provided by Ohomairangi for parents/whanau with parenting difficulties. This programme is has eight weekly session lasting two hours long. This programme has been developed in the mid 1990s and it consists of eight weekly sessions each lasting approximately two hours. It is a broad intervention and it has a focus on reducing family violence.</comparator>

    <summary>This study is a pilot evaluation of an intensive parenting programme delivered to Maori and Pacific parents residing in the Counties Manukau DHB.  The programme (Hoki ki te Rito) is based on the methods from an established intervention called Mellow Parenting  (MP) which is a 14 week programme (1 day, 5 hours a week) designed to support families with relationship problems with their infants and young children. It combines personal support for parents with a video and direct work with parents and children on their own parenting problems. Overseas, it has proved effective in recruiting and engaging families with a variety of severe problems. It aims to improve maternal well being, parent-child interaction, child behaviour and child development. The programme has been developed by a team led by Christine Puckering in UK.  In this study we aim to pilot a delivery of an intensive parenting programme based on the MP and adapted for Maori.  We intend to run a two-stage evaluation. In the first phase, we will run a small open trial with up to 10 families/whanau. Formative feedback from this stage will be used to refine the programme and the delivery methods for phase 2. In the second phase, we will compare the programme against treatment as usual (a parenting course Whakatokia te Rongomau) with up to 20 families (10 per arm).  The results of this pilot will be used to further refine the programme and methodology for a larger definitive efficacy trial.</summary>
