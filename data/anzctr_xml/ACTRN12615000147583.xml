    <concealment>Participants will be recruited by public notices and advertisements placed in community newspapers. Telephone screening will firstly identify participants within the required age ranges and exclude those likely to be experiencing exclusion factors (family history of diabetes and heart disease). Participants meeting this screening will be forwarded the Participant Information Sheet and Consent form. The participants will be invited to a face to face meeting with the researchers to ensure the Participant Information Sheet has been read and understood. If written consent is provided, a written general health questionnaire and baseline blood sample will be drawn to verify inclusion criteria by excluding diabetes and risk of heart disease. Participants meeting the inclusion requirement will be invited to undertake the study and a date provided for the first breakfast meal. Allocation will be concealed by use of sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ingestion of fat in a meal causes a short term increase in blood lipids (triacylglycerides, or TAG) which contributes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in part through a post-meal inflammatory response. Palm olein (PO), although high in saturated fat, does not cause a heightened TAG or inflammatory response. This is partly due to the chemical positioning of individual fatty acids in the meal fat, which affect the way the fat is broken down in the body. Interesterified palm olein (IPO) is PO where the position has been changed and is used in food manufacturing. Importantly, IPO does not increase post-meal TAG and inflammation as much as PO; however, the TAG and inflammatory effects of eating IPO on individuals at a higher risk of CVD, such as the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), are still unknown.

This study aims to analyse the post-meal TAG and inflammatory responses to PO, IPO, high oleic sunflower oil and lard in healthy middle aged men, and those with MetS. We hypothesise that the post-meal TAG and inflammatory response will be suppressed after IPO ingestion in all subjects, and that subjects with MetS will have a heightened response relative to healthy subjects.</summary>
