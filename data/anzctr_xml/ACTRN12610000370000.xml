  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Laser acupuncture to 4 acupoints found by double blind randomised controlled trial to be highly significant in the treatment of depression, and to a fifth acupoint KI3 added for anxiety management according to Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis or TCM diagnosis).
2. The acupoints are lasered in random order and the process repeated once so each acupoint is lasered twice in a single session.
3. The fibreoptic laser is a 804nm continuous beam laser, 25mW delivered over 20 seconds per block (0.5Joules).Total 35 minutes in the scanner, actual laser time being
4. Nine Rest blocks alternate with eight Active laser blocks. Blocks are 20 seconds duration.
5. Acupoints used were LR14, CV14, HT7 and LR8 from the randomised controlled trial amd KI3.
LR14 on right at 6th intercostal space, midclavicular line
CV14 in epigastrium about 10cm from the xiphisternum
HT7 is at left medial wrist
LR8 is at medial knee on Left between semimembranosis and semitendinosus muscles.
KI3 is at right medial knee.</interventions>

    <concealment>Recruitment was by online advertisement to personnel in the Prince of Wales and Sydney Childrens Hospital as well as the University of New South Wales. Flyers were made and distributed to general practices in the district. Those who fulfilled the MADRS score were then invited for a face to face interview to score on the HAM-D. Positive scores to both these were necessary for recruitment. All subjects received real laser in block design as described and the order of acupoints being lasered was randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>Acupoint randomisation was by draw lots. The 5 acupoints were written down on paper lots and placed in a box. Order of drawing was order of acupoint stimulation. The repeat acupoint stimulation was also similarly randomised.</sequence>
