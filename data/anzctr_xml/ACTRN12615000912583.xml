  <interventions>
    <interventions>Targeted delivery of radiotherapy (radionuclide therapy) with intravenous administration of Lutetium-177 radiolabelled to prostate specific membrane antigen (LuPSMA).
- administered activity of 4-8 GBq, dose adjusted according to tumour burden, patient weight and renal function. LuPSMA administered on day 1 of a 6 week cycle.
- post therapy imaging following each administration of LuPSMA with quantitative SPECT/CT with each cycle to determine radiation dose delivered to tumour and normal tissues
- further cycles (up to four) will be given if post-therapy imaging demonstrates sufficient uptake to indicate further benefit. Cycles will be separated by 6 weeks</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) labelled with a radioactive substance called Lutetium-177 (177Lu) in men with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy.

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you have metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma that has progressed despite hormone treatment and chemotherapy.

Study details: In this study, we will use a radioactive molecule (called Lutetium-177) that, after injection into vein, specifically attaches to cells with high PSMA Expression. This substance is taken up into prostate cancer cells, wherever they have spread (most often bones or lymph nodes) and enables targeted delivery of high doses of targeted radiation to sites of prostate cancer whilst sparing most normal tissues. This is called radionuclide therapy and uses radiation to kill prostate cancer cells. All participants who pass the screening visit selection will receive this therapy with up to 4 cycles separated by 6 weeks. 

You will not stay in hospital overnight but several scans will be performed requiring you to come back to the hospital for additional visits. From these scans, we will see where the radiation has gone and also quantify how much radiation was delivered to both tumours and normal tissues. Following treatment you will be mildly radioactive for a few days and there may be some restrictions on close personal contact including with pregnant women or children, but otherwise we anticipate that most patients feel will feel well and be allowed to go home the same day. Overall, participation will require you to visit the hospital approximately 14 times over around 18 months. 

The drug used in this study is not approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). This study will help inform the efficacy and side effects of LuPSMA in treating metastatic prostate cancer, and design of future larger studies assessing this therapy.</summary>
