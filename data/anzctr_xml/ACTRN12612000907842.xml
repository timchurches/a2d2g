  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single 60 minute intraduodenal infusion at 4mL/min of
i) 0 kcal/min (saline control)
ii) 1.5 kcal/min (Whey Protein Hydrolysate)
in 12 undernourished and 12 'healthy' older subjects

Appetite sensation questionnaires in the form of a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), blood samples.

A standard buffet meal will be provided at the end of the 60 minute infusion from which the volunteer has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions mayonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and a 14g milky way bar.

Each volunteer will receive one of each infusion solution over 2 study days. Study visits will be seperated by no less than 3 days.

Each study visit will last approximately 3-6 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Volunteers will act as their own control via administration of a single 0kcal/min intraduodenal infusion of saline solution, delivered at a rate of 4mL/min for 60 minutes, to enable comparison to nutrient containing infusion.

Undernourished older people will be compared to 'healthy' older people.</comparator>

    <concealment>Volunteers are asked to visit the clinic for a screening visit. A series of screening questionnaires are answered by the volunteer, and a blood sample is taken for determination of ferritin levels. Eligibility is determined based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A signed informed consent form is obtained and study dates are established. Eligible volunteers are assigned a subject number and randomised into a treatment for each study visit using a randomisation table created on an excel spreadsheet. Randomisation involves contacting the holder of the randomisation table (study assistant) to inform them of the subjects details and study dates. The unblinded study assistant is therefore responsible for allocating a random treatment to the subject and preparing the solution for infusion on each study day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ageing is associated with a physiological reduction of appetite and energy intake, which has been called the anorexia of ageing. Dietary supplementation with liquid protein preparations is now used frequently to increase energy and protein intake in older adults in both institutionalized and community-dwelling populations. Although the latter would appear a logical approach, evidence for success of increased energy intake in older individuals is limited. There is consensus that nutrient stimuli in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially in the small intestine, play a major role in the regulation of appetite and energy intake via modulation of GI motility and hormone release. Increasing our knowledge of how protein affects GI motility and hormone release is of increasing relevance in healthy and undernourished older individuals. In addition to the effects of healthy ageing, there is evidence of differences between undernourished and well-nourished older people, which may potentially result from being undernourished and/or contribute to the undernourished state. Urgent investigation is warranted to determine the effects of oral protein intake, so that protein can be incorporated into their diet to assist in sparing muscle mass without reducing their appetite.

The study aims to characterise in older individuals, the effect of undernutrition on energy intake, appetite, antropyloroduodenal motility, plasma concentrations of amino acids, hormones (i.e. CCK, PYY, ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and insulin) and glucose after intraduodenal protein infusion.</summary>
