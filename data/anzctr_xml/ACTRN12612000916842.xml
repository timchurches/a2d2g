  <interventions>
    <interventions>500mls ClinOleic 20% Intradialytic Parental Nutrition will be administered whilst each subject is undergoing routine thrice-weekly haemodialysis. The IDPN bag will be connected by a tube to the venous chamber of the dialysis machine and the IDPN solution will be infused over the 4 hour dialysis session. Patients will receive the IDPN infusion during each dialysis session (three times a week) for 12 weeks. Blood pressure, blood glucose and tryglceride levels will be monitored during the period of the intervention.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting blood samples will be taken to measure changes in appetite hormones such as acyl-ghrelin, leptin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK),  peptide YY (pYY), neuropeptide Y (NPY), adiponectin,  and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Blood samples will be centrigfuged to obtain plasma which will be stored at -80C for batch analysis. Acyl-ghrelin, GLP-1, CCK, pYY and IGF-1 will be analysed at established laboratories in Adelaide. ELISA kits will be used for NPY, leptin and adiponectin.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be screened to check they meet the inclusion criteria and then enrolled in study. Patients will be assigned a study number (sequentially) and allocated treatment according to the randomisation sequence generated.
The randomisation sequence will be concealed and the allocation of treatment will only be revealed once the study number has been allocated to the patient. In order to obtain the treatment allocation the study dietitian will contact the holder of the allocation schedule (off-site) via interstate phone call.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malnutrition is a critical issue affecting the quality of life of patients with end-stage kidney failure on dialysis, and is associated with chronic inflammation, adverse patient outcomes and increased death. Nutritional support is highly important in this patient group, but often oral supplements are insufficient to correct the malnourished state. Intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) is intravenous nutrition supplementation which is given during dialysis treatments. IDPN has had some promising effects on appetite, food intake, body weight and other markers of nutritional health, but needs to be studied more closely particularly before patients develop severe malnutrition. This multidisciplinary, collaborative project aims to compare IDPN versus standard dietetic input (control group) in malnourished dialysis patients, and look at the effect on a comprehensive range of key markers of nutrition and patient quality of life. We aim to address this important clinical problem, to obtain evidence for new therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes.</summary>
