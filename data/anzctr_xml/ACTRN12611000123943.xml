  <interventions>
    <interventions>SAN-300 is a humanized anti-VLA-1 MAb. Eight cohorts of healthy subjects, plus 1 cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, will receive single doses ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg, intravenously infused over 4 hours. Additionally, 3 Cohorts of healthy subjects will receive a single dose of SAN-300 by subcutaneous injection (an injection just beneath the skin). (The dose of SAN-300 in each Cohort is listed below: Cohort A (healthy subjects): 0.03 mg/kg Cohort B (healthy subjects): 0.1 mg/kg Cohort C (healthy subjects): 0.3 mg/kg Cohort D (healthy subjects): 1.0 mg/kg Cohort E (healthy subjects): 0.6 mg/kg Cohort F (healthy subjects): 0.8 mg/kg Cohort G (healthy subjects): 1.0 mg/kg Cohort H (healthy subjects): 2.0 mg/kg Cohort I (Rheumatoid Arthritis patients) 2.0 mg/kg. The subcutaneous cohorts are; Cohort J (healthy subjects): 2 mg/kg Cohort K (healthy subjects): 4 mg/kg Cohort L (healthy subjects): 6 mg/kg</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo for IV infusion is normal saline.
Placebo for subcutaneous (SC) injection is a histidine solution (pH 6) with a small amount of riboflavin for coloring so that it matches the drug product.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability after a single dose of SAN-300 through 1 month after dosing. 

Safety and tolerability will be assessed by serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, physical exam, vital signs, and electrocardiogram.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will receive the dose of study drug and remain in the clinic for 24 hours.  There are 5 follow up visits conducted over 1 month (Day 3, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 and Day 29).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Characterization of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after a single dose of SAN-300, through 1 month after dosing</outcome>

    <concealment>When it is determined that the subject is eligible for the study and meets all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be assigned to be enrolled in a sequential manner into one of the dosing groups. Sealed opaque envelopes will be used to conceal the treatment assignment. Within each dosing group, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either SAN-300 or placebo. Dosing groups A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K and L include the healthy subjects and dosing group I includes the patients with active rheumatoid arthritis.</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each dosing group, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either SAN-300 or placebo using a randomisation table created by computer software. In Cohorts A, B, E, F, G, H, J, K and L four subjects will receive SAN-300 and 2 will receive placebo. In Cohorts C and I, 6 subjects will receive SAN-300 and 2 will receive placebo. In Cohort D, 3 subjects will recieve SAN-300 and 1 will receive placebo.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study C2011-0301 is the first study in man for SAN-300. SAN-300 is being developed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. SAN-300 will be administered intravenously in 9 cohorts and subcutaneously in 3 cohorts. Approximately 66 healthy volunteers and approximately 8 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled to receive a single dose of SAN-300 or Placebo. Participation in the study is approximately 1 month, including dosing and follow-up visits. Subjects will receive the dose of study drug and remain in the clinic for 24 hours. There are 5 follow up visits conducted over 1 month.</summary>
