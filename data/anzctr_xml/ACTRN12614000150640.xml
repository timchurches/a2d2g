    <interventions>The intervention group will receive a skills-based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) self-help booklet and telephone support. The booklet is designed to help caregivers and significant others cope better with their situation through psycho-education and experiential exercises, and telephone support. The booklet will teach skills that enable participants to have a different relationship with their difficult thoughts and feelings so that they have less of a negative impact on the way they want to live their life and who they want to be. It will also guide participants to be clearer on their values and make a commitment to act in accordance with their values despite the difficulty they are experiencing. The booklet was developed based on a literature review and consultation with experts in psychology and palliative care. It has been reviewed by a consumer group of cancer caregivers. 

A researcher will call participants after 1 week of receiving the booklet to offer support for understanding the information and exercises. The researcher will ask participants if they did all, some or none of the reading and exercises, and if they have a question about the information or exercises. The researcher will respond with positive and encouraging feedback, and offer advice and instruction. If the caregiver or significant other becomes bereaved within 1 week of receiving the booklet, the researcher will wait at least 2 weeks before calling. This time period was recommended by site staff and is reflective of their current practice with bereavement follow-up support.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group receives treatment as usual in the form of psychosocial support by social workers at the participating site hospital. The social work team is comprised of one full-time inpatient worker and two part-time workers in the community. Social work is offered to all patients and their family and friends, and includes psychoeducation, counselling, and practical assistance with broader social issues such as finances. As per the standards of Palliative Care Australia a bereavement service is provided, which involves an information pack to all palliative clients families and a follow-up phone call. Bereavement counselling is also available for those who seek it and an annual Memorial Service is facilitated by the social workers.</comparator>

    <concealment>Research and clinical staff at participating sites introduce the study and provide a study brochure to potentially eligible caregivers during their routine rounds. If a caregiver is not present with the patient, recruiting staff ask patients if they would like to nominate their caregiver to receive more information about the study. Recruiting staff always ask patients and caregivers to nominate any significant other(s) who they believe might be willing to receive more information about the study. Results of recruitment discussions (i.e. accept or decline to receive more information about the study and nominations) are recorded on a recruitment form to be emailed to the research team. 

The research team post nominated caregivers and significant others a recruitment package containing a letter from the managing director of the service and a study brochure. The letter describes how their name was obtained, the identity of the researchers, and an outline of the aims and procedures. The letter also informs caregivers and significant others that should they wish to participate they can contact the research team using the details provided. 

A researcher attends the inpatient unit once to twice a week to explain further about the study and answer any questions to potential participants who have expressed interest. The researcher then provides caregivers and significant others with a pre-randomised study package containing a participant information sheet and consent form, baseline questionnaire, reply paid envelope and, for intervention participants, the booklet. Potential participants absent from the inpatient unit are posted the study package.

Randomisation will be performed by an individual blinded to the identity of participants, using computer-generated random numbers. Randomisation will be stratified by social network such that caregivers and significant others from the same social network will be allocated to the same group. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome is acceptance scores between the caregiver treatment and control groups as measured by the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire - II at 1 month post-bereavement. Assuming a significance level of .05, 176 participants per condition gives an 80% chance of detecting a small effect size of 0.3. To account for caregiver drop out of 30% as seen in similar studies, we inflate this to 230.

The inpatient unit at Port Kembla Hospital contains 15 beds and has an average turnover of 2 weeks, and therefore approximately 390 patients in 12 months. At any one time, approximately 75% of patients are too unwell or cognitively impaired to be eligible for participation, which suggests a potentially eligible population of 98 in 12 months. Previous cross-sectional survey studies inclusive of an inpatient population show response rates of at least 50%.  There are approximately 5 palliative patients moving through Wollongong Hospital every week and hence approximately 200 patients over a 10-month data collection period. If we estimate a response rate of 40% it is feasible to achieve a sample size of 80 patients over a 24-month data collection period at Port Kembla Hospital and 20 patients over a 10-month data collection period at Wollongong Hospital.  

Similar intervention or longitudinal studies with caregivers indicate that a 70% response rate is a reasonable expectation. No previous quantitative studies in palliative care have purposefully recruited significant others and we therefore cannot make an informed estimate of their response rate. However, assuming each patient has at least one significant other, we anticipate an equivalent response rate to caregivers.  Therefore, since caregiver and significant other participation is independent of patient participation, it is feasible to achieve a sample size of 340 caregivers and 340 significant others over a 15-month data collection period at Port Kembla Hospital and 120 caregivers and 120 significant others over a 6-month data collection period at Wollongong Hospital. 

ANALYSIS
Descriptive statistics and graphic representations will be used to summarize participants demographic details and scores on the outcome and process variables. Tests will be two-tailed. The experiment wise error rate for contrast analyses will be controlled using the Bonferroni procedure, with the resulting significance value set at a=0.025. For all other analyses, statistical significance will be set at a=0.05.

Exploratory hierarchical multiple regressions analyses (MRA) will be conducted separately on preintervention data for acceptance and valued-living as independent variables on levels of depression, grief, death attitudes and communication as dependent variables; adjusted for age, gender and disease. Planned contrast analysis to test differences between caregivers and significant others will be [1 -1]. 

Hierarchical MRA will be the primary analytic method used to investigate the efficacy of the intervention on levels of acceptance and valued-living. The predictor variables will be: demographics (age, gender and disease), condition (intervention vs control), time (baseline vs 1 month follow-up vs 6 month postbereavement follow-up). Condition and time will be dummy coded. Hierarchical MRA with follow-up simple slope analyses will also be used to investigate the efficacy of the intervention on levels of depression and grief. In particular, the effect of condition across assessment points as a function of levels of acceptance and valued-living will be explored. The predictor variables will be: demographics (age, gender and disease), condition (intervention vs control), time (baseline vs 1 month follow-up vs 6 month postbereavement follow-up), acceptance, valued-living, and four interaction terms between the condition comparison and acceptance or valued-living variables. Condition and time will be dummy coded, and acceptance and valued-living will be mean-corrected. Mediation of the intervention effects by acceptance and valued-living will be tested by bootstrapping analysis.

The MRAs will be conducted using both intent-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The intent-to-treat analysis will give an unbiased estimate of treatment effect resulting from removal of noncompliants and dropouts, whereas the per-protocol analysis will give a less diluted estimate of intervention effects. In the per-protocol analysis intervention participants will be excluded if they had not completed at least 75% of the booklet.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND
A significant proportion of caregivers of palliative care patients experience severe psychological distress and complicated grief. Little is known on the psychological impact of a patients death and dying among significant others who may not be recognised as the primary caregiver but nonetheless share a close relationship. However, research has shown that caregivers and significant others indicate a similar need for support. 

In this project, we will evaluate an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy based intervention for caregivers and significant others. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy that encourages individuals to accept unwanted private experiences (e.g. thoughts, feelings) that are out of their personal control and engage in values-guided action that gives meaning to their lives.  The intervention is a guided self-help program consisting of an ACT booklet and telephone support by a counsellor.

AIMS
To measure the efficacy of the ACT self-help program at postintervention in improving:
1. acceptance and valued-living
2. depression and grief 

METHODS
This project is a two-arm randomised controlled trial: participants are randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. The control group will receive treatment as usual from the palliative care service in the form of psychosocial support from social workers. The intervention group will receive the ACT booklet and telephone support. The booklet will guide caregivers and significant others to manage difficult thoughts and feelings and engage in valued activities (i.e. things they care about that give them meaning and fulfilment). The telephone support comprises a phone call after 1 week of receiving the booklet to address questions about the self-help booklet. Participants complete three questionnaires: preintervention, 1-month postintervention, and 6 months postbereavement. The questionnaires ask about feelings; values in life; attitudes towards life, death and dying; and communication with the patient.

    <publicnotes>Although the main focus of this project is the RCT for caregivers and significant others of palliative care patients, we are also administering a cross-sectional questionnaire to patients.  The patient questionnaire assesses the same outcomes as the caregiver and significant other questionnaire and is administered at the pretreatment time point. The purpose of this cross-sectional patient component is to examine the transference or interconnectedness of outcomes among the social network of patient, caregiver and significant other(s). Patient participation is not necessary for caregivers and significant others to take part.

Funding from the Illawarra Cancer Carers groups is a small grant to cover the costs of design and printing for the intervention booklet only.</publicnotes>
