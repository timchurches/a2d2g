  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acute postprandial effects of two meals of different GI content will be tested against a control meal on a range of metabolic and vascular parameters. Participants will be required to consume three different meals, one meal per visit served in random order, with a minimum one week washout between each visit. The two meals will be 1) a low GI meal, containing 14g of protein with a GI index of 45, and 2) moderately-high protein, containing 23g of protein with a GI index of 45.</interventions>
    <comparator>A high GI content meal, containing 15g of protein with a GI index of 76, serves as the control. This meal is randomly allocated to one of the three visits, with a one week washout period seperating the three visits.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With the increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, people are routinely advised to reduce the intake of sugars (high glycemic index foods) and increase the intake of whole grains and fibre rich (low glycemic index) foods. It has been suggested that consumption of whole grains and fibre rich foods leads to an improved blood glucose and triglyceride (blood fat or lipid) status, which may reduce the risk of diabetes and heart disease. On the other hand, some research suggests that increased intake of protein may be a better option than carbohydrate and fibre rich whole grains.

The study aims to investigate and compare the effects of three different meals, providing different amounts of GI content or protein, on post-meal glucose, insulin, triglycerides, brachial and central blood pressure and platelet aggregation.</summary>
