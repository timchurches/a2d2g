    <concealment>Patients will be randomised in the operating room.  The anaesthetist will be given the randomisation envelope.  This will describe whether the patient receives local anaesthetic or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride) into the pre-peritoneal space. He/she will check the vial of either marcain 0.25% with adrenaline or 0.9% sodium chloride (name and appearance of the randomised solution, volume to be administered and the expiry date) with the circulating nurse.  The circulating nurse will give the solution to the scrub nurse to draw up.  This will occur while the surgeon is scrubbing his hands in the scrub bay (not in the operating room) prior to the start of the operation.  The surgeon will be able to administer the local or placebo after verifying that it has been checked by the anaesthetist and the circulating nurse.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this study are to assess post operative pain and other surgical complications on elective laparoscopic hernia repair patients following the injection of local anaesthetic into the pre-peritoneal space.

This study will enrol patients aged 18  80 years of age who are suitable for day surgical repair of their hernias at Waitemata District Health Board and Waitemata Specialist Centre (surgery at Southern Cross Hospital North Harbour).

Participants will be randomised to receive 20mls of local anaesthetic or 20mls of normal saline injected into the pre-peritoneal space.  They will be followed up by phone at 2 hours after surgery, 1, 7 and 14 days after surgery.  They will be seen in the outpatients clinic at 6 weeks after the operation.</summary>
