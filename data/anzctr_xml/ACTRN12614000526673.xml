    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This study was powered to show a 10% difference in appendicular muscle mass on DEXA scan between active and placebo.  The dropout rate was estimated to be 30%, and power calculations taking this into account suggested that 88 participants would be required.

We aim to recruit 100 participants to allow for the possibility of a higher dropout rate given an extremely unwell, and often liver transplant waitlisted population</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BRIEF BACKGROUND SUMMARY
1. Low serum testosterone levels are common in men with advanced liver disease
2. Symptoms and signs of testosterone deficiency are common in men with advanced liver disease
3. Low testosterone levels correlate with increased mortality in men with advanced liver disease
HYPOTHESES
1. Testosterone therapy is not associated with significant adverse outcome in men with advanced liver disease
2. Testosterone treatment will increase muscle mass and bone mineral density in men with advanced liver disease
SPECIFIC AIMS
To conduct a single centre randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of 12 months of testosterone therapy in men with advanced liver disease and low serum testosterone</summary>
