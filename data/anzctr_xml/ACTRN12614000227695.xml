  <interventions>
    <interventions>This pilot study will examine the ease of application of the product, the substantivity of the active manuka honey agent within the periodontal pocket, and the release profile of the proposed Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) agent during a 7-day pharmacokinetic study. Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) Honey will be applied below the gum around teeth with periodontitis, in combination with scaling and root planing (SRP). Each participant will receive full mouth SRP under local anaesthetic in two treatment sessions of one hour per session, over a 24-hour period. 0.05ml of Manuka honey will be delivered using a blunt cannula into the test site immediately after SRP, where possible after the first treatment session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Scaling and rootplaning alone: each participant will receive full mouth SRP under local anaesthetic in two treatment sessions of one hour per session, over a 24-hour period. Control sites receive no additional treatment.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be taken from the periodontal pockets using PerioPaper strips.  The presence and activity of methylglyoxal in GCF will be quantified by using the neutralization assay of Kwakman et al. (2011). The strips will be stored at -80 degrees C until assayed, then thawed and centrifuged derivatized for 30 min at room temperature with o-phenylene-diamine to give 2-methylquinoxaline, according to the method of Chaplen et al. (1998). Derivatized samples will be partially purified by solid-phase extraction and subjected to reverse phase chromatography in an HPLC system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to SRP) and 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subgingival bacterial plaque samples will be taken from the periodontal pockets using a sterile curette. Subgingival plaque samples will be transferred without delay to labeled sterile transport tubes containing phosphate-buffered saline and frozen at-80 degrees C until analysis. A multiplex qRT-PCR assay will be used for the detection and quantification of seven microbial pathogenic species: A actinomycetemcomitans, P gingivalis, P intermedia, T forsythia, F nucleatum, T denticola and S aureus. Species-specific PCR primers and TaqMan probes will be designed and synthesised as described by Suzuki et al (2004). The microbial species will be quantified using the cycle threshold (^^Ct) method as described by Joyce (2002). Oral samples will be treated with InstaGene Matrix (Bio Rad) and small aliquots (in duplicate) will be subjected to TaqMan-based mqRT-PCR using the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time qPCR System.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (prior to SRP) and 1, 3, 5 and 7 days after therapy</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical indices consisting of Plaque Index (PI), Pocket Depth (PD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) and Bleeding on Probing (BOP) parameters will be recorded at all time intervals at both sites using a periodontal probe with Williams markings and 20g force.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The unique antimicrobial properties of honey are well recognized. Although many honeys display antibacterial effects, the active ingredient thought to be responsible for the unique and superior antibacterial properties of honey obtained from the manuka shrub is methylglyoxal, measured by a Unique Manuka Factor (UMF registered trademark) rating. In recent years local delivery systems containing antibiotics have been introduced as an adjunctive therapy to traditional treatment of periodontal (gum) disease to optimize healing. However, use of a natural product utilising the superior therapeutic potential of our own readily-available New Zealand manuka honey in the treatment of periodontitis may show significant potential. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of manuka honey delivered into the periodontal pocket following scaling and root planing (SRP+UMF), with scaling and root planing alone (SRP). This study is the pilot trial to test the ease of application of the honey and its ability to stay in the pocket. The second phase for which a separate registrations has been made, will recruit 60 patients who fit the inclusion criteria from a private specialist periodontal practice and a single-blind, split-mouth, randomised clinical trial design methodology will be followed. Clinical measurements and microbiological analysis of plaque samples will be analysed for 6 months post-treatment.</summary>
