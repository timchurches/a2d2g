  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total of 335 healthy, 25-64 years old women, were randomized into control and intervention groups.                                                                                                                                                                The intervention group completed an 8 week lifestyle modification program for increasing their physical activity, based on a revised form of  Choose to Move program;                                                                                     an American Heart Association Physical Activity Program for Women. Audio-taped activity instructions with music and practical usage of the educational package (4 booklets and weekly newsletters) were given to the intervention group in weekly home-visits by 53 volunteers from local non-governmental and community-based organizations.</interventions>
