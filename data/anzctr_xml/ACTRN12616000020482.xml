Participants fill out a sleep log (taking less than 5 minutes per day) each day, and wear an actigraphy recording device (watch-like device) on their wrist for the whole monitoring period (except when swimming/showering).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep and circadian disturbances are intricately linked to the onset, co-morbidity and chronicity of various mental disorders. For instance, shortened or extended sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation and delayed and disorganized sleep-wake schedules have been observed in young people with a range of affective and psychotic disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that changes in sleep and circadian rhythms may modulate the trajectory of mental disorders and treatment outcomes, but little is currently known about sleep and circadian rhythms during critical mental illness episodes leading to hospitalization and how this may relate to the recovery process. The current observational study will use novel ambulatory devices to monitor sleep, general activity levels, body
temperature and ambient light exposure across multiple days in inpatients admitted to a young adult mental health service. Potential associations between sleep-wake and circadian parameters and changes in self-reported clinical symptoms measured across the course of hospitalization will also be investigated. This study has the potential to deepen our understanding of sleep and circadian disturbances in acute phases of mental disorders and how they relate to the recovery process. </summary>
