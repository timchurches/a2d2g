The CBT intervention includes information about bipolar disorder along with interactive skills and strategies designed to help manage the disorder, including (but not limted to ) mood monitoring, activity scheduling, goal setting and problem solving.                                                                                                                                                                                      </interventions>
    <comparator>The information control group will have access only to information on bipolar disorder. Participants progress through the web site models in a set sequence, with 2 weeks allowed for each module.  Participants acess of modules is recorded automatically, noting the specific module and duration of time spent. If a participant has not loged onto the program for 4 days a reminder email is sent.  Participants will have access to the website for 12 months.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of on an on-line web based intervention for bipolar disorder.  The intervention utilises techniques and strategies found to be successful in previous psychosocial interventions conducted in face-to-face groups.  The study also uses the experience of similar online studies in the area of unipolar depression and anxiety.The intervention comprises a number of modules including an introduction to the project, understanding bipolar disorder, stress and triggers of illness, medication management, managing and monitoring prodromes of depression, mania and hypomania and relapse prevention plans.  The modules contain psycho-education along with specific strategies for participants to utilize in the management of the illness.  The intervention also contains a moderated discussion board to develop a sense of support between participants and reduce feelings of stigma and isolation.  The active intervention group described will be compared to an online information only group with moderated discussion.</summary>
