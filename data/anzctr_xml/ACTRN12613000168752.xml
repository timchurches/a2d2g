  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cosmetic outcome. 
Assessed using the previously validated Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS). Lacerations will be assigned a 1 to 10 point in each criterion. Investigators will use the observer section to assess the vascularity, pigmentation, relief, pliability, surface area and overall opinion of the scar using this scale. Parents and adolescents (age, &gt;15 years) will be asked a series of seven questions using this scale and consideration of using the specific suture technique in the future. The presence of a keloid scar and the width of the scar will also be measured to the nearest millimetre in its widest dimension will also be noted.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound infection.
During the follow-up visit, the wound will be evaluated for the presence of wound infection which is defined as one that requires systemic antibiotics as determined by the treating clinician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single time point, a follow-up visit within 5 to 8 days after the procedure.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound dehiscence.
During the follow-up visit, the wound will be evaluated for the presence of wound dehiscence which is defined present if the wound edges are not coapted and require the placement of additional sutures or tissue adhesives.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Single time point, a follow-up visit within 5 to 8 days after the procedure.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skin cuts are common injuries sustained by children. There are two main to stitch cuts. The first method is to use stiches on the outside of the skin and the other method is to use a deeper stitch that would not be able to be seen on the skin surface. The purpose of this project is to study whether one of these two methods of stitching results in better healings of cuts.
 
We do not know whether one method of closing facial skin cuts is better than the other. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Stitches under the skin (or buried stitches) provide good support for facial wound closure while stiches on the skin (external stitches) have a lower risk of complications but may result in a more visible scar.  Previous research studies on adults have found that the both buried and external stiches have healed in a similar fashion
