  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a randomised cross-over design, participants will either be inactive or complete sixty minutes of moderate intensity exercise (treadmill walking at 60% of peak oxygen uptake) in the late afternoon (4 - 5 pm) prior to the ingestion of a standardised high-fat breakfast and lunch.

The breakfast provides 1.5 g fat (60% Energy), 1.8 g carbohydrate (33%), 0.4 g protein (7%) and 92.9 kJ per kilogram body mass.  The lunch provides 1.1 g fat (50%), 1.9 g carbohydrate (37%), 0.6 g protein (13%) and 84.6 kJ per kilogram of body mass.  Breakfast is consumed between 08:30 - 09:30 and lunch 3.5 hours later between 12:00 - 13:00.

Each trial will be separated by a period of seven days.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: The ingestion of high-fat meals impairs endothelial function in adults and this impairment is attenuated by exercise. The response of young people to these nutritional and physiological stressors has not been established.

Objectives:  To investigate if endothelial function is  impaired following the ingestion of a high-fat breakfast and lunch in adolescent boys, and if a bout of moderate-intensity exercise could attenuate any impairment if present.</summary>
