    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometric measures:
Height (nearest 0.1cm)  measured in duplicate without shoes using a stadiometer (Seca limited, Germany).
Weight, body water mass, and body fat mass measured using an electronic bio-impedance scale (Soehnle-Waagen GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany) with footwear and heavy clothing removed.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated as [average weight (kg)/ average height (m2)].
Waist and hip circumference were measured in duplicate to the nearest 0.1cm using a non-expandable tape measure at the superior border of the iliac crest (Ross et al., 2008) and the greatest gluteal protuberance (Lohman, Martorell, &amp; Roche, 1988), respectively, over one layer of clothing.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting blood lipids and glucose, assessed using a 35 microliter whole-blood sample via finger stick and a Cholestech LDX Analyser (Hayward, CA) following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-report measures: general demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, educational attainment, employment history, smoking history and medical history), general health (fatigue, eye strain, headaches, digestion and sleep problems, musculoskeletal health), dietary intake, and work-related (self-rated work performance, absenteeism and presenteeism) user perception, participant feedback, and adverse events were collected via self-report in an online questionnaire.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research over the last decade has shown that less sitting throughout the day is associated with a decreased risk of many chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. While at work, office workers report high levels of sitting time, mostly due to the nature of their computer and desk based jobs. Height-adjustable workstations may provide a means of reducing sitting time at work. However, the most effective way to introduce such workstations to organisations is yet to be established. That is, whether the installation of height-adjustable workstations alone is sufficient to reduce sitting time in office workers, or whether additional aspects of the workplace (including indiviudual staff and managers, organisational social norms etc) need to be targeted as well. The objective of the Stand Up UQ  study was thus to evaluate (in a three-arm study) whether a multifaceted intervention involving height-adjustable desks and organisational and individual behavioral change elements leads to greater reductions in objectively measured workplace sitting when compared to the use of height-adjustable workstations alone (and in comparison to a control group).</summary>
