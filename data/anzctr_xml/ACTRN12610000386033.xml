  <interventions>
    <interventions>* healthy.me is an online system developed at the Centre for Health Informatics,University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. It contains information about influenza vaccination; an online tool for consumers to book an appointment at the University Health Service for influenza vaccination; and an online personal health record for participants to record their appointments, medications and other health-related information.

* All participants are required to complete a 5-minute mandatory online tutorial about the healthy.me system before commencing the study.  

* Duration of study is expected to be 6 months. Period of access to the website will vary depending on date of participant enrollment.</interventions>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>* The intervention will not modify in any way the standard procedures of healthcare provision by the University Health Service
* Interested healthcare consumers are directed to a website with detailed information about the study, where they can provide consent and self-enrol into the study online.
* Allocation to control or intervention group will be concealed according to a computer generated block randomization list. (Investigators will be blinded in the group allocation process).
* The randomization sequence generation, participant recruitment and the group allocation processes in this study are computerised and do not involve human interventions from the investigators.</concealment>
    <sequence>* Eligible healthcare consumers are randomly assigned to the intervention or control group using a computer generated random number sequence in randomly assigned blocks with intervention allocation ratio of 1:1. 
* The block randomisation sequence is pre-generated using a computerized random-number generator before commencing participant recruitment.  
* For each level of strata, a random sequence of study group allocations is generated and each level of strata is numbered consecutively. 
* As each consumer completes the online study enrolment process, he/she receives the next consecutive number in his or her stratum, which automatically assigns the consumer to the intervention or control group without additional intervention from the investigators.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to assess the effectiveness of an online system designed for healthcare consumers, called healthy.me, to support healthcare management. healthy.me provides consumers condition specific information, as well as online tools to manage their care including a personal health record. We hypothesise that use of healthy.me will improve the  uptake of preventative activities and this randomized controlled trial will specifically test whether system use is associated with an increased rate of influenza vaccination among university students and staff over the respiratory infections season.</summary>
