    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Balloon Kyphoplasty
Other interventions - Non Surgical Management

Experimental: Balloon Kyphoplasty (BKP) - The subjects assigned to this group will undergo the treatment with Balloon kyphoplasty for their painful VCFs.

Active Comparator: Non Surgical Management - The subjects in this group will undergo the non-operative treatments aimed at alleviation of back pain and restoration of decreased function associated with VCFs.


Treatment: devices: Balloon Kyphoplasty
Ballon Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive technique aimed at reduction of VCFs using KyphX® Inflatable Bone Tamps followed by fracture fixation with KyphX® HV-R Bone Cement.

Other interventions: Non Surgical Management
Non-surgical treatment includes, but is not limited to, the following: back brace, pain medication, physical therapy, walking aids, bed rest, and radiation treatment.
