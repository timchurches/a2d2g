    <interventions>Response guided duration of therapy:
Dual treatment with weight based Gratisovir (Sofosbuvir) + weight based Daclatasvir for doses according to the following table:
* Gratisovir (Sofosbuvir) 400mg / 200 mg tablets on daily doses based on body weight (20  29.9 Kg will take one 200 mg tablet daily); (30  39.9 Kg will take 1.5 tablets daily); (&gt; 40 Kg/adults will take 2 tablets (or 1 table of 400 mg) once daily) 
* + Daclatasvir 60 mg/30 mg tablets on daily doses based on body weight or according to the following schedule: 
	(20  30 Kg: will take 30 mg once daily),
	(31  45 Kg: 45 mg once daily)
	 (&gt; 45 Kg/adults: 60 mg once daily)

And for a duration tailored according to the very rapid virological response (vRVR) for each patient::
* Those who will show very show rapid virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at week 2) will be treated with 8 weeks duration. 

* Rest will complete the 12 weeks duration.

Adherence to the study protocol and medications will be monitored at each visit by counting the number of pills (if any) remained in the medication packets.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the trial is non-inferiority in mean differences in the proportion of patients achieving SVR12 (HCV RNA below the lower level of quantification (LLOQ) between the 2 groups.
The response tailored duration (test group) versus the recommended fixed 12 weeks duration (reference group). 
The comparison was based on testing the null hypothesis of inferiority of the test group with a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority (NI-margin) of 0.1.

SVR12 Rate is defined as Sustained virologic response rate at 12 weeks after end of treatment.. This will be  estimated as rate and percentage of patients who will have serum negativity for hepatitis c virus RNA (virus load below level of quantification) by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, at the end of 12 weeks after completion of therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Twelve weeks after end of the treatment course of either 8 or 12 weeks duration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>rate of suspected unexpected serious and non serious adverse events such as headache, abdominal pain, fatigue that are known to occur with such drug therapy or any other unknown or unexpected drug reactions or hypersensitivity reactions, This will be assessed by asking the patients to report immediately to his treating doctor any adverse event during treatment and also during weekly visits by verbal questionnaire, physical examination and laboratory investigations including complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, abdominal ultrasonographic examination   </outcome>

    <summary>Efficacy and Safety of Gratisovir (Sofosbuvir) - Daclatasvir Dual Therapy in Egyptian adult and Pediatric Patients with Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.
A prospective, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority, multi-center Study

Objectives:
1.	To evaluate the efficacy of Gratisovir (Sofosbuvir) - Daclatasvir dual combination therapy, in Egyptian adult and Pediatric age group patients with chronic hepatitis C. 
2.	To compare the standard fixed 12 weeks duration of dual SOF/DAC versus a response guided duration of 8/12 in patients with vRVR. 
3.	To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sofosbuvir based combination therapy, in Egyptian adult and Pediatric age group patients with chronic hepatitis C
4..	To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the very-rapid virologic response as an on-treatment predictor for SVR12.
A randomized, open label, non-inferiority, study designed to test efficacy (SVR12) of the combined Sofosbuvir and Daclatasvir and to compare a suggested response guided shortened duration of 8 weeks of therapy versus the recommended 12 weeks duration.
Eligible adults and children above 10 years old patients with chronic hepatitis c infection will be included and randomized into 2 groups, group 1 will be treated for a fixed 12 weeks duration of dual therapy and group 2 will be treated according to their virologic response  at week 2 for either 8 weeks (for those who will have vRVR) or 12 weeks for the rest.
Data will be compared between the 2 groups and the 2 studied durations.
