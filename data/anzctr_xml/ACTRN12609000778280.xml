  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm One: N95 respirator
Respirators are personal protective fitted devices that cover the nose and mouths and operate by purifying the air inhaled by the wearer through filtering materials.
In this trial, participants will be asked to wear the respirator continuously on every shift (around 8 hours) over the four week period. They are to remove the respirator when: they exit the department/ward or when they enter the tea room for a break.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: Surgical masks-are loose-fitting facial coverings that are designed to prevent wound contamination in the patient from the cough or exhaled secretions of the physician, nurse or other healthcare worker. In this trial, participants will be asked to wear the surgical mask continuously on every shift (around 8 hours) over the four week period. They are to remove the mask when: they exit the department/ward or when they enter the tea room for a break. 
Arm 3: N95 respirator-Participants in this arm will be asked to wear a respirator only when they are involved with a high risk procedure (HRP) (aerosol generating) or when they are caring for a patient with influenza-like-illness (ILI). They will be asked to remove the respirator when they have completed the HRP or when they have finished caring for the patient with ILI.</comparator>

      <timepoint>We will monitor individual participant adherence with mask or respirator use over the four week time course by: (1) Observation: the head ward nurse will observe compliance on the ward on a daily basis and record the information on a structured form, (2) Self report: a diary card with tick boxes will be given to each subject, which they will carry with them during the day. Adherence to wearing the masks or respirators will be monitored by these diary cards and returned to researchers on a weekly basis. Exit interviews with participants will be conducted after the four weeks to gain further insights into adherence and other issues around the use of masks/respirators including adverse effects.</timepoint>

      <outcome>The following measure will be used to measure compliance and infection control:
Self report: a diary card with tick boxes for the respirator/mask use will be given to each subject, which they will carry with them during the day. They will tick the responses after each shift. Adherence to wearing the respirator/mask will be monitored by these diary cards that will be returned to researchers on a weekly basis. Time from enrolment to onset of illness will be measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete their diary card on a daily basis. A member of the research team will assess these cards on a weekly basis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following measure will be used to measure compliance and infection control:
Exit interviews with participants will be conducted after the four weeks to gain further insights into adherence and other issues around the use of respirators/masks including adverse effects.  We will specifically ask about pain, discomfort, skin necrosis, difficulty breathing, headaches, adherence to infection control protocol associated with respirator/mask use (hand hygiene, face touching etc) and perceptions about patient communication issues associated with respirator/mask wearing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interviews with participants will be completed at the end of the four weeks.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A prospective, three-armed cluster randomized trial of respirator/mask use in frontline health care workers (HCWs) to determine the efficacy of two different kinds of respirators/face masks (N95s, and surgical masks) during the influenza season on the transmission of pandemic H1N1 09, seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses. Other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinoviruses etc are also associated with outbreaks of acute respiratory disease. 
Health care workers (HCWs) from the emergency departments, respiratory wards and infectious disease wards of major hospitals in Beijing, China will be recruited. These wards are selected because they are a setting in which repeated and multiple exposures to viral respiratory infections are present for staff. Hospitals will be allocated to one of the three study arms. 

Participants will be provided with one of two types of masks/respirators (depending on the arm to which the hospital they work in has been randomised) to be worn for four weeks when working on the ward. All participants will be followed up for five weeks (the four weeks of wearing the masks and an extra week of non-mask wearing)</summary>
