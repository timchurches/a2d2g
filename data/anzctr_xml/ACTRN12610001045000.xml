  <interventions>
    <interventions>The components of AA4500 are: mixed collagenase AUX I and AUX II, sucrose. The components of the sterile diluent are: 0.03% calcium chloride in 0.9% sodium chloride. Each dose of AA4500 is 0.58mg. The Drug is injected directly into the cord using a 27 gauge (13mm) needle. This is a single dose drug.</interventions>
