  <interventions>
    <interventions>The patient was advised to undertake a 10 week expiratory muscles training program with Threshold Positive expiratory preassure (Treshold PEP), which he was taught by a physiotherapist in the hospital and with which he continued at home. The Treshold PEP is a small respiratory device to which the patient breathes against resistance and strenghtens his expiratory muscles. This device is advised to be used half an hour every day for the duration of 10 weeks. Every patient recieves a plan based on their initial examination results. All patients, who refused expiratory muscle training were, with approval, included in the control group - it is consecutive group of patients.
These patients went through identical initial and leaving examinations: anamnesis, clinical examination, spirometry, plethysmography, blood gas levels were determined and the patients also completed the modified Medical Research Council dyspnea questionnaires. A six-minute walk test (6-MWT) was performed with patients, also, the chest parameters in the mesosternale and xiphosternale level were measured.</interventions>
    <comparator>All of this information was collected during July 2017 - September 2017. The control group is without any expiratory muscle training - the do not use the treshold PEP, but after the 10 weeks, they are evaluated with the use of the same methods (spirometry, bodyplethismography) as the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in subjective perception of dyspnoea scale (mMRC scale), assessed by a 4 point numerical rating scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This study is starting on July 10 2017 and last until September 24 2017. On the July 10 the patients start to use the Treshold PEP and they stop using it after 10 weeks, which is September 24. Change of dyspnea on the modified medical research council dyspnea scale (mMRC scale) is assessed in each participant in the beginning of this study and at 10 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in maximal expiratory preassure, assessed by body plethysmograhy. </outcome>
      <timepoint>In the beginning of this study, every patient undergoes a series of tests. Based on the results, every patient gets an individual plan of the use of the PEP device. After the 10 week training the use of PEP is done and the patient takes the same tests as on the start.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in chest expansion in cm, assessed by meter.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the beginning of this study, every patient undergoes a series of tests. Based on the results, every patient gets an individual plan of the use of the PEP device. After the 10 week training the use of PEP is done and the patient takes the same tests as on the start.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in quality of life, assessed using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>After the 10 week programme, the patient answeres a questionare, where he states the change.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) suffer from low exercise tolerance, dyspnea and increased fatigue. The quality of life is very low because of the symptoms accompanying the CHF. The methodology of respiration therapy by means of any expiratory aids in patients with CHF has not yet been described in foreign countries. The expiratory muscle training with the treshold PEP device at home will lead to the improvement of the quality of life.
The main intention of this study is to find a way how to effectively, cheaply and easily minimize the consecuences of heart failure.</summary>
