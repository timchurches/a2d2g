    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Challenge proven food allergy. Children in the HealthNuts cohort were enrolled at immunisation contacts at 1 year of age and invited to undergo skin prick testing. Those with a positive skin prick test were invited to undergo oral food challenge. Hence children who were sensitised to a particular allergen were tested with the gold standard oral food challenge soon after turning one year of age. A description of the formal food challenges and assessment of outcomes has been described (Osbourne et al. 2010 Clinical &amp; Experimental Allergy, 40, 15161522)</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Timing of pertussis-containing vaccinations
The primary analysis will be based on timing of the first aP-containing vaccination. First, the association between administration of the first aP and challenge proven food allergy will compared using a multiple logistic regression model. Delay in the first dose of aP will be modeled as a continuous variable, and any association will be assessed for linearity. Further analyses will be performed comparing children vaccinated early versus late according if a threshold can be determined. It is expected that children vaccinated &gt;2 weeks late (ie &gt;10 weeks of age) will be compared to those vaccinated &lt;2 weeks late, as this is the threshold previously used by us to explore association between vaccination timing at atopic sensitisation (Kiraly et al. 2013 Allergy; 68: 11681176.) Adjustment for potential confounders will be performed by including background variables in the model if they alter the association between aP and food allergy by &gt;=10%. A minimum number of potential confounders will be included in the model based on prior data; these are parental income (stratified into 5 groups), number of courses of antibiotics (0, 1-3, &gt;=4), day-care attendance (yes/no), number of older siblings (0, 1, &gt;=2), country of birth of the childs parents (Australia/overseas), presence of smokers at the home (yes/no). Receipt and timing of other vaccines will also be included if they confound the result. A similar analysis will be performed for subsequent doses of aP controlling for timing of the first dose. All analyses will be stratified by sex, as sex may be an effect modifier.
Vaccination coverage is very high in the population covered by this study (approximately 94% fully vaccinated at 12 months of age), and is expected to be higher in this particular cohort as they were recruited at vaccination clinics. Thus it is expected that there will be too few children missing aP vaccination to be able to association between aP-vaccination doses and food allergy. Analyses of vaccination doses and food allergy will be performed if possible.
2. Receipt of Hep B vaccine: doses and timing
A dose of Hep B is scheduled to be given between 0 and 7 days of life. Receipt of the birth dose of Hep B will be compared with food allergy using multiple regression as described above, including adjustment for timing of aP. 
3. Other vaccinations
Association between doses and timing of other vaccinations and food allergy or atopic sensitisation will be investigated in explorative analyses.

Sample size
The sample size is predetermined by the size of the HealthNuts cohort. This population size of 5000 was originally calculated to provide power to detect risk factors present in at least 10% of the population with a food sensitisation or food allergy rate of 5 to 10%. At the time of this association study, the prevalence of sensitisation and challenge proven food allergy in the HealthNuts population are known at 21.0% and 10.4% respectively. The potential effect size of timing of vaccination on atopic sensitisation or food allergy are unknown. We have no data on the proportion of the population with a delay in pertussis containing vaccination &gt;2 weeks; hence we are unable to perform a power calculation based on the possible association between delay in vaccination of 2 weeks and food allergy. 
Interpolation from outdated ACIR data indicated that approx 4.9% of children have a delay &gt;1 month in the first dose of DTP (Hull and McIntyre 2006 Vaccine; 24;44034408). Our population is likely to have improved vaccination timeliness than this cohort. However assuming 4.9% of the included population have a delay in 1st dose of pertussis-containing vaccination &gt;30 days and with alpha set to 0.05, the study population of 5200 would provide a power of 76% to detect a 33% reduction in sensitisation, and 99% power to detect reduction of 50% in sensitisation. The same population will provide power of 34% to detect 33% reduction in food allergy, and power of 78% to detect a 50% reduction in food allergy associated with delay in pertussis-containing vaccination.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Epidemiological studies of routine vaccinations and allergic disease have had mixed results, with studies showing positive, negative or no association. Very few randomised studies have been performed. Observational studies have the potential to be confounded by reasons for not receiving vaccination which may be associated with allergic disease. To minimise confounding associated with receipt of vaccination, McDonald et al. (JACI 2008;121(3):626-31) investigated the effect of timing of vaccination on asthma, finding that risk of asthma was reduced when the first dose of DTP was delayed by greater than one month.

The HealthNuts cohort was initiated in 2007 to study environmental and genetic determinates of food allergy. This population provides an opportunity to test the association between vaccination timing and food allergy using the gold standard outcome of oral food challenges. We hypothesise that there may be an association between delay in the first dose of pertussis-containing vaccine and protection from food allergy at one year of age.

Methods:
Enrolment, examination and food-allergy testing have been performed as part of the HealthNuts study. Briefly, 5276 parents agreed to enroll their children in the cohort and 5120 had a skin prick test performed at 1 year of age. 1089 children had a positive skin prick test and were invited for an oral food challenge within the following months, of which 928 children completed, along with 197 skin-prick negative control children. Parents also completed an extensive survey of symptoms of allergic disease, family history of allergic disease, demography, environmental factors, and other risk factors for allergic disease.
Data on vaccination doses and timing up to 18 months of age will be obtained for children of the HealthNuts cohort from the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register. Statistical analyses will be performed as described.</summary>
