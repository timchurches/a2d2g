  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The monoclonal antibody GNbAC1 targets the envelope protein (Env) of the human endogenous
      Multiple Sclerosis associated RetroVirus (MSRV), which could play a critical role in
      different autoimmune disorders, notably type 1 diabetes (T1D).

      This study is a multicentre study evaluating for the first time the safety and efficacy of
      GNbAC1 for 20 weeks in T1D subjects. The primary objective of the study is to assess the
      safety and tolerability of six consecutive 4-weekly doses of GNbAC1 in subjects with T1D.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacodynamic response to GNbAC1 on biomarkers of
      T1D.</summary>
