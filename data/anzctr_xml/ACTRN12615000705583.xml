  <interventions>
    <interventions>The utility of quetiapine (25 - 200mg/day, oral) will be assessed in patients diagnosed with severe borderline personality disorder.  Patients who have given informed consent will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or quetiapine in a double-blind study.  Dose will be adjusted weekly in 25 mg/day increments depending on efficacy and tolerability.  After 12 weeks, participants will commence evidence-based weekly individual in combination with group psychotherapy (assignment to Dialectical Behavior Therapy or Mentalisation Based Therapy by clinician discretion) while continuing on quetiapine or placebo treatment.  Weekly psychotherapy will comprise a 1 h individual session and a 1-2 h group session administered by a mental health clinician.  Safety and efficacy will be assessed at frequent intervals with the blinded study ending after 12 months of psychotherapy (15 months after commencing drug or placebo treatment).
Quetiapine or placebo medication will be dispensed weekly for up to 15 months (the end point of the study).  Participants will bring the package from the medication that was dispensed the previous week to their weekly appointment to monitor adherence. The provision of psychotherapy is expected to assist in participant retention.  Medical examination, questionnaires and blood tests will be used to monitor safety.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be placebo prior to (3 months) and then in tandem with psychotherapy (12 months).  Placebo will comprise microcellulose tablets.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, no drugs are approved for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD).  Newly published evidence showing that the antipsychotic drug, quetiapine, improves BPD symptoms suggests that quetiapine might facilitate the benefits of psychotherapy  currently the only evidence-based treatment for BPD. We plan to investigate this at Spectrum (Eastern Health), the specialist service for treatment of BPD in Victoria, Australia</summary>
