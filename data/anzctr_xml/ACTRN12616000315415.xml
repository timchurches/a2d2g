  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in this study will have peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) used in cancer care services departments, including adult and paediatric populations. Consenting patients will have their PICC dressed and secured with one of the following randomly assigned options: 
Arm 1 (Control): Securement device (SSD) and simple polyurethane dressing (SP). 
Arm 2: Securement device; simple polyurethane dressing and a chlorhexidine impregnated (CHG) disc. 
Arm 3: Integrated securement device. Integrated securement devices (ISDs) are simple polyurethane dressings which combine both SP and SD into one product. 
Arm 4: Integrated securement device and a chlorhexidine impregnated disc. 

Patients will be monitored daily to ensure protocol adherence. The randomly allocated dressing will be applied regularly every 7 days or as clinically indicated until either removal of device or until 8 weeks after device insertion (at which point the allocated dressing/securement will be removed and replaced with standard care). </interventions>

    <sequence>Computer generated. Randomisation will be stratified by (i) hospital site, (ii) cancer type (haematological malignancy or solid tumour), (iii) inpatient/outpatient, and (iii) first/subsequent PICC . Randomisation will be in a 1:1:1:1 ratio between the four study groups. Block randomisation will be used with random variation in block size.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Participants will be allocated to:

2. One intervention: a. SP+SD+CHG disc; or b. ISD (no CHG disc)
3. Both interventions: ISD+CHG disc.

Blinded microbiologist and infectious diseases physicians will assign infectious outcomes (including Primary Outcome (1) catheter-associated bloodstream infection). </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>To test the dressing hypothesis: Baseline CABSI is 8% for SP with no CHG disc, and we predict this incidence in the combined no-CHG disc groups. We hypothesise incidence in the combined CHG disc groups of 4% based on the RR of 0.52 previously associated with CHG-discs. An inequality test of two proportions calculated that 602 patients/group were needed to detect reduced CABSI from 8% to 4% with 90% power (p=0.05, 1-sided, PASS) (602 CHG disc; 602 no CHG disc).

To test the securement hypothesis: We anticipate PICC failure of 26% in the SD groups, based on the RSVP Trial (funded APP1008428), and a pilot PISCES Trial. We hypothesise 19% failure in the combined ISD groups i.e. RR=0.73. This was the mid-point between RR=0.84 associated with ISD vs SP+Sutures in PICCs, and the pooled RR=0.63 seen in our pilot trials. Conservatively, we expect a smaller effect size than our pilot trials. An inequality test of two proportions calculated a sample of 608 patients/group (608 ISD; 608 SD) is needed to compare 26% and 19% PICC failure with 90% power (p=0.05, 1-sided, PASS).
As this trial has a factorial design, we will use the comparison that needs the larger sample, thus 608 per group plus 2% for potential attrition, so 620/group, and split these so that each of the 4 study groups will have 310 devices. Thus the total trial will be 1240 devices, which can test both hypotheses.

Analysis will be by intention to treat with the patient, the unit of randomisation and PICCs, the unit of measurement. Pairwise, sequential comparisons will be made for CHG vs. SP, and ISD vs. SD. Baseline group comparisons will be by clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of PICC failure/100 devices and /1,000 PICC days (95% CIs) will summarise treatment impact, with group differences tested. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (and log rank M-H test) will compare failure rates over time. Secondary endpoints will be compared between groups using parametric/nonparametric techniques. The proportional hazards assumption will be checked, and Cox regression will test the effect of group, patient, device and clinical variables on failure, and assess for an interaction effect. Regression models will allow for stratification factors and clustering by ward (gamma shared frailty). Subgroup analysis (a priori) will test for differences within and between strata. Data will be exported into PASW after cleaning outlying figures, missing and implausible data, with all attempts to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes, with multiple imputation considered if data is missing at random. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P-values &lt;0.05 will be statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of alternative dressing and securement devices in preventing device failure and infection in peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in cancer patients. 

You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are a cancer patient of any age, with a haematological malignancy or solid tumour, and are having a PICC inserted as part of your therapy (which is expected to remain in place for at least 24 hours). 

All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive one of four PICC dressing/securement device combinations. These combinations are the standard securement device with a simple polyurethane dressing; the standard securement device with a simple polyurethane dressing and a chlorhexidine impregnated disc; an integrated securement device and simple polyurethane dressing combined into a single device; or an integrated securement device and chlorhexidine impregnated disc. The allocated dressing will be re-applied every 7 days or more frequently if required, until 8 weeks or until the time of device removal if removal is required earlier. Participants will be asked to rate the acceptability of the device and dressing, and the device will be observed closely to examine side effects, device failures and infections. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on which PICC securement devices and dressings are most effective in preventing PICC failure and infection in cancer patients.</summary>
