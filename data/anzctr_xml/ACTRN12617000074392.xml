  <interventions>
    <interventions>In the first session, patients will be explained the exercise program focused on gluteus medius in order to execute it in a correct way. It will take place in one of the rooms of Universidad de Alcala. Patients will perform it for 8 weeks (2 days per week). Every session will be programmed in groups of 8-10 people, and will be managed by one of the physiotherapist involved in this study. Each exercise session will last approximately 1 hour. The program will be divided in two months. In the first month, next exercises will be executed:
- Double leg bridge
- Traditional hip claim exercise: Side-lying. Feet in contact, with hips and knees in 45 degrees flexioned. Patient perform hip abduction and external rotation.
- Prone heel squeeze: heel pressure and contraction of guteus. 
- Side-lying hip abduction with internal rotation, with low back in neutral position. 
- Side-lying hip abduction against a wall, while foot is pressing against the wall (hip extension). Low back and hip in neutral position.
Each exercise will be performed in three different series of 10 repetitions each one. The time of contraction will be 5 seconds and the rest time between series will be 30 seconds. 

In the second, month, there will be an increased difficulty with next exercises:
- Single leg bridge
- Traditional hip claim exercise: Side-lying. Feet in contact, with hips in neutral position. Patient perform hip abduction and external rotation.
- Prone heel squeeze: heel pressure and contraction of guteus with knee flexion
- Side-lying hip abduction with internal rotation, using a theraband
- Side-lying hip abduction against a wall, using a theraband
Each exercise will be performed in two different series of 15 repetitions each one. The time of contraction will be 5 seconds and the rest time between series will be 30 seconds.

Before each session, it will be performed a warm up (10 minutes) consisting in walking with different combinations of step and speeds and movement of joints from feet to head. 
After each session it will be performed streching of low back, psoas, gluteus medium, hip muscles, quadriceps, adductors, hamstring muscles, neck and shoulders (30 seconds each one)

Then, the physiotherapist will perform dry needling in gluteus medius muscle (dry needling will be performed only in the first session).  Patient will be side-lying (on his heathy side) with aducction of the leg to be treated. The needle to be used will measure 6x0,3 cm. Dry needling session will last between 5 and 10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>the intervention in control group is the same than in the intervention group, except that, in the first session, instead of dry needling, physiotherapist will perform placebo dry needling by superficial dry needling (the patient will feel the prick but the needle won´t get to gluteus medium or any other muscle)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the treatment of the gluteus medius reduces nonspecific mechanical low back pain, specially if dry needling and an exercise program are performed instead of just exercise. We hypothesize that the weakness and the presence of trigger points is relationed directly with the low back pain of the patient, so the treatment focused on this muscle should reduce the low back pain level and also the disability. 
Two randomized groups, of at least 18 patients with low back pain per group, will participate in the study. In the first session, the intervention group will be performed dry needling in gluteus medium, while the control group will be performed placebo dry needling. Both groups will learn an exercise program focused on gluteus medium which must perform for 8 weeks (2 days per week). 
Outcomes have in count will be level of pain and disability, measured before the first session, after finishing the first session, and 1, 3 and 6 months after the first session.
