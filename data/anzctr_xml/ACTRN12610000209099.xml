Participants already consuming functional beverage products (except if participants conduct four week wash-out period).

    <concealment>Potential participants will undergo telephone screening and attend and information/recruitment session.  If participants meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria (as determined by Research Team), and sign informed consent, they will be included in the study.  Treatment identification is concealed from participants and the Research Team via numbered treatment containers.  The identification of the numbered treatment containers will be held off-site in secure location by a Research Partner.  Participants will receive a numbered treatment container at random by the Research Team.</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatment products will be randomised using a simple randomisation table created by computer software (computerised sequence generation).  This will result in treatment products being allocated a randomised number.  Treatment identification will be concealed from the Research Team and participants.  The Research Team will receive treatment products in concealed numbered treatment containers. Participants will receive a treatment product via random selection of a treatment container.  The batch number of the treatment container will be recorded by the Research Team.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine physiological effects of foods and beverages containing grape, olive leaf and seaweed extracts in 272 overweight and obese adults.  The study will be a double-blind randomised controlled trial.  Participants will consume the intervention or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by six month and 12 month reviews to monitor outcomes.  The study will examine physiological effects including whether the products may result in a reduction in body weight and composition, blood pressure, cholesterol, waist circumference, appetite, and inflammation.  This study will contribute significantly to the current body of knowledge of the physiological effects of these compounds, as no previous human trials have been conducted.  Foods and nutrients that support and enhance metabolic pathways and reduce inflammation may provide significant alternative methods for weight loss for people with chronic disease.</summary>
