  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resistance exercise intervention: After 12 weeks of usual care and 1 week gap (testing period), participants proceed to 12 week intradialytic resistance training intervention conducted 3 times per week for approximately 30 minutes per session encompassing full body weight training. Moderate to high intensity, progressive resistance training (free weights, elastic tubings and machine) will be administered by an exercise physiologist. The training session will be conducted on an individual basis. A generic set of exercises will be prescribed and progressed according to individual's rating of perceived exertion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care: During the 12 weeks control period, participants will be provided usual medical and dialysis care but will be given no instructions to exercise or access to equipment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular mortality and morbidity are high in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients compared to general population. Arterial stiffness is a cardiovascular measure that predicts mortality in ESRD patients. Although exercise can counteract many risk factors contributing to arterial stiffness, research on its effect on arterial stiffness in ESRD patients is inconclusive and limited to aerobic exercise. The aim of this project is to examine the affect of intradialytic resistance training on arterial stiffness and other secondary health outcomes in ESRD patients. Participants will undergo a 12 weeks usual care control period followed by a 12 weeks resistance training intervention period. Participants will be recruited from dialysis centres and will undertake their exercises in their centres. All participants will undergo a series of measurements before and after control period and after intervention period. Measures include arterial stiffness, blood sample measures, quality of life, depression level, physical fitness and activity level.</summary>
