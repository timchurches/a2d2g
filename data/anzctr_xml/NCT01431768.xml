Treatment: devices: Respirio Flu Test
The Respirio Flu Test (RFT) is a rapid test for identifying whether a patient is infected with the Influenza A or B virus. The test separates the Influenza virus from the patient's nose blow sample and utilizes the same underlying technology as a pregnancy test (lateral flow/immuno-chromatography) to deliver a positive or negative result in less than 10 minutes. The RFT is easy to use, designed with a 3 step process similar to that of the home pregnancy test. Results are presented to the patient as a combination of different coloured lines, depending on whether the patient has Influenza A or B.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a open label, prospective, pair comparison, randomised, multi-centre trial. The
      primary aim of this study to is to clinically validate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      Respirio Flu Test (RFT) in detecting Influenza A as compared with (a) the best available
      rapid Influenza A test in the market Quidel QuickVue (QQV) and (b) the gold standard for
      identifying Influenza A infection Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR).

      The secondary aim is to clinically validate the sensitivity and specificity of the Respirio
      Flu Test (RFT) in detecting Influenza B as compared to QQV and PCR.</summary>
