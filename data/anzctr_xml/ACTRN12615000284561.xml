  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to assess tolerability of enteral feeding versus standard care (parenteral feeding) when commenced the day after transplantation, before the onset of gastrointestinal toxicity. Patients will be randomised on admission to early enteral nutrition or standard care. The patients receiving enteral nutrition will have a fine bore nasogastric tube inserted the day after transplantation. Supplementary enteral feeding will commence immediately at 30ml/hr continuously to allow oral intake to continue ad libitum during the day. If oral intake declines enteral feeding rates will be adjusted until patients are meeting their goal nutrition requirement.

If patients are intolerant of enteral feeding the nasogastric tube will be removed and parenteral nutrition commenced. If a low rate of enteral nutrition is tolerated but not the goal rate, top up parenteral feeding can be given. 

Supplementary feeding (enteral, parenteral or combination of both) will cease once patients are meeting 60% of nutrition requirements via oral intake post neutrophil  engraftment. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomised to standard care will commence parenteral feeding as per the usual protocol when oral intake is less than 60% of nutrition requirements for three days and is unlikely to improve for another week. The rate of feeding will be increased daily until meeting their goal nutrition requirements.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is tolerability of supplemental enteral nutrition (EN) as defined by the percentage of randomized patients who do not tolerate goal enteral feeding so must either discontinue EN or commence top up parenteral nutrition.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nutritional support during allogeneic stem cell transplantation is imperative to prevent malnutrition. Nutrition support can be provided via either enteral (nasogastric) or parenteral (intravenous) feeding.
Despite increased risks of infections and complications parenteral nutrition is used routinely at most
transplant units due to patient's gastrointestinal toxicity at the time feeding is required. Recently a few small studies have shown benefits with early enteral nutrition in this group, including less infections, reduced risk of complications such as graft versus host disease, earlier neutrophil engraftment and improved survival. 

This study aims to assess tolerability of enteral feeding versus standard care (parenteral feeding) when commenced the day after transplantation, before the onset of gastrointestinal toxicity. 

This research study will determine which is the best form of nutritional supplementation for patients undergoing
stem cell transplantation and the results will directly improve patient care as it will inform future clinical practice and lead to new clinical guideline development. </summary>
