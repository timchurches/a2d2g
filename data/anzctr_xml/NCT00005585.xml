    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells. It is
      not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for childhood acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing different regimens of combination
      chemotherapy to see how well they work in treating children with acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.</summary>
