  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life as measured through Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire - only two subdomains of the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) were used: the Shortness of Breath (SoB) domain and the Mastery domain</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Preference - Five 7-point Likert Scales, ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 7 (all of the time) on portability ("the equipment was portable enough for my needs"), operation ("I was able to set up and operate the equipment properly"), noise ("Noise from the equipment affected me"), comprehension ("I was able to understand the functions of the equipment, e.g. alarms") and duration ("The oxygen lasted long enough for me to perform my normal activities"). Furthermore, patients were asked to provide comments on use of the POCs and the Cylinders after they completed the respective stage of the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost effectiveness of portable oxygen concentrator compared to cylinder - Economic assessment based on treatment cost, readmission data and hospital utilisation</outcome>
      <timepoint>one month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life as measured through AQoL-8D - Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D Multi-Attribute Utility Instrument</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Co-morbidities such as: other major respiratory conditions, cardiac or other
             substantial co-morbidities which significantly limit mobility independent of COPD

          -  Baseline step test which demonstrates a reduced effect on the battery device compared
             to oxygen cylinders.</exclusivecriteria>
