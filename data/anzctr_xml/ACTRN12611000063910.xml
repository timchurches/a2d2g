    <interventions>Ranibizumab (Lucentis) combined with grid laser compared 
with laser alone for the treatment of recalcitrant, diabetic 
macular oedema.
Ranibizumab(Lucentis)will be administered via intravitreal injection on at least 3 occasions. There will possibly be as many as 9 injections in a 12 month period.
Injection dose is 0.05 ml/1.25 mg once/day.The initial 3 injections will be given at 1 month intervals and subsequent injections will be given at the discretion of the attending medical officer at 6 week intervals.The injection procedure will take approximately 5 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Type of Laser is Alcon Ophthalas 532 with 100 micrometre spot size,80-150MW power,0.1 second duration.Each laser session duration is 15 minutes.
Grid laser will be administered once at week 2 of the study for all participants.In the treatment group discretionary focal laser will be administered at week 14 and 32.
The sham group will receive as needed grid laser at week 14 and 32.The sham group will receive placebo injection procedure by having pressure applied on the eye to simulate an injection (sham injection). Injection site is then tamponaded with sterile cotton bud for 5 seconds.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary objective: Improve the vision of patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO) affecting the centre of the fovea that has persisted despite laser treatment.Outcomes will be assessed via Best Corrected Visual Acuity testing(BCVA),Central Retinal Thickness,Intraocular pressure and eye examination from medical officer.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary objective: Reduce retinal thickness as measured by OCT (optical coherence tomography).</outcome>
      <timepoint>OCT will be performed at first visit at baseline, then 2 weekly until week 10, week 14, then 6 weekly until the completion and review of DMO for a 12 month period.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives:
Primary objective: Improve the vision of patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO) affecting the centre of the fovea that has persisted despite laser treatment.

Secondary objective: Reduce retinal thickness as measured by OCT (optical coherence tomography).


Strategic goal: 
Primary Objective: 
1.	To determine if combined treatment with ranibizumab and grid laser for recalcitrant diabetic maculopathy is more effective in improving visual acuity than grid laser alone.

Secondary Objectives: 
1.	To design a treatment protocol that requires less visits and intravitreal injections than similar studies currently in progress. This would be more acceptable to patients and clinicians.</summary>
