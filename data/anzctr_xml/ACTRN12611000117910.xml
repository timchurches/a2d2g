  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a m-health cardiac rehabilitation programme. Participants will receive a personalised automated package of text message components via their mobile phones to increase exercise behaviour delivered over 24 weeks.  A total of 162 messages will be sent over 24 weeks. Participants will receive 1-2 messages per day for the first 6-weeks, then 8 messages per week from weeks 7-12 and then 4 messages per week  from weeks 13-24. Participants will also have access to an interactive website which they may enter using a unique password and login.  The website will be able to used at the participant's discretion and will contain messages sent to their phones which they can retrieve on demand, motivational messages, role model video clips, and weekly health and exercise tips.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be directed to receive usual care, which currently involves encouragement to be physically active and an offer to join a local cardiac club.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from two metropolitan hospitals in Auckland. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) nurses will identify eligible and interested participants from the existing database. CR nurses will screen patients according to the eligibility criteria. Contact details for those eligible and interested in participating will be forwarded to the research team, who will make contact to enrol them in the study and organise baseline assessments. 

Following baseline assessment procedures, participants will be randomly assigned to either an m-health exercise-based CR intervention or the usual CR control group using the a central computerised randomisation service.  Researchers will use laptop computers to randomise participants on-site; therefore allocation concealment will be maintained.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using the a central computerised randomisation service. A minimisation method will be considered using three stratification factors: sex (female and male), self-identified ethnicity (Maori and non-Maori), and adherence to Phase 2 CR (attended at least one session or not).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise is the cornerstone of cardiac rehabilitation for people with heart disease. However many of those with heart disease do not undertake sufficient levels of exercise, and therefore do not realise the benefits, such as increased cardiovascular fitness, decreased weight and improved lipid profile. The proposed study aims to improve existing exercise based cardiac rehabilitation provision using a (m)-health delivery approach. One hundred and seventy participants will be allocated at random to receive a package of exercise prescription and behavioural support strategies via mobile phone and internet (m-health) for 6 months or usual care (advice to be physically active and encouragement to join a cardiac club). Assessments at baseline and 6-months will compare physical fitness, exercise levels, and quality of life in the different groups. If effective, this approach has enormous potential to improve the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation and could be scaled up nationally and internationally.</summary>
