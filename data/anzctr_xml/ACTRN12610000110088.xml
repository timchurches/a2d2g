  <interventions>
    <interventions>An ultrasound-guided liver biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from the liver that is then sent to pathology for testing.  

Liver biopsies performed in medical imaging are done with guidance from an ultrasound machine to ensure that the sampling needle is taking a sample from the correct part of the liver and that it is away from major blood vessels, lung, and other areas that are not meant to be sampled.

Patients normally get one or two samples depending on how easy the sample can be obtained, how much tissue is removed each sample, and a variety of other reasons determined by the radiologist doing the biopsy.

The biopsy itself only takes 10-15 minutes.  Preparation of the equipment, explanation, introduction to staff, getting changed, and moving in and out of the room means the event takes approximately 45 minutes.  Patients are observed for 2 hours after the procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>The purpose of a liver biopsy is to get a sample of liver tissue.  This tissue sample is then sent to pathology and looked at under a microscope to determine the diagnosis.  The biopsy may require one or two samples to get sufficient tissue to make a diagnosis.  The more tissue sampled, the easier it is to make a diagnosis but the more side effects the patient may have.  

Therefore we would like to compare two groups.  One group will have an ultrasound-guided non-targeted liver biopsy (using a 14 gauge needle) to obtain ONE sample of tissue, the other group will have an ultrasound-guided non-targeted liver biopsy (using a 14 gauge needle) to obtain TWO samples of tissue.</comparator>

      <outcome>The most common side effects of ultrasound-guided liver biopsies are pain and bleeding.  

Nurses take frequent observations before, during, and after the procedure to monitor for signs of pain, bleeding, and other complications.  These observations include pain using a numerical pain scale, bleeding at the site, bleeding in the liver (radiologist observes ultrasound images whilst performing the biopsy to look for signs of bleeding), and blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturations using a pulse oximeter and automated observation equipment.

This continues at regular intervals until 2 hours after the procedure.  There is also a follow-up phone call the next day to ensure the patient is comfortable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain levels will be recorded before the procedure, the patient will have the biospy and any adverse events are recorded by the radiologist.  The patient will remain in the nursing recovery area and pain, bleeding, side effects will be monitored for 2 hours.  There will be a phone call for follow-up within 24 hours.  This is the normal routine for liver biopsy patients.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All patients presenting to the Royal Brisbane &amp; Women's Hospital (RBWH) Department of Medical Imaging (DMI) who need ultrasound-guided, non-targeted liver biopsies.  The study group will not include children as it is an adult hospital.  The groups will be randomised to include equal numbers of men and women.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>All patients will be getting biopsies based on a clinical indication.  They will have various medical comorbidities.  It is an "all-comers" trial to ensure the results are clinically relevant.  Patients won't be included/excluded on their physical fitness.  They will simply be included if they need a non-targeted liver biopsy for any reason.  Patients with International Normalised Ratio (INR) over 1.5 may be excluded for safety as they are at increased risk of bleeding (current practice).  This will be at the discretion of the interventional radiologist performing the biopsy.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients presenting for ultrasound-guided, non-targeted liver biopsies will be asked to participate in the trial by the radiologist performing the biopsy.  All patients requiring liver biopsies will be included in the trial.

Patients willing to participate will be randomly assigned to one of two sample groups as they present.  

A random allocation spreadsheet has been produced by the statisticians to ensure there will be equal numbers of men and women.  One group will have a single biopsy sample, the second group will have two biopsy samples.  Allocation is not concealed.

Due to the nature of the trial, the patients cannot be blinded during the procedure as they will know how many samples are being taken.  Patients will not be made aware of which group they are participating to prevent biasing pain perception.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation table will be used according to advice from our biostatisticians.

The protocol will be:
- a patient arrives
- determine if they are male or female
- if male go to the next available number on the male list, assign the
patient to that group and then tick the number off the list (to ensure
that it is not reused).
- if female, do the equivalent on the female list</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Liver biopsy procedures are conducted using either a single pass or multiple pass method whereby a needle is inserted into the patient to extract liver material once (single pass) or more than once (multiple pass).  The type of procedure used depends on the practitioners preference as there is a need to strike a balance between ensuring extraction of a sufficient tissue sample and the comfort / safety of the patient.  

The aim of this project will be to compare the complication rate of single versus multiple pass techniques in ultrasound-guided non-targeted liver biopsies.

It will be a randomised, prospective trial in which patients will enter one of two groups.  The first group of patients will have a single 14gauge(g) non-targeted ultrasound-guided liver biopsy.  The second group will have two 14g non-targeted ultrasound-guided liver biopsies using a foam plug for haemostasis.  Due to the interventional nature of liver biopsies, the clinicians and patients are unable to be blinded.  All patients will continue to have an International Normalised Ratio (INR) prior to their procedure (current practice).  Consent for the procedure will be obtained along with consent to participate in the trial.  Patients will be assessed for pain in the recovery period using a visual pain scale and clinicians will be required to document peri/procedural complications.  The reporting pathologist will be required to comment on the diagnostic yield and quality of the biopsy sample.  These additional data collection steps will be included in an addendum to current liver biopsy clinical pathway.

The rationale for comparing these two groups is to reflect clinical practice as these two techniques are used by different interventional radiologists at RBWH and to establish whether one technique should be adopted universally within the department.  

The results will review safety, patient tolerability, yield, clinical indication, and coagulation status with an emphasis on complications including pain.</summary>
