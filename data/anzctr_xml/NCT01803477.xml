  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the new vehicle formulations containing ingenol
      mebutate are as safe and effective as Picato® gel 0.05% (it's current vehicle formulation)
      when applied to AK lesions on the forearm for two consecutive days.</summary>
