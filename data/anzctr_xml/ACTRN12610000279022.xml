  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Items 1 -3 (AUDIT-C items) and the AUDIT items 4-10, they will also complete questions concerning the largest number of standard drinks consumed on one occasion in the last four weeks, the duration of the drinking episode in hours, and their body weight for the purpose of estimating their blood alcohol concentration. They then complete the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ; 10 items). The approximate duration of the screening part of the intervention will be 10 minutes. The mode of intervention of the screening is a web-based questionnaire. The intervention group will then receive personalised feedback (web-based information, provided immediately following screening, duration approximately 10 minutes, provided via computer generated information taking the participants answers into account so that the feedback is personalised) consisting of: their AUDIT score, an LDQ score, with an explanation of the associated health risk and information about how to reduce that risk; an estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) for the respondents heaviest episode in the previous four weeks, with information on the behavioural and physiological sequelae of various BACs, and traffic crash relative risk; estimates of monetary expenditure per month and year (estimates are for alcohol purchased); bar graphs comparing episodic and weekly consumption with that of other students of the same age and gender; and hyperlinks for help with drinking problems. Further web pages will be presented as options, offering facts about alcohol, tips for reducing the risk of alcohol-related harm, and where medical help and counselling support could be found. Participants will be contacted for follow up 5 months later (12 months follow up is intended but subject to funding)</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group only completes AUDIT-C (items 1-3 of AUDIT, web-based questionnaire, approximate duration of the screening 5 minutes) and will then be send to a 'Thanks' page. Subjects in the control group will not receive personalised feedback.

    <concealment>On 26 April 2010 random samples of students aged 17-25 years will be sent an e-mail message containing a hyperlink to a web questionnaire. Up to two reminder e-mails will be sent in the following weeks. Any student who indicates they do not wish to participate (by e-mail or phone) will not be sent a reminder e-mail. 

Respondents will visit the study website and be presented with an introductory page followed by one page of three questions concerning (1) gender, (2) age, and (3) ethnicity, and a following page with a question concerning alcohol consumtpion in the last 12 months (yes/no) and the three items of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test--Consumption (AUDIT-C) subscale; frequency of drinking; number of drinks consumed per typical drinking occasion; and frequency of having six or more drinks per occasion. Upon clicking the submit button on this page, AUDIT-C scores will be calculated. Those who score 4 or more on the AUDIT-C (the standard cut-off score) will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group.

method of allocation concealment: central randomisation by computer</concealment>
    <sequence>Those who score 4 or more on the AUDIT-C (the standard cut-off score) will be randomly allocated by the web server to either the intervention or control group. Randomisation will be effected by the computer server administering the electronic Screening and Brief Intervention (e-SBI) program.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Unhealthy alcohol use is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, particularly among young people. In addition to better controlling the availability and promotion of alcohol, effective interventions to reduce demand for alcohol that are deliverable to many are needed. Web-based alcohol screening and brief intervention (e-SBI) has certain advantages over practitioner-delivered approaches, being cheaper, and administrable remotely. A previous trial at a single Australian university showed that this 10-minute intervention reduced drinking among 17-25 year-old undergraduate hazardous drinkers. In this study we aim to determine whether e-SBI is effective across a range of universities and among Maori and non-Maori students. Students from New Zealand universities will be invited by e-mail to complete a web questionnaire including the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Those who score in the hazardous range will be randomly allocated to no further contact until follow-up (control) or to assessment and personalised feedback (intervention) via computer. Follow-up assessment will occur 6 months later. Recruitment, consent, randomisation and follow-up will all be online. This study will provide information on the effectiveness of e-SBI in reducing unhealthy alcohol use across several diverse university student populations.</summary>
