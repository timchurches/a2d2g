  <interventions>
    <interventions>Education for parents about coping and management strategies. involves 8 group sessions for both parents - one session per week for 8 weeks. Topics covered include parenting strategies, contingency management, exposure hierarchies for children, and anxiety management for parents. Topics are delivered by a clinical psychologist in a standard behavioural treatment format. Intervention is assisted by handouts for parents.</interventions>
    <comparator>No intervention. In the control condition, no intervention is offered and all assessments are simply repeated at 6 months. Ie the control condition involves children and parents who do not receive any intervention.</comparator>

  <eligibility>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants screened by questionnaire and then invited to observational (laboratory) assessment. Eligible participants were not allocated to conditions until after inclusion in the trial - ie once criteria for inhibition of child and anxiety disorder in parent had been met. Hence initial inclusion in trial was independent of treatment allocation. Allocation to intervention was conducted by the study co-ordinator after assessment of participant eligibility by toss of a coin. Hence the person assessing participant eligibility did not know which treatment condition the participant would be allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>After inclusion of eligible participants in trial, allocation to condition was done by the investigator by coin toss.</sequence>
