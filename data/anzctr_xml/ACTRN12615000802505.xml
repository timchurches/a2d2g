    <interventions>Arm 1: Standard care plus Intervention
Intervention: Phototherapy using a Waldmann UV7002 (TL01) phototherapy cabinet with output (between wavelengths 311-312 nm) of 0.6 mW/cm2 will be used. Eye protection will be with a full face mask.  Phototherapy will be given three times/week for twelve weeks (36 exposures in total). Phototherapy will be delivered according to the patients skin type using the psoriasis protocol recommended by Waldmann. The starting dose of 0.1 - 0.4 J/cm2 will be based on the skin type and will be well below the likely erythema threshold. All patients will receive 20% increments on their initial dose, up to a maximal dose of 2.0 - 3.0 J/cm2 dependent upon skin type, similar to that previously published (Paul et al, (2012) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 26 Suppl 3, 1-10). At each visit the dose will be given and any adverse effects will be recorded. The time of each UVB exposure varies from approximately 1 to approximately 4 minutes, with increasing lengths of exposure over time on therapy as the skin becomes tanned.

Patient calendars, reminder phonecalls and free dedicated parking at the hospital will be provided to improve adherence to the intervention.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety as assessed by adverse events assessments and clinical assessments. 

Adverse events with NB-UVB therapy are very rare as this is a well-established therapy used to treat dermatological conditions for more than 20 years, but the possible side-effects of treatment are as follows:

1. The most common side-effect is sunburn (significant redness or pain following the treatment).  It is common for the skin to become slightly red after treatment. Rarely blisters can occur.

2. Some patients could develop a skin rash in response to phototherapy, as the treatment may uncover a previously unknown sun sensitive skin condition. 

3. There is a theoretically increased risk of skin cancers similar to going out in the sun. Short term treatments such as this one do not seem to entail any more sunlight hazard than a similar amount of sun exposure.

Adverse events will be assessed 3 times per week at the time of phototherapy treatment by interview and physical examination by the phototherapy nurse.

Neurological adverse events are not expected, however neurological assessments will be conducted using the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised at months 3, 6 and 12. 

Dermatological assessments will be conducted by study dermatologist at the completion of phototherapy and at 12 months by physical examination.

    <statisticalmethods>We will calculate the change in regulatory T cells (Treg) as % leukocytes from baseline for each individual, and determine the difference between % Treg change from baseline for treated and untreated patients using t-test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. We conducted sample size calculations using empirical means and standard deviations of normalised change on narrow-band-UVB phototherapy data from a group of treated individuals and 7 untreated controls showing a significant difference between the groups (now published; Schweintzger N et al including CI Byrne , Br J Dermatol. 2015 May 30. doi: 10.1111/bjd.13930), and required a sample size of 10 in each group to achieve 80% power to detect p&lt;0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown, recent evidence points to an important role for immune dysregulation in ALS disease. In particular, a role for the suppressive arm of the immune system, directed primarily by regulatory T cells (Tregs), may slow disease progression. In this project we will conduct the first trial in ALS of a specific immune therapy, narrow band UVB phototherapy, known to increase Treg activity.

Narrow band UVB phototherapy is a simple, safe and non-invasive treatment used routinely to suppress damaging immune reactions in other conditions such as psoriasis. We will determine whether UVB phototherapy is safe in ALS and whether it induces regulatory T cells. If effective, this would support a larger trial examining whether UVB phototherapy can slow the progression of disease.

Slowing disease progression using phototherapy would be a major advance for this disease. If phototherapy has no effect on disease progression but can increase regulatory T cells it may be useful in combination with other neuron-regenerating treatments that are in development, by reducing immune-mediated neuron damage. The study proposed here will expand our knowledge of the role of the immune system in ALS and highlight the potential to harness its regulatory arm to slow disease progress.
