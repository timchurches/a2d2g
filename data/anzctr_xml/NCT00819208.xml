Active Comparator: Physical Activity Program + General Health Education Materials - Intervention Arm

Active Comparator: General Health Education Materials - Control Arm


Behaviour: exercise intervention
3 phases Phase 1: Intensive intervention for 6 months Phase 2: Reduced intervention for months 6-12 Phase 3: Minimal intervention for months 12-36

Other interventions: counseling intervention
Achieving an increase in PA from baseline of = 10 MET hours/week will require a significant amount of behavioural support. The intervention will comprise a 36-month individualized PA and behavioural support program with a PAC. This will include a personalized PA prescription which takes into account the baseline fitness test results, PA history, performance status and patient's personal PA preferences and any barriers to activity. Most patients are likely to choose a walking program however any PA of at least moderate intensity level is acceptable.

Other interventions: educational intervention
Once at the beginning of the program

Other interventions: laboratory biomarker analysis
Every 12 months

Other interventions: questionnaire administration
Every 6 months

Other interventions: study of socioeconomic and demographic variables
Every 6 months

Treatment: surgery: fatigue assessment and management
Every 6 months

Treatment: surgery: quality-of-life assessment
Every 6 months

Other interventions: Educational Intervention
For Arm 2 just once at beginning of program.

Other interventions: Fitness testing
Objective fitness testing for both arms

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Participating in a physical activity program designed to increase free time
      physical activity and receiving written health education materials may influence the chance
      of cancer recurring as well as impact on physical fitness, psychological well-being and the
      quality of life of patients who have undergone surgery and chemotherapy for colon cancer. It
      is not yet known whether giving a physical activity program together with health education
      materials is more effective than giving health education materials alone for patients who
      have undergone colon cancer treatment.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying a physical activity program given
      together with health education materials to see how well it works compared with giving health
      education materials alone for patients who have undergone treatment for high-risk stage II or
      stage III colon cancer.</summary>
