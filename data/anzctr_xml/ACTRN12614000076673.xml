  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia is the intervention examined in this study. A pre-procedure lumbar neuraxial ultrasound is performed to identify the "best" lumbar intervertebral space for the performance of a combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic. Pen ink markings are placed on the patient's skin to identify the appropriate needle insertion point. The procedure takes 3-5 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Palpation-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia is the accepted standard of care. The patient's's iliac crests and lumbar spinous processes are palpated to determine the "best" lumbar intervertebral space for the performance of a combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic.  Pen ink markings are placed on the patient's skin to identify the appropriate needle insertion point. The procedure takes 1 minute.</comparator>

    <concealment>Consecutive patients scheduled for elective LSCS who are deemed appropriate to receive a neuraxial anaesthetic and who do not meet exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in this study during an outpatient anaesthetic pre-admission consultation. 

All patients scheduled for an elective lower segment Caesarean section will be reviewed in an outpatient pre-anaesthetic assessment clinic. During this consultation, an anaesthetist will determine their suitability for a combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic for the LSCS. If it is appropriate according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the study, the patient will be recruited at this time.</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to the commencement of the clinical phase of the trial, 216 envelopes (same size and colour) will be purchased. Two-hundred-and-sixteen cards (same size and colour) will be printed with “Palpation” (108 cards) or Ultrasound (108 cards). One card will be inserted into each envelope and the envelope will be sealed. The envelopes (containing the cards) will be shuffled and stored in a non-see-through box. The operator on the day of the procedure will randomly select a card from the box and give it to the researched performing the ultrasound. 
  * "Palpation" means the patient is randomised to the palpation-assisted group. 
  * "Ultrasound" means the patient is randomised to the ultrasound-assisted group.

    <statisticalmethods>There is a paucity of published data examining the efficacy of ultrasound-assisted versus palpation-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia for elective Caesarean section surgery. The sample size was determined using published data from two studies.

Study 1:
Grau T, Leipold RW, Conradi R, Martin E, Motsch J. Ultrasound imaging facilitates localization of the epidural space during combined spinal and epidural anesthesia. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine 2001; 26:64-67.

Eighty parturients scheduled for Caesarean delivery were randomized into 2 equal groups:
  * 40 patients underwent CSE without ultrasound imaging  Control Group
  * 40 patients underwent CSE after ultrasound imaging  Ultrasound Group


Results:
  * Puncture attempts mean was 2.075 (SD =0.829) in the Control Group and in the Ultrasound Group 1.275 (SD=0.506), giving a pooled standard deviation of 0.686. 
  * Using a 5% level of significance and 80% power, 61 patients will be required to see a difference of 0.5.
 
Thus, to demonstrate the benefit of ultrasound-assisted versus palpation-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia in the obstetric population undergoing elective Caesarean section, a sample size of 61 would be required. 

This study also aims to identify the subgroup of the obstetric patient at higher risk of difficult neuraxial anaesthetic performance. The following study examined the difference between ultrasound-assisted and palpation-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia in obstetric patients with presumed difficult neuraxial anaesthesia performance:

Study 2:
Grau T, Leipold RW, Conradi R, Martin E. Ultrasound control for presumed dif?cult epidural
Puncture. Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 2001; 45: 766771

72 parturients with abnormal anatomical conditions who were scheduled for epidural anaesthesia. They were randomised into two equal groups:
  * 36 patients underwent CSE without ultrasound imaging  Control Group
  * 36 patients underwent CSE after ultrasound imaging  Ultrasound Group

Results
  * Mean puncture attempts for the Ultrasound Group was 1.5 (SD =0.9). 
  * Mean puncture attempts for the Control Group was 2.6 (SD = 1.4). 

The population examined in our study will include both presumed easy and difficult patients. Based on clinical practice, patients with difficult to palpate anatomical landmarks are at risk of more difficult neuraxial anaesthesia performance. There is no data available on the incidence of difficult anatomical landmarks in the obstetric (or non-obstetric) population. However, palpation difficulty is closely related to body mass index (BMI). Data from the Royal Brisbane &amp; Womens Hospital demonstrates that approximately 30% of obstetric patients are severely obese (BMI &gt;35). This puts them at greater risk of difficult palpation and neuraxial anaesthetic performance.

Thus, but comparing the needle puncture attempt data in the easy and difficult populations, the study can be powered to demonstrate a significant difference in these populations based on a 30% incidence of presumed difficult neuraxial performance.

In Study 1 (Easy population) the Ultrasound Group mean was 1.275 (SD=0.506). In Study 2 (Difficult population) the Ultrasound Group mean was 1.5 (SD = 0.9), giving a pooled standard deviation of 0.72. We expect there to be approximately 2.3 more patients in the Easy Ultrasound Group. Using a 5% level of significance and 80% power, 215 patients will be required to see a difference of 0.3 between groups

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neuraxial anaesthesia (spinal, epidural or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia) is the gold standard technique for elective lower segment Caesarean section (LSCS) surgery. The traditional and accepted method of performing this anaesthetic procedure involves palpation of the patients spinous processes and iliac crests to identify the midline and intervertebral space to appropriately insert the needle and deliver the anaesthetic. The needle is then inserted through the skin, subcutaneous fat and ligaments until the epidural and spinal space is reached. Difficulties can be encountered during this procedure due to the misidentification of the appropriate level of insertion and midline of the spine and needle contact with vertebrae, nerves and blood vessels.
Ultrasound images can help identify structures beneath the skin including bone, ligament anf muscle. This study aims to: 
   * determine the accuracy of palpation-based identification of intervertebral level and midline of the spine compared with ultrasound,
  * assess the efficacy of ultrasound-assisted versus palpation-assisted neuraxial anaesthesia and identify the obstetric population, and
  * identify the obstetric population at higher risk of difficult neuraxial insertion.

Full-term pregnant (&gt;37 weeks gestation, adult patients undergoing elective LSCS surgery who are deemed appropriate to receive a neuraxial anaesthesia will be invited to participate in the study. Patients recruited to the study will be randomised to either the palpation-assisted (control) or ultrasound-assisted (intervention) group. Prior to the performance of a combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic, an anaesthetist will identify and mark the midline and best lumbar intervertebral space by palpating the patients hip bones and spine. An investigator will then perform an ultrasound of the patients lumbar spine to identify and mark the midline best intervertebral space.
In the control group, the palpation-identified mark will be used as the needle insertion point. In the intervention group, the ultrasound-identified mark will be used as the needle insertion point. The combined spinal-epidural anaesthetic will be performed using the same standard technique in both groups.
