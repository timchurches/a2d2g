  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK; how the human body processes a substance) of ETX2514 when given to
      healthy volunteers intravenously as a single dose, and when given as multiple intravenous
      doses for up to 8 consecutive days.

      As it is anticipated that ETX2514 could be used as a treatment for Acinetobacter baumannii (a
      type of bacteria) infections, this project will also look at whether ETX2514 will interact
      with the current treatments for these infections when they are administered at the same time.</summary>
