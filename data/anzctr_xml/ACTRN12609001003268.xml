  <interventions>
    <interventions>The duration of the intervention is 3 months. All participants will attend a face-to-face introductory session (60 minutes) led by the Chief Investigator in Oct-Nov 2009. The information session will cover standard weight control instruction relating to diet, physical activity and behaviour change strategies including self monitoring, goal setting and social support. All participants will be provided with a study handbook. Participants in the intervention group will receive additional behavioural procedures over the course of the 3 months via use of the online website www.calorieking.com.au to support the key strategies of self monitoring and social support. The initial face-to-face session for Intervention participants will also include a technical orientation session to familiarise and teach participants how to use the study website. The website allows submission of self-monitored energy expenditure and intake, weight and online group support. Participants will be instructed to submit daily diaries for the first month and be given the option of submitting daily or weekly thereafter. Their diaries will be reviewed (weekly in the 1st month; fortnightly in the 2nd month and monthly thereafter) and individualised feedback provided in the key areas of weight loss; diet (kilojoule intake, saturated fat, sodium and fibre) and physical activity (frequency, intensity, type and time).  Participants can email the research team with questions. Men will attend the information sessions in crews or departments and be encouraged to help each other use the website. Men will also weigh in each month to track progress and the 'crew' with the greatest percentage weight loss will win a prize offered by workplace management (= $50 p/hd each). A prize will also be offered at 3 months from management.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body weight (kg) was measured in light clothing, without shoes on a digital scale to 0.1kg (model CH-150kp, A&amp;D Mercury Pty Ltd, Australia)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Mass Index (BMI) -  Height was measured to 0.1 cm using the stretch stature method and a stadiometer (VR High Speed Counter) (Harpenden/Holtain, Mentone Education Centre, Morrabin, Victoria). BMI was calculated using the standard equation (weight [kg]/height[m]2).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist Circumference (cm)  - Waist circumference was measured at two points (i) level with the umbilicus and (ii) at the narrowest point. Each measurement was recorded with a non-extensible steel tape (KDSF10-02, KDS Corporation, Osaka, Japan).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured using a NISSEI/DS-105E digital electronic blood pressure monitor (Nihon Seimitsu Sokki Co. Ltd., Gunma, Japan) under standardized procedures</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Yamax SW700 pedometers (Yamax Corporation, Kumamoto City, Japan) were used to objectively measure physical activity. Participants were asked to wear pedometers for seven consecutive days and keep to their normal routine. At baseline assessments, participants were instructed on how to attach the pedometers (at the waist on the right hand side) and asked to remove the pedometers only when sleeping, when the pedometer might get wet (e.g. swimming, showering) or during contact sports. At the end of the day participants were instructed to record their steps and reset their pedometers to zero. Once they had completed seven days of monitoring, participants were instructed to place the pedometer and record sheet in the prepaid envelope provided and return to the research team.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants wore pedometers for 7 days at baseline and then again at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dietary intake - measured using items from the Food Frequency Questionnaire from the Victorian Cancer Council and other supplementary questions + 4-item healthy eating practices</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity cognitions (social support, self efficacy, self management) using validated questionnaires</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleepiness  - using the Epworth sleepiness scale</outcome>

      <outcome>Work productivity - using the the Work Limitations Questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived physical and mental health using the SF-12 questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 3 and 6 months follow-up</timepoint>

      <outcome>Absenteeism and injury rates were determined using work records</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects completed a consent form, an eligibility screen and a pre exercise screening questionnaire. Participants over 40 years were required to receive a doctor's clearance prior to commencement of the study. 
Subjects were randomised in distinct 'crews' or departments that were matched based on profile and shift. All eligible crews were randomised into either intervention and control. Contamination was minimised as crews were matched so that they would not be working together at the same time.
To ensure concealment, the random allocation sequence was generated by a statistician and given to the chief investigator. The allocation sequence was concealed when enrolling crews.</concealment>
    <sequence>The random allocation sequence was generated by a computer-based random number-producing algorithm. This method ensures an equal chance of allocation to each group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shift workers have been found to be at increased risk of insomnias, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. Several well controlled epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to shift work is associated with increased health problems compared with working normal daytime hours and is an independent predictor of increased body mass index and obesity prevalence. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a workplace-based weight-loss program developed specifically for overweight and obese male shift workers.</summary>
