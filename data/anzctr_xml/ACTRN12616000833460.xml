  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral SGLT2 inhibitor, including dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and canagliflozin.

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be performed using GraphPad and R software. Grouped and categorical data will be compared by t-test and Fishers exact test respectively, and correlations will be performed using the method of Pearson. Multiple regression analyses will be performed using the lm function in R. 
To determine if SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is associated with a mean+/-SD reduction in HbA1c of 0.5+/-1.0%, 40 participants need to complete the study to achieve &gt;85% statistical power (alpha=0.05, two-tail). We expect up to 10 patients will withdraw from the study. The final sample size will therefore be 50 participants. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will prospectively assess the clinical effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with type 2 diabetes who attend RMH diabetes clinic. The primary aim is to determine their effect on HbA1c after 3 months of therapy. We hypothesise that people who take these drugs will on average lower their HbA1c by 0.5%.</summary>
