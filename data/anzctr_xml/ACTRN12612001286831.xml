  <interventions>
    <interventions>Emergency departments (EDs) randomised to the intervention arm will receive a targeted, theory and evidence-informed implementation intervention designed to increase the uptake of key evidence-based recommended practices in the management of mild head injured patients. 

The intervention will involve local stakeholder meetings, identification of nursing and medical clinical opinion leaders in each site; a train-the-trainer day; materials to increase the visibility of tools; and a non-specific reminder to optimise data collection and standardised education and interactive workshops delivered by the clinical leaders over a 3 month period of time. </interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>Hospitals will be excluded if they * are either non 24-hour EDs or specialised hospital (e.g. womens or children) and therefore do not routinely treat adult patients with TBI; * do not have a CT scanner on site; or if there is a significant risk of bias (e.g. risk of contamination due to two EDs having the same ED director or senior influential clinicians working across sites). EDs that participated in the pilot of the intervention will be ineligible for inclusion in the trial.

    <concealment>Randomisation will take place through inclusion of a random component and allocation of batches of EDs by a statistician independent of the trial. The statistician will be provided with a file containing only ED codes and the minimisation factors (thus no identifying information). For each batch of EDs, the statistician will randomise the order of EDs before using the minimisation algorithm to allocate the EDs to intervention and control groups.</concealment>
    <sequence>EDs will be allocated to the intervention and control groups using the method of minimisation proposed by Pocock and Simon (Biometrics 1975, 31:103-115). Minimisation has been shown through statistical simulation studies to outperform stratified allocation methods for maintaining baseline balance in prognostic factors. In addition, the method allows for balancing across a greater number of prognostic factors. The minimisation factors will include: the existence of a protocol for mTBI (consistent with our recommendation for appropriate PTA assessment); size (annual presentation rate 2012); rurality; and type of participation (NET or NET-Plus). Minimisation is essentially a deterministic method and therefore, use of this method can increase the risk of selection bias (Berger. Contemp Clin Trials 2010, 31:406). We plan to reduce the risk of selection bias through inclusion of a random component and allocation of batches of EDs by a statistician independent of the trial. The statistician will be provided with a file containing only ED codes and the minimisation factors (thus no identifying information). For each batch of EDs, the statistician will randomise the order of EDs before using the minimisation algorithm to allocate the EDs to intervention and control groups.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
The primary outcome in the NET trial is appropriate PTA screening. In the calculation of sample size for this outcome, adjustment needs to be made for the clustered nature of the design. The variance inflation factor, or design effect, used to achieve this is a function of the average cluster size, variation in cluster size, and the intra-cluster correlation (ICC). 

The assumed ICC was calculated from two sources reporting ICCs from various datasets.Thirty three ICC estimates for process measures in secondary care were available, and the median ICC was 0.18. The variation in cluster size was incorporated into the sample size calculation through an estimate of the coefficient of variation (CV; 0.47), calculated from annual attendance at EDs across 170 hospitals in Australia (2009). 

There were no studies providing estimates of rates of compliance for our primary outcome in adult populations. We therefore undertook a retrospective audit of two Australian metropolitan EDs. The estimated rates of appropriate PTA screening were 0% in one hospital, and 31% for a second (which had an mTBI protocol in place).  We expected that hospitals without a protocol for mTBI would be more interested in participating in the trial, and therefore calculated our sample size based on a control group rate of 10%. We wish to detect an absolute increase in the rate of appropriate PTA screening of at least 20%. Based on the mentioned assumptions, we will require 15 EDs per intervention group. A total of 30 EDs will provide 900 patient participants for whom ED staff management will be assessed. Allowing for 10% attrition in EDs, we plan to initially recruit 17 EDs per intervention group. 

Effectiveness analysis:
The effectiveness of the intervention on management outcomes, predictors of management outcomes, and patient outcomes will be estimated with marginal modelling using generalised estimating equations (GEEs). These models will appropriately account for correlation of responses of individuals within EDs. 

Models will include adjustment for minimisation factors and pre-specified potential confounding variables. All pre-specified confounders will be included in the models even when no baseline imbalance exists. In addition, for continuous outcomes which are collected at both baseline and follow-up we will include the baseline measure of the outcome in the model. 

Estimates of intervention effect from these models with binary outcomes will yield odds ratios. To aid interpretability, we plan to also provide estimates of risk differences. Estimates of risk differences will be computed from marginal probabilities estimated from the fitted logistic models.
All tests will be two-sided and carried out at the 5% level of significance. A full statistical analysis plan will be developed and written prior to undertaking any data analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Head injury is a very common presentation to emergency departments (EDs). Up to 15% of patients with mild head injury experience persistent disabling problems (e.g. reduced cognitive and functional ability, heightened emotional distress, and delayed return to work or school). As the ED is the main, and often only, point of medical contact for these patients, the care they receive in the ED can impact on these patients outcomes. 

The NET-Trial is a cluster randomised trial which aims to test the effectiveness of a targeted, theory and evidence-informed implementation intervention regarding the management of adult mild head injured patients in the ED in Australia. Three recommendations from clinical practice guidelines have been selected as the focus of the study and they are 1) prospective assessment for post traumatic amnesia (PTA) using a validated tool; 2) appropriate computed tomography (CT) scanning based on risk criteria; and 3) the provision of patient information upon discharge from the ED. The 3 key evidence-based recommendations have been decided after a systematic review of the evidence and available clinical guidelines, and consultation with the ED community. EDs will be randomised to receive either the intervention or to a control group who will have access to the clinical practice guideline alone. The control group will be offered to receive the intervention component of the study following data collection. 

In addition, EDs will be invited to participate in the NET-Plus trial that also includes patient outcomes to investigate whether improved management as a result of our intervention is translated into improved patient outcomes.</summary>
