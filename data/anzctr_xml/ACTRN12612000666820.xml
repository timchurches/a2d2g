    <summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intravitreal Aflibercept in the treatment of choroidal neovascularisation secondary to age-related macular degeneration.
The hypothesis of this study is that intravitreal Aflibercept injection may be effective in causing resolution of persistent sub or intraretinal fluid in patients with previous treatment of Lucentis or Avastin.</summary>
