    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LEE011
Treatment: drugs - LGX818

Experimental: Phase Ib - Phase Ib will randomize 18 patients with BRAF mutant melanoma, who are naïve or who have progressed on prior therapy to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of LEE011 and LGX818.

Experimental: Phase II arm 1a - Phase II arm 1a will randomize 60 patients that are naïve to prior BRAF inhibitor therapy to LGX818+LEE011 to evaluate the effect of adding LEE011 to a BRAFi in this population.

Experimental: Phase II arm 1b - Phase II arm 1b will randomize 30 patients to LGX818. Single agent anti-tumor activity of LGX818 is comparable to other BRAFi that are either approved or in clinical trials. This single agent anti-tumor activity will be compared to that of the combination (LEE011 + LGX818) in the BRAFi naïve patient population.

Experimental: Phase II arm 2 - Phase II arm 2 will evaluate a single arm LEE011+LGX818 in 40 patients resistant to prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Single agent LGX818 has shown limited activity in patients with melanoma who have failed prior BRAF inhibitor treatment; the contribution of LEE011 in this combination will be evaluated.


Treatment: drugs: LEE011
LEE011 will be administered orally, once daily for 21 consecutive days followed by a 7-day planned break (28-day cycle).

Treatment: drugs: LGX818
LGX818 will be administered orally, once daily on a continuous dosing schedule (28-day cycle).
