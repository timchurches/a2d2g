  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with acute stroke and dysphagia who are referred for swallowing assessment will be managed under current clinical care protocols. These include a cranial nerve exam, informal assessment of cognition and communication, and cough reflex testing. If a patient passes the cough reflex test, bedside evaluation of oral intake will also be undertaken. This entire process is completed by a speech-language therapist.

Cough reflex testing involves the presentation of aerosoled citric acid solutions (0.8 and 1.2 mol/L) diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride via a facemask and nebuliser. Each presentation last for 15 seconds. Initially, a placebo (0.9% sodium chloride), is presented in order to demonstrate the test to the patient. Then, the lowest dose of citric acid is presented to the patient for 15 sec with the instructions "cough if you feel the need to cough". Presence/absence and strength of cough is documented. This process is repeated 3 times, with 30 sec between presentations to prevent tachyphylaxis. The patient is then asked to try and suppress the cough. The ability to suppress constitutes a failed response. In case of such a response, the test is repeated at 1.2 mol/L. A speech-language therapist trained in cough reflex testing administers the test.

The results of cough reflex testing rigidly dictate subsequent swallowing managment. Patients who present at least 2 out of 3 present, strong reflexive coughs and who cannot suppress at 0.8 and/or 1.2 mol/L proceed to oral trials at bedside. Patients who present with 2/3 weak or absent reflexive coughs, or who are able to suppress their cough at 1.2 mol/L remain nil by mouth, and are referred for an instrumental assessment of swallowing (videofluoroscopy). 

A subgroup of patients (n = 102) will also undergo cough reflex threshold testing. The methods for this are identical to those described above, with the addition of two further concentrations of citric acid (0.6 and 1.0 mol/L). Citric acid will be presented from lowest dose to highest. The lowest concentration that elicits at least 2/3 strong reflexive coughs will be considered the patient's cough threshold, and the test will stop. A sample of oral mucosa will also be obtained in this subgroup using oral swabs. A speech-language therapist trained in these techniques will perform the test and obtain the samples. 

Outcome measures will be taken upon discharge from acute stroke unit (approx 7-10 days) and at 3 months. The primary outcomes of interest are presence/absence of pneumonia, S. mitis and S. pneumonia. The relationship between pneumonia, oral bacteria, and cough reflex threshold will also be quantified. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients with diagnosed pneumonia at the data collection points. Specifically, three or more of the following variables result in a diagnosis of pneumonia: fever (&gt;38 degrees celcius), productive cough with purulent sputum, abnormal respiratory examination (tachypnea [&gt;22/min], tachycardia, inspiratory crackles, bronchial breathing), abnormal chest radiograph, arterial hypoxemia (PO2 &lt;70 mm Hg), and isolation of a relevant pathogen (positive gram stain and culture). The primary outcome will be determined by a physician. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients whose saliva samples show presence of S.mitis and/or S.pneumonia. Real time quantitative PCR will be used to measure the relative genomic presence of the targeted bacteria.  The relative quantity of the target bacteria is determined using the analytical macro Normalization of SAS software. The underlying algorithm of this macro to determine the relative quantity is the comparative CT delta delta Ct method</outcome>

After an evaluation by the clinical advisory board for this project and hospital neurologists across NZ, a relative risk reduction of 40% was considered clinically significant and achievable for this study. On this basis, using a binomial proportion test, a sample size of 284 patients will achieve nominal 90% statistical power to detect a relative risk reduction of 40%, adjusted for 15% drop out (from the 2009 trial). 

For the substudy investigating the relationship between oral bacteria and cough reflex sensitivity, a subgroup of 102 patients will achieve nominal 90% statistical power to detect a medium effect (d = 0.5), adjusted for 15% drop out.</statisticalmethods>
