  <interventions>
    <interventions>There were 2 randomizations, ie a 2x2 factorial trial:

One randomization was to receiving generic alendronate 70mg weekly per oral for 3 months or proprietary alendronate 70mg weekly per oral for 3 months

The second randomization was to being informed of taking, either generic alendronate 70mg weekly  or proprietary alendronate 70mg weekly per oral for 3 months. Participants were informed verbally by research staff and by labeling on medication container.

    <sequence>A pseudo random number was generated for 200 potential participants using Microsoft Excel (2010).   Within blocks of variable size (8-16) the random numbers were sorted and those potential participants within each rank quartile were allocated to separate treatment/information groups</sequence>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Two primary analyses will be undertaken:

i. An evaluation of tolerability will be undertaken by comparing the proportion of participants who report at least one adverse event in the treatment groups, using Fishers exact test.  Tolerability will also be evaluated by comparing symptom scores in the treatment groups. These scores are likely to be non-parametrically distributed and therefore a Wilcoxon independent groups test will be performed. Further analysis will compare symptom severity scores between treatment groups.

ii. An evaluation of efficacy will be undertaken by comparing change in beta-CTX at 3 months in the treatment groups.

For both tolerability and efficacy equivalence intervals will be calculated for each endpoint and formal tests of equivalence performed by testing two sets of one-sided hypotheses. 

All tests will be two tailed and a 5% significance level maintained.  Data analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a 3 month prospective randomized 2x2 factorial trial of generic vs proprietary alendronate. 200 participants meeting the admission criteria will be randomly and equally allocated to 4 treatment groups, according to formulation of trial medication (proprietary or generic) and knowledge of formulation (proprietary or generic). Subjects will undergo baseline assessments of medication sensitivity, symptoms, and biochemical markers of bone turnover.  Symptom scores will be measured at 2, 6 and 12 weeks. Markers of bone turnover will be measured at 12 weeks. Adherence self-report and tablet counts will be undertaken at the conclusion of the trial.</summary>
