    <interventions>HSV-2 DNA Vaccine
Two injection regimens of the HSV-2 DNA vaccine will be compared with placebo, administered by intradermal injection as three, 4-weekly doses followed by a 6-month booster. The first injection regime will consist of subjects receiving an injection to each forearm.  Once this is fully allocated, the second injection regime will commence recruiting.  The second injection regime consists of two injections into the one forearm. Each injection will contain a dose of 500 mcg </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo vaccine
Two injection regimens of the placebo vaccine will be compared with the active vaccine, administered by intradermal injection as three, 4-weekly doses followed by a 6-month booster. The first injection regime will consist of subjects receiving an injection to each forearm.  Once this is fully allocated, the second injection regime will commence recruiting.  The second injection regime consists of two injections into the one forearm. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety. Possible adverse events include erythema, induration and pain at the injection site</outcome>
      <timepoint>The incidence and severity of adverse events in each treatment group, including vaccine related adverse events will be measured from enrollment until approximately 6 months after the booster injection. Possible adverse events include injection site reactions.  The Principal Investigator will closely monitor these.  There will also be a Data Safety Monitoring Review Committee that will meet regularly</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunogenicity. Immune responses to HSV gD2 antigens will be measured using ELISA and ELISPOT assays</outcome>
      <timepoint>Antibody responses will be measured prior to vaccination and 4 weeks after each vaccination. Cell mediated responses will be measured at baseline and 1 week after each vaccination and at end of study visit 6 months post final vaccination</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of the HSV-2 DNA vaccine. We will also investigate whether the vaccine is immunogenic i.e. if it has any effect on the immune system and what type of response is induced. The study will also investigate the vaccines effectiveness in combating and/or treating HSV-2 infection</summary>
