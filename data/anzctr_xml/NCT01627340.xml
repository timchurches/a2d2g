Experimental: Diabetes Group - Subjects diagnosed with type 2 diabetes within the five year period before study start who received 3 doses of Engerix-B vaccine (HBV) at 0, 1 and 6 months. The vaccine was administered intramuscularly (IM) into the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.

Active Comparator: Control Group - Subjects with no diagnosis or documented history of diabetes who received 3 doses of Engerix-B (HBV) vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months. The vaccine was administered intramuscularly into the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.


Other interventions: Engerix-B vaccine
3 doses administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid region of the non-dominant arm.
