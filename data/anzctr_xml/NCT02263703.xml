    <interventions>Other interventions - Quadrivalent HPV vaccine

Experimental: HPV vaccine - Quadrivalent HPV vaccine


Other interventions: Quadrivalent HPV vaccine
Three 0.5 mL doses will be given at time 0, 2 months after the 1st dose and then 6 months after the initial dose. For kidney transplant recipients the first dose will be at least 6 months post-transplant.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunogenicity - Indicator:
Geometric mean four fold rises (with 95% confidence intervals) of the vaccine serotype specific IgG antibody in all participants.
Proportion of subjects achieving a 4 fold rise in antibody titre for each serotype. Serum antibody levels will be measured using a Luminex immunoassay.
Analysis: For each individual, the change in log-22FA levels for each serotype pre-post vaccination will be calculated. The average change will then be compared over time for each group and also between healthy and immunosuppressed groups using t-tests. Geometric mean titres of antibody for each serotype will be measured and compared at each follow up interval.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of immunity - Interpretation of Results: Persistance of immunity will be measured over 5 years, as well as the comparison of immunogenicity by immune status.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Genital HPV is the necessary cause for cervical cancer, as well as a major contributing cause
      of several other cancers and conditions. There are now effective vaccines against the main
      oncogenic HPV types, HPV16 and 18.

      Most research and discussion has focused on targeting the vaccine to young women and older
      adolescents. Based on this, a national free HPV vaccination program for adolescent girls
      commenced in 2007, in Australia. However, at the time of commencement, there had been no
      research on the use of this vaccine in immunosuppressed. Therefore, information on the
      immunogenicity, safety and duration of efficacy of HPV vaccine when administered to
      immunosuppressed children is needed. This trial looked at a 3 dose schedule of quadrivalent
      HPV vaccine in a range of immunosuppressed children, with the endpoint being immunogenicity,
      followed for 5 years for duration of immunity.</summary>
