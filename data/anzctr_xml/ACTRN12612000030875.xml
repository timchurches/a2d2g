  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study 3-point bending traction was used, each subject lied in a supine position;, there is vertical load applied by a posterior padded strap between the upper torso and lower pelvis while the upper torso and femur were stabilized by other straps. The patients were having traction three times a week for ten weeks. The traction began at three minutes/session, increased one minute/session to 20minutes, at which time traction was applied for 20minutes/session 
Stretching exercises were performed for erector spine muscles and hamstring muscle holding each movement for 30 seconds. Each exercise was repeated 3 times. The stretching program was performed 3 times a week for 10 weeks.

Application of infrared radiation (wave length 800-1000nm). The patient was assumed the prone lying position where the area to be treated (the paraspinal muscles of the back) was adequately exposed, supported and relaxed. The lamp was positioned at distance ranged from (50-75cm). The radiation strikes the surface at or near right angle to achieve maximum penetration. The duration of application was fifteen minutes per session 3 times a week for 10 weeks. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess each patients pain perception.

all treatments were administered simultaneously over the10 weeks.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For kinematic data acquisition of lumbar spine:Three sets of lateral lumbar radiograph in flexion and extension view were analyzed according to protocol of Frobin et al (1996). For measuring the sagittal rotational movements between segments L1-L2: L5-S1, we started by defining the midplane which is the line connecting the midpoints between corners for each vertebrae and then the angle between two adjacent vertebrae is calculated by the angle between their midplanes. The value of sagittal rotational motion of any segment is given by the difference of the angle in extension view minus the angle in flexion view .For translational displacements measurement between each adjacent vertebra , we had to draw Perpendiculars from the center points which is the geometric center of four corners onto the bisectrix between the midplane. The difference between the intersection points in the bisectrix line was defined as translational displacement. To correct the radiographic magnification, the displacement measured in millimeters was divided by the mean depth of the caudal vertebra. As previous, the value of translational motion is given by the difference of the displacement in extension view minus the displacement in flexion view.

      <outcome>For pain assessment
It was performed by using VAS, the patients were asked about the perception of pain using a 10 cm line with 0 (no pain) on one end and 10 (worst pain) on the other end. Patients were asked to place a mark along the line to denote their level of pain.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>this study was conducted to investigate the effects of lumbar extension traction on lumbar curve, pain and intervertebral movements in patients with chronic mechanical low back pain (CMLBP). Eighty patients selected had CMLBP with hypolordotic lumbar spine were assigned randomly into two groups of equal number (study and control). Both groups received stretching exercises and infrared radiation; additionally the study group received lumbar extension traction. Absolute rotatory angle (ARA), intervertebral movements, and visual analogue scale (VAS) were measured for all patients at three intervals.
Results:The results revealed a statistically significant difference between groups at two follow-up time points adjusted to baseline value of outcome for translational and sagittal rotational movements of l3-L4,L4-L5,L5-S1, L2-L3(post treatment) and ARA (p&lt;0.01) while there was no significant changes in pain(p=0.1&amp;0.3) and L1-L2 (p=0.072&amp;0.076),L2-L3(at follow up)(p=0.3),and at the same time there was no significant difference between the previous variables adjusted to the group baseline outcome interaction(p&gt;0.01).
Conclusion: It was concluded that lumbar extension traction is beneficial in improving the sagittal lumbar curve, pain, intervertebral movement in CMLBP.</summary>
