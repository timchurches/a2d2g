  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Traffic-Light front-of-pack nutrition label. Traffic-light label uses green, amber and red colours to indicate the relative levels (low, medium and high) of four nutrients (fat, saturated fat, sugar and sodium).
Arm 2: Health Star Rating front-of-pack nutrition label. The label assigns a rating from 0.5 (less healthy) to 5 (most healthy) stars to foods basing on their Health Star Rating score, calculated from energy, fat, sugar and salt content, and adjusted for other components, such as fruit and vegetables.

Intervention details (for Arm 1 &amp; 2):
Mode of administration: delivered via a specially designed smartphone application (app) 
Duration of intervention: four weeks
Frequency: participants will be able to use the smartphone app to view nutrition labels as often as they wish. To view a nutrition label, users scan barcodes of packaged food products using the smartphone camera, and assigned labels instantly appear on the phone screen.
Strategies to improve adherence: Automated reminder messages via the smartphone app will appear three times per week to prompt the participants to use the app.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: Nutrition Information Panel (standard New Zealand nutrition label): numerical nutrition information presented in tabular format.

Control details:

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size estimated was based on difference between groups in mean NPSC score. With the assumption of a standard deviation (SD) of 9.9, which was the actual variance of NPSC scores in a similar Australian branded food composition database, a sample size of approximately 1500 individuals was estimated to provide 80% power at a 5% level of significance (two-sided) to detect a two-unit difference in mean NPSC score between either of the intervention arms and the control group, with adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Treatment evaluations will be performed on the principle of intention to treat, with randomised participants analysed according to the treatment to which they were assigned, regardless of whether they received the treatment or not. No imputation will be undertaken. For the primary outcome, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) regression models will be used to compare intervention and control groups, adjusting for baseline NPSC, age, gender and ethnicity (Maori, Pacific, Other). A similar approach will be used for continuous secondary outcomes. Repeated measures mixed models will be used to evaluate treatment effects over time. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Governments throughout the world are considering  implementing front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition labelling systems. FOP labels provide at a glance information that is easy for consumers to understand and act upon. There is now substantial global evidence indicating that interpretative FOP labels (using graphics, symbols or colours) are better understood than traditional quantitative
nutrition labels (Campos et al., 2011). However, research on the impact of FOP labels on food purchases and consumption is greatly needed (Signal et
al., 2012). 
The aim of this study is to assess the effects of two interpretive FOP nutrition labels, compared with a standard non-interpretive numerical label, on the healthiness of consumer food purchases in supermarkets and other retail outlets in New Zealand. 
In this study, two types of FOP labels (Traffic Lights (TL) and Health Star Rating) are compared with a nutrition information panel, which is a current mandatory labelling standard in New Zealand. Several studies suggest that the TL is the best understood FOP label (Signal et al., 2012; Hawley et al., 2013). Health Star Rating labelling will be introduced as a voluntary FOP labelling in Australia. 
Because it is impossible to apply the front-of-pack labels to be tested to actual food products in supermarkets and other stores, all labels to be tested in the trial will be delivered via download of a smartphone application. The application will be active during the 4 weeks of the study intervention only. 
The application will be used in the following way:
(1) Participants open the application on their smartphone;
(2) They position the smartphone camera over the barcode of a packaged food product;
(3) The camera acquires the barcode image and immediately provides the products nutrition information in one of the following onscreen label formats:
Traffic Light Label, Health Star Rating Label or Nutrition Information Panel.
