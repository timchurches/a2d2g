  <interventions>
    <interventions>On arrival the participants have a cannula inserted into a vein and an injection of iodine based contrast (dose of which is dependent on participants' weight.  This is usually approximately 100mls of Omnipaque 350 mgI/ml).  Following this (approximately 3-5 minutes later) the participant is asked to stand still in front of the x-ray machine whilst images are taken.  The entire study takes approximately 10 minutes from the time of the injection.  A log of the contrast administered to each participant will be kept.  
Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography is performed using special equipment that produces high and low energy XRays and is able to logarithmically subtract these images to produce a processed image that shows areas of contrast enhancement within the breast tissue.</interventions>
    <comparator>The standard of care is tomosynthesis of the breast and also breast ultrasound.
The tomosynthesis scan is a type of mammogram in which the XRay tube moves in an arc over the breast whilst a series of images are obtained. This produces images that look like  "slices" through the tissue, removing overlapping structrues to show possible underlying abnormalities more clearly. Usually two views are obtained of the breast in which the possible abnormality was noted on the screening mammogram.
The breast is compressed for the  tomosynthesis scan just as it is for a standard mammogram. Each scan takes only a few seconds more than a standard mammogram. A tomosynthesis study of one breast usually involves two views and  takes approximately four minutes (including the time taken by the radiographer to position the breast) to complete.
During this study, the tomosythesis scan and the contrast enhanced scans are performed in quick succession whilst the breast is compressed for each mammographic image, This combined examination takes approximately 90 seconds per view, with two views per breast being obtained as standard.
Breast ultrasound involves the participant lying on her back, Warm ultrasound gel is placed in the breast surface and a hand held probe is gently run across the skin. Sound waves are used to produce images of the breast tissue. The ultrasound scan of both breast takes approximately 15-20 minutes to perform and does not involve the use of any radiation.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of performing contrast enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) in comparison with the standard of care tests (which are breast tomosynthesis and ultrasound) for the detection of breast cancer in women with dense breast tissue. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 to 65, have dense breast tissue  and have been recalled for further investigation of least one non-calcified finding on a screening mammogram. 
Study details:
As part of standard care investigations, all participants enrolled in this trial will undergo tomosynthesis  of the breast in which a possible abnormality has been found and an ultrasound scan of both breasts. The tomosynthesis study is a type of mammogram that is able to show the breast tissue slices, As part of this trial, a contrast enhanced spectral mammogram  is being tested.  This involves the injection of a dye into a vein, followed by two mammogram pictures of each breast taken 2-4 minutes later. The specialised equipment  used for the CESM study is able to take mammograms at two different energy levels as well as performing the normal tomosynthesis study. 
This CESM study is taken at the same time as the tomosynthesis scan and the combined tomosynthesis and CESM study will take about 12  minutes from the  start of the injection to completion of the pictures. 
During this  study, the injection will be given first with the participant seated. Two to four minutes later  the participant is asked to stand and mammograms of both breasts will be taken with the breasts gently compressed. The tomosynthesis mammograms are taken first, immediately followed by the contrast enhanced mammogram. The tomosynthesis and CESM scans are both taken during the same episode of breast compression ie each breast is only compressed once for each of the views that is taken. Having the CESM scan will mean the breast is compressed for approximately one extra minute longer per view than for a tomosythesis only scan.
Researchers will  compare the results of the CESM scans to the  results from the tomosynthesis and ultrasound scans.  Based on all results available, the physician will then make a decision as to whether any further tests, such as a needle biopsy are needed. The treating doctor will be asked to rate their level of confidence in the diagnosis made, and researchers will follow-up to assess whether performing the CESM scan was able to reduce the need for further tests such as needle biopsy and ultrasound. It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether CESM may be a useful and feasible tool to aid in the diagnosis of breast cancer in women with dense breasts and help prevent unnecessary extra tests.</summary>
