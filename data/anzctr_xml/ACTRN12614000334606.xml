  <interventions>
    <interventions>400 IU oral daily vitamin D (cholecalciferol) daily for 10 months. . Participants will be asked to return all empty/un-used bottles to the investigators or delegate in order to assess compliance with medication. Bottles will be weighed before and after use. Researcher will record the number of missed doses reported by mothers. Participants will be informed that extra vitamin D supplementation should not be administered to their infant because of the potential risk of vitamin D excess in those randomised to supplementation.</interventions>

    <concealment>infants aged 6-8 weeks will be enrolled at Local Government Immunisation Centres. Women attending council run immunisation sessions for their infantâ€™s 6-8 weeks immunisation will be given information about the study including what participation involves by a research assistant and asked to consider including their baby in the study.A web-based system will be used to generate a randomised treatment allocation and to communicate this allocation online, via email or SMS text messaging to the relevant study investigator. </concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a design based on permutated blocks of variable length sizes to ensure a balanced treatment allocation over time and, in particular, season of the year.The web-based system will be designed and overseen by CI Gurrin at the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health. The web-based system will be administered by the trial statistician.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Estimation
A study design with 80% power to detect a 32.5% reduction with vitamin D supplementation in challenge-proven food allergy at 12 months of age from 10.00% (the observed prevalence in the HealthNuts study) to 6.75% requires a sample size of 1205 infants in each randomisation group, so 2410 infants in total. Assuming 80% follow-up at 12 months of age, the number required for recruitment to account for attrition is 1205/0.80 = 1506 infants in each randomisation group, so 3012 in total. Using formula feeding from birth as a possible proxy for vitamin D supplementation, within the HealthNuts study there was a 43% lower prevalence (95% confidence interval 16% to 65%) of food allergy for infants fully formula fed from birth (n=273, 7.4% food allergic) compared with infants still breastfed at 12 months of age (n=1439, 13.5% food allergic), suggesting that attributing to vitamin D supplementation a one-third reduction in the prevalence of food allergy is plausible.
Statistical analysis will be overseen by the trial statistician CI Gurrin. The vitamin D group will be compared to the placebo group by an intention-to-treat analysis. For the primary outcome measure, differences between the 2 randomisation groups will be analysed using chi-square tests and ORs with 95% confidence intervals. Secondary analysis using multivariable logistic regression with adjustment for possible confounders particularly any occurring post randomisation, will be undertaken to obtain more precise estimate of the treatment effect. The analysis will be repeated by per protocol method (including infants fully breastfed for at least 6 months and fully compliant with the randomisation) to take into account actual vitamin D dosage. We will also perform an analysis by actual serum 25(OH)D levels. This approach will be extended to include a consideration of the variation in vitamin D binding protein levels by ethnicity.  Number needed to treat and the 95% confidence intervals will also be calculated.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergic disease in our population, as it has a substantial adverse impact on the health of children both now and in later life.  Our studies have recently found Australia to have the highest prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with a staggering 10% of infants having challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne Australia. Furthermore, strong evidence from our research and others indicates that food allergy is the  earliest manifestations of the atopic marchwith 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to develop respiratory allergic diseases later in life. 

Our NHMRC-funded HealthNuts cohort study in 12 month old infants was the first to show a direct association between vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) and an increased risk of challenge-proven food allergy (the gold standard for diagnosis). These results support numerous ecological studies from both our group and others that show an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the equator suggesting a link with decreased UV exposure and vitamin D levels. This association is biologically plausible since vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the immune system in early life. Given this evidence, routine supplementation of vitamin D in infants may be the first simple, preventative strategy to be employed on a population basis that can significantly reduce the risk of allergic disease.

Several countries in the Northern hemisphere have recommended universal infant vitamin D supplementation in the absence of large scale trials proving either efficacy for disease prevention or safety to protect against toxic levels. Australia is ideally placed to answer this globally important question since unlike the USA, Canada and Europe, there are no population recommendations for routine infant supplementation with vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that does not routinely supplement the food chain supply with vitamin D. Remarkably, there has never been a population-based trial of infant vitamin D supplementation sufficiently powered to address the impact on any disease outcome, let alone allergic disease.
