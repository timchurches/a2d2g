Per RECIST 1.1, progressive disease is defined as =20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of =5 mm. Note: The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to approximately 2 years</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Experiencing an Adverse Event (AE) - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Discontinuing Study Treatment Due to an AE - An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study treatment which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study treatment or protocol-specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the study treatment or protocol-specified procedure.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change from Baseline at Weeks 12 and 24 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale - The QLQ-C30 quality of life (QOL) questionnaire contains 5 functioning scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea, and pain) and single symptom items (dyspnoea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation and diarrhoea) and perceived financial impact of the disease. Items are scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3= quite a bit, 4=very much). The QLQ-C30 also contains 2 global health status scales that use 7-point scale scoring (1=very poor and 7=excellent). The change from baseline in the 2-item global health status/QOL life scale (range: 2-14) will be presented, with a higher score representing a higher QOL.</outcome>

      <outcome>Time to True Deterioration in the Composite Endpoint of Cough, Chest Pain, and Dyspnea Using the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ-LC13) - The EORTC QLQ-LC13, a supplemental lung cancer-specific module, consists of 13 multi-item and single-item measures of lung cancer-associated symptoms (i.e., coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and side effects from chemotherapy and radiation (i.e., hair loss, neuropathy, sore mouth, and dysphagia). It is scored on a 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). The results of the 6-item composite endpoint of cough, chest pain and dyspnea (range: 6-24) will be presented, with a higher score representing increasing symptom levels.</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus standard
      of care (SOC) chemotherapy (etoposide/platinum [EP]) in participants with newly diagnosed
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) who have not previously received systemic
      therapy for this malignancy.

      The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab+EP prolongs Progression-free Survival
      (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by blinded
      independent central review (BICR) and Overall Survival (OS) compared with placebo+EP in adult
      participants with ES-SCLC.</summary>
