  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention comprises: 

a)	A proactive and structured Outcall program of information and support, delivered by experienced Cancer Council Helpline nurses to carers, that links them to a range of community based supportive care services as required; 

b)	Screening carers for distress and refers those with elevated levels to their GP for follow up psychological services to reduce their burden and improve their psychological health. 

Participants randomised into the Intervention group will be contacted by a Cancer Council Helpline nurse as follows:  
Using a standardized protocol and check list, a Cancer Council Helpline nurse will telephone participants 7-10 days post referral (Outcall One), four weeks later (Outcall Two), with the third outcall (Outcall Three) three months later. 
For each outcall, seven Cancer Helpline outcall attempts over different times (eg 9am-1pm; 1pm-5pm; 5pm-6pm) across different week days over 2 weeks will be undertaken. After seven failed attempts and no response, a person will be declared absent for a particular outcall. No further contact will be made until the next outcall is scheduled. All successful and failed attempts will be documented. Duration of each telephone call will be on average 20 minutes.
During each of the three outcalls, the Helpline nurse will administer the Distress Thermometer (DT) and will then raise six items for further discussion during which tailored information, support and specific carer resources will be provided. The areas selected for discussion have been specifically chosen to achieve the intended outcomes of reduced carer burden, improved psychological health and quality of life and increased health literacy and ability to navigate the health system. The six areas that will be addressed are:
1)	Psychological distress
2)	Health literacy
3)	Health
4)	Family support
5)	Financial support
6)	Practical advice</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group (attention control, usual care) will receive three telephone outcalls by members of the research team at the same time points as the intervention group receives the Outcall program. The purpose of the call will be to remind participants in this group about the availability of the Cancer Helpline.  Participants who choose to contact the Cancer Helpline will not receive the Outcall program but the usual support provided by cancer helpline nurses.</comparator>

Staff members who will be identyfing and approaching eligible participants, will be unaware to which group (intervention or control) the participant will be allocated. In more detail: Carer / patient dyads will be approached by an experienced clinical trials or clinical research centre nurse in the out-patient setting. Each dyad will be given a brief introduction to the study and initial consent will be sought from both individuals for a researcher to contact them. Interested carers /patients will be given a study pack (plain language statement, consent form and baseline questionnaire). Within about 48 hours carers / patients will be contacted by the project coordinator by phone and consent sought. Consenting carer / patient dyads will be asked to complete the consent form and baseline questionnaires and post them to Deakin University. Consenting carer/patient dyads will be randomised into either the intervention group or the control group (usual care with reference to Cancer Helpline) via a computer-generated randomisation scheme produced by the trial statistician.   For carers randomised into the intervention group, their names and phone numbers will be sent to the cancer nurse at the Cancer Council Helpline for subsequent follow up. To ensure the integrity of the trialâ€™s procedures, all study staff and clinical trial / research centre nurses will undergo specific training and quality assurance assessments throughout the study.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on our extensive previous research, the estimates of recruitment rate over the total recruitment indicate we will easily recruit our target sample. We have shown that approximately 70% of cancer patients indicated they had a carer during the treatment phase. Based on the number of new cases (~600/year; Health Services Information Services; 2011), if we assume conservatively that 1/3 of 600 new cases arrive for treatment with a carer at Cycle 2-5 / Fraction 2-10 across the 4 health services, a minimum of 16 carer /patient dyads will be recruited per month. Based on previous experience, we expect an 80% uptake so an overall recruitment phase of approximately 18 months to account for the greater challenge of recruiting the carer/patient dyad. For an 18 month recruitment period with 4 recruiting health services, we need to recruit an average of 4 dyads per month to yield approximately 288 dyads. With an anticipated attrition rate of 20%, this leaves us with around 180 completed dyads, which is sufficient for the planned statistical power of the trial. 

An intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be performed. Analysis of covariance will be used to assess differences in 1 and 6 month outcomes between groups after adjusting for baseline differences. ITT analyses will be based on all [randomized and consented] participants. A dose-response effect will be explored. 
Repeated measures analysis using linear mixed models will assess the constancy of any effects of the Outcall program over time. 
Qualitative analysis techniques will be used for data obtained from the telephone interviews. Thematic analysis from the interviews will be used and results will be discussed according to themes identified from the data. 
A thematic analysis of the interviews with Cancer Council Victoria and Cancer Council South Australia and health service cancer nurses will determine experience of referral process, impact on workload, services utilised and any suggested improvements to the referral process and provision of services for carers. 
Economic Analysis, this evaluation will comprise a cost-consequences analysis where incremental costs of the intervention will be compared with the full spectrum of outcomes included in the study. This means that a series of cost-effectiveness ratios will be determined rather than just one  such an approach has been shown to be useful for decision-makers. The inclusion of the AQoL-8D will also enable a cost-utility analysis to be undertaken, thereby allowing practical judgements to be made regarding the value for money credentials of the intervention. The economic analysis will be primarily from the perspective of the health care sector though and a secondary analysis from the broader societal perspective will also be undertaken. The evaluation will first measure and value any change to the use of health care resources over the period of the study between the two arms of the trial (intervention and control) and then compare any additional costs to the additional outcomes achieved.  Resource use will be accessed via the resource use questionnaire. Standardised economic evaluation techniques will be used including incremental analysis of mean differences and bootstrapping to determine confidence intervals.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating a proactive and structured telephone based intervention for carers of cancer patients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and a carer of a newly diagnosed cancer patient attending chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment with curative intent.

Trial details
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the new telephone based intervention. This is a proactive and structured outcall program of information and support, delivered by experienced Cancer Council Helpline nurses to carers. The Helpline nurse screens carers for distress and links them to a range of community based supportive care services as required. Carers in this group will be contacted by a Cancer Council Helpline nurse at 7-10 days post referral (Outcall One), four weeks later (Outcall Two), and three months later (Outcall Three). 
Participants in the second group will receive three telephone outcalls at the same timepoints as group one. The purpose of the calls is to remind participants about the availability of the Cancer Helpline. Participants who choose to contact the Cancer Helpline will not receive the Outcall program but the usual support provided by cancer helpline nurses.

Carers will complete questionnaires at Baseline, 1 month and 6 months, and patients will be complete questionnaires at Baseline and 1 month, in order to evaluate carer burden, psychological health, carers ability to navigate health services, quality of life, unmet needs, and cost-effectiveness.
