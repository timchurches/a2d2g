  <interventions>
    <interventions>The primary intervention for this study is humidified high flow (HHF) air via nasal canulae  during sleep. The air will be delivered at 100% relative humidity. No additional oxygen will be used. This is a crossover study and participants will receive in randomised order i) five nights of usual care and ii) five nights of HHF therapy in addition to usual care. HHF will be delivered at an individualized rate of between 20 and 45 L/min depending on participant weight. The study will be conducted in the participant's home. Adherence will not be monitored. Treatment acceptability will be assessed by questionnaire. </interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator is usual treatment (no placebo). This will be determined by the usual treating phsyician and consists of twice daily chest physiotherapy with oral vitamin and calorific supplemenation. Participants may be on oral azithromycin. Some participants will continue on their usual nebulised pulmozyme,  hypertonic saline or nebulised antibiotics. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 3000 people in New Zealand. CF results in thickened airway mucus which causes infection, inflammation and loss of lung function with gradual onset of respiratory failure. Individuals with CF have poor growth and failure to thrive occuring through malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble nutrients, but also through increased energy expenditure with  increased work of breathing. Unlike healthy controls, persons with CF have an increased respiratory rate and work of breathing during sleep. Reducing this may have long term benefits in improving respiratory health, weight gain and overall quality of life.

Humidified high flow air via nasal prongs (HHF) is a novel but increasingly utilized treatment to decrease work of breathing. It is currently used in the hospital setting, but is a relatively easy treatment to deliver in the home. HHF delivers  flows up to 70 L/min via nasal prongs and if delivered through sleep  may benefit persons  with CF by :
i)	Reducing the work of breathing through reduced upper airway resistance and dead space
ii)	Improving oxygenation 
iii)	 Increasing hydration of airway secretionsimproving airway secretion clearance 
As well as short term benefits  these could result in more substantial long term benefits with improved weight gain and reduced respiratory infections  both directly associated with disease prognosis. 

The Starship Respiratory Department is the national centre for children with CF, and the national centre for sleep and home respiratory support providing  outreach to other hospitals around New Zealand. 
In this - initial randomised controlled cross-over study, we will determine the effect  of HHF compared to a usual night of unsupported sleep  in 15 young  persons with CF on respiratory rate, work of breathing, and other physiological parameters as well as measuring sleep quality. We will also determine the acceptability of having this support in the home. If effective and acceptable this will inform  the development  of a larger multi-centre study measuring the effect of HHF on longerterm outcomes such as weight gain, respiratory infections , ability to exercise, quality of life, and general well-being. HHF is potentially an effective new treatment to be used in the home to prevent disease progression and improve longevity.
