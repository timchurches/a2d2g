  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will present themselves to the hospital Assessment area at 07.30 on the day of their scheduled induction of labour. The research midwife will confirm their consent to participate in the trial. They will then be randomized to the intervention or control group. Women in the intervention group will then receive an explanation of the balloon insertion procedure from the doctor or midwife on duty and have an opportunity to ask questions. The foley balloon is the device which will be used. It is a flexible catheter that is threaded up the cervical canal, and the balloon inflated just above the internal os with 30mL sterile water. This requires the woman to be in lithotomy position on a gynaecological procedure table.  The procedure takes five minutes and will be performed by the doctor on duty, Afterwards, the woman will be asked to rate her discomfort during the procedure (VAS score) and will then be discharged from hospital with an information sheet on what to expect, when to return to hospital and a phone number to ring if concerned. If the balloon falls out, or if contractions start, or if she has spontaneous rupture of membranes, she would be instructed to return to hospital. If no concerns, she will return to hospital the following day at 06.30 and the balloon will be removed by the midwife on duty. Then the induction will be continued as clinically appropriate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will present themselves to the hospital Assessment area at 07.30 on the day of their scheduled induction of labour. The research midwife will confirm their consent to participate in the trial. They will then be randomized to the intervention or control group. Women in the control group will then receive an explanation of the prostaglandin vaginal gel insertion procedure from the doctor or midwife on duty and have an opportunity to ask questions. The prostaglandin gel comes in two different doses. This first dose will be given as per study protocol (1mg for multipara or 2mg for nullipara). The gel is placed in the vagina by the midwife or doctor on duty at the same time as a routine cervix examination, and takes an extra one to two minutes. Afterwards, the woman will be asked to rate her discomfort during the procedure (VAS score). She will remain in hospital for the next six hours, at which point she will be reassessed. Then the induction will be continued as clinically appropriate. If possible for the midwife on duty to perform artificial rupture of membranes, this would be done; if not, a 2mg dose of prostaglandin vaginal gel would be given as per protocol, and reassessment another six hours later. At that point, the midwife on duty will again attempt to perform ARM. If this is not possible, then the doctor on duty will attempt to do so. At any point that the woman starts to feel regular painful uterine tightenings, the midwife will perform a CTG. Following ARM, the woman will be transferred to labour and birthing suite for intravenous oxytocin infusion and monitoring as per local protocols.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be collected electronically from hospital medical records and maternity databases, and from women and staff directly. Data will be entered into a REDCap database which is centralised, online and secure.
Sample size calculation: At Auckland Hospital in 2015, the caesarean section rate in women who had IOL (excluding women with previous caesarean) was 24.8%, almost all of whom had vaginal prostaglandins (as described above in standard care arm of trial). In the small published trial of outpatient vs inpatient balloon IOL, the caesarean section rate decreased by 14%, from 43% to 29%. Based on consultation with local and Australian obstetricians, we felt that a 6% decrease would be a clinically meaningful difference. In consultation with our statisticians, in order to detect a decrease in caesarean section rate from 24.8% to 18.8%, with 80% power and a two-sided type 1 error of 0.05, the sample size required would be 743 women for each study group. Adding a continuity correction, the final sample size is 1,552 women.
Data analysis: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of each group will be described. Analyses will follow the principle of intention-to-treat. Participants will be analysed according to the assigned treatment group at randomisation. Binary endpoints will be analysed using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for the intervention. Continuous outcomes will be modelled using generalised linear models to estimate any changes in outcomes with the intervention compared to the control group. Multivariable models will control for potentially confounding variables and include hospital site. A p value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. We recognise there are a number of secondary outcomes; most will be correlated and thus we plan to report p values for these outcomes without corrections, which would be overly conservative.
Economic evaluation: Economic evaluation: Our approach will be to relate costs to outcomes for both arms of the study, allowing for the calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the primary study outcome  caesarean delivery rate. In addition, a comparative cost analysis will be conducted to demonstrate the budget impact of wide-scale uptake of the intervention, given that length of stay and complication rates are both higher for caesarean birth rates.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Rationale: The induction of labour rate in New Zealand is high. Mechanical methods of induction in hospital are safe and effective. However, most women in New Zealand have induction using pharmacological methods. Trials are needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of outpatient induction with balloon catheter. Outpatient balloon induction has the potential to give women more choice and improve satisfaction, and to save on health care costs, while maintaining safe outcomes for mothers and their babies.

Aim: To compare two management protocols for initial management of induction of labour

Objective: To demonstrate safety, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness for mothers and babies who are allowed to go home after commencing a balloon induction, versus remaining in hospital after commencing a prostaglandin induction.

Design: This will be a multi-centre randomized controlled trial across New Zealand. Women will be identified by clinicians in antenatal clinics when induction of labour is recommended. Women will be included if they have a live singleton cephalic presentation and induction of labour is planned at 37 weeks or more gestation, and excluded if monitoring in hospital is necessary. Eligible women will be recruited by a research midwife and provide written consent to participate. The primary outcome is clinical effectiveness as measured by caesarean section rate. Secondary outcomes include safety as measured by rates of adverse events (placental abruption; stillbirth; neonatal admission to intensive care); cost effectiveness; and maternal and staff satisfaction.

Implications: If outpatient balloon induction is found to be as safe and effective as inpatient prostaglandin induction in low-risk women, then district health boards can incorporate this protocol into their clinical guidelines. Moreover, this evidence-based recommendation can be added to the Auckland Consensus Guideline (2014) which will hopefully become a national guideline following broad consultation, enabling consistency of practice across the country. </summary>
