  <interventions>
    <interventions>Routine drug therapy as perscribed by the treating physician. This may include agents to treat acute gout including Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, colchicine and corticosteroids, and prophylactic agents including allopurinol and probenicid. Each Participant will be observed at two time points, once during acute gout and onbce during intercritical gout. The timing of observation will depend on the natural history of the disease in each patient, however it would be presumed that both observations would occur within a 12 month period. Patients will be reassessed at 2 years with repeat radiographs of joints imaged at baseline ( for clincal reasons) to look for progression of damage</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ultrasound detected synovitis</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be determined when the study subject has completed 2 study visits. These will be one visit during an intercritical period and one visit during a critical period of gout. The timepoints at which outcomes will be assessed depends on the clincial status of the patients, will be variable and  cannot be specified a-priori, however we envisage all patients will complete alla ssessments within a 12 month period from enrolment in the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Samples of serum and urine will be analysed for appropriate biomarkers of synovial inflammation, including hylauronan, C telopeptide of type 11 collagen, and RAGE using ELISA kits</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be determined when the study subject has completed 2 study visits. These will be one visit during an intercritical period and one visit during a critical period of gout.
