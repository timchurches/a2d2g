  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Achieved American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 14 - ACR 20 response is defined as a greater than or equal to 20 percent improvement from baseline in: 1. Swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints) 2. greater than or equal to 50 percentage improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: a. Patient's assessment of pain of pain by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0-10 cm) b.Patient's Global Assessment of Disease activity VAS (0-10 cm) c. Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity VAS (0-10 cm) d. Patient's assessment of physical function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) e. C reactive protein.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 14</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) Score at Week 24 - HAQ is 20-question instrument that assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0 (no difficulty), to 3 (inability to perform a task in that area). The average score across the functional areas yields an overall HAQ score which ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (completely disabled).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0) and Week 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS 28) Using C-reactive Protein (CRP) Response at Week 14 - DAS 28 using CRP is an index to measure the disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis which combines tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), CRP value, and participant's global assessment of disease activity (using a Visual Analog Scale of 0 to 100 mm). The DAS 28 score ranges from 0 (best) to 10 (worst). Participants are considered to have a DAS 28 response if they have a score of &lt;= 3.2 (good response) or &gt; 3.2 to 5.1 (moderate response).</outcome>
