  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single center observational longitudinal case control study that will follow 168 adult patients aged &gt;50 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 50% with left ventricular hypertophy (LVH, case) and 50% without LVH (control).

Baseline testing will include: demographic and medical history questionnaire, measurement of height, weight, waist and hip, echocardiogram, ECG, carotid ultrasound, 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor, cognitive assessment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), physical activity monitor and a blood sample (to determine HbA1c level, APOE genetic risk assessment). 

Participants will return for tests at the 2 year time-point.

    <statisticalmethods>We calculated our sample size in order to include sufficient participant numbers for the primary outcome measures of brain volume and cognitive impairment.. The primary outcome requires a direct comparison of 2 groups: participants with diabetes with and without LVH.  We used a modified retrospective case-control method; i.e., all participants have the exposure (diabetes), which will naturally halve by additional risk factor (LVH, expected prevalence around 50%) but only some of them will develop the primary outcome (cognitive impairment). We used an ANCOVA method to estimate sample size for 4 samples (cognitively impaired LVH, non-cognitively impaired LVH, cognitively impaired non-LVH, non-cognitively impaired non-LVH) with repeated measures, including a correlation score between baseline and follow-up. Using alpha=0.05 (two-sided), power=0.8 and an estimated correlation of 0.1, we estimated that 140 (i.e., 35 in each of 4 groups) participants will be required. Given we expect around 20% attrition due to death or non-participation (unable to participate in testing due to new pacemaker/implanted metal/other medical issue, lost to contact, no longer interested), we have estimated a total recruitment number of 168.

By the nature of the study design, the investigators are blinded to the outcome of interest (brain volume loss and cognitive decline at 2 years). MRI image analysis will be performed by an analyst blinded to the case control status. This will be unblinded when the cohort is complete and statistical analysis is performed. In addition, we have 2 study raters, one who will know details of the patients medical history and the other who will be performing cognitive testing and scales of functional status.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus and dementia are two of the commonest and most disabling conditions worldwide, responsible for an enormous and growing burden of disease. There is increasing awareness that the two conditions are linked, with cognitive impairment (worsening memory, thinking, perception) common in patients type 2 diabetes, and a strong association between type 2 diabetes and Alzheimers disease, the most common form of dementia.  Better markers are needed for the prediction of cognitive decline in people with diabetes. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of the hearts main pumping chamber, which is common in type 2 diabetes. To date there have been no studies on the association between LVH and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes. The purpose of this study is to establish whether people with type 2 diabetes and LVH have increased rates of brain volume changes and cognitive impairment. An understanding of whether LVH is contributing to cognitive decline will allow us to identify patients at particular risk.</summary>
