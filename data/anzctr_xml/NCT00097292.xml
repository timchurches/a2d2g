    <summary>RATIONALE

      The accrual of data from the laboratory and from epidemiologic and prevention trials has
      improved the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM). Genetic and immunologic factors play a key role in the development of T1DM, and
      characterization of the early metabolic abnormalities in T1DM is steadily increasing.
      However, information regarding the natural history of T1DM remains incomplete. The TrialNet
      Natural History Study of the Development of T1DM (Pathway to Prevention Study) has been
      designed to clarify this picture, and in so doing, will contribute to the development and
      implementation of studies aimed at prevention of and early treatment in T1DM.

      Purpose:

      TrialNet is an international network dedicated to the study, prevention, and early treatment
      of type 1 diabetes. TrialNet sites are located throughout the United States, Canada, Finland,
      United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand. TrialNet is dedicated to
      testing new approaches to the prevention of and early intervention for type 1 diabetes.

      The goal of the TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of Type 1 Diabetes is to
      enhance our understanding of the demographic, immunologic, and metabolic characteristics of
      individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.

      The Natural History Study will screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to identify
      those at risk for developing the disease. Relatives of people with type 1 diabetes have about
      a 5% percent chance of being positive for the antibodies associated with diabetes. TrialNet
      will identify adults and children at risk for developing diabetes by testing for the presence
      of these antibodies in the blood. A positive antibody test is an early indication that damage
      to insulin-secreting cells may have begun. If this test is positive, additional testing will
      be offered to determine the likelihood that a person may develop diabetes. Individuals with
      antibodies will be offered the opportunity for further testing to determine their risk of
      developing diabetes over the next 5 years and to receive close monitoring for the development
      of diabetes.</summary>
