Digits are combined into 5-digit number describing health state. Numbers 1-3 are not added for total score. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) assesses caregiver's impression of participant's overall health state; VAS scores range=0-100, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the original study was to assess the safety of semagacestat in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients during 24 months of open-label treatment. Baseline for the
      efficacy measures is defined as the baseline for feeder studies LFAN (NCT00594568) and LFBC
      (NCT00762411). For all safety analyses (adverse events), baseline for patients will be week 0
      of this study (LFBF).

      Preliminary results from LFAN and LFBC showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression
      and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to
      perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC
      and LFBF have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores,
      for at least seven months. The CT-Registry will reflect results of analyses from the original
      protocol in addition to those from the amended protocol. Very few participants from LFBC
      rolled over into LFBF (N = 9). Due to insufficient sample size, the data for LFBC
      participants who rolled into LFBF were not analyzed.</summary>
