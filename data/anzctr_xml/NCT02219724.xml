  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - MOXR0916

Experimental: MOXR0916: Dose Escalation Stage - Participants in different cohorts (according to MOXR0916 dose received) will receive escalating doses of MOXR0916 to determine the MTD or maximum administered dose (MAD) for 21 to 42 days.

Experimental: MOXR0916: Expansion Stage - Participants in different cohorts (according to different cancer types, prior therapy and mandatory procedures on study) will receive MOXR0916 at the highest dose level that has already been deemed to be tolerable in the dose escalation stage until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurred first (approximately up to 3 years).


Treatment: drugs: MOXR0916
MOXR0916 will be administered as intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MOXR0916 administered
      intravenously in participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors that have
      progressed after all available standard therapy or for which standard therapy has proven to
      be ineffective or intolerable, or is considered inappropriate. This study will consist of a
      screening period, an initial treatment period, a re-treatment period (for participants who
      discontinue MOXR0916 after demonstration of prolonged clinical benefit), and a post-treatment
      follow-up period. Participants will be enrolled in two stages: a dose-escalation stage and an
      expansion stage. The planned duration of the study is approximately 3 years.</summary>
