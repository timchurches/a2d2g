    <interventions>Arm 1: self-guided use of a smartphone app-based intervention for depression.
This group is given access to the intervention materials (via app), with the instructions to complete each of the 12 x 30 minute modules in sequence. It is emphasized that the modules are designed to be paced at one per week.
The treatment material consists of six modules based on 3rd Wave Cognitive and Behavioural approaches to treat negative moods and build personal resilience: (1) Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to identify personal values (2) Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) to uncover and dispute unhelpful thinking styles and their underlying assumptions, (3) Mindfulness Based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (MCBT) to learn to accept negative thoughts without judgment, (4) resilience building to learn to maintain healthy levels of self-esteem, optimism, and to savour acts of kindness and gratitude, (5) Behavioural Activation to increase exposure to positive situations that provide meaning and/or pleasure and, (6) Troubleshooting/Relapse prevention.

Arm 2: app-enhanced use of a smartphone app-based intervention for depression.
This group is also given access to the intervention materials, with the same instructions for self-guided use (i.e., complete one module per week for 12 weeks). However, they are also informed that, based on their scores on the brief app surveys (given up to four times per day, measuring current mood state), they will be invited to undertake brief, additional content (top-up activities) at times of greatest need (i.e., when their depressive mood state scores are elevated they may be recommended to complete a brief relaxation task). These top-up activities are similar to the activities they receive in the online training, but are prompted by scores deemed at risk by the app surveys. Please note, these top-up activities are additional to, rather than substitutes for, the 12 weeks of module content, and participants are encouraged to continue to progress through the 12 modules at the same pace as recommended for Arm 1 participants (regardless of how many times they may engage in top-up activities).

Both groups will have access to the intervention content for 12 weeks. Adherence and usage is monitored by the app for both groups.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control condition (Arm 3):
This group downloads an app that monitors depressive symptoms throughout the duration (12 weeks) of the intervention phase, but does not link to intervention content. This is a more suitable control condition than simply taking baseline and post-intervention measures of depression because the act of filling out ratings of depressed mood throughout the intervention phase (for Arms 1 and 2) may, in itself, be a low-level form of intervention, by enhancing awareness of depressive symptoms.
To mirror the number of assessments given to the intervention conditions, this control group will complete assessments of mood via the app up to 4 times per day for the duration of the intervention phase (12 weeks).</comparator>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Multilevel modelling, with depression scores at the three time points nested within participants, and the effect of time on depression scores allowed to randomly vary across individuals and be predicted by group (Arms 1-3):
Level 1: Yij (depressive symptoms) = b0j + b1j*(time)
Level 2: b0j = b00 + b01*(group)
Level 2: b1j = b11 + b12*(group)

Required sample size of 140 per group for the proposed study was based on a minimum meaningful difference in efficacy of d = .3 between the intervention groups and control condition, with power of .80 and alpha of .05. To allow for a conservative sample attrition estimate of 30%, sample size target of n = 200 per group was set.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare self-guided use of an online intervention resource against BlueWatch-enhanced use of the same content. BlueWatch monitors depressive symptoms throughout the duration of intervention, and uses this information to obtain a risk profile for each participant, which can be used to predict periods of greater risk of depressed mood. In instances where greater risk is identified, participants are recommended to use the intervention resources immediately. It is hypothesized that this guided use will lead to stronger and quicker improvement in depressive symptoms, and due to the tailored nature of the intervention, will have lower dropout rates than self-guided use of the same intervention resources.</summary>
