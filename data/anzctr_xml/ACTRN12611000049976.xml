  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients in the intervention group recieve the endoscopy LDRf type (intervention group)and Japanese type (control group by conventional endoscopy varicosis type)simultaneously to observe patients live rate after EVL therapy.  
EVL was performed by a Wilson-Cook 6 rubber bands from the gastroesophageal junction,the first band was released on the varix about 2 cm beyond the bleeding point, then then the second band was released exactly on the bleeding point and the third band was released 2 cm above the bleeding point. EVL takes 0.5-1 hour each session, once every 2 weeks until esophageal varicosis has disappeared.
  The LDRf type is considered to be an advanced endoscopic methods for GI variceal. LDRf type characterize it: L:Location;D:Diameter;Rf :Risk factor;The therapeutic method are decided by Location and Diameter; The therapeutic occasion is decided by Risk factor.Japanese type  is a conventional type.
   Because LDRf type can decrease the risk after esophagus variceals therapy (e.g. rebleeding,mortality,degree of varices; etc).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many articles have showed that LDRf is a safe and effective alternative type for endoscopic esophagus variceal. But there is still no one,which is prospectively randomized and controlled , to compare LDRf type and conventional type for EV.So our purpose is to compare LDRf type and conventional type for EV in a prospectively randomized and controlled way.</summary>
