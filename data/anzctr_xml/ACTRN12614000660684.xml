  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised cross-over trial of 3 treatment doses of glucose for hypoglycaemia (0.2 g/kg, 0.3 g/kg and 15 g).

As per protocol each treatment is administered as glucose tablets at onset of spontaneously occurring hypoglycaemia, and only repeated at 10 minutes if hypoglycaemia has not resolved. As blood glucose is very dynamic "a wash-out" is not really applicable, and hypoglycaemia had always resolved prior to any repeat episodes. Patients record on the treatment sheet when an episode occurs, what treatment is given and then blood glucose at specified intervals - it si unlikely they would complete the data sheet without adhering to treatment for that episode.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The best treatment for episodes of hypoglycaemia has not been studied in detail and most guidelines have a small evidence base. The study aimed to investigate whether using an individualised dose of glucose, based on weight, rather than a fixed dose  of 15 g, as currently recommended, would be more effective in resolving hypoglycaemia. Adult subjects with T1DM and frequent hypoglycaemia (more than one per week) were enrolled into this study. Treatment for each hypoglycaemia episode, defined as capillary glucose &lt;4.0 mmol/L, was randomly assigned one of three protocols:  0.2 grams/kg and 0.3 grams/kg or15 grams of glucose (Dextro glucose tablets).  Each subject received each treatment in random order for up to 15 hypoglycaemia episodes. Glucose was re-tested 10 minutes after treatment, with a repeat dose if &lt; 4 mmol/L. The study shows 0.3 g/kg treatment dose resulted in a greater change in glucose and higher glucose at 10 minutes, with less need for extra treatment.</summary>
