Diagnosis / Prognosis - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Diagnosis / Prognosis - Viral culture

Experimental: iTreat Flu A+B Test and ellume.lab Flu A+B Test - Upper respiratory tract samples from participants will be tested with:
iTreat Flu A+B Test; ellume.lab Flu A+B Test; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR); and viral culture.


Diagnosis / Prognosis: iTreat Flu A+B Test
The iTreat Flu A+B Test is a rapid in vitro diagnostic test for the detection of influenza A or influenza B in nasal swab samples. The iTreat Flu A+B Test is designed to be simple to use and generates a result within 15 minutes.

Diagnosis / Prognosis: ellume.lab Flu A+B Test
The ellume.lab Flu A+B Test is an in vitro diagnostic test intended to be used at point-of-care for the detection of influenza A or influenza B in nasal swab samples. The ellume.lab Flu A+B Test generates a result within 10 minutes.

Diagnosis / Prognosis: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is a molecular diagnostic technique for the detection and identification of influenza viruses, both for clinical samples and isolates. The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) allows template viral RNA to be reverse transcribed producing complementary DNA (cDNA) which can then be amplified and detected.

Diagnosis / Prognosis: Viral culture
Nasopharyngeal samples will be inoculated into appropriate culture media for influenza viral culture. In this test, the virus is actually grown and further identified in the laboratory as influenza A or B.

    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the
      iTreat Flu A+B Test and the ellume.lab Flu A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B
      as compared to viral culture.

      The secondary aims are to:

      Validate the sensitivity and specificity of the iTreat Flu A+B Test and the ellume.lab Flu
      A+B Test in detecting influenza A and influenza B as compared to Reverse Transcriptase
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR).

      Evaluate the correct interpretation of the iTreat Flu A+B Test by subjects with
      influenza-like symptoms.

      Evaluate the subjects' satisfaction with the convenience, comfort and ease of use of the
      iTreat Flu A+B Test.

      Evaluate the operators' satisfaction with the ease of use of the ellume.lab Flu A+B Test.</summary>
