  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ambulatory care - patient will be discharged on day 2 following diagnosis. A nurse will visit to assist with/supervise morning and evening insulin administration for 48 hours following discharge. A diabetes educator and a dietitian will visit on two occasions and a diabetes educator and a social worker will visit on one occasion over the two week period following discharge to complete education and pyschosocial review that would normally be done during inpatient hospital stay. Each visit will be approximately 2 hours in duration. Phone support will be available 24 hours a day to all ambulatory care patients for the two week period following discharge.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is trialling a new model of care for children and adolescents newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Currently children remain in hospital for an average of 5-6 days while they receive initial stabilisation, commencement of insulin therapy and intensive education. Under the model being trialled, children will be discharged on day 2 after admission and will receive nursing support and education at home over a period of two weeks. They will continue to be under the care of an endocrinologist during this time and phone support will be available at all times. We will be assessing a range of clinical measures, patient satisfaction, knowledge, adjustment and quality of life in order to detemine whether this model of care is the same, better or worse than the existing one in terms of patient outcomes.</summary>
