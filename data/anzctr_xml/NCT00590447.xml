  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - rituximab monotherapy
Treatment: drugs - sequential R-CHOP

Experimental: A - All patients will receive 4 courses of rituximab on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients achieving a CR after the first 4 applications of single agent rituximab (evaluated between day 40 to 50) will go on with 4 further courses of single agent rituximab on days 50, 72, 94 and 116.

Experimental: B - All patients will receive 4 courses of rituximab on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Patients who do not achieve a CR after the first 4 applications of single agent rituximab (evaluated between day 40 to 50) will go on with 4 courses of R-CHOP on days 50, 72, 94 and 116.


Treatment: drugs: rituximab monotherapy
375 mg/m2, IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 50, 72, 94 and 116. In case of disease progression during the first 4 administration of rituximab antibody or the 4 weeks interval between course 4 and 5 the patients directly enter R-CHOP chemotherapy (Arm B).

Treatment: drugs: sequential R-CHOP
375 mg/m2 rituximab, IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 50, 72, 94 and 116. Cyclophosphamid 750 mg/m2, adriamycine 50 mg/m2 and vincristine 1.4mg/m2, IV and prednisone 50mg/m2, PO every 3 weeks at days 50, 72, 94 and 116.
In case of disease progression during the first 4 administration of rituximab antibody or the 4 weeks interval between antibody and R-CHOP administration the patients directly enter R-CHOP chemotherapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase-II trial will investigate the efficacy, safety and the tolerability of a
      sequential therapy consisting of 4 courses of single agent rituximab followed by 4 courses of
      R-CHOP chemotherapy in patients with CD20+ posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders
      (PTLD). However, responders to rituximab achieving a CR after the first 4 applications of
      rituximab will go on with rituximab monotherapy and will not receive chemotherapy.</summary>
