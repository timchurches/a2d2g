    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patients are eligible for INCLUSION in the study if ALL the following criteria are
             met:

               1. At time of the patient's admission to the ICU the treating ICU specialist expects
                  the patient will require treatment in the ICU that extends beyond the calendar
                  day following the day of admission.

               2. Patient has an arterial line in situ or placement of an arterial line is imminent
                  (within the next hour) as part of routine ICU management.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Patients will be EXCLUDED from the study if ONE or MORE of the following criteria are
        present:

          1. Age &lt; 18 years.

          2. Imminent death (cardiac standstill or brain death anticipated in less than 24 hours)
             and the treating clinicians are not committed to full supportive care. This should be
             confirmed by a documented treatment-limitation order that exceeds a
             "not-for-resuscitation" order.

          3. Patients admitted to the ICU for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar
             state.

          4. Patient is expected to be eating before the end of the day following admission

          5. Patients who have suffered hypoglycaemia without documented full neurological
             recovery.

          6. Patient thought to be at abnormally high risk of suffering hypoglycaemia ( e.g. known
             insulin secreting tumour or history of unexplained or recurrent hypoglycaemia or
             fulminant hepatic failure)

          7. If a patient has previously been enrolled in the NICE-SUGAR Study (patients cannot be
             enrolled in the NICE-SUGAR Study more than once).

          8. If the patient can not provide prior informed consent, there is documented evidence
             that the patient has no legal surrogate decision maker and it appears unlikely that
             the patient will regain consciousness or sufficient ability to provide delayed
             informed consent

          9. The patient has been in the study ICU or another ICU for longer than 24 hours for this
             admission.

        There is no upper age limit for inclusion into the study unless any of the specific
        exclusion criteria are present.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of the two blood glucose targets on 90
      day all-cause mortality in Intensive Care patients who are predicted on admission to stay in
      the ICU for at least one full calendar day. The hypothesis is that there is little difference
      in the relative risk of death between patients assigned a glucose range of 4.5 - 6.0 mmol/L,
      and those assigned a glucose range of less than 10.0 mmol/L with insulin being infused if
      blood glucose exceeds 10.0 mmol/L, and adjusted when needed to maintain blood glucose of 8.0
      - 10.0 mmol/L.</summary>
