  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised double-blind, controlled study conducted within a clinical setting with a parallel arm design. Participants randomised to the intervention group will receive a high flavanol content drink (494 mg) consumed twice a day (2 x 494 mg/day, i.e. total of 988 mg/day) for 24 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Particants randomised to the comparator group will consume very low flavanol drinks(29 mg) twice a day (2 x 29 mg.day i.e. 58 mg/day) for 24 weeks.</comparator>

    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to test whether a supplement containing a specific component of cocoa (called flavanol) will decrease blood pressure, improve the function of the lining of blood vessels and increase sensitivity to insulin if consumed for 24 weeks.</summary>
