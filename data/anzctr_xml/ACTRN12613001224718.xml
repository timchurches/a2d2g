  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single bout of resistance exercise (i.e. strength training) comprising 3 exercise, 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 60% of maximum (i.e. 60% of 1 repetition maximum), 1 minute rest between sets. This intervention was delivered under 2 conditions, either 3 lower body exercises (leg press, leg curl, calf raise) or 3 upper body exercises (chest press, supported row, lat pulldown). Upper and lower body exercise bouts were completed separately with 1 week washout in between bouts.</interventions>
    <comparator>This study will examine pain sensitivity pre and post-exercise therefore the participants' baseline measures will act as their own controls for comparison with each of lower body and upper body exercise. There are 3 groups of participants, one group diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis, 1 old healthy group (50+ yrs) and 1 young healthy group (18-35).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure pain threshold will be assessed via a force algometer, which measure pressure through a rubber tip. This pressure will be slowly increased until the participant indicates they feel pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately post exercise</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure pain tolerance will be assessed via a novel device that will place a constant pressure (at 90% of their threshold) on the medial aspect of a participant's knee. This pressure will be maintained for 5 min or until the participant can no longer tolerate the pain. Pain ratings will be taken every 30 sec via a 0-10 pain scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and immediately post exercise</timepoint>

  <eligibility>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited via posters placed at the university and in the reception areas of various gyms and exercise physiology clinics. The onus will be on potential participants to approach researchers to seek further information about the study. Once recruited they will provide informed consent and undergo baseline testing. They will then be randomised to perform upper or lower body exercise first and the other intervention will follow a week later. Therefore it is not necessary or possible to blind the participants to their randomisation.</concealment>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Repeated measures ANOVAs will be performed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 20) to assess an effect of exercise type (within subjects: baseline, post lower-body exercise, post upper-body exercise) and group (between subjects: OA, old healthy, young healthy) at the level of P equals 0.05. For pressure pain threshold data the ANOVA models also will include the location of these measures as an additional within subjects factor, either for all 8 sites or for the mean of the 4 lower limb or 4 upper limb measures. T-tests willl be used to assess group differences at baseline (unpaired) as well as within-participant differences between baseline and post-exercise (paired). The number of subjects was calculated via a power analysis based on previous results of post exercise pressure pain thresholds in young healthy populations. As we anticipated a greater variance in older and osteoarthitic populations we were conservative and an n greater than 13 was needed to reach statistical significance with 80% power. As there are 3 groups we anticipated 15 for each group amounting to 45.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study investigates the analgesic effects of a bout resistance exercise on pressure pain thresholds and pressure pain tolerance in healthy participants and participants with knee osteoarthritis.  The pain measures will be assessed at baseline and will be repeated following a bout of resistance exercise. Questionnaires concerning physical activity, pain, disability and injury will be completed by the participants.</summary>
