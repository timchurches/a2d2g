  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mulligan Method (or Mobilization with Movement Treatment or MWM Treatment, which are all terms for the same procedure) and Kinesio Taping were done on the same group (intervention group). Both procedures were done in one -on-one sessions with therapist. MWM treatment was administered in the following way: the patient was seated and the therapist was positioned on the opposite side of the patient's painful shoulder. The therapist applied the thenar of one hand on the anterior aspect of the patient's humeral head, and the other hand on his/her scapula. The hand on the humeral head performed a postero-lateral glide, while the other hand stabilized scapula. During this procedure, the patients was encouraged to perform active shoulder movement to the point of the first onset of pain. Prescription details for MWM were: 10 repetitions in 3 sets daily, 30 sec rest period between sets; 10 sessions with 24 hours between session
The same (intervention) group received Kinesio Taping (or KT treatment). Kinesio Taping was applied on painful shoulder form day 1 to day 5, then from day 5 to day 10.The KT procedure followed this order: supraspinate muscle, deltoid muscle, glenohumeral joint.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control treatment applied consists of exercises that are usual or standard  program for impingement shoulder syndrome. Specific exercises are as follows: pendular exercises, active pain-limited shoulder exercises of shoulder elevation, depression, flexion, abduction, rotations; static strenghtening exercises for rotator cuff and scapular stabilizers' muscles; 10 repetitions in one set daily per type of exercise, 30 sec rest between sets;10 sessions with 24 hours between sets</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this study is to compare efficacy of Mobilization with Movement (MWM) and Kinesio Taping (KT) techniques with a supervised usual exercise program in participants with shoulder impingement syndrome. Our hypothesis is that MWM and KT are more effective as an initial treatment of this frequent musculoskeletal problem comparing to standard exercise program.</summary>
