  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 12 week intervention will consist of individualised dietetic advice regarding ways to ensure adequate energy and protein intake to improve nutritional status. This information will be provided at baseline by a dietitian. Fortnightly phone calls consisting of a 24 hour diet history will be conducted by a dietitian to ensure compliance, modify the diet as necessary and to answer any questions that the participant may have. These phone calls are expected to last from 30 minutes to 1 hour. 3 day food diaries will be collected at baseline and also the week before the visit at Week 6 and before the visit at Week 12 during the intervention period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Malnutrition, especially unintentional weight loss, is a known issue in Parkinson's disease. Malnutrition is associated with a number of adverse outcomes including decreased physical function, higher mortality, impaired immunity, longer hospital stays and decreased quality of life. People with Parkinson's disease are at a higher risk of malnutrition due to the motor and non-motor symptoms associated with the disease as well as the side effects of anti-parkinsonian medication. To date, an intervention to address malnutrition in this population has not been conducted.</summary>
