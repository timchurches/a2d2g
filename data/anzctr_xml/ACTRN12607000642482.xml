  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People of South Asian origin are anecdotally thought to be deficient in vitamin D, partly due to skin colour and partly to other lifestyle/cultural reasons. They are also known to be at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes than the general population. There is some evidence that vitamin D deficiency plays a role in the aetiology of diabetes. The aim of this trial is to test the hypotheses that insulin resistance will improve when vitamin D deficiency is addressed.</summary>
