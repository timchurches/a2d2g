    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Number of Participants With Mild, Moderate and Severe AE - AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or misuse. SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically significant. The severity of AEs was assessed by the investigator as mild, moderate or severe.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Menopause Quality of Life (MENQoL) Score From Baseline to Visits 6 (Week 4) and Visit 8 (Week 12) - MENQOL instrument is a 32-item, validated questionnaire designed to measure symptoms that participants experience due to menopause and degree to which these symptoms bother them. Each item references a symptom and is composed of two-part question; a yes/no confirmation that the participant has symptom followed by a question asking how bothersome the symptom is, if present. The MENQOL items are designed to be grouped into domains that address vasomotor (items 1-3), psychosocial(items 4-10), physical (items 11-26, 30-32) and sexual symptoms (items 27-29). Each domain is given a separate score; there is no overall score. The domain score is sum of individual item scores divided by number of items in that domain. Since domain subscales are not comprised of an equivalent number of items, mean of subscale is used as overall subscale score. Each domain score ranges from 1 to 8. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Score From Baseline to Visits 6 (Week 4) and Visit 8 (Week 12) - The MOS Sleep Scale is a validated questionnaire designed to measure a participant sleep quality via 12 questions. Items are designed to be grouped into domains that include sleep disturbance (items 1, 3, 7, 8), sleep adequacy (items 4, 12), daytime somnolence (items 6, 9, 11), sleep quantity (2), 6-Item Sleep Scale (items 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12) and 9-Item Sleep Scale (items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12). Each domain is given a separate score. The domain score is calculated as the sum of the individual item scores in that domain. Transformed scores were calculated for the domains only. This transformation converts the raw domain score to a 0 to 100 scale following the formula: Transformed score = ([Raw score - Lowest possible score]/Possible score range)*100. Lowest score 0 indicates best sleep quality and higher score 100 indicates worst sleep quality. Baseline was Week 0.

      <outcome>Change in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) Score From Visit 2 to Visit 7 - The BFI is a validated questionnaire designed to measure a participant's fatigue via nine questions that are summated to create a total score. Items 1-3 request a rating on a scale ranging from 0 - 10 with 0 representing 'No Fatigue' and 10 representing 'As bad as you can imagine'. Five items 4A-4F request an interference score on a scale ranging from 0 - 10 with 0 representing 'Does not interfere' and 10 representing 'Completely Interferes'. The values of the scales for all items was used in scoring the response to each item. The following groupings of items was used to create domain scores. The total score is calculated by taking the sum of all 9 rating scales for a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 90. Higher score indicates more severe fatigue. Visit 2 was Day -21. Change from Visit 2 was calculated by subtracting Visit 2 values from post-Visit 2 values.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies in Depression (CES-D) Score From Visit 2 to Visit 7 - The CES-D is a questionnaire designed to measure depressive symptoms via 20 items that are summed to create a total score. Depressive symptoms are fairly common in postmenopausal women, and it's possible that stimulation of estrogen receptors via a selective estrogen receptor modulator may improve depressive symptoms. Questions 4, 8, 12 and 16 are weighted negatively (the scores are flipped prior to creating total score). If 3 or more items are missing then total score is missing. If fewer than 3 items are missing then missing item is set to group mean of that item for appropriate randomized treatment group. These means are only calculated if more than half of the participants used for calculation have responded to item. The items are summed to give total score ranging from 0 to 60. Lower score 0=no depression, higher score 60=higher degree of depression severity. Visit 2 was Day -21. Change from Visit 2 was calculated by subtracting Visit 2 values from post-Visit 2 values.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Score From Visit 2 to Visit 7 - The WPAI is a questionnaire that measured workplace productivity and absenteeism via 6 items/questions, adapted to participants experiencing menopausal symptoms. Item 1 asks about current employment with a yes/no response. Items 2- 4 ask for continuous response in hours. Item 5 asks for response on rating scale related to WP ranging from 0:Menopausal symptoms had no effect on work to 10:Couldn't work at all. Item 6 asks for response on rating scale related to daily activities ranging from 0:no effect on daily activities to 10:Couldn't perform any daily activities. The score calculation- Effect on work: (Item 5 score÷10); Absenteeism: (Item 2÷Item 2+Item 4); Overall work impairment ([Item 2÷Item 2+Item 4]+ [1- {Item 2÷Item 2+Item 4}]*[ Item 5 score÷10]); Activity impairment: (Item 6 score÷10). Total score range from 0 to 10 where higher score indicates worst condition. Visit 2 was Day -21. Change from Visit 2 was calculated by subtracting Visit 2 values from post-Visit 2 values.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline at Week 12 in Waist Circumference - To measure waist circumference, clothing was lifted from around the waist to ensure correct positioning of the measuring tape. Participants were instructed to stand erect with abdomen relaxed, arms at side, feet together, and weight equally divided over both legs. The non-stretchable tape was placed at the waist midway between the palpated iliac crest and the palpated lowest rib margin in the left and right mid-axillary lines. The tape was even, parallel to the floor not twisted with the measurement scale facing outward. The assessor was instructed to ensure that the tape was just touching the skin but not compressing the soft tissue. The measurement was made at the end of a normal expiration. The waist was measured at least twice or more if necessary, until two measurements were within 1 centimeter and the confirmatory reading recorded to one decimal place. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline at Week 12 in Hip Circumference - For hip circumference, the participant was instructed to stand erect with arms at sides and feet together. The measurement was taken at the point yielding the maximum circumference over the buttocks (widest part of the greater trochanters) with nonstretchable tape. The tape was even, not twisted with the measurement scale facing outward. The assessor was instructed to ensure that the tape was just touching the skin but not compressing the soft tissue. The hip should be measured at least twice until two measurements are within 1 centimeter and the last reading recorded. Baseline was Week 0.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline at Week 12 in Weight - Participants were weighed on a calibrated balance beam or digital scale. Participants were instructed to be dressed in light indoor clothing without shoes and also to have empty pockets and to void before weighing. It was strongly recommended that participants were weighed in the morning at the beginning of the clinic visit. Weight was measured at least twice or more if necessary, until two measurements were within 0.5 kilograms. The last (confirmed) reading was recorded in the electronic case report form. Weight was recorded in kilograms to the nearest tenth. When the weight was measured in pounds, it was converted into kilograms using the conversion factor: pounds/ 2.2 = kilograms. Baseline was Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting Baseline values from post-Baseline values.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          -  Postmenopausal women aged 40 to 65 years old; postmenopausal defined as:

             i.Amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months* OR ii.At least 6 weeks post-surgical
             bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy.

             *Note: Although duration of amenorrhea is initially determined by subject history at
             the time of the screening visit (Visit 1), menopausal status must be confirmed by
             demonstrating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;40 mIU/mL (SI: &gt;40 IU/L)
             and estradiol &lt;35pg/mL (SI: &lt;128pmol/L) at entry. Screening reports provided by the
             Central Laboratory must be carefully reviewed to determine menopause eligibility prior
             to conducting Visit 2 assessments. In the event a subject's menopause status has been
             clearly established (for example, the subject indicates she has been amenorrheic for
             10 years), but FSH and/or estradiol levels are not consistent with a post-menopausal
             condition, determination of subject eligibility should be discussed with the study
             medical monitor.

             For women who are surgically menopausal, a copy of the pathology report or a
             statement on letterhead from the subject's physician documenting both ovaries have
             been removed or biochemical evidence of post-menopausal status as noted above is
             required prior to conducting Visit 2 assessments.

          -  A minimum average frequency of seven daily moderate to extremely severe hot flashes or
             episodes of night sweats sufficient to cause the patient to seek treatment (these
             episodes must be documented during the baseline period and the subject must have
             recorded frequency and severity of symptoms for a minimum of eight days in order to be
             eligible for randomization). This average frequency will be calculated by summing the
             number of moderate, severe, and extremely severe VMS events during the baseline period
             and dividing by the total number of non-missing days during this period, with details
             related to the definition of non-missing days described in Section 6.3.1.

          -  BMI within the range 19 to 35 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  Subject has provided signed and dated written informed consent before admission to the
             study.

          -  Subject is able to understand and comply with the protocol requirements, instructions,
             and protocol-stated restrictions.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Investigator considers subject unfit for the study as a result of medical history,
             physical examination, or screening tests.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs including:

             i.Hormone therapy (estrogen or estrogen/progestin combination or related products)

             methyldopa, and the phytoestrogens black cohosh and red clover) within the past 30
             days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to conduct of Visit 1 assessments
             (note: half-lives will be provided in the SPM). Use of non-medication treatments for
             VMS, such as acupuncture and biofeedback, and other complementary or alternative
             therapies for VMS relief (with the exception of black cohosh and red clover which
             require a specified washout previously noted) must be discontinued at Visit 1.

        iii.Use of weight loss drugs (e.g., phentermine, sibutramine, orlistat, rimonabant) within
        3 months of the first dose of investigational product. Other complementary or alternative
        therapies for weight reduction must be discontinued at Visit 1. See SPM for listing.

        iv.Use of pravastatin [Pravachol/Lipostat], rosuvastatin [Crestor], or pitavastatin
        [Livalo] within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of the first dose of
        investigational product (note: half-lives will be provided in the SPM. Uses of other
        statins, for example simvastatin [Zocor], atorvastatin [Lipitor], fluvastatin [Lescol],
        lovastatin [Mevacor] is allowed).

        v.Use of bupropion, orphenadrine [Norflex], cyclophosphamide, efavirenz, ifosfamide, or
        methadone (because of the potential for GSK232802 to inhibit CYP2B6), or use of paclitaxel,
        torsemide, amodiaquine, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone (because of the
        potential for GSK232802 to inhibit CYP2C8) within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives
        (whichever is longer) of the first dose of investigational product (note: half-lives will
        be provided in the SPM).

        Please note: Regardless of the reason for prescribing, use of the medications and therapies
        defined within Exclusion 2 above is prohibited. Concurrent administration of
        anti-depressants, anti-hypertensives, lipid-lowering therapies, etc. not specifically
        excluded above is allowed. See SPM for detailed listings and relevant half lives.

        - Use of investigational drug within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
        before the first dose of investigational product.

          -  Uterine disease or medical condition including:

          -  Bi-layer endometrial thickness greater than 5mm as determined by TVUS, or for women
             with a non-informative TVUS, a single layer thickness of greater than 3 mm determined
             by SIS; presence of fibroids that obscure evaluation of endometrium by TVUS;

          -  History of uterine cancer; evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer as assessed
             by a screening endometrial biopsy. (Note: if a subject has insufficient tissue for
             diagnosis at screening, but bi-layer endometrial thickness by TVUS is =5mm or single
             wall thickness by SIS is =3mm, she may still be eligible for study entry if she meets
             the remaining inclusion/exclusion criteria);

          -  Evidence of an endometrial polyp with hyperplastic or malignant epithelium;

          -  Unexplained or unusual endometrial bleeding; or uterine surgery (other than
             hysterectomy*) within the past 6 months; *Note: hysterectomy must have been conducted
             at least 6 weeks prior to screening Visit 1. See also Inclusion criterion 1.

          -  Abnormal cervical Pap smear with evidence of cervical dysplasia greater than or equal
             to low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or with a diagnosis of atypical
             squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) that is HPV High Risk positive, or
             glandular lesions including but not limited to atypical glandular cells of
             undetermined significance (AGUS), adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or malignancy

          -  History of breast or ovarian cancer. Any clinically significant findings on
             mammography suspicious of breast malignancy that would require additional clinical
             testing to rule out breast cancer (note: simple cysts confirmed by ultrasound are
             allowed).

        Note: A screening mammogram is required unless the subject has had a mammogram performed
        within the last 12 months. If local mammography or medical management guidelines restrict
        the frequency with which mammograms can be performed, or impose age restrictions on the use
        of mammography, such that a subject may be unable to undergo the study-required screening
        mammogram, then these subjects must not be enrolled in the study. See Section 6.2.7.

        - Cardiovascular conditions including: i. Systolic blood pressure (BP) outside the range 80
        to 150 mmHg, diastolic BP outside the range 50 to 90 mmHg, and/or heart rate outside the
        range 40 to 100 bpm. Subjects with mild to moderate hypertension who are controlled on a
        stable antihypertension regimen may be enrolled if they meet the inclusion/exclusion
        criteria.

        ii. Symptomatic or asymptomatic arrhythmia of any clinical significance. iii. Any
        clinically significant abnormality identified on the screening 12-lead ECG. Subjects with
        QTc prolongation (QTc interval &gt;450msec) will be excluded.

        iv. Has a documented history (within the last year) of myocardial infarction, angina, or
        has undergone coronary artery bypass surgery and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary
        angioplasty (PTCA).

        v. History of venous or arterial thromboembolic disease (e.g., deep vein thrombosis,
        pulmonary embolism, stroke), history of known coagulopathy or abnormal coagulation factors;
        increased thrombotic risk as evidenced by positive APC resistance (APCR) evaluated at
        screening.

        - Has a documented history of hepatobiliary disease or hepatic enzyme elevation including
        any one of the following: i.ALT or direct (conjugated) bilirubin values 1.5-fold higher
        than the ULN at screening.

        ii.Fasting triglycerides &gt;400mg/dL (SI: &gt;4.52mmol/L) at screening. If a subject is
        receiving a lipid-lowering therapy, then she must be on a stable dose for at least 1 month
        before screening.

          -  Has an abnormal thyroid function test assessed by TSH at screening (TSH &lt;0.1uU/mL or
             &gt;10uU/mL [SI: &lt;0.1mU/L or &gt;10mU/L] ).

        Note: If the TSH is mildly out of range at screening (TSH &lt; 15U/mL), the subject may have
        her dose adjusted (if already on exogenous therapy) or have therapy initiated as deemed
        appropriate by the subject's physician, followed by a 3-4 week period to allow adequate
        equilibration. The TSH may then be re-assayed for eligibility purposes after this
        stabilization period has been completed. The subject should not progress through subsequent
        V2 assessments until re-assay demonstrates the TSH is within acceptable protocol-defined
        limits. Subjects with suppressed levels of TSH, &lt;0.1U/mL, may have dose adjustment if free
        T4 is in normal range, and they are on exogenous thyroxine therapy.

          -  Has either a previous disease or current medical condition, which as judged by the
             investigator, may affect the interpretation of efficacy or safety data or which
             otherwise contraindicates participation in a clinical study with a new chemical
             entity. These diseases include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular disease,
             malignancy*, complex ovarian pathology, hepatic disease, renal disease, hematological
             disease, neurological disease, or endocrine disease. A subject with diabetes may be
             included if her diabetes is well controlled (i.e., HbA1c level is less than 8% at
             screening).

             *Note: Any history of malignancy within the past 5 years is exclusionary with the
             exception of basal cell (excluded if within the prior 2 years) or squamous cell
             (excluded if within the prior one year) carcinoma of the skin. Subjects with a prior
             malignancy who have had no evidence of disease for at least the past 5 years are
             eligible. Note that this timeframe does not apply to uterine, breast, and ovarian
             cancers which are defined in Exclusions 4 and 5 above.

          -  History of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence in the 12 months before screening
             as determined by the investigator.

          -  Positive results for hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C antibodies as
             evaluated at screening Visit 1. Known history of HIV.

          -  Donation of blood in excess of 500mL within a 56-day period before screening.

          -  History or presence of allergy to the investigational product or drugs of this class
             (e.g., raloxifene), or history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the
             physician responsible, contraindicates their participation.</exclusivecriteria>
