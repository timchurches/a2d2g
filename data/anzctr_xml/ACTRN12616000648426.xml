  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was a single centre, single dose, randomised, open, two-way, two-period, cross-over, two-stage bioequivalence study. The objective of the study was to assess the bioequivalence of the generic formulation of cysteamine bitartrate (test formulation Rec 0/0462: T) versus the marketed formulation (reference formulation Cystagon Registered Trademark: R), in healthy male and female volunteers. The two formulations T and R were orally administered as a single dose of 600 mg (i.e. a single dose of four 150 mg capsules), under fasting conditions, in two consecutive study periods, with a wash-out interval of at least 5 days between the two administrations. Each study subject underwent 6 visits. </summary>
