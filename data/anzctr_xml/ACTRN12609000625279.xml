    <interventions>Methylphenidate (30mg), atomoxetine (60mg), citalopram (30mg).

All administered as capsules. Participants will be tested over four sessions, administered one dose of one drug (or placebo) each session. Sessions are a minimum of one week apart to allow wash-out of drug.

This study implements a cross-over design, with each participant receiving each of the three drugs and placebo over four sessions (one drug or placebo per session).</interventions>

    <concealment>This is a repeated-measures design study. Participants will receive each drug or placebo once over four sessions. The order in which the drugs/placebo will be administered to each participant is randomised and structured by a Latin square design, and this drug order is sent directly to an offsite pharmacy that will be organising the drugs. The pharmacy will put each drug dose or placebo into identical capsules which will then be put into sealed opaque numbered envelopes, with the participant number (1-36) and session number (1-4) specified on the front.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine how three different medications influence brain activity whilst healthy participants are performing cognitive tasks.  The three medications are methylphenidate, atomoxetine and citalopram.  The first two medications are commonly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in both children and adults, whereas citalopram is used to treat depression in adults.  Importantly, we know that these medications act on different chemical systems in the brain.  What we do not know, however, is whether these medications can influence underlying brain activity when people are performing cognitive tasks.  This project will help us to understand which chemicals in the brain modulate our ability as humans to inhibit and control our behaviour.  Studying these effects in healthy people will provide important clues to the underlying biology of a range of mental disorders where problems of inhibition and control of behaviour are common.</summary>
