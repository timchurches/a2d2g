  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sexuality intervention DVD plus 8 sessions of telephone support by peer support volunteers (ie peers who have previously been treated for prostate cancer); or Sexuality intervention DVD plus 8 telephone-based sessions of counselling by prostate cancer nurse counsellors. In each intervention condition telephone calls will begin immediately after randomisation to intervention group and will continue until 6 months post-surgery: two telephone support/counselling sessions will be conducted prior to the male participant's surgery for prostate cancer and six sessions following surgery. Each support/counselling call will be approximately 1 hour in duration. Both intervention conditions will also receive a package of supporting materials including tipsheets and worksheets and an evidence-based patient education booklet about sexual function after treatment that was written by the present research team and that has national endorsement by Andrology Australia. The patient materials will be sent to participants immediately after randomisation to the intervention conditions.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The most substantial long term morbidity from prostate cancer is sexual dysfunction with consequent adverse changes in couple and intimate relationships. Research to date has not identified an effective way to improve sexual and psychosocial adjustment for both men with prostate cancer and their partners. As well, the efficacy and cost effectiveness of peer counselling as opposed to professional models of service delivery has not yet been empirically tested. Proscan for Couples is a randomised control trial of a couples-based intervention that targets the specific challenges couples experience at diagnosis of localised prostate cancer and after radical prostatectomy. Intervention components include psycho-education; cognitive behavioural strategies; couple relationship education focussed on relationship enhancement and helping the couple to conjointly manage the stresses of cancer diagnosis and treatment; and specific psychosexual education and sexual communication.  An audiovisual DVD resource supports the intervention that can be delivered with peer or nurse counselling. We will evaluate the efficacy of this intervention in a three arm randomised controlled trial comparing (1) usual care; (2) eight sessions of peer-delivered telephone support with the audiovisual resource; and (3) eight sessions of oncology nurse-delivered telephone counselling with the audiovisual resource. The trial will involve 210 couples with 70 couples in each condition (420 participants in total).</summary>
