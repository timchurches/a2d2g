  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Area Under the Curve 0-4 Hours (AUC0-4h) Response - Mixed Model Repeated Measurement (MMRM) results. Response was defined as change from baseline in percent of predicted at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment period and is therefore expressed in percent of predicted. Means are adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age group (&lt;= 11, &gt;=12), baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction. FEV1 AUC0-4h was normalised for time and was calculated using the trapezoidal rule divided by the observation time (4 h).</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 minutes (min) before first dosing of study drug (defined as baseline), at 1 hour (h), 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing at day 1 and at 30 min before dosing, at 1 hour, 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing after 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough FEV1 Response - MMRM results. Response was defined as change from baseline in percent of predicted at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment period and is therefore expressed in percent of predicted. Trough FEV1 was defined as the pre-dose FEV1 measured just prior to the administration of randomised treatment. Means are adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age group (&lt;= 11, &gt;=12), baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) Area Under the Curve 0-4 Hours (AUC0-4h) Response - MMRM results. Response was defined as change from baseline in percent of predicted at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment period and is therefore expressed in percent of predicted. Means are adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age group (&lt;= 11, &gt;=12), baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction. FVC AUC0-4h was normalised for time and was calculated using the trapezoidal rule divided by the observation time (4 h).</outcome>
      <timepoint>30 minutes (min) before first dosing of study drug (defined as baseline), at 1 hour (h), 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing at day 1 and at 30 min before dosing, at 1 hour, 2 h , 3 h, and 4 h post dosing after 12 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trough FVC Response - MMRM results. Response was defined as change from baseline in percent of predicted at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment period and is therefore expressed in percent of predicted. Trough FCV was defined as the pre-dose FVC measured just prior to the administration of randomised treatment. Means are adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age group (&lt;= 11, &gt;=12), baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Flow Between 25 Percent and 75 Percent of the FVC (FEF25-75) Response - MMRM results. Response was defined as change from baseline in percent of predicted at the end of 12-week double-blind treatment period and is therefore expressed in percent of predicted. FEF25-75 is also known as maximum mid-expiratory flow and was measured before bronchodilator (salbutamol) use. Means are adjusted for treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, age group (&lt;= 11, &gt;=12), baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With at Least 1 Pulmonary Exacerbation During Double-blind Treatment - Selected questions from the Respiratory and Systemic Symptoms Questionnaire (RSSQ), the investigator assessment of physical findings and pulmonary function, and the use of intravenous antibiotics as a concomitant therapy were used to determine if a cystic fibrosis-related pulmonary exacerbation had occurred.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Revised Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R) Score - Different format of CFQ-R are used depending of the patients' age. Adolescent and adult format of CFQ-R is used for patients of 14 years and older, for younger children a parent version and a children format is used. In case parent and children questionnaires were filled out, the children questionnaire is taken into account. Scores were calculated for each domain of the CFQ-R which are presented separately. A score of 100 corresponds to the highest quality of life possible, whereas a score of 0 corresponds to the lowest quality of life possible. Increasing score indicates better health.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, there have been no formal clinical studies completed using tiotropium in CF
      patients. While there is a large body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of
      tiotropium in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), relatively little
      is known about its efficacy and safety in patients with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
      Therefore, Boehringer Ingelheim proposed to profile the long acting anticholinergic
      tiotropium and to generate adequate clinical data for use as a bronchodilator in paediatric
