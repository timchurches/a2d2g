  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate whether preventative placement of a removable
      oesophageal stent reduces the rate of scar tissue, or stricture formation after removing the
      precancerous or early cancerous Barrett's mucosa by Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR). The
      stent will be placed 10-14 days after initial EMR. The stent will then be removed 8 weeks
      later by repeat Endoscopy. Patients will be followed up weekly following insertion of the
      oesophageal stent.</summary>
