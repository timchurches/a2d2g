  <interventions>
    <interventions>Neurocognitive function testing, sleep studies and EEG analysis, arterial blood gas and questionnaires will be performed before and after 3 months of positive airway pressure therapy.   

Positive airway pressure will be titrated to determine optimal pressure settings for each patient. Either CPAP or Bilevel will be applied via a full face or nasal mask interface for the 3 month duration. Patients will be advised to use this therapy each night. Positive airway treatment is part of standard care.

In addition to monthly phone calls to monitor use of therapy, positive airway pressure devices will be downloaded at 3 months to obtain objective compliance data. 

Participants are patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). By definition, they will have elevated carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia).


</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) without hypercapnia. These patients are those that do not meet the criteria for obesity hypoventilation syndrome. 

Patients with OSA (controls) will also receive positive airway pressure therapy as per standard of care. The pressure will be set and compliance monitored as described for the OHS group.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Prior to treatment, OHS subjects will be compared with the normocapnic OSA group with respect to the cognitive outcomes tested, using linear regression modelling. The effect of group will be examined, controlling for OSA severity, BMI, gender, age, and years of education. Response to therapy (mean change with 95% confidence limits) will be assessed by paired-t-test, and also by mixed effects modelling to control for changes in weight and also explore the impact of change in pCO2 on the change in performance.

A total of 60 patients will be studied. We estimate there will be 20 in the OHS group and 40 in the OSA group (ie 30-40% OHS). This will provide 80% power to detect a 8.6 cm difference in steering deviation between the two groups (assume SD=11 cm, alpha 0.05, controlling for circadian effects, this difference of 8.6 cm ~ 14.5 hours of extended wakefulness). Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, the sample is powered to detect a 10.8 cm change in AusEd steering deviation (~ 17 h extended wakefulness, at 80% power, within subject SD=10.2 cm).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neurocognitive impairments in Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) are likely related to a combination of factors including low oxygen levels during sleep (hypoxia), sleep fragmentation and possibly elevated carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia). The latter, unlike hypoxia, has not been explored in depth and is often viewed as an innocent bystander.  Early detection of hypercapnia may be an important step in the prevention of neurocognitive dysfunction in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OSA/OHS). In this study, neurocognitive function of patients with sleep disordered breathing will be assessed before and after 3 months of positive pressure mask therapy.

Hypothesis
1.	Patients with OHS exhibit greater cognitive impairment than obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but without daytime hypercapnia.
2.	Patients with sleep hypoventilation have less sleep fragmentation but greater neurocognitive impairment arising from a longer exposure to hypercapnia.
3.	Although correction of hypercapnia with PAP treatment will at least partially improve cognitive function, patients with OHS may remain impaired relative to treated OSA patients without hypercapnia.
