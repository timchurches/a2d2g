  <interventions>
    <interventions>Not applicable - retrospective chart review study.

The retrospective chart review will involve the review of 150 - 200 patient charts, dating from 1996 to 2010, to examine the outcomes for patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) undergoing auto-Stem Cell Transplant (auto-SCT) at the Haematology &amp; Oncology Clinics of Australia (HOCA).  Cohort analysis will be completed on two groups of patients: 1) patients who received CHOP chemotherapy and underwent auto-SCT for relapsed DLBCL and 2) patients who received R-CHOP for relapsed DLBCL. 

Total length of time for study is approximately 12 months with an expected end date of December 2011.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis:  Relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients who received R-CHOP as their primary therapy have a poor outcome compared to patients who received CHOP as their primary therapy. 

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of R-CHOP on the overall survival of autologous stem cell transplant for patients with relapsed DLBCL.  The information gained may benefit patients by altering standard therapy for this patient population.</summary>
