  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chronic Asthma Sufferers who qualified for this study were randomly allocated to three groups, A, B and C. Groups A attended treatment centers and only group A receive 3 spinal manipulative therapy sessions per week for up to 6-weeks, in one of 19 treating centers within NSW. Randomly allocated control participants in group B also attended treating centers and participated in all assessments criteria but did not receive any spinal manipulative therapy for 6-weeks. Assessment included interviews with attending clinician, palpation of the spine (hands on assessment of spinal motion only), completed questionnaires and submitted salivary samples. However, Group C participants provided all salivary samples and questionnaire for the same period of 6-weeks from home. 

Spinal manipulative therapy involves the use of hands on techniques to articulate vertebral joints. Specifically this chiropractic technique involved a high velocity low amplitude thrust delivered in a desired direction to restore joint motion. On average a treatment session would be between 15 and 20 minutes.</interventions>

      <outcome>All participants completed a Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), a wellness questionnaire (SF-36) and an Asthma global questionnaire.</outcome>

    <designfeatures>Subjects were instructed that their treatment program will consist of 14 weeks of participation and at various times throughout the fourteen weeks they will receive a variety of manipulative interventions. They were not aware of when they will receive the SMT. Effectively both groups A and B believed that they will receive SMT, however, group A was the only group that did. As such participants were masked. However, the clinicians who delivered the therapy itself were not blinded simply due to the nature of this type hands on of manual therapy, effectively a single blind study design.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This clinical trial was developed to look at the role that chiropractic may have in co-managing asthma sufferers with spinal manipulative therapy (SMT). A multisite clinical trial was conducted that attracted up to 160 participants.  Randomly allocated participants were assigned to one of three groups (A, B and C) for a period of 14-weeks of participation. Participants in group A received up to 18 chiropractic SMT sessions. During this time all participants in all groups provided regular salivary samples for hormone (cortisol) and immune (immunoglobulin A) function analysis as well as wellness questionnaires.  Groups B and C did not receive any spinal manipulative therapy. 

The aims of this study were to determine whether stress is a factor in the pathophysiology of asthma and to determine the mechanisms by which chiropractic co-management of asthma sufferers can alleviate their symptoms.  More specifically, our study aimed at determining whether chiropractic treatment has beneficial effects on the endocrine and the immune systems through measurement of salivary cortisol and salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) respectively.</summary>
