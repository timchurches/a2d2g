  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>All patients in CMDHB eligible for bariatric surgery are given a weight loss goal prior to
      surgery. It is unknown what the most effective diet is to lose weight, while still preserving
      muscle mass. The diet must also be acceptable and adhered to by patients. The aim of this
      study is to find out if a diet that is higher in protein and lower in carbohydrate than the
      standard Ministry of Health guidelines will have a greater effect on weight loss,
      preservation of lean muscle mass, surgical recovery score, adherence and acceptability.</summary>
