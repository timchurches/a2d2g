  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>FAME2 is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomised to receive fenofibrate (145mg daily for 24 weeks) or placebo (145mg daily for 24 weeks) in a parallel group, double blind design. Randomisation lists will be generated by a statistician and provided to the study centres ensuring both investigators and participants are blinded to drug assignment. Screening and randomization will occur at Visit 1 and 2.  Participants will receive a phone call at three weeks in addition with a blood test, drug safety check and recording of any adverse events. Another phone call will occur at three months.  Here again participants drug safety and compliance will be checked along with any adverse events. The final visit will occur at the end of six months. </summary>
