Treatment: drugs: IgNextGen 10%
Ig NextGen 10% is a liquid formulation and is to be administered intravenously. At the discretion of the Investigator, patients could be administered Ig NextGen 10% in accordance with either of two dosage regimens:
Regimen One: 1 g/kg body weight of Ig NextGen 10% administered daily for two days.
Regimen Two: 0.4 g/kg body weight of Ig NextGen 10% administered daily for five days

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterised by
      isolated low platelet counts. The aim of treating patients with ITP is to increase the
      platelet concentration and reduce the risk of bleeding. A number of controlled multi-centre
      studies have demonstrated that Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy produces a rapid
      rise in platelet counts within a 24 to 72 hour period. This study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of Ig NextGen 10% in adult patients with ITP.</summary>
