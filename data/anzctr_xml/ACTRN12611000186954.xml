  <interventions>
    <interventions>Telehealth system with nurse led support. Patients complete a symptoms questionnaire twice daily on a device(morning and afternoon) from Cycle 1 - Cycle 4 of chemotherapy.
The intervention nurse monitors symptoms and responds if any alerts are triggered. A red alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requiring urgent attention, a amber alert occurs if a patient reports a symptom requring non-urgent attention. 
In the case of an alert, the nurse will contact the patient by phone and query the symptom, provide self care and support.
The device is a mobile phone based system. The handset contains an application that prompts patients to complete a side-effect assessment questionnaire by following instructions on the touch screen handset. Normal phone functions are disabled. All patients will be provided with the mobile phone handset and SIM card for the trial.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with cancer are required to monitor and to initiate self care activities to manage side effects at home. In haematological cancer patients these side effects are often severe and life threatening. Safe home care requires close communication with the health team. We will test if a mobile phone based system can support patietns to monitor their side effects, promote the delviery of evidence based self care advice in a timely manner, and mediate the role of nurses to effectively provide real-time patient support.</summary>
