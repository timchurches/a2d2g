  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pilates exercise is a mind-body exercise that focuses on strengthening, stretching, core stability, breathing, and posture.  Participants will undertake an individualised and supervised Pilates exercise program based on the recommended principles reported in Wells et al (2014).Participants will be required to participate in 2 supervised exercise sessions per week at the New Acton Pilates studio for 12 weeks. These sessions will be  of 60 minutes in duration, and will include mat-based exercises and the use of specialised equipment, such as a Reformer, Cadillac, and Ladder Barrel. Pilates exercises will be based on the protocol. Exercise sessions will be supervised by trained Pilates instructors. Participants will be supervised individually for 3-4 sessions, and then supervised in small groups (with no more than 4 participants per class). A home exercise program will also be provided to participants which will be of 10  15 minutes duration. Participants will be requested to complete these exercises 5 days a week (on the days not undertaking supervised sessions at the studio), and report adherence (in a written diary, and to Pilates instructor). </interventions>
    <comparator>The usual care group will be requested to maintain current physical activity levels and not undertake any new exercise program throughout the trial. They also will be requested to not undertake any heath professional treatment for low back pain, apart from medications.  They will be requested to provide a weekly record of any unavoidable change in activity, health professional treatment they sought, and medication usage via an online survey</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be self referred responding to advertising or referred by other professionals.The project will be promoted in advertisements in local newspaper,magazines,radio and notices on buildings of the University of Canberra.Referrals from medical doctors and physiotherapists will also be encouraged by face to face and written communication with the chief investigator. In response to enquiries,the participants information sheets will be posted or emailed to potential participants.The chief investigator will then follow up contact with the potential participant via phone to confirm interest and potential suitability for participant inclusion according to the selection criteria.If potential participants verbally consent to being involved in the project they will be requested to attend the University of Canberra for an initial assessment and to bring their completed written informed consent form. Research staff responsible for assessment will be blind to information consent form.Research staff responsible for assessment will be blind to information about the group allocation.Following recruitment and first assessment,participant will then be randomly allocated to treatment groups.Treatment allocation will be concealed using an opaque envelopes and notify the participant and the intervention group manager</concealment>
    <sequence>The treatment allocation will be randomised using a computer generated random number.The randomisation will be permuted block randomisation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A power calculation was computed  to determine the appropriate sample size for the study. The primary variable utilized to calculate sample size was Oswestry Disability Index.  To detect a moderate effect size with a power of 0.80(80%) and the level of significance at 0.05 we will require 40 participants in each group. To allow for a 15% drop out rate, approximately 92 participants will be recruited.To determine differences in the outcomes between groups over time, a repeated measures ANOVA will be used.To know where the differences occur, a multiple comparison test Post Hoc will be conducted.This analysis may require to be further developed into general linear model with the capacity to control prognostic factors of participants such as age,pain and disability.An intention to treat analysis will be undertaken.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this randomised controlled trial is to investigate the effectiveness of Pilates versus usual care on pain and disability in people with chronic non specific low back pain in short term(6-12 weeks) and long term (26 weeks).The research hypothesis is that the Pilates exercise will show short term and long term effects in decreasing pain and disability in people with chronic non specific low back pain more than usual care.The alternative hypothesis is that there is no difference in pain and disability in participants who undertake Pilates exercise and those that continue usual care.</summary>
