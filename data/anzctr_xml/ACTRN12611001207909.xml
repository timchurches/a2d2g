  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who have not previously had an elective caesarean section will be randomised to a study group that sees a patient information video prior to their anaesthetic appointment or a control group that has usual care. Anxiety levels will be measured after the anaesthetic interview and maternal satisfaction scores will be measured on the first post operative day.
The study group will watch a Patient information video: "Your Anaesthetic for Caesarean section at the Royal Brisbane and Womens hospital" before their interview with the anaesthetist.  The video will be 4-5 minutes long and will be viewed once.  The video is not intended to replace informed consent but to convey a typical patient experience.  It will include information regarding preparation for theatre, insertion of an intravenous cannula, application of monitoring, insertion of a neuraxial anaesthetic, monitoring of the baby and insertion of indwelling catheter.  The video does not include information specific to the operation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual care - an interview with an anaesthetist.  This follows a proforma provided by the hospital - history, examination and review of investigations.  A discussion of anaesthetic options and the risks and benefits of each option occurs.  There is a description of the proposed anaesthetic technique.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to determine whether the use of a patient information video prior to the maternal anaesthetic preadmission interview affects the patients satisfaction with the information provided by the anaesthetist and if it affects their anxiety levels, directly after the interview.  We will also measure the duration of the interview.  Post-operatively, we will assess whether or not the use of the video affects maternal satisfaction with the entire anaesthetic for caesarean section experience.  
 Video-based patient information supplementing clinician interview has been shown to reduce anxiety scores and increase patient satisfaction, for patients undergoing coronary angiography.  Patient satisfaction with anaesthesia has been shown to correlate most with information given pre-operatively, involvement in decision-making and contact with the anaesthetist.   No studies have examined the use of video-based patient information for patients undergoing caesarean section.
The results of this research will provide information on how to improve maternal satisfaction and reduce anxiety in the perioperative period.  Implementation of video-based information in the preadmission clinic may improve clinic efficiency while improving the patient experience.</summary>
