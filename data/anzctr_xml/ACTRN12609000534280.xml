  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of Cognitive Existential Couples Therapy for men with early stage prostate cancer and their partners. Research has shown that men with early stage prostate cancer may experience considerable psychological distress in the months following their initial diagnosis. Research has also shown that their partners may also experience distress at the time of the diagnosis which, if left untreated, can lead to subsequent relationship difficulties. Cognitive Existential Couples Therapy has been designed to help couples cope in the aftermath of a prostate cancer diagnosis. It is predicted that couples who receive Cognitive Existential Couples Therapy will experience less psychological distress and show improved quality of relating and more adaptive coping compared to couples who receive medical treatment as usual.</summary>
