  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interviews using semi-structured questionnaires will be conducted with women with breast cancer, breast care nurses and breast/plastic surgeons to evaluate barriers and enablers in accessing breast reconstruction in their local areas. Some state- and national-level decision makers (clinical and policy) will also be interviewed to look at current policy and potential obstacles to change. This project will take a 'snapshot' approach, capturing participants' experiences with breast reconstruction as reported in 2016-2017, with no ongoing follow up of participants. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess general issues around access to breast reconstruction following mastectomy for breast cancer. This will be assessed through interviews with women with breast cancer, breast care nurses and breast/plastic surgeons.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Snapshot of participants' experiences of breast reconstruction, as reported in 2016-2017.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess reasons behind regional variation in breast reconstruction practice. This will be assessed by comparing data on breast reconstruction practice in particular areas with the views of local women with breast cancer, breast care nurses and breast/plastic surgeons through interviews.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To make recommendations, based on our findings, on the best ways to overcome barriers to accessing breast reconstruction for all clinically eligible women who wish to have it.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any patterns in facilitators and barriers to accessing breast reconstruction that impact on several regions across Australia. This will be assessed through interviews with women with breast cancer, breast care nurses and breast/plastic surgeons as well as with clinical and policy decision-makers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2016-2017</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine any specific facilitators and barriers to accessing breast reconstruction that are unique to certain parts of Australia. This will be assessed through a closer examination of local factors that may impact on the provision of breast reconstruction services.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to systematically explore factors behind the low and uneven rates of breast reconstruction across Australia, It aims to identify practical ways to improve equity of access for women regardless of where they live, their age and ethnic/cultural backgrounds. It will produce acceptable, feasible and readily-translatable recommendations for practice and policy changes to address disparities in womens breast reconstruction options. Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are a woman who has had mastectomy for breast cancer, a breast care nurse, a breast or plastic surgeon or a clinical or policy person involved in making decisions about breast reconstruction. Study details: The study will primarily involve one-off interviews, either face-to-face or by telephone, with eligible participants. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide recommendations for practice and policy changes which improve the equity of access to breast reconstruction in Australia. </summary>
