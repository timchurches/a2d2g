  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Randomised control trial of IV and oral paracetamol to assess the efficacy of pain relief. This project could act as a pilot study to form a basis for more extensive research  to support the introduction of IV paracetamol for certain ED populations

We hypothesize that patients receiving the IV paracetamol will have a more rapid reduction in pain score, larger reduction in pain scores and require less rescue analgesia than patients in the oral paracetamol group.</summary>
