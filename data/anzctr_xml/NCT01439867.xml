  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cinacalcet hydrochloride
Treatment: drugs - Standard of Care

Experimental: Cinacalcet - Prior to the partial clinical hold, the starting dose was 0.25 mg/kg (based on dry weight) and was titrated upwards (maximum allowed daily dose of 4.2 mg/kg) based on plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), corrected serum calcium levels obtained monthly, and adverse signs and symptoms.
After the partial clinical hold the starting dose was 0.20 mg/kg (based on dry weight) and was titrated upwards (maximum allowed daily dose of 2.5 or 60 mg, whichever was lower) based on plasma iPTH, corrected serum calcium levels obtained monthly, weekly monitoring of ionized calcium levels, and adverse signs and symptoms.
All participants also received standard of care, which may have included vitamin D sterols.


Treatment: drugs: Cinacalcet hydrochloride
Cinacalcet was provided as 5 mg capsules that were opened, and the contents were either sprinkled on soft food or suspended into a sucrose syrup to create a liquid suspension for administration. All doses were administered with food or shortly after a meal at the same time daily.

Treatment: drugs: Standard of Care
Standard of care may have included vitamin D sterols (25 OH vitamin D and/or 1-25 OH vitamin D and its analogs) at the discretion of the investigator.
