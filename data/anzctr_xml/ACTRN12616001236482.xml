  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatments will be carry out during 2 sessions a week/ 3 weeks  and there will be 1 check-up 1 month after the last session (total duration of the study: 7 weeks). To develop this study 2 professional will be needed (both professionals are physiotherapists):
-	The first professional (P1) will do the selection the sample and the evaluation. 
-	The second professional (P2) will do the randomisation into 2 groups and the treatment. 

	The treatments will be:
Each patient will be randomly assigned one of two treatments. Both groups will receive the same Manual Therapy Program by the second professional (physiotherapist with more than 5 years experience).

The Manual Therapy Program has duration of 30 minutes.  
-	Passive mobilizations: 2 sets of 10 flexion mobilizations, 10 extensions, 10 abductions, 10 adductions, 10 internal rotations and 10 external rotations. 
-	Massage with movement: massage at muscles of low back pain from craneal to caudal while the patient makes an active anterior flexion (3 times).
-	Passive stretching: physiotherapist takes both patient´s legs and she does a flexion in order to approximate the knees of the patient to his breast (3 times of 1 minute).
-	Pressure release: at myofascial trigger points of quadratus lumborum (3 cycles each point with a maximum of three).

Active exercises: patient lies in a pad with knees´s flexion. 10minutes.
-	Patients make little steps from right to left (lateroflexion). 1 set of 10 times.
-	Patients drop his legs to both sides (rotation). 1 set of 10 times.
Active exercises: patient in cuadrupedia.5 minutes.
-	Cat-horse: take the whole column to flexion and extension respectively. 1 set of 10 times.

All exercises have a comfortable intensity without pain, just muscular tension.
The difference between groups will be that one of them will additionally receive a neuromuscular bandage at the end of the session (after the treatment and the exercises).
.
Neuromuscular bandage will be placed by a physiotherapist at paraspinal low back muscles: 2 vertical strips without tension and one transversal strip with 50% of tension. Patients have to make an active anterior flexion to place it and thy have to keep it during 4 days. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will have the same Manual Therapy Program but they will receive a false neuromuscular bandage.

This tape bandage haven´t the properties of the neuromuscular bandage, It is not elastic and his application has no tension. On the other hand .the strips have the same place in both groups.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Since no previous studies that allowed us to determine the sample size of the study, a pilot study with 11 patients in each group was performed. We used the mean and standard deviation of the primary outcome  (improvement in pain) in the control group , the average was 6,636 (1,566 DT) and at the case group was 8 (DT 1,183) . Under these conditions the effect size or standardized mean difference (Cohen's d) was equal to 1.03038. We used Gpower program and we considered an alpha error of 0.05 and  80% of power, the sample size required was 26 subjects (13 in each group) .

The statistical tests we have chosen are:

	A Friedman test and a Dunn test:  to see the difference between the initial and final average of each variable in the same group.
	A t-student test for independent samples: to see the difference between the initial and final average of each variable between groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nowadays, low back pain is considered as the first limitation of the activity in people younger than 45 years and the most prevalent muscular pathology in people older than 65 years old. In the same way low back pain, is the second reason of medical consultations, the third of surgery and the fifth of hospital admission.
There are a lot of treatments which try to prove its effectiveness in this type of pathology without significative results or conclusions in relation of which treatment is the most effective.
In last years, the neuromuscular bandage or kynesiotape has been widely used all around the world for the treatment of muscular disorders.
This neuromuscular bandage or kynesiotape was discovered by Kenzo Kase and Murai in the seventies. They established the functions of this bandage:
-	Analgesia.
-	Improvement of muscular function.
-	Correction of articular position and the movement direction.
-	Stimulation of propioception.
-	Increasing stability. 

Besides, this pain is an important problem because of sick leave reductions so it´s necessary an effective treatment for this patients. No studies have been found a treatment with long effects for this matter yet. That is the reason we introduce this study. We hope the addition of kynesiotape to the conservative treatment carries analgesic effects, improves movement, function, reduces pain and of course makes possible people return work.

HYPOTHESIS:
-	Conceptual hypothesis: Kynesiotape is effective in mechanical low back pain after the conservative treatment of physiotherapy. 
-	Operative hypothesis: Kynesiotape after the conservative treatment of physiotherapy, comparing with the control group, reduces pain at 3 points of VAS.

OBJECTIVES:
-	Main objective: Checking if kynesiotape is an effective complement in the conservative treatment of mechanical low back pain. 
-	Secondary objective: Improve range of motion, pain and function, just as make people return work reducing absenteeism from work.
