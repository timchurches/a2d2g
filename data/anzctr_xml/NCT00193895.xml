  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: other - Radiotherapy

Active Comparator: Radiotherapy alone - Radiotherapy alone (60Gy or 66Gy in 30-33 fractions 5-5/week)

Experimental: Radiotherapy plus chemotherapy - Radiotherapy plus chemotherapy (Radiotherapy 60Gy or 66Gy in 30-33 fractions 5/week + Carboplatin (AUC 2) intravenously weekly)


Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Carboplatin will commence with a dose calculated to target an AUC of 2.0. A maximum of 6 doses of weekly Carboplatin will be given. Carboplatin will be administered intravenously over 20-30 minutes prior to radiation therapy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the trial is to determine, in patients who have undergone surgery
      with curative intent for high-risk CSCC of the head and neck, whether there is a difference
      in time to loco-regional relapse between patients treated with post-operative concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy ,consisting of Carboplatin, and post-operative radiotherapy alone. The
      target sample size for the trial is 266 patients and will take 3-4 years to accrue, based on
      an anticipated accrual of 80 patients/year. A further 2 years follow up is required.</summary>
