  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is subcutaneous longitudinal acupuncture. We used 2.5cm filiform needles to treat the patients. First, we asked the patient to point at the most painful site. We took this most painful point as an origin of the Y-axis which was parallel with the central line of trunk through the navel. Then we took the transverse line through the navel as the X-axis. The intersection of these two lines was the point which we inserted the needle. After we inserted one needle, we asked the patient to find the most painful site and pointed at it. The same procedure was practiced repeatedly until 5 needles were inserted and taped.  In each treatment we used 5 needles totally. The time of retaining needle was 6 hours a day. We treated the patients daily and the overall duration of the treatment was 3 to 5 days based on when the inpatient was discharged from hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>We used intradermal needle as control treatment. First, we asked the patient to point at the most painful site, then we found the homologous acupoint at the abdomen and insert the needle. In each treatment we used 5 needles totally. The time of retaining needle was 6 hours a day. We treated the patients daily and the overall duration of the treatment was 3 to 5 days.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Backgorund  Pain control is emphasized as a priority for practitioners and patients with rib fracture. Main acute pain management includes analgesia and nerve block. There are some side effects recorded and the effect cant be continued. All clinical practitioners expect to create a new and safe therapy which could offer long-term pain relief. Acupuncture has been applied to relieve pain for a long time. No clinical trial has taken acupuncture to treat patients with rib fracture currently.

Methods and Evaluation  This is a prospective, randomized, and single-blind study. A creative therapy named Subcutaneous longitudinal acupuncture is applied. Intradermal needle is taken as a control to exclude placebo effect. Evaluation including pain intensity of deep breath, cough, turn over the body, and the angle and rate of turn over the body will be taken before and after needling. Quality of sleep and sustained maximal inspiration (SMI) lung volumes are also recorded.


Expected outcome  Based on the use of single oral analgesia, the involvement of long needle retention duration of Subcutaneous longitudinal acupuncture may relieve acute pain in patients with multiple rib fracture immediately. It may reduce pain when taking deep breath, coughing, and turning over the body, improve sleep quality and recovery of lung function, and decrease the incidence of other lung complications.</summary>
