    <designfeatures>This study is a pilot investigation of the feasibility of using measurement of serum 5-HIAA as a surrogate clinical marker for the antivascular activity of voltaren in patients with colorectal cancer.  This study will also investigate if increases in 5 HIAA are observed in healthy controls following a dose of voltren, and whether chemotherapeutic agents also induce a rise.</designfeatures>
