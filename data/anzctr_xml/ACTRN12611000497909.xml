    <concealment>The study will be explained by the study investigator(s) verbally and with written information in the form of a participant information sheet provided in advance. Informed consent in written form will be obtained and the participant will be screened for eligibility. All participants will undergo routine medical assessment. A randomisation sequence, determining the order of allocation of intervention drug or placebo drug chronologically with each enrolled participant, will be generated by a statistician. A third party, Wellington Hospital Pharmacy Department, not directly involved with the study, will dispense the study drug according to this schedule. Study medication will be marked 'paracetamol/placebo' and coded numerically such that the identity the medication may only determined by the third party.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paracetamol is recommended for the routine treatment of fever and systemic symptoms in influenza. However, this recommendation is contrary to evidence which suggests that the presence of fever is protective in infections. This study aims to investigate whether the regular use of an antipyretic (paracetamol) during acute infection with influenza may prolong viral shedding and clinical symptoms.</summary>

    <publication>The study manuscript is in preparation for submission to a peer-reviewed medical journal.  A draft study abstract was presented to the Thoracic Society of Australia and NZ at their Adelaide conference in April 2014. A further presentation will be made at the American Thoracic Society conference in San Diego in May 2014.</publication>
