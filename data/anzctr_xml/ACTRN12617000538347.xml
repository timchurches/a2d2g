  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will primarily be implemented by the class teacher of the child with autism within the classroom. During the one-term intervention (8 weeks), the child with autism will watch a DVD episode with their class once per week (15-20 minutes). We also request parents watch the corresponding episode each week at home with their child to reinforce the skills being worked on by the whole class at school.. The intervention DVD is pre-taped, where youth who are actors model the desired skills. There is a superhero theme used throughout the DVD to appeal to children. The DVD contains 10 episodes, each focusing on a social or communication skill children with autism find difficult (e.g., perspective-taking, sharing, initiating interactions, repetitive play). During the week, the teacher will facilitate discussions with the child/their class before and after they go out to lunch (reminding them about the things they have learnt from the DVD). The discussions will occur Monday-Friday and last approximately 3-5 minutes before and after lunch.
There is also a video-modelling project where children film themselves playing/interacting during class activities and watch the footage back to the class and discuss it (these activities will happen with the whole class). The video-modelling project is a one-off project that will occur in the last week of the intervention. it is anticipated to take one hour from filming to class discussions. However, this will vary slightly depending on the individual teacher and their classroom routine/schedule.
Three class buddies will be selected by the teacher and trained by the researcher. The researcher will train the buddies for 30 minutes at the start of week one of the intervention. During the term the buddies will help facilitate social interactions in the playground for all children in their class.
Adherence will be monitored by researchers using a weekly checklist. Reasons for non-adherence of activities will be recorded (e.g., school camp, children away).</interventions>
    <comparator>Half of the participants (schools) that enter the study will be randomly assigned to a waitlist control group. The control group will wait for 1 school term (8 weeks) before they receive the intervention. During the waitlist term, children will continue with all usual school activities.</comparator>

      <outcome>Composite secondary outcome: Social skills (as reported by teachers and parents)</outcome>
      <timepoint>A teacher-rated social skills measure (School Social Behaviour Scales-2; SSBS-2) will be used for the three selected buddies at pre- and post-intervention. The SSBS-2 will be completed for children with autism pre-intervention, post-intervention and 2 months following intervention. 
Parent-rated social skills (Home and Community Social Behaviour Scales; HCSBS) and communication skills measures (Children's Communication Checklist-2; CCC-2) will be used for children with autism pre-intervention, post-intervention and 2 months following intervention.</timepoint>

  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Children with autism: need to have a formal diagnosis of autism (made by a paediatrician or psychiatrist using recognised diagnostic procedures e.g. ADOS/DSM-IV). Children with autism need to attend a mainstream school and attend a mainstream classroom.

Typically-Developing class buddies: No diagnosis of autism/other developmental disorders and no concerns raised by parents or teachers about the childrens development. 

The Conners Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales (CCBRS; Conners, 2008) will be used as a screening measure to confirm the presence or absence of autism symptoms. Children with autism need to score above the clinical cut off (T-Score &gt;70) and class buddies needed to score below the borderline clinical cut off (T-score &lt;65)</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Children with autism will be included if they have a dual diagnosis where ADHD is included, provided autism is the primary diagnosis. Children with autism will be excluded if they are diagnosed with intellectual disability.

Class buddies will be excluded if they scored above the clinical cut off on the CCBRS.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Simple central randomisation randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software will be used to allocate participating schools across Sydney and Perth to either a control or intervention group using numbers 1-20. This study has been funded for 20 schools/children with autism. The randomisation table/list will be generated by the research team prior to participants entering the study. Children will be allocated to number 1-20 (once randomised) in the order they join the study. Researchers will only collect information about the child relating to the inclusion criteria prior to entry in the program (e.g., diagnosis of autism). The child's age, gender etc. will not be collected until an initial meeting with the school and parent takes place, once the child has been allocated to the intervention or control group.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on 3 previous pilot studies and power/sample size calculations, we determined the sample size needed was 15 children with autism per group. To calculate sample size we used the G Power calculator and input the: 1) desired power (e.g., 0.8), 2) statistical test (e.g., ANOVA), 3) alpha value (0.05) and 4) expected e ect (&gt;.5 large); which generated the
minimum sample needed n = 30. The study was funded for 20 children with autism.

Anticipated statistical analysis includes: One-way repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc LSD and Cohen's'-d e ect sizes to determine the e cacy of the intervention, and Stepwise linear regression model analysis to determine variables that predict intervention change..</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the  intervention is to improve the social and communication skills of
children with autism. We aim to do this by using children's everyday school context and their typically-developing class peers.
We suspect, that both children with autism and their class peers will demonstrate signicant
improvements in their social and communication skills following the intervention.</summary>
