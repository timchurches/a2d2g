  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - TRx0237
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: TRx0237 200 mg/day group - 

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 


Treatment: drugs: TRx0237
TRx0237 100 mg tablet will be administered twice daily.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo tablets will be administered twice daily. The placebo tablets include 4 mg of TRx0237 as a urinary and fecal colorant to maintain blinding; hence, the placebo group will receive a total of 8 mg/day of TRx0237.
