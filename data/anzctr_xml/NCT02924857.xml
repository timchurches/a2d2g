    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Chocolate Touch
Treatment: devices - Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon

Experimental: Test Group (Chocolate Touch) - The diameter of the Chocolate Touch should correspond to the diameter of the vessel for treatment with a balloon to artery ratio of 1.1:1.
The Chocolate Touch must be inflated to at least nominal pressure. Maintain balloon inflation for a minimum of 2 minutes. The balloon may be inflated as long as required to achieve optimal angioplasty outcome.
If delivery is attempted and failed, a new Chocolate Touch should be used for subsequent attempts after pre-dilatation.

Active Comparator: Control Group (Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon) - Never inflate the Lutonix® Drug Coated Balloon (DCB)prior to reaching the target lesion.
The Lutonix® Catheter should be advanced to the target site as fast as possible (i.e. 30 seconds) and immediately inflated to appropriate pressure to ensure full wall apposition (balloon to artery ratio of &gt;1:1).
If the deployment of the Lutonix® Catheter exceeds 3 minutes, the catheter requires placement with a new unit.
Maintain balloon inflation for a minimum of 2 minutes (120 seconds). The balloon may be inflated as long as required by standard of care to achieve a good angioplasty outcome.


Treatment: devices: Chocolate Touch
The Chocolate Touch Paclitaxel Coated Balloon Catheter is indicated for balloon dilatation, after appropriate vessel preparation as needed, of lesions in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries up to 15 cm in length that are appropriate for angioplasty with balloon diameters from 3.5 mm to 6.0mm.

Treatment: devices: Lutonix Drug Coated Balloon
The Lutonix® 035 Drug Coated Balloon Catheter is indicated for improving luminal diameter for the treatment of obstructive de novo or non-stented restenotic lesions (= 15 cm in length) in native femoropopliteal arteries having reference vessel diameters of 4 mm to 6 mm.
