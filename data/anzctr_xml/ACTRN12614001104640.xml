  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those randomised to intervention will receive the intervention DVD (or website for those with internet access) for pre and post-operative education as well as the standard hard copy booklet. As the pre-operative time is variable, it will be up to the participant to view the video, and it can be viewed as many times as the participant chooses. Post-oerpatively it is also up to the participant when to view the video.
The video-based intervention contains presentations about key issues faced during surgical treatment for head and neck cancer and will take up to 60 minutes to view.
The patient is also contacted at 3 timepoints of:
-pre-op clinic
-at discharge from hospital after surgery
-at 3 months post-surgery
At these timepoints patients will be asked what parts of the video they may have watched.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard education is made up of anaitial contact with the Head and Neck Cancer Clinical Nurse Consultant who provides the patient with the Cancer Council Australia Head and Neck Cancer Information booklet. It is then up to the patient to make further contact if they have any questions regarding his/her treatment. These patients do not receive any post-op nursing follow-up, but are seen by the treating surgeon.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Based on historical Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale data the standard deviation of the response variable is 3.75. With a power of 0.8 and an alpha level of 0.05 (2-sided) and in order to detect a treatment difference if the true difference between treatments is 1.500 units, the sample size calculation is then that we need 250 patients to have at 0.8 power to make a comparison (125 in in the intervention group and 125 in the control group).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the use of a pre- and post-operative DVD or web-based patient education for patients undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with primary early-stage head and neck cancer and your treatment plan includes surgery. Study details Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive a DVD, or be directed to a website, that provides them with pre- and post-operative educational information on the surgical management of head and neck cancer. While participants in the other group receive a standard pre- and post-operative education of provision of the Cancer Council Head and Neck Information Booklet. Participants will be asked to answer questionnaires on anxiety levels and quality of life before the operation, at discharge and 3 months after the operation. Partners and family members will also be asked to answer questionnaires at the same time periods as the patient.</summary>
