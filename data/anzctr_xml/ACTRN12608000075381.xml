  <interventions>
    <interventions>On the first visit weight, height, waist and hip circunference, blood pressure, fasting blood test, body composition (DEXA scan) and brachial ultrasound will be obtained. On the second visit participants will perform an incremental exercise test to maximal effort (VO2max test) on a stationary bicycle. On the thrid visit cardiac magnetic reasonance imaging (MRI) will be performed at rest and during bouts of steady-state submaximal exercise using a supine leg ergometer. Participants will then be randomised to an exercise or non-exercise group. The exercise intervention will consist of 20 weeks of exercise training (60 minutes, 4 times a week of combined aerobic and resistance training). After 20 weeks all participants (exercising and non-exercising) will have their initial assessments repeated.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aerobic capacity is reduced in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Structural and functional changes of the heart and vessels may play an important role on the decreased aerobic capacity in T1D. Exercise training in T1D adults has demonstrated increased aerobic capacity and decreased insulin use. However the exact impact of training on cardiac and vascular function and structure has yet to be established. In T1D adolescents the changes in cardiovascular morphology and function remain less defined. Signs of cardiovascular abnormalities have been observed at rest. However other studies have found no functional or structural cardiovascular changes. T1D adolescents already have reduced aerobic capacity. However, few studies have examined the causes for this reduction and the impact of exercise training and none have investigated the impact of training on heart and vessels structure or function. Considering that T1D adolescents have been exposed to diabetes for a short period of time and will face years of exposure to the diabetes health related risks, they form an important group of interest. Therefore this study aims to investigate the cardiovascular function and structure of T1D adolescents using magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound and to examine the impact of 20 weeks of exercise training on the cardiac and vascular function and structure.</summary>
