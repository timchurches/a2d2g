  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab
Treatment: drugs - Rucaparib

Experimental: Dose-Finding Phase (Part 1): Rucaparib and Atezolizumab - Approximately 6-18 participants with advanced gynecological cancers will receive different doses of rucaparib administered orally (PO) twice daily (BID) with a fixed dose of atezolizumab (1200 milligrams [mg] intravenously [IV], every 21 days) in 21-day cycles, starting with 400 mg rucaparib BID. The highest dose level with an acceptable safety profile and with a minimum of 6 participants at which fewer than one-third of participants experience a DLT will be declared the RP2D.

Experimental: Dose-Expansion Phase (Part 2): Rucaparib and Atezolizumab - Approximately 30 participants with advanced, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer will begin treatment with a 21-day run-in period of rucaparib monotherapy at the specified dose for rucaparib in the potential RP2D for the combination. Following the run in period, participants will receive the combination of rucaparib (specified dose, BID) and atezolizumab (1200 mg IV, every 21 days) in 21-day cycles.


Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight-based dose of 15 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) will be administered by IV infusion once every 3 weeks, corresponding to a 21-day treatment cycle. Participants will receive atezolizumab starting on Cycle 1, Day 1. Participants deriving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue on study treatment until the absence of unacceptable toxicity or compelling evidence of disease progression.

Treatment: drugs: Rucaparib
The starting dosage level of rucaparib for Part 1 is 400 mg PO BID during a 21-day treatment cycle. During Part 1 of the study, the rucaparib doses will be increased up to a maximum of 600 mg PO BID using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation until the RP2D for the two-drug combination of rucaparib and atezolizumab is defined. During Part 2 of the study, rucaparib will be dosed at the RP2D determined in Part 1. Participants in Part 1 of the study will receive rucaparib starting on Cycle 1, Day 1. During Part 2, participants will receive rucaparib monotherapy during a 21-day run-in period. After completion of the rucaparib run-in period and the first on-treatment biopsy between Days 15 and 21 of the run-in period, participants will begin Cycle 1, Day 1 of the rucaparib. Participants deriving clinical benefit will be allowed to continue on study treatment until the absence of unacceptable toxicity or compelling evidence of disease progression.
