  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dietary salt restriction followed by dietary salt loading.  2 week dietary salt restriction (sodium 60mmol/day) then randomised sequencial allocation to 4 weeks intervention A (tomato juice no added salt 500ml/day), intervention B (tomato juice plus 90mmol sodium, 500ml/day) intervention C (tomato juice plus 140 mmol sodium 500ml/day). There is a 4 week wash out phase between each intervention (no tomato juice). All participants remaining on the low salt diet for the duration of the study. Dietary compliance was facilitated by weekly dietitic input with advice about low salt foods, fortnightly 4 day diet records. Compliance was measured by urinary sodium/creatinine ratios at baseline, week 1, week 2 and week 4.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a cross over study so each individual acts as their own control. The tomato juice with no added sodium acts as a positive control as the participants remain on their low dietary salt diet (sodium 60 mmol/day) for the entire duration of the study.</comparator>

    <concealment>Allocation of treatment sequence was done by a third paper, contacting the hospital pharmacy who prepared the salt addition to the tomato juice, separate to the investigator. The subjects were then provided with the tomato juice from the pharmacy</concealment>

    <designfeatures>Participants and investigators were blinded to sequence allocation. However, clearly the participants will be aware of added salt to daily tomato juice once commenced intervention. Investigator remained  blinded.  There was a 4 week wash out phase between each intervention with no tomato juice. Participants remained on low salt diet (sodium 60 mmol/day throughout whole study.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the association between dietary NaCl intake and hypertension and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Reduction in dietary NaCl intake lowers blood pressure significantly, with a subsequent reduction in cardiovascular events. Reducing dietary NaCl increases arterial compliance and reduces arterial stiffness in older people with systolic hypertension. Experimentally, NaCl affects arterial stiffness by altering vascular structure along with smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell function through a variety of mechanisms. There are only a limited number of studies which have examined the effects of dietary NaCl on arterial wall function in vivo in humans. These studies have focused predominantly on large artery compliance. This study proposes to examine the impact of low, normal and high dietary NaCl on arterial function in normal healthy volunteers. Arterial function can be measured non-invasively by pulse wave analysis, pulse wave velocity and markers of endothelial function. Using these different techniques collectively, we will be able to document the impact of dietary NaCl on arterial compliance in mildly hypertensive individuals. This will then allow for subsequent studies investigating the impact of dietary NaCl in greater at risk populations of hypertensive individuals and those with chronic kidney disease.</summary>
