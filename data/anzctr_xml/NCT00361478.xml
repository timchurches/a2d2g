  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study investigates the effect of the 'Mother and Baby' (M&amp;B) program on the psychological
      health and well-being of new mothers 6-10 weeks following the birth of their baby. The M&amp;B
      program is an 8-week program of group exercise and education sessions provided by various
      health professionals. The design of the study is a comprehensive cohort design, including a
      randomised controlled trial. The primary outcome measure is the Affect Balance Scale. The
      hypotheses are:

        1. The M&amp;B program has a positive effect on new mothers' psychological health and
           well-being.

        2. The M&amp;B program increases participation in regular physical activity.

        3. the M&amp;B program benefits first time mothers more than women who have had more than one
           child.</summary>
