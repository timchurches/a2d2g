    <summary>A combination of the corticosteroid GW685698X and the long-acting Ã2-agonist GW642444M is
      being developed for once daily administration for the maintenance treatment of asthma and
      COPD. GW642444M and GW685698X will be simultaneously co-administered from a single device and
      compared with GW642444M and GW685698X administered separately in order to determine whether
      co-administration affects the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetics
      of either compound in healthy Japanese subjects.</summary>
