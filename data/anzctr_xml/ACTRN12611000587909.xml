  <interventions>
    <interventions>A force of 30-40N is applied to the patient's cricoid during intubation. This is achieved by the cricoid operator standing on a platform scale and reducing their weight on the scales by 3.060 - 4.075 kg while applying pressure to the patient's cricoid. A data recorder records weight data for later analysis by the researchers.  Once successful intubation is confirmed by end-tidal CO2,  aspirates will be suctioned from the oropharynx and trachea. the aspirates will be tested for the presence of pepsin. The patient's records will be reviewd at 28 days to determine whether they were treated for aspiration pneumonitis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The cricoid operator stands on a platform scale but is blinded to the change in their weight during application of cricoid pressure (scale display panel is covered). The amount of cricoid applied during intubation is that which the operator would normally apply (what they believe to be the correct amount of force). A data recorder records weight data for later analysis by the researchers.  
Once successful intubation is confirmed by end-tidal CO2,  aspirates will be suctioned from the oropharynx and trachea. the aspirates will be tested for the presence of pepsin. The patient's records will be reviewd at 28 days to determine whether they were treated for aspiration pneumonitis.</comparator>

    <concealment>Any adult patient requiring emergency intubation (but not receiving CPR) will be eligible for enrolment into the trial. Informed consent will be sought from the Person Responsible at the time of consent. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the study groups when the cricoid operator opens a trial enrolment pack containing the group allocation. The packs are identical are appearance therefore the group assignment is not apparent to the operator until it has been opened.</concealment>
