  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children consumed for 12 weeks one of the following treatments: One serving (33g) of ready to eat cereal (RTEC) at breakfast; two servings of RTEC, one at breakfast and another serving at dinner; one serving RTEC and mothers received a nutrition education guidance which consisted of delivering orally and written general recommendations for a healthy eating during 12 sessions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight Body Mass Index. Weight and height we meassured with an electronic scale (SECA, Erecta 844, Hamburg, Germany) and a portable stadimeter (SECA, Bodymeter 208, Germany) by personnel standardized following standard procedures recommended by the World Health Organization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, week 4, 8 and 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood lipids. A fasting blood sample was drawn from every child at basal and after 12 weeks of treatment. Blood samples were centrifuged at 1800-2000 rpm during 15 minutes and plasma was stored at -20oC until analysis. Biochemical analysis in plasma samples included triglycerides, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol and were done using a commercial kit (Sera?Pak Kit Bayer Diagnostics, France).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body fat. A body composition analysis was carried out by bioelectrical impedance using a conductance measurement apparatus (BIA 101, RJL Systems, Clinton TWP, MI).</outcome>

    <concealment>Children were first measured and weighted, those with BMI &gt;85% and assesed by a physician as healthy, were cited few days later to let them know the treatment they were allocated to which was determined by another person in the central office.</concealment>
    <sequence>Several randomizations were performed to each of the different groups stratified by gender, age, height and BMI percentile. This was achieved with a computer program developed by one of us.</sequence>
