  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Evolocumab
Treatment: surgery - Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Apheresis

Experimental: Evolocumab - Participants received 140 mg evolocumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) administered by subcutaneous injection for 6 weeks during the primary period of the study. Starting at week 6 (beginning of the post-primary period), participants received 140 mg evolocumab Q2W up to week 24.

Active Comparator: Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Apheresis - Participants continued apheresis at the same schedule, every week (QW) or every two weeks (Q2W), as prior to study entry, for the first 6 weeks. Starting at week 6 (beginning of the post-primary period), participants received 140 mg evolocumab Q2W up to week 24.


Other interventions: Evolocumab
Administered by subcutaneous injection once every 2 weeks

Treatment: surgery: Low-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) Apheresis
Participants received apheresis for LDL-C according the their physician's prescription and local custom.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Apheresis Avoidance at the End of Randomized Therapy - Avoidance of apheresis at end of randomized therapy was defined as no apheresis at week 5 and week 6. Aperesis at weeks 5 or 6 was based on LDL-C level at week 4:
participants with LDL-C = 100 mg/dL at week 4 received apheresis at week 5 (participants who received apheresis QW before study entry) or week 6 (participants who received apheresis Q2W prior to study entry). If LDL-C was &lt; 100 mg/dL at week 4, no apheresis was performed at week 5 or week 6, irrespective of assigned treatment group.
Participants who ended the study prior to week 6 were considered as not achieving apheresis avoidance.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male or female, = 18 years of age

          -  Subject has been receiving regular apheresis for LDL-C lowering for at least 3 months
             immediately prior to lipid screening and has a treatment goal of LDL-C &lt; 100 mg/dL
             (2.6 mmol/L), and has been receiving LDL-C apheresis during the last = 4 weeks prior
             to lipid screening at regular QW or Q2W schedule and with no changes in apheresis type

          -  Subject is receiving lipid-lowering pharmacological background therapy which includes
             a high-intensity statin dose (moderate-intensity statin dose with attestation that a
             higher dose is not appropriate for the subject) unless the subject has a history of
             statin intolerance

          -  Lipid-lowering therapy status (ie, any therapy for lowering lipids, including
             apheresis type and frequency) must be unchanged for = 4 weeks prior to LDL-C screening

          -  Pre-apheresis LDL-C is = 100 mg/dL (= 2.6 mmol/L) and = 190 mg/dL (= 4.9 mmol/L) at
             screening
