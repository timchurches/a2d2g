  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has shown that individuals suffering from recurrent headaches have inadequate social support. Research results suggest that it should be possible to increase the effectiveness of headache treatment for individuals who have inadequate support by specifically helping them to increase the size of their social networks and to derive more support from their networks. The proposed study compares a pychological treatment (cognitive behaviour therapy) with a focus on social support, with the same treatment given for the same number of sessions but without a focus on social support. It is predicted that the former approach will work best for individuals with inadequate social support and the latter approach will work best for those with adequate social support. Tension-type headaches are the most common type of primary headache and have the highest socioeconomic impact. The study results will have important implications for our understanding of how tension-type headaches can be managed.</summary>
