Experimental: Dose Escalation 1 - Subjects will receive carfilzomib in combination with induction chemotherapy, comprising either an R3 backbone of dexamethasone, mitoxantrone, PEG asparaginase, and vincristine (Dose Escalation 1) or a VXLD backbone of vincristine, dexamethasone, PEG asparaginase, and daunorubicin (Dose Escalation 2).

Subjects in both dose escalation portions of the study will receive a 4 week cycle of induction chemotherapy and have the option to receive a 4 week cycle of consolidation chemotherapy (Children's Oncology Group (COG) modified Berlin Frankfurt Münster (BFM) chemotherapy backbone (6 mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, PEG asparaginase, vincristine), if stable disease or better response is achieved at the end of the Induction Cycle.
