  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With First Clinical Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR) Episode 6 Months Post-Transplant - Clinical BPAR was a BPAR (category acute rejection as interpreted by the central blinded pathologist according to the Banff 97 working classification) associated with an increase in serum creatinine of &gt;= 0.3 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) and &gt;=20 percent (%) from pre-rejection baseline. The increase in serum creatinine was assessed based on the comparison of baseline and the highest serum creatinine recorded within 24 hours (hrs) of the time of biopsy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Month 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) at Month 12 - GFR: an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using iohexol serum clearance. For determination of iohexol serum clearance, iohexol was administered as an intravenous bolus over 5 minutes immediately after morning dosing of CP-690,550 or CsA on day of GFR evaluation. A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;) 90 milliliter per minute (mL/min), although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;) 15 mL/min indicated kidney failure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2, 3, 4, and 5 hrs post iohexol intravenous bolus at Month 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) at Month 6 - GFR: an index of kidney function. GFR described the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using iohexol serum clearance. For determination of iohexol serum clearance, iohexol was administered as an intravenous bolus over 5 minutes immediately after morning dosing of CP-690,550 or CsA on day of GFR evaluation. A normal GFR is &gt;90 mL/min, although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR &lt;15 mL/min indicated kidney failure.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Progression of Chronic Allograft Lesions at Month 12 - Progression of chronic allograft lesions was defined as an increase in the Banff chronicity score (Banff-CS) in biopsy from the implantation (baseline) biopsy in a given participant. Banff-CS was the sum of the Banff scores for the 4 chronic basic lesions (allograft glomerulopathy [cg] + interstitial fibrosis [ci] + tubular atrophy [ct] + vascular intimal thickening [cv]).The Banff-CS ranged from 0-12, higher score indicated greater lesions and Month 12 Banff-CS greater than the implantation biopsy score indicated progression of lesions.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A new immunosuppressive drug, based on the inhibition of an important enzyme in the immune
      system called JAK3, is being developed by Pfizer to prevent transplant rejection. In this
      research study, a JAK3 inhibitor or cyclosporine will be given to new kidney transplant
      patients for 12 months. Patients will be assigned to one of three treatment groups after
      receiving a kidney transplant. Two of the treatment groups will receive 2 different dosing
      regimens of the JAK3 inhibitor that will be taken by mouth. The third treatment group will be
      a standard-of-care control arm. Patients will continue to take the assigned study medication
      for 12 months as well as other standard transplant medications such as prednisone.</summary>
