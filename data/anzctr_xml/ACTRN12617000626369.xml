  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to describe lactate metabolism in critically ill patients our group has designed a simple, minimally invasive protocol in healthy volunteers. In our current study we aim to use this protocol in a mixed ICU population.
Briefly patients will be recruited after informed consent (from next of kin when appropriate). After this baseline samples will be drawn and a bolus dose of 13C-labeled lactate (2.7mg/kg) will be given. Blood samples will be drawn over two hours (no more than 100 ml all together), samples will be frozen and analyzed for lactate concentration and 13C-enrichment. An interim analysis will be conducted after the first 6 patients. Data will be collected from electronical charting systems.</summary>
