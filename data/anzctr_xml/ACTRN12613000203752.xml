  <interventions>
    <interventions>Involvement of a mobile rehabilitation team consisting of at least physio, occupational therapy and social worker and rehabilitation medicine physician. This team provides early multidipsciplinary assessment, adequate intensity of therapy (1-2 hours per day), and weekly case conferencing. They will provide rehabilitation interventions in parallel care with trauma/surgical team for the duration of the acute hospital stay. Patients are monitored as soon as they are admitted by the research assistant and approached for consent. Once the patient consents, early multidisicplinary rehabilitation assessment will take place within 24 hours (or 3 days if on a weekend) or  as soon as he/she is discharged from intensive care.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A multi-site single-blinded stratified randomised controlled trial.
A research assistant screens and consents all eligible patients.
The patient is then allocated by central randomisation by fax.
At each of the 3 sites, patients will be stratified by using the Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS) to obtain the Injury Severity Score into severe or mild/moderate and then randomised to either the intervention or control arm.</concealment>
    <sequence>Within each stratum, randomisation in blocks has been made. The website http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1.cfm has been used to randomly shuffle numbers from 1 to 30 seven times. This has been repeated twice, once for each stratum.   The blocks will ensure even distribution of participants in each of the two arms within the two strata as the proportion of participants in the two stratification is unknown.  Odd numbers have been assigned 'intervention' and even numbers 'control'. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Those randomised to the intervention group will receive the services of a Mobile Rehabilitation team who will deliver rehabilitation services while the participant is admitted to the acute wards. Those randomised to the control group will have usual care. Both groups will be followed up by phone interview at 3 months for those with moderate injury and 6 months for those with severe injury to determine health outcomes.</summary>
