    <studytitle>Comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmcodynamics of recombinant and urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG vs uhCG)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A two part study to compare the pharmacological effects of recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG/Ovidrel) versus urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG/Pregnyl) given as subcutaneous injection to healthy men following supression of endogenous testosterone (T) and luteinising hormone (LH) with nandrolone decanoate(ND).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1: a randomised single dose two phase cross over study. 10 healthy men will receive intramuscular (IM) nandrolone decanoate (ND) 200mg on day 0. Then will be randomised to recieve 1500iu subcutaneous (s/c) injection of either  rhCG (Ovidrel) or uhCG (Pregnyl) on day 3/week one followed by s/c rhCG or uhCG on day 10/ week 2 (crossover design).
IM Nandrolone decanoate injections will be repeated on days 4 (100mg), 7 (200mg) and 11 (100mg).
Part 2: a parallel (two) group, multi-dose study 
16 healthy men will be recruited into the study.
After consent is provided, each participant will undergo suppression of endogenous T levels prior to and during gonadotrophin treatment by administration of a 200mg intramuscular injections of ND. IM Nandrolone decanoate injections will be repeated on days 5 (100mg), 7 (200mg) and 12 (100mg).  After the first ND injection, men will be randomised to receive either Pregnyl 1500iu or Ovidrel 1500iu  by subcutaneous injection on days 3, 5, 7 and 10.

All participants will have a single 5ml blood sample taken for Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis in order to investigate genetic predictors of variable responses to hCG.</interventions>
    <comparator>Part 1: 10 participants will act as their own controls in the cross over study as each one will receive both treament options in a random order.
Part 2: 16 participants will be randomised to receive multiple doses of either rhCG or uhCG and comparisons made between the 2 groups. IM Nandrolone will be administered on days 0, 5, 7 and 10.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the pharmacokinetic (serum hCG)  and pharmacodynamic (serum testosterone) effect of each hCG product in a single dose, cross over randomised sequence, clinical trial  in healthy men who have temporary supression of endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) in order to observe the pharmacology of the two hCG products on serum testosterone concentrations in the abscence of endogenous testosterone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be collected at baseline and then on the morning of days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the effect of multiple (4) doses of each hCG product on the pharmacokinetics (serum hCG) and pharmacokinetics (serum T) levels in a randomised, parallel group clinical trial of healthy men undergoing supression of endogenous LH and T using nandrolone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken at baseline and then on each morning of days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 17.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Prior to entry into the study, potential participants are assessed for eligibility and required to provide written consent on the approved form.

The men will be informed of the studyâ€™s objectives and overall requirements.  A study investigator will explain the study using the Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form and participants will be provided with a copy of the Information and Consent forms.  If the man is willing to participate in the study, he will be required to give written consent, which will be witnessed by the investigator.

Treatment allocation will be done using opaque, sealed, numbered envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Assignment to treatment group will be determined according to a computer generated randomisation list prepared by an investigator not directly involved with the hormone administration or blood sampling in the study.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Crossover</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Treatment is open and unblinded in both studies as all pharmacological endpoints are based on objective measures (serum hormone assays) that are undertaken by scientists unaware of treatment assignment and using assays that cannot be influenced by their or the nurses knowledge of treatment.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are currently 2 forms of injectable hCG available in Australia. One is derived from urine (Pregnyl) and the other is genetically engineered (Ovidrel). hCG is used to treat men and women with certain types of infertility.  However only Pregnyl is available for use in males.  If Pregnyl is withdrawn from the market then there will no alternative form of treatment for infertile men. 
We aim to compare the action of both forms of hCG in healthy males to determine if Ovidrel has the same pharmacological effects as Pregnyl, when given to men.</summary>
