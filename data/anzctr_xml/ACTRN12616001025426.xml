  <interventions>
    <interventions>An individual sixty minutes intervention of physiotherapy one per week for two years
The sensory motor stimulation physiotherapy including functional electrical stimulation (FES)- cycling will involve electrode stimulation to the quadriceps, hamstring, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius while using Motomed cycling model VIVA 2 which syncchronize with Hasomed Rehamove 2 a FES machine during gait cycling. The parameters will be set with 300 microsecond pulse width, 30 Hz frequency, 35 rpm speed and 70-140 mA intensity. The dynamic balance training program reported here is based on a previously developed mechanical apparatus which is commercially available as the "Balance Trainer", It consists of two parallel bars that are connected to a base `plate via a two-degrees-of-freedom mechanical joint that allow for the physiological movement of a person while standing as well as while performing a single step. The patients perform various tasks during standing on the Balance Trainer and a physiotherapist guiding, correcting and facilitating movement and proper posture of the trunk. The subject can incline to the right, left, foward and backward while therapists monitor the posture of the trunk. This is performed after cycling. The duration spent on each is 20 minutes and there is 10 minutes rest between each exercise.. These sessions are supervised by the physiotherapist. The strategy used to monitor adherence is a daily diary about the exercises.
