Treatment: drugs: Cilengitide
Cilengitide 2000 mg flat i.v. twice weekly is administered over a period of 18 months without interruption.
Starting one week after the initiation of Cilengitide, RTX (60 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction) with concurrent daily temozolomide (60 mg/m2 p.o.) and daily procarbazine (PCB, 50 mg p.o. if BSA &lt; 1.7; 100 mg p.o. if BSA = 1.7) is given over a period of 6 weeks (RTX Monday to Friday, both TMZ and PCB seven days a week).
After a break of 4 weeks, adjuvant TMZ (50mg/m2 p.o in first cycle, 60 mg/m2 p.o. in subsequent cycles) and PCB (50 mg p.o. if BSA &lt; 1.7; 100 mg p.o. if BSA = 1.7) are then given daily D1 to 20. This TMZ/PCB cycle is repeated every 28 days over a total period of 6 cycles.
