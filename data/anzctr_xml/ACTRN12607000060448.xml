  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention/s: The intervention group will undergo a 3-year program targeting lifestyle factors important in the development of cardiovascular complications of diabetes, and comprising 3 components;
1) Exercise training (both aerobic and strength training) will start with 1 month of twice-weekly supervised training, in combination with a home training program. After the supervised period, the program will be adjusted and patients will continue with this at home. Ongoing telephone contact will be maintained and the program altered according to progress.
2) Dietary advice will start with weekly dietician visits for 3 months. These will include weighing, 6 minute walk, review of dietary intake and education. Ongoing dietary advice will continue by provision of telephone contact and refresher courses every 6 months.
3) Ongoing personalized support and counselling by the study nurse, to ensure attendance for testing and optimize compliance with guideline-based medical therapy by the patients general practitioner, including aggressive management of insulin resistance and glucose levels.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients with type 2 diabetes are at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.  Lifestyle changes and an exercise program may reduce damage to the structure and function of blood vessels and improve heart function.  In this trial, subjects with type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned to one of two groups  Usual care (ie standard treatment of diabetes according to guidelines) or Active intervention (additional measures such as frequent follow-up, additional dietary advice and an exercise program, in addition to usual care). The efficacy of these interventions on cardiovascular structure and function, exercise capacity, attainment of target biochemistry and outcome will be assessed after 1 month, 1 year and 3 years</summary>
