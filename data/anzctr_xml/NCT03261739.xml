             in subjects with documented NAFLD or fatty liver by ultrasound or transient
             elastography if approved by medical monitor).

             drug half-life, whichever is longer, prior to the first study drug administration.

             investigational or approved medications for NASH, or antidepressant medications within
             90 days of screening.

             weight during study.

         14. Daily alcohol intake &gt;20 g/day for women and &gt;30 g/day for men (on average per day),
