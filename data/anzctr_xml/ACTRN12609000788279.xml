    <interventions>Ascending single and multiple oral doses of BMS-817399, a chemokine receptor 1 antagonist administered to healthy subjects.
The effect of food (high-fat meal) will also be studied.

In the single ascending dose part (SAD; Part A), 8 subjects/panel, will receive single oral dose of the test medication (or placebo in 3:1 ratio) in a double blinded manner as follows:
Panel 1: 20 mg capsule
Panel 2: 80 mg capsule
Panel 3: 200 mg capsule under fast in Period 1 and 200 mg capsule after a high fat meal* in Period 2 (to study food effect)
Panel 4: 400 mg capsule in Period 1 and 400 mg oral suspension in Period 2
Panel 5: 800 mg capsule
Panel 6: 1600 mg oral suspension
Panel 7: 2000 mg oral suspension.
*High fat meal contain 54.6 mg fat, 82.3 mg carbohydrate and 32.1 gram of protein.  The high fat meal will be served within 30 minutes prior to dosing and the subject must ingest the meal completely within this time period.

The duration of each period in Part A is 5 days postdose, with a single dose administered on Day 1. 

No subject from Part A of the study will participate in Part B of the study.

In the multiple ascending dose part (MAD; Part B), 8 subjects/panel, will receive the test medication (or placebo in 3:1 ratio) orally 2 times a day (every 12 hours) for 13 days and a single dose on Day 14 in a double blinded manner as follows:
Panel 1: 40 mg capsule
Panel 2: 100 mg capsule
Panel 3: 200 mg capsule
Panel 4: 400 mg capsule
Panel 5: 800 mg capsule
Panel 6: 1000 mg capsule

The duration of each panel in Part B will be 17 days with dosing up to Day 14.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo capsule is an opaque, gray, size #00 two-piece, hard gelatin capsule that contains Microcrystalline Cellulose, NF (99.75% w/w) and Magnesium Stearate, NF (0.25% w/w).

Placebo for the Oral suspension is microcrystalline cellulose in 0.25% w/v hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in water.

Of the 8 subjects in each dose panel in the whole study, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive the active compound (BMS-817399) and 2 subjects to receive placebo.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety &amp; tolerability assessment of BMS-817399 will be based on medical review of adverse event reports, the results of vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests.  The incidence of adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The subjects will be monitored for any adverse events continuously while they  remain in the clinic.  Additionally, site staff will ask the subjects for any adverse events that they may be undergoing.

In Part A of the study, subjects will stay at the study site for a total of 6 nights per period.  Subjects in Panels 3 and 4 will spend a total of 11 and 12 nights respectively, to complete Period 2.

Subjects in Part B will spend a total of 18 nights at the study site.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the effects of BMS-817399 on the QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) and PR intervals, electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be measured at predetermined timepoints throughout the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In Part A (SAD) of the study, ECGs will be measured at the following timepoints:
Baseline, and on Days 1, 2, &amp; 5

In Part B (MAD) of the study, ECGs will be measured at the following timepoints:
Baseline, and on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 15 &amp; 17.</timepoint>

    <summary>Nucleus Network Limited.
The primary purpose of this study is to determine if BMS-817399 can be safely administered to human beings at dose ranges that may provide clinical benefit to patients of rheumatoid arthritis. The study has no formal research hypothesis to be statistically tested. The study will be carried out in normal healthy volunteers under close observation to determine BMS-817399 dose ranges that are safe and tolerable in human beings. Initially, BMS-817399 will be given as a single dose by mouth, with doses increasing till the highest tolerated dose that is also safe is determined. Following this, BMS-817399 will be given as more than one dose daily by mouth for a period of fourteen days, with doses increasing in amount till the highest tolerated dose that is also safe is determined. To know the amount of BMS-817399 that has entered into the body, blood will be drawn for testing. Other test will also be done to see if BMS-817399 is safe and has the expected effects in the body. During the period of dosing and testing, the patient will be confined to the clinic for close observation. Taking part in this study will not provide any medical benefit to the subjects.</summary>
