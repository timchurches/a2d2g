  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ear-acupressure is a non-invasive treatment that involves taping small round pellets onto points in the ear. A two-week run-in period will be used to collect baseline data, including, nicotine withdrawal symptoms record, number of cigarettes smoked daily and record of nicotine replacement thearapy usage.
After a two-week run-in period, each participant will be given ear-acupressure treatment once per week for eight weeks by a registered acupuncturist. Stainless-steel Press-pellet Tapes (Magrain Pellets: Cat. No. PELSST S/Steel Tan, Acuneeds Co., Australia), will be used for this study. The participants will be instructed in the technique of how to press the five pellets three times daily by themselves throughout the week and whenever they feel a craving for cigarettes. During the week, participants will need to record how many pellets remain attached each day in the case report form. At weekly visits, the acupuncturist will remove the remaining pellets and attach new pellets to the same acupuncture points on the ear on the opposite side of the body. The two ears will be used alternately on a weekly basis for the 8 weeks with the left ear being used at first treatment. Participants are required to select a quit date within the first two treatment weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-specific ear-acupressure as 'sham' control. Due to the large number of acu-points on the ear, it is difficult to construct a plausible non-ear-acupressure control. Therefore, five ear points which are non-specific for smoking cessation will be chosen for the participants assigned to the non-specific control group. There are over 90 acupuncture points on the ear. These five ear points are not known to be used for smoking cessation or respiratory conditions. After a two-week run-in period, each participant will be given non-specific ear-acupressure treatment once per week for eight weeks by a registered acupuncturist.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to investigate the efficacy of ear-acupressure for smoking cessation, and the effect of ear-acupressure on nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Ear-acupressure is like acupuncture but no needles are used, instead, small round pellets are taped to points on one ear. The study consists of a two week run-in, followed by eight weeks of weekly visits and 12 weeks of follow-up.</summary>
