A single operator Dr Michael Fredrickson (MF) will place all interscalene catheters (ISCs) in the operating room. Patients will be premedicated with oral acetaminophen 1 g, diclofenac SR 75 mg and omeprazole 20 mg one hour before surgery. Intravenous midazolam 2 mg, alfentanil 0.5 mg and cephazolin 1 g will be administered 5 min prior to interscalene catheter placement. Catheters will be placed following either the administration of a superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) or after the induction of general anaesthesia depending on patient preference. ISCs will be placed using a combination of ultrasound and nerve stimulation. 

General anaesthesia will then be administered and ropivacaine 0.5% 0.5 mL/kg to a maximum of 30 mL will be administered through the ISC. 

Continuous block patients will then receive an ambulatory infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at the end of surgery.</interventions>

    <concealment>A invitation to participate in the study will be posted to patients identified from the operating list.  One preoperative phone call will be made by the research assistant to assess patientâ€™s suitability for the study.  At this stage participation in this study would be discussed with the patient. Post operatively, patients will be questioned by phone for some simple data for the first 2 days following surgery. All patients will have a follow-up phone call at 10 days (5-10 mins) and they will be asked to fill out another questionnaire at 3 months.
Patients will be assigned to one of the two groups by random number generator, and assignments delivered in a sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computerised random number generator will be used to assign the patient to one of the 2 groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute postoperative pain is commonly severe after major shoulder surgery - with opioids being required for several days.  There is increasing evidence that poorly treated acute postoperative pain is a predictor of chronic pain and therefore chronic disability. Further, evidence exists that preventing early postoperative pain reduces the risk of chronic pain.  Continuous interscalene block (CISB) has been shown to provide better analgesia and patient satisfaction than opioids for rotator cuff surgery. It has also been shown to improve patient outcome. CISB has been successfully used in Auckland for 4 years, however, anaesthetists have had to base many aspects of the technique on personal opinion rather than evidence from high quality research. Although CISB has been shown to provide better analgesia and patient satisfaction than opioids for rotator cuff repair,  it is unknown whether these benefits apply to less painful procedures such as arthroscopic stabilization and arthroscopic subacromial decompression. For both procedures, randomized trials comparing CISB with traditional opioid analgesia have not been conducted. 
The purpose of the current study is to determine whether CISB provides better analgesia and patient satisfaction than traditional single shot interscalene block (the community standard) following minor shoulder procedures (subacromial decompression and stabilisation).
If the primary hypothesis is confirmed, this study will provide evidence supporting the use of continuous interscalene block for this surgery.
This may result in future patients experiencing less postoperative pain after minor shoulder surgery. Potential benefits might include a lower incidence of post shoulder surgery chronic pain.</summary>
