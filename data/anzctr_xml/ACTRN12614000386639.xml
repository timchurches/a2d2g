  <interventions>
    <interventions>Link is a dedicated online web service to guide users to appropriate avenues for both online and offline sources of care. 
The service will triage the user by assessing the area of concern, severity of concern and readiness to access care. For the purposes of this study, users must sign in so that their data can be stored and accessed again. Users can also return and log in to return to data that they have already entered.
Based on the triage, users will also be given detailed information about three services appropriate to their needs and wants plus an additional 'recommended' service. Information about that service including target area, triage criteria, evidence to support it and youth friendliness will be included. Each service listed will have some digital content associated with it, outlining what to expect from the service, a successful story from a young person who has used it and what to prepare for when accessing the service. This information can be accessed through the triage once the user reaches the recommended services page. The website should take a minimum of 90 seconds to complete (as per recommendations for developing websites and apps for young people) but users can spend longer to explore their issues and return if they wish. Participants in the intervention arm will have access to the website for the duration of the trial (1 month in total).</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual help-seeking strategies will be the control condition. Participants will be asked to seek help for their issue and be directed to google. However, they may seek help however they wish, but will not have access to the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported help-seeking behaviours assessed using an online version of the Mental Health Care Resource Use Questionnaire (Mihalopoulos, Lee, Magnus, Shih, &amp; Chatterton, 2014).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Help-seeking intentions will be assessed by self-report using the Stages of Change Questionnaire (Lewis et al., 2009) and two items created using the ReBEQI guidelines (Francis et al., 2004) that ask agreement on a 7-Point Likert Scale, 'I want to seek help for my problems' and 'I intend to seek help for my problems'</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month after randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Access to appropriate care assessed by self-report and experts.  Participants who indicate that they have found help using the resource use questionnaire, will complete questions asking how appropriate this source of information was for them in terms of: whether their questionnaire were answered the service helpful, the service matched the problem, and whether the service helped them understand the problem better. A panel of experts will be given data about the issues, level of distress and the types of care received, and using this data determine whether the services used were appropriate for the individual. </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 month</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Timeliness of access to appropriate care will be assessed after determining whether the participant has reached an appropriate service. If an appropriate service is reached, the time to access will be calculated according to whether the young adult reached the service within the first 7 days or at one month.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed once completed help-seeking strategy (either intervention or usual help-seeking strategies) from 1 to 7 days after baseline and again 1 month after baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mental health will be measured by self-report using the k10 (Kessler et al., 2003) and the Mental Health Continuum - short form (Lambers, 2011). 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Economic evaluation will be measured using the self-report resource use and the Adolescent Quality of Life Questionnaire (Hawthorne et al., 2013), </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month after randomisation </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in self-worth, empowerment, attitudes and self-stigma will self-reported using the Adolescent Quality of Life Scale (Hawthorne et al., 2013), the Barriers to Adolescents Seeking Help scale (Kuhl et al., 1997), 5 questions about people they know who have sought help before and their attitudes towards it, and the Mental Health Literacy Vignette (Jorm et al., 2007).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction and trust in the service, and the likelihood of using the service in the future will be self-administered. Participants will complete the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and asked 10 items adapted from Retolaza (2003) about whether their expectations were met.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Each participant will be identified by an identification number (ID). This ID will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control arms using a random seed generator. The sequence for the random allocation will be set up automatically by the computer software used (QuON) and not involve the research team directly. Participants will be allocated to a trial arm after completion of the baseline survey. A link to either google or Link will be attached to the participants identification number depending on randomisation allocated in order to prevent the researchers from identifying the arm the participants are allocated to. Once that person clicks the link and enters the website, they will be randomised into the program.  The program developers will be independent and not involved in any data collection or analyses. An academic, independent from the research team and not directly involved with the research, will provide assistance and oversee the randomisation process.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A small pilot study will first be conducted consisting of 80-100 young adults in each arm (a total of 200 participants, allowing for 2/3 attrition as is likely when recruiting participants from online sources) to test the feasibility of trial methods including response rate and attrition rate, suitability of measures, and progress through the intervention. This information will assist with refining the methods for the main trial and estimating the required sample size.  Intention-to-treat analysis will be used with a focus on latent growth curve modelling. Mixed methods analysis will also be used to test the primary and secondary outcomes of help-seeking intentions and behaviours, appropriateness of care, timeliness of access, mental health symptoms, economic evaluation, self-worth, empowerment, attitudes and stigma, as well as satisfaction and trust in the help-seeking strategies. User experiences, satisfaction and process evaluation will also be qualitatively conducted in interviews with a small number of participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Of the one in four young people who are diagnosed with mental disorders, only 35% seek professional help. There are many barriers preventing young people from seeking help such as: lack of recognition of mental health problems, lack of awareness about appropriate mental health services, readiness to seek help, and the stigma associated with mental illness and seeking professional health. Technological solutions have been identified as one of the key areas that should be utilised to improve treatments and access to care. Young people often seek information about health online and often prefer anonymous sources of help to traditional services. Nevertheless, despite the broad interest and vast amount of online services available to assist young people with mental health problems, evaluation is rarely conducted to determine the impact of online services on help-seeking. Focusing particularly on young adults aged 18 to 25 years, we aim to investigate the effects of a dedicated online tool to facilitate help-seeking in young adults compared to usual search strategies. All surveys and recruitment will be conducted online. Young adults will be asked to complete three surveys at baseline, one week, and one month. 
This project is of international relevance as one of the first dedicated online tool to facilitate help-seeking for young adults and one of the few to evaluate access to care as an outcome. It will also help inform policy and practice with evidence on whether technical solutions can increase help-seeking for young adults using a stepped-care approach.
