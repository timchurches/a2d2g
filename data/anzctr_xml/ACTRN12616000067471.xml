  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be recruited during a gestational diabetes pregnancy. However, the active intervention will commence from the time of discharge from hospital. Intervention subjects will be given guidelines to follow (standard post gestational diabetes booklet from Diabetes Australia), a Fitbit wrist band activity monitor (to be worn continuously), and a telephone lifestyle counselling session with a dietician (of no more than 1 hour duration) at 6-10 weeks post-partum. They will subsequently receive 3-4 semi-personalised and culturally sensitive SMS messages per week, to provide advice, motivation, information and support with a focus on addressing and overcoming known barriers to behaviour change. The SMS messages will be spaced 1-2 days apart. They will have the opportunity to have further contact with the lifestyle counsellor if required by telephone, SMS or email. Data from the activity monitor will be visible to the subject, but also downloaded centrally via the internet and thus accessible to the investigators. This will enable monitoring of physical activity which will also be fed back into the SMS messaging. The intervention goes for 6 months from the initial counselling session, in the post-partum period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Subjects randomized to Control will receive standard paper based advice regarding healthy lifestyle following gestational diabetes. They will be contacted at 12 weeks to remind them to have a glucose tolerance test, and to be encouraged to remain in the study for the full 8 months (6 months + additional 2 months to factor in the delay before lifestyle counselling in the intervention group).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This proposal aims to use new technology to aid the management of women after gestational diabetes (GDM), to improve lifestyle behaviours and adherence to recommendations in the postpartum period. If successful, this
model would support diabetes prevention programs for women following GDM, particularly those in remote or regional settings.
This randomised controlled trial will recruit women during a GDM pregnancy, with the intervention being conducted in the 6 months postpartum.
The intervention will include the use of interactive mobile phone messaging, the use
of an activity monitor, supported by individual consultations with a health counsellor. Control subjects will receive standard care.
The main outcomes to be analysed are the proportion of women meeting dietary and physical activity guidelines.</summary>
