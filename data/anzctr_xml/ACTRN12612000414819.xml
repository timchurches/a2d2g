    <interventions>CRUfAD Schools: Overcoming Anxiety and Combating Depression is an online universal prevention program delivered as part of the Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) Syllabus for New South Wales. 
Participants will receive access to the CRUfADschools anxiety and depression course as an internet Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) program. This iCBT program is based on the efficacy of the CRUfAD Schools model in stress, alcohol and cannabis in three earlier based interventions (Van Vilet &amp; Andrews, 2009), (Newton, Andrews, Teesson, &amp; Vogl, 2009; Newton, Teesson, Vogl, &amp; Andrews, 2010; Vogl et al., 2009). The Overcoming Anxiety program consist of six lessons and summaries and the Combating Depression program contains seven lessons. 
Both represent best practice principles used in Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for depression and anxiety including skill acquisition, psychoeducation, and management of psychological symptoms, cognitive symptoms, behaviour and additional skills specific to each disorder. The program was delivered once a week over a total of six weeks. The lessons run for 40 minutes using blended (online and classroom) teaching techniques. 
The first is a 15-20 minute online module. Students are instructed to log onto the program and individually undertake the self-directed program. Students complete quizzes and follow a cartoon storyline of teenagers experiencing and solving real life problems with anxiety and depression. As participants progress through each lesson they complete quizzes and a lesson summary activity sheet. The second half of the lesson, students return to a class discussion. Using the downloadable teachers manual, teachers are instructed to hand out a set of activities and resources to reinforce the information learnt in the previous lesson. Teachers in the intervention group required minimal training. The control schools received PDHPE classes as usual.</interventions>

    <concealment>Randomisation occurred at the level of school (not at the individual student). Schools were invited to participate in the condition to which they had been allocated as determined by a random allocation schedule. The condition to which schools were allocated was not concealed from the schools. However, students were not informed about the use of a CONTROL versus INTERVENTION to ensure this did not bias responding.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation process was completed by an independent researcher, who developed a simple randomisation schedule for schools using a coin tossing procedure.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to assess the feasibility and efficacy of an evidence-based internet anxiety and depression prevention program for year 9-10 of high school. Currently, evidence-based programs do exist, but are largely not implemented in schools due to implementation (e.g., limited resources and teacher training) and dissemination failure. The aim of developing CRUfAD Schools: Alcohol Module is to overcome such concerns by developing a online intervention which would have the advantage of providing complete, consistent and flexible delivery on every occasion, without demanding excess teachers time, resources and training. CRUfAD Schools: Overcoming Anxiety and Combating Depression would also have the potential advantage of being an interactive program which would allow high-risk populations, who often do not seek help, to seek help with relative anonymity and confidentiality.</summary>
