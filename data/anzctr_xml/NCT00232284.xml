  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to treat young people with an adjunctive integrated cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) intervention and to examine the acceptability of this treatment approach within
      this population. The study will also include a pilot placebo-controlled trial of sertraline
      for those young people who fail to or only partially respond to the CBT intervention, so as
      to determine whether adjunctive anti-depressant treatment improves clinical response in this
      population.</summary>
