  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part 1 has a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-condition crossover design. This part of the study will enroll 30 subjects into three Dose Cohorts for MRX-I Tablets. The dose levels of MRX-I Tablets will be 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg. Each of the three subject Dose Cohorts will receive a single dose of MRX-1 Tablets under two different conditions (Fasting Condition or Fed Condition), each condition separated by a 5-day washout period.  Subjects will be confined in a Clinical Research Unit during the dosing periods and will be monitored to ensure compliance with dosing.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Part 1: On Day 1 and Day 7, obtain blood for PK analyses immediately prior to administration of study drug, and at 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after administration of study drug. On Day 1 and Day 7, obtain urine for PK analysis immediately prior to administration of study drug and at 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and 24-36 hours after administration of study drug.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study on healthy volunteers is to determine the safety and tolerability of MRX-I, an orally administered antibiotic.  There will be three Parts to the study.  Part 1 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single dose administrations of MRX-I compared with placebo.  Part 2 will assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a 14 day administration of MRX-I compared with placebo. Part 3 will compare the safety and tolerability of a 28 day administration of MRX-I with linezolid an active comparator.</summary>
