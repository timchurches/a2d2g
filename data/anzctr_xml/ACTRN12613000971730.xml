    <interventions>Study Treatments/Medications:  
There will be  two active formulations. All formulations will be administered by the intranasal route.
Active Test Formulations:
The active investigational product (API) is (-)-MSP-2017 (code-named MSP-2017).
The two Active Test Formulations (MSP-2017A and MSP-2017B) are the API formulated in two different, but closely related, aqueous solutions: 
MSP-2017A: water, MSP-2017, acetic acid, n-dodecyl-D-maltoside, disodium EDTA, sulfuric acid.
MSP-2017B: water, MSP-2017, acetic acid, disodium EDTA, sulfuric acid.

Single doses of both MSP-2017A and MSP-2017B will be evaluated at ascending concentrations with subsequent cohorts, but doses will not alter within a cohort.  The starting doses for both MSP-2017A and MSP-2017B will be 3.5 mg (nominal 0.05 mg/kg based on 70 kg subject).
Each subject in each dose level cohort will receive two single doses of either both active drugs or both placebos.  Within each cohort, the eight subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups.  For those assigned active drug:
N=3: Active MSP-2017A and Active MSP-2017B
N=3: Active MSP-2017B and Active MSP-2017A
Doses will be escalated sequentially through the cohorts.  The starting dose and incremental dose increase through the cohorts will be determined based on the results of the preclinical studies.  Before the subsequent cohort of eight  subjects can be enrolled and dosed at the next highest dose level, feasibility of escalation will be evaluated based on safety observations from the previous, lower dose level.  Evaluation will be a full safety review by the Safety Evaluation Committee (SEC), which will include at least one certified cardiologist, the Principal Investigator and the Sponsors Medical Monitor after each dosing cohort is complete.
It is intended that at no time will a dose be increased by more than twice that of the previous dose. However, a greater increase may be permitted if there are no detectable plasma concentrations of MSP-2017 or there is no effect on the pharmacodynamic parameters, provided the greater increase is deemed to be safe by the SEC. Dose escalation is planned to be identical for both MSP-2017 formulations, however, the data will be reviewed independently for each MSP-2017 formulation and the SEC may allow deviation from the planned dose escalation schedule for either MSP-2017 formulations independently in response to the results from each cohort. If = 2 subjects administered a dose of one of the MSP-2017 formulations experience a clearly determined DLT at that dose level, dosing must cease with that formulation and the MTD for that MSP-2017 formulation will be determined. However, the SEC may deem it safe to continue dose escalation with the second MSP-2017 formulation for subsequent cohort(s) of eight subjects with six subjects receiving that MSP-2017 formulation and two receiving a single dose of the matched Placebo.
Dose escalation will proceed until two or more of six active (drug) subjects experience a DLT or until dose level #6 is achieved.  However, if the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is not achieved for each or one of the MSP-2017 formulations after six dose levels, an additional two cohorts (i.e., 16 subjects) will be enrolled, resulting in a total of 64 subjects enrolled in the study.  The MTD for that active drug will be considered the dose level immediately below the dose at which two of six subjects who received the MSP-2017 formulation experienced a DLT.  If no DLT occurs, the MTD for the active drug(s) will be declared as the highest dose evaluated. 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups within each cohort which will involve administration of a single intranasal dose on Day 1 (right nostril) and Day 3 (left nostril), when possible depending on dose level, of either MSP-2017A then MSP-2017B, or MSP-2017B then MSP-2017A, or Placebo A then Placebo B or Placebo B then Placebo A.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo Reference Formulations:
Placebo A: water, n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside, disodium EDTA.
Placebo B: water, disodium EDTA.
Each subject in each dose level cohort will receive two single doses of either both active drugs or both placebos. Within each cohort, the eight subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups. For those assigned placebo:
N=1: Placebo A and Placebo B
N=1: Placebo B and Placebo A
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four groups within each cohort which will involve administration of a single intranasal dose on Day 1 (right nostril) and Day 3 (left nostril), when possible depending on dose level, of either MSP-2017A then MSP-2017B, or MSP-2017B then MSP-2017A, or Placebo A then Placebo B or Placebo B then Placebo A.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In general, safety analyses will be performed and the results summarized by cohort and treatment group.
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized using the latest version of MedDRA by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), classified from verbatim terms. 
Laboratory results will be classified according to PI clinical judgment of clinical significance and summarized by treatment group. 
Vital sign measurements will be summarized at each scheduled time-point using descriptive statistics. 
Nasal irritation assessments will be summarized at each scheduled time-point using descriptive statistics.
Physical examination findings will be presented in subject listings. 
Based upon the results from the above, the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be determined.  
The safety of the MSP-2017 formulations will be evaluated by collection of the following minimum safety criteria assessed at baseline (when the subject signs the informed consent form) and at subsequent specified time-points:
*Monitoring of adverse events and serious AEs.
*Physical examinations.
*Vital signs (resting heart rate, semi-supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature).
*ECG measurements.
*Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, coagulation, urinalysis)
*Reasons for treatment discontinuation due to toxicity.
Safety will be evaluated in terms of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory results (hematology and serum chemistry), vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oral body temperature), safety issues identified on 12 lead ECG results, and physical examination findings. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be recorded from time of signed consent through to end of study date.
Physical examinations will be conducted at screening, check-in (day -2) (if more than 2 weeks after screening), Day 4, end of study follow up (day 10) and early termination.
BP &amp; Heart Rate criteria must be met at Check-in on Day -2 and Day -1 as well as at Screening.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study on healthy volunteers is to determine the safety and tolerability of two different formulations of study drug when administered via the intranasal route. There will be four study treatments: two active formulations and two placebos, or dummy treatments. Neither the study staff or the participants will know which treatment they are on.  All formulations will be administered by the intranasal route using a single use nasal spray syringe. Each participant in each dose level group will receive two single doses of either both active drugs or both placebos, with the doses administered 48 hours apart via the nasal spray, in alternating nostrils.
