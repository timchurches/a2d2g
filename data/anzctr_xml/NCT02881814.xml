Experimental: Lung ultrasound and clinical decision - 


Diagnosis / Prognosis: Lung and diaphragm ultrasound
The ultrasound physiotherapist/operator performs a lung and diaphragm ultrasound. He is blinded to the patient's status and clinical physiotherapist examination. He/she is not involved in patient management or patient clinical decision-making. The ultrasound findings are recorded in the LUS report. The LUS report is reported to the clinical physiotherapist and to the intensivist. The ultrasound diagnosis(es) is recorded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Physiotherapist usually uses a clinical examination, including auscultation, an
      analysis of blood gasses and chest imaging to determine the indication for chest
      physiotherapy, to choose the treatment protocol and evaluate the efficacy of the management.
      Lung ultrasound (LUS) presents greater accuracy than chest X-ray in the diagnosis of lung
      deficiencies interesting the physiotherapist. So, it could allow the physiotherapist to
      determine the indication for chest physiotherapy and thus avoid unnecessary or inappropriate
      treatments. No study has evaluated the impact of LUS on clinical decisions in chest
      physiotherapy in ICU patients.

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of using the results of lung and diaphragm US on clinical
      decisions in chest physiotherapy in hypoxemic patients hospitalized in ICU.

      Method: The physiotherapist carries out a clinical examination and analyses the complementary
      tests (chest X-ray, chest CT-scan and blood gasses if available). Following the examination,
      he will put forward one or several hypotheses concerning the respiratory deficiency and will
      confirm or not the indication for chest physiotherapy. If respiratory physiotherapy is
      indicated, the physiotherapist will specify the protocol.

      A lung and diaphragm US will be done following the evaluation of the clinical
      physiotherapist, and will make it possible to answer the question: are the results of the
      lung and diaphragm US compatible with the hypotheses put forward? The LUS report will be
      given to the clinical physiotherapist. He will specify the respiratory physiotherapy protocol
      according to the results of the US-scan.

      The modification of the clinical decision will be assessed with the Net Reclassification
      Index (NRI).

      Expected results: We expect that decisions for chest physiotherapy will be modified by LUS.
      The expected benefit for patients is therefore that they will be given a chest physiotherapy
      protocol that is better suited to the type of respiratory deficiency they are suffering from.</summary>
