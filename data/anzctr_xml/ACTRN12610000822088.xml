  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Portuguese Sentences Lists test to the individuals was applied. With this test was obtained the speech recognition thresholds in noise and the signal to noise ratio to each ear, using earphone TDH-39P.
This is a monaural test  and consists of sentences that the individuals should repeat. The sentences and noise were presented using a Toshiba Digital Compact Disc Player - 4149 coupled to the audiometer Fonix (FA-12).
The noise intensity was fixed at 65 dB HL.
The application was made in a single session of 20 minutes and was applied only once in each participant. The total study duration was 4 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Speech recognition thresholds for normal hearing - Uncontrolled.

Two groups were studied: Group 1: individuals with clinical symptoms of difficulty to understand the speech in noise; Group 2: individuals without the clinical symptoms.</comparator>
    <control>Uncontrolled</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Portuguese Sentences Lists test to individuals with and without clinical symptoms of difficulty to understand the speech in noise was applied. With this test was obtained the speech recognition thresholds in noise and the signal to noise ratio to each ear.
For each ear was presented a list with 10 sentences. When the subject repeated the sentence correctly the intensity of the next sentence was reduced, if the answer was incorrect the following stimulus intensity was increased. With these values was calculated the average, resulting in speech recognition thresholds in noise.</outcome>

      <outcome>Signal to noise ratio.
From the average of the Speech recognition thresholds in noise was subtracted the noise intensity (fixed to 65 dB HL), obtaining the signal to noise ratio for each ear.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To verify and compare the performance of young adults, with normal hearing, with and without clinical symptoms of understanding speech in noise difficulty, using sentences as stimulus.

Individuals with normal hearing may be impaired in communication situations in which the signal to noise ratio is unfavorable and interfere negatively on the intelligibility of speech.</summary>
