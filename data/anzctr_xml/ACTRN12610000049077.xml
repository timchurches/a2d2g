    <studytitle>The Impact of Weight Loss on the Metabolic Syndrome</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In obese patients with the metabolic syndrome, we investigate outcomes with weight loss after bariatric surgery using the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band. This is a prospective cohort study monitoring resolution of the risk factors of metabolic syndrome including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and fasting glycaemia and therefore risk profile for cardiovascular disease and Type II diabetes.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective cohort study observing the resolution of aspects of the metabolic syndrome with weight loss. Weight loss will be achieved by utilisation of a laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band (LAGB) by a previously well described technique. Patients will be assessed preoperatively at the Centre for Bariatric Surgery (CBS), a dedicated bariatric surgery centre in Melbourne. They will have baseline blood tests reviewed and anthropometric measurements taken including weight, height, waist, neck and hip circumference. If they satisfy the criteria for the Metabolic syndrome as set out in the Adult treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines,they will be invited to take part in the study. Patients will be followed up at CBS by surgeons and physicians. They will be followed monthly for 9 months, and 3 monthly thereafter to a total of 24 months. Their progress will be reviewed, they will have adjustments to the band, and be given advice on achieving their weight loss goals. They will have their anthropometric parameters assessed by the same team of staff utilising the same instruments and methods. They will have blood tests performed at each visit.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rates of overweight and obesity are increasing in large numbers in many countries over the past 2 decades. Along with that, we are seeing increasing numbers of people with related health problems including high blood pressure, problems with cholesterol, and elevated blood sugar levels. These factors are a constellation which together are called the metabolic syndrome, and which give people a higher risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease in the future. We wish to study people with metabolic syndrome to discover how these problems resolve with different degrees of weight loss. We also seek to understand better the relationship between gut hormones, obesity, inflammation within fatty tissue and the hormones and proteins fat cells secrete, and their effect on the factors of the metabolic syndrome.</summary>
