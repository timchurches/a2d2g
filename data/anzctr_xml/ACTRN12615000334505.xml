  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cold water immersion - subjects will lie in a prone position in a temperature controlled 10 degree celsius bath up to the neck for 15 minutes.  Inflammatory and muscle damage urinary biomarkers, along with questionnaires on perceived soreness, fatigue, physical performance and skin and core temperature will be collected and measured.  During the eight week camp and final contest, subjects will immerse themselves in the bath immediately following training and the contest.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We will use general linear mixed modelling to test significance.  In exercise testing of this nature, a minimum 10 subjects will be required to gauge the effectiveness of the intervention.  We have specified 15 participants to gain as much statistical power as possible and to account for any drop-out during the study. If more subjects are interested then this will not prevent them from participating as well.  The statistical assumptions for this include a significance of less than 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to observe what effect repetitive cold water immersion has on the adaptive and muscle regenerative processes, cumulative stress, delayed onset muscle soreness, fatigue and physical performance during an eight week elite mixed martial arts training camp and contest.
We hypothesize that the repeated use of cold water immersion during the training camp will reduce the subjects perceived soreness, fatigue levels and inflammatory levels, but cause a reduction in physical performance in comparison to passive recovery.  Following the contest, we believe cold water immersion will significantly reduce skin and muscle temperature which will lead to a decreased inflammatory response compared to passive recovery.</summary>
