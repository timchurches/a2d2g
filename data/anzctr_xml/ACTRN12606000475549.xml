  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We propose to conduct a randomised controlled trial to compare the effect of eggs to a similar amount of protein and kilojoules from meat fish and chicken in the context of a high protein energy restricted dietary pattern. Primary outcome variables are LDL cholesterol and other cardiovascular risk factors. Our hypothesis is that daily consumption of 400mg dietary cholesterol as 2 eggs compared to an equivalent protein source low in saturated fat and low in cholesterol a kilojoule restricted  diet will not adversely affect these outcomes  We also propose to opportunistically compare the impact of these dietary patterns on post prandial glucose metabolism, cognitive function and satiety.</summary>
