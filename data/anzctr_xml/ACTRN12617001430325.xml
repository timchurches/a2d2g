  <interventions>
    <interventions>Materials: Participants will be given an appointment card listing the dates and times of their sessions and a map of the centre location.
Procedures: Whole body resistance training
Staff: Delivered by a physiotherapist with over 30 years experience and an exercise physiologist with 2 years experience.
Mode of Delivery: face to face (Individual 1:1 for weeks 1-4 and small group 1:4 for weeks 5-12).
Duration, Intensity &amp; Dose: 24 x 30-45 minute sessions at a moderate intensity, 2x per week for 12 weeks.
Location: 1 of 3 Kieser Australia centres (Essendon, South Melbourne or Caulfield)- chosen based on geographical proximity to the patient's home address.
Exercise Sessions: 
-Pre-exercise: heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation taken at rest.
-30-40 minutes of whole body resistance training. Participants will spend 90-120 seconds on each exercise machine with 1-3 minutes rest between each exercise. The rest will include active recovery (i.e. walking between machines) and passive recovery (seated rest). Performed at an RPE of 13-16 on the Borg 6-20 Rating of Perceived Exertion scale. The first 60 seconds of each exercise is aimed to progressively warm-up the muscles. For this reason an additional warm-up will not be performed.
-5 mins cool-down: walking at an RPE 6-8 (very light) and passive recovery. Oxygen saturation, blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored for return to baseline levels..
Exercise format/progression:
The program will commence with 6-8 exercises for weeks 1-3 and progress to 8-10 exercises by week 4. Transition time between exercises will be reduced from 2-3 minutes to 1-2 minutes in the 4th week.
One set of each exercise will be performed to the point of local muscular fatigue (90-120 seconds), at a 4-2-4 cadence (4 second concentric contraction, 2 second isometric hold, 4 second eccentric contraction). To apply progressive overload, initial weights will be chosen and then progressed, using the formula that if the exercise can be completed for 120 seconds, within the intensity guidelines, the weight will be increased by 12 kg. The physical outcome measures obtained pre-intervention and mid-intervention will help to determine the initial weights selected and when the exercise programs need to be progressed.
Exercises:
Exercises may include: hip abduction, hip adduction, leg press, knee extension, lumbar extension, seated row and chest press. They have been selected based on the muscle groups that they isolate. The machines are specialised to allow the weight to be evenly applied to the target muscles throughout the entire range of movement.

    <comparator>Standard care following coronary artery bypass grafting usually involves referral to a community-based cardiac rehabilitation program.
Procedures: Aerobic training and education for secondary prevention
Mode of Delivery: face to face in a group (usually up to 10 participants)
Duration, Intensity &amp; Dose: low intensity aerobic exercise and education typically 2-3 times per weeks for 60-180 minutes, for 6-10 weeks.
Education: will include information for secondary prevention. This may include information on the condition (coronary artery disease), medication, nutrition, physical activity, how to improve lifestyle behaviours. The information delivered will be determined by the community rehabilitation service that the patient is referred to. This will not be run by the trial investigators.

    <statisticalmethods>As the effect size is currently unknown, we aim to perform pilot studies to determine group separation and feasibility. The results will allow sample size estimates for future definitive trials. A sample size of 100 participants is feasible for the institutions and resources, 

The analysis will be descriptive, as the size of the pilot study will preclude definitive outcome analysis. The data will be reported in terms of group separation with odds ratio and confidence intervals. The following parameters would indicate clinically important relative differences between groups:
	ADAS-cog: difference of at least 2 on the ADAS-cog scale;
	VO2peak: relative difference in VO2peak between groups of 3mL/kg/min; and,
	Muscular strength: 15% or greater improvement in strength.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart disease is the number one killer worldwide, with over one million cardiac operations performed each year. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are typically elderly with multiple health conditions. Whilst cerebral (brain) complications such as stroke are infrequent (3%), a decline in cognitive (brain) function is more prevalent following surgery with reports that concentration, focus, cognitive processing speed and short-term memory is impaired in 1540% of patients at 3 months or longer after surgery (Ahlgren et al., 1998; Roach et al., 1996; Newman et al., 2001; Royse A et al., 2000). This permanent loss of cognitive function is even higher in elderly patients (Moller et al., 1998; Benvenuti et al., 2014; Royse C et al., 2011), and results in disability and loss of independence. It may also accelerate the incidence of dementia, as high as 30% in patients 7.5 years after cardiac surgery (Evered et al., 2016).
Dementia occurs in approximately 9% of the general population over the age of 65 years, causing substantial personal and family suffering, and a high cost to the health care system. Within the next 20 years, 100 million people are predicted to have dementia, which will pose a serious challenge for the health care system (Andrieu et al., 2009). Furthermore evidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), considered a precursor to dementia, is evident in 30-50% of patients prior to undergoing cardiac surgery (Royse C et al., 2017). Preventing further deterioration of cognitive function after surgery is therefore critical in reducing dementia in this vulnerable cohort. 
Previous studies have shown that exercise preserves or even improves cognitive function (Vaynman et al., 2004), as well as reducing long term cognitive decline (Liu-Ambrose et al., 2010; Hamer et al., 2009). This study will look at the effect of early weight training exercise, requiring an increased effort and heart rate, following open heart surgery. We aim to determine if there is an optimal dose (type, intensity and duration of exercise) to maximize cognitive and physical health benefits. Participants will be randomly assigned (like tossing a coin) to either a 12-week moderate intensity weight training program or to a 6-week low-intensity exercise program (usual care). Participants in both groups will attend twice weekly exercise rehabilitation, lasting for approximately 60 minutes per session (12-24 sessions). All exercise sessions will be supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist or physiotherapist to ensure patient safety. We predict that the weight training intervention will prevent further cognitive decline, and result in significantly greater improvements in patient-reported recovery, exercise ability and muscular strength up to 6 months after surgery. We anticipate that the participants will return to pre-disease levels of health and function or better.</summary>
