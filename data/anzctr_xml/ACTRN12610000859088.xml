  <interventions>
    <interventions>Peer-assisted Learning:
Students will complete learning activities in pairs, including assessment and management of patients, reflective processes and supervised sessions.
Learning will take place in the clinical environment, 31 hours per week for 5 weeks.
Each student will undertake 1 intervention for 5 weeks then cross over to the alternate intervention for another 5 weeks. There will be a 3 day washout period between the two interventions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Independent Learning:
Students will complete all learning activities as individuals, including assessment and management of patients, reflective processes and supervised sessions.
Learning will take place in the clinical environment, 31 hours per week for 5 weeks.
Each student will undertake 1 intervention for 5 weeks then cross over to the alternate intervention for another 5 weeks. There will be a 3 day washout period between the two interventions.</comparator>

    <sequence>Students who are allocated to the Southern Physiotherapy Clinical-School will be enrolled in the study. Each subject will receive five weeks of clinical education in the intervention phase, five weeks of clinical education in the control phase and a further five weeks which is not involved in the study. All the participants receive both interventions in different sequences. Students will be randomly allocated to pairs by a computer system at the University which matches students to their site preferences for clinical education. Pairs will be randomly allocated to starting positions using computer generated randomisation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>No research data supports decisions regarding the impact of increasing supervisor to student ratios on learner performance, to increase system capacity (Lekkas L, et al 2007, Ladyshewsky,1995). Our study will determine the best model of education to be utilised when clinical educators are supervising multiple students. This will then allow for studies to effectively evaluate the typical one-to-one clinical educator to student teaching ratio with higher student to educator, supplying essential data with which to evaluate the potential for capacity growth associated with a shift in the design of clinical educator and student models.</summary>
