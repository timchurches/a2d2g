  <interventions>
    <interventions>Male participants (aged 40-60 years) will randomise to ingest differing breakfasts.  Four possible breakfast meals (treatment arms) will be provided. These include; Arm 1: High fat dairy breakfast. Arm 2: High fat non-dairy breakfast. Arm 3: Low fat dairy brekfast. Arm 4: Low fat non-dairy breakfast. Subjects will be randomised to ingest either arms 1 and 2 or 3 and 4, with sequence of each meal being further randomly allocated. 

Arms 1 and 2 are equal in total energy (3120kJ Arm 1 versus 3250kJ Arm 2), and equal for macronutrients (54g fat, 20g protein and 37g carbohydrate). Arms 3 and 4 are equal in total energy (1860kJ Arm 3 versus 2010kJ Arm 4), and equal for macronutrients (19g fat, 29g protein and 39g carbohydrate).

Subjects will arrive at the laboratory in a fasted stated.  Breakfast will be supplied and eaten within 15 minutes. Following each breakfast, blood samples, as well as adipose and muscle samples (via biopsy) will be taken. These will be used to determine what biological and metabolic responses occur after food ingestion. Breakfasts meals will be separated by a 4 week wash-out period.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adipose and muscle responses to a meal; - Adipose and muscle gene and protein signaling responses to the meal will be measured.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be complete a medical questionnaire, physical examination and undergo a blood test. Based on weight and heart disease risk, participants will be recruited into one of two groups (lean or metabolic syndrome). Subjects will then be randomly allocated (allocation is not concealed) to one of two interventions, either high or low-fat breakfasts.  Within each intervention arm the subjects will be further randomised to recieve either a dairy breakfast or a non-dairy breakfast.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The reponses of the human body to a high fat meal are largely unknown. This study aims to examine the responses of the immune system, fat cells and muscle cells to a breakfast meal containing saturated fats or polyunsaturated fats.  This study will specifically investigate the saturated fat that comes fom dairy foods, including milk, butter, yoghurt and cheese.  Our hypothesis is that although dairy is rich in saturated fat, many of these fats are beneficial for human health.</summary>
