  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many girls perceive menstruation as time to celebrate the transition from girlhood to womanhood however, a significant proportion of girls suffer from dysmenorrhea.

Primary dysmenorrhea is a cramping pain in the lower abdomen that occur before or during menstruation without identifiable pelvic pathology (Kannan &amp; Claydon, 2014). It's affecting from 50% to 91% of women of reproductive age in worldwide (Mahvash et al., 2012), its prevalence increases through the adolescent years and decreases with increases in age (Dawood, 2006).
The prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea in the Arab countries are high, for example about 94% in Egypt (Maher, Eman, &amp; Ahmed, 2011), 74.3% in Lebanon(Santina, Wehbe, &amp; Ziade, 2012), 94% in Oman (Al-Kindi &amp; Al-Bulushi, 2011), 72.4% in Yemen (Hearst &amp; Molnar, 2013) and 55.8% in Jordanian(Al-Jefout et al., 2014). 

The aim of this  study will  aim to assess the impact of health education on primary dysmenorrhea among Arabic school girls.
This study will apply both quantitative and qualitative study design (Grove, Burns, &amp; Gray, 2013)and also develop and evaluate the intervention conducted. 

The quantitative research design used in this study is a quasi-experimental design with single group design which involves both pre and posttest will be applied in this study to determine whether health education improves the knowledge, self-care and quality of life among schoolgirls with primary dysmenorrhea. 
Following quantitative approach, a qualitative study will be conducted to explore the influences of culture beliefs on primary dysmenorrhea. Exploring lived perceptions would give meaning to each persons perceptions of a particular phenomenon under study. 

The outcome of the study will be expected to improve  knowledge ,self-care and  quality of life. and the finding of the focus group discussions will be supporting the self-care outcome in term of influences of Arabic culture.
