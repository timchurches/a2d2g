      <timepoint>After titration has established the optimal doses for twice daily administration, the child will attend for one morning or afternoon and his/her optimal morning dose will be administered by 3 (for 1.5 tablets) or 4 (for 1 or 2 tablets) half hourly increments, with the Stop Signal Task administered at baseline and half an hour after each increment. This will occur within 3 months of finishing titration.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The number required for 90% power that the lower limit of a 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) will be above the non-inferiority limit of 1.5 points of improvement on the IOWA Conners Rating Scale is 48 per group. (This assumes a standard deviation of 2.5 points for the change in score). 48 per group will be rounded up to 50 per group.
Statistical analysis using independent samples t-tests for comparing group data and paired t-tests for paired observations. Significant confounders will be controlled for using linear modeling and correlations will use the Pearson correlation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dexamphetamine and methylphenidate are used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) but few studies directly compare their efficacy. This randomised study has been designed to compare the efficacy and side effects of dexamphetamine and methylphenidate during initial dose titration for treating ADHD. The dose titration schedule will be allocated by weight (maximum dose 1 tablet twice daily for children up to 25kg body weight, 1.5 tablets twice daily for those 25-35kg and 2 tablets twice daily for those weighing more than 35kg: tablets containing 5mg dexamphetamine or 10mg methylphenidate are conventionally considered equipotent). The dose will be increased weekly (as tolerated) over 4 weeks, aiming to establish the lowest dose that gives maximum improvement in functioning. A rating scale will be requested from the child's teacher describing the child's functioning before starting medication and on each dose. Side effects will be monitored with rating scale and measurement of weight and blood pressure. Cognitive functioning using a simple computer-based test will be assessed unmedicated and on each dose used during titration. At the completion of dose titration the participant's active involvement in the study will cease and medication will either be ceased, continued or changed as clinically indicated.</summary>
