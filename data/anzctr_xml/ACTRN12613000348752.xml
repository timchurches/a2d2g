  <interventions>
    <interventions>For women randomised to the Bakri arm, the Bakri device package is opened following delivery of placenta and the stopcock removed from the inflation port at the end of the device.  The balloon should be placed (un-inflated) in the uterine cavity.  Using a long Harrison forcep the inflation port end of the balloon device should be fed through the cervix from above and retrieved by an assistant (non-sterile) vaginally.  The stopcock is then to be re-attached to the inflation port by the assistant.  Meanwhile the first layer of closure of the uterine incision should be undertaken.  Following this, 100ml of sterile water should be inflated into the Bakri balloon.  The second layer uterine closure should now be performed taking care not to damage the underlying semi-inflated balloon device.  After 2 layer uterine closure, the balloon device should be further inflated (up to a maximum total instilled volume of no more than 500ml) until the uterus is firm.  In the event that the clinician is concerned regarding bleeding, any and all alternative surgical and/or pharmacological measures of achieving haemostasis can now be employed.  This may include (but is not limited to) increased rate/duration/concentration of Syntocinon infusion, Misoprostol, Ergometrine, B-lynch or other compression suture, Ergometrine, PGF2-alpha, ligation of uterine/ovarian/internal iliac arteries, hysterectomy.  At conclusion of the caesarean section, the surgeon should perform a vaginal examination to confirm that the balloon is in the uterine cavity.  A Betadine soaked 1-inch vaginal pack should be introduced to reduce the risk of the balloon being expelled into the vagina. The urethral Foley catheter is to remain in situ until Bakri removed and subsequent vaginal loss assessed.  The balloon device is to remain in-situ for no less than 17 hours and no more than 23 hours.  The Bakri balloon should be deflated fully, but remain in-situ (deflated) for a further 1 hour to observe for ongoing blood loss in the Bakri collection bag.  After 1 hour, the vaginal pack should be removed and the deflated Bakri balloon removed.  Subsequent vaginal loss should be recorded up to 36 hours post-birth.  

</interventions>
    <comparator>Women randomised to the control arm are to undergo a similar 2 layer uterine closure.  The clinician is free to employ any and all alternative surgical and/or pharmacological measures of achieving haemostasis.  This may include (but is not limited to) increased rate/duration/concentration of Syntocinon infusion, Misoprostol, Ergometrine, B-lynch or other compression suture, Ergometrine, PGF2 alpha, ligation of uterine/ovarian/internal iliac arteries, hysterectomy.  Note: this includes the option of a Bakri balloon.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Combined intraoperative and postoperative blood loss.  
 
Intraoperative blood loss is to be determined by consensus of the surgeon, anaesthetist and theatre nursing staff.

Postoperative blood loss includes blood loss from the time of leaving the operating suite until 36 hours after birth of the baby.  This will be determined by the research midwife using some/all of the following pieces of information
i) measured loss in Bakri bag
ii) measured loss in intra-abdominal drains
iii) estimated millilitre loss as documented by treating practitioners in the medical record and/or observation sheets
iv) pad loss where scant loss = 10mls, light loss = 15mls, moderate loss= 30mls, heavy loss =60mls, soaked or clots = 100mls 
v) bluey loss where scant loss = 20mls, light loss = 50mls, moderate loss= 150mls, heavy loss =250mls, soaked or clots = 400mls
vi) vaginal pack loss where scant =  20mls, moderate = 100mls, soaked =300mls
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood loss includes blood loss from the time of leaving the operating suite until 36 hours after birth of the baby. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Endometritis.  

The diagnosis of endometritis will be determined as an inpatient
1) if antibiotics are administered beyond 24 hours post-birth and the treating clinician documents endometritis in the case notes OR
2) if antibiotics are administered beyond 24 hours post-birth in the absence of presumed urinary tract infection, breast infection, chest infection or wound infection

The diagnosis of endometritis will be determined as an outpatient (by phone call to woman at 4 weeks post-birth)
1) if antibiotics were administered after discharge from hospital because of heavy bleeding and/or discharge and/or lower abdominal pain OR
2) if antibiotics were administered after discharge from hospital for a reason other than presumed urinary tract infection, breast infection, chest infection or wound infection
</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by the research midwife via antenatal clinic records after their repeat scan at 32 weeks confirms a persistent placenta praevia (where the leading edge of the placenta is &lt;20mm from the cervical os).  The Obstetrician will discuss the trial with the woman and if she meets inclusion criteria, the research midwife will provide her with written information about the trial.  Women will be given the opportunity to discuss the details of the study with the research midwife by telephone in 5-7 days time.  If the woman expresses a desire to be involved she will be invited to sign a consent form to participate in the trial when she attends her next planned antenatal appointment.  The research midwife will obtain consent and arrange randomisation and a staff information sheet will be filed in the medical record.  The research midwife will keep a log of all potentially eligible participants and the reasons for participation or not as per CONSORT guidelines.  Sealed opaque envelopes will be prepared by MMRC and stored by the research midwife securely in the Antenatal Clinic. The envelope will be opened by the research midwife in the antenatal clinic after obtaining written consent </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be according to computer-generated random allocation list into 2 study arms.  Given the nature of the proposed intervention (presence or absence of an intrauterine Balloon device) it is not possible to blind either clinicians or the patient as to their allocation.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 100 would detect 
a) a difference in preoperative to postoperative haemoglobin of 1g (12-10 vs 12-9g/dL)
b) a difference in the proportion of cases requiring further haemostatic intervention (25% vs 5%)
with a power of 80% and a type 1 error of 0.05

These assumptions are based on Frederikens series of 514 caesarean sections performed for placenta praevia and their mean pre-operative to post-operative haemoglobin change.  Secondly, considering that the incidence of blood transfusion for women undergoing caesarean section  for placenta praevia is increased some 10-fold, it is assumed the rate of haemostatic intervention also  increases proportionately.  Finally, presuming there are approximately 100 potentially eligible women each year, and that 2/3 of these women will consent to take part, it will take approximately 18 months to achieve a sample size of 100 women.

The initial analysis will assess the adequacy of randomisation procedure in ensuring comparability of the study groups. In this analysis demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed comparing the study groups. The Chi squared test will be used for categorical outcomes and students t-test for data measured on a continuous scale.   If imbalance is identified in important baseline characteristics or demographics, a second analysis will be undertaken controlling for these factors using multivariate analysis.    The level of significance for the primary outcome measures is set at 0.05 and Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons will be undertaken for secondary outcome measures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Placenta praevia remains a significant cause of peri-partum morbidity. It is associated with an increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage and subsequent surgical procedures to control bleeding including caesarean hysterectomy. The use of the Bakri balloon prophylactically at the time of caesarean section may provide a significant benefit in reducing blood loss and avoiding the need for other more extensive surgical procedures. </summary>
