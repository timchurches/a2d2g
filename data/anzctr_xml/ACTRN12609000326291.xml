  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acupuncture will be administered to lower abdomen, arms, hands, lower legs and feet.  Participants will receive 3 acupuncture treatments over the IVF cycle - day 2, day 7 and on the day of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) administration.  Each treatment is 40 minutes in duration.  The women first undergo IVF without having acupuncture and therefore act as their own controls.  The duration between the normal IVF treatment and the IVF treatment with acupuncture is 1 month.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control. Standard IVF treatment using the clinic protocol for stimulation with GnRH Antagonist will be administered.  IVF treatment will vary with the individual and the clinicians' decision.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women who respond poorly to ovarian stimulation in an IVF cycle have been shown to have compromised blood flow to their ovarian follicles when compared to women with normal ovarian responses. Research suggests acupuncture may exert a sympatho-inhibitory effect reducing uterine artery impedance and thereby increase ovarian blood flow and subsequently follicular health among women with poor response to IVF treatment. The pilot study will recruit 20 women with a history of poor response to IVF. The methodology with involve experimental design with subjects acting as their own self control. The study will include an initial baseline measurement of study outcomes during a normal IVF cycle, and secondly, an acupuncture intervention, followed by measurement of outcomes of oocyte retrieval. The acupuncture diagnosis and treatment will follow an algorithm, and three acupuncture treatments will be administered prior to egg retrieval. The effects of blood flow and the follicle will be assessed by changes from baseline to egg retrieval, as measured by: peri-follicular blood flow, levels of follicular fluid VEGF, and level of follicular fluid anti-mullerian hormone.</summary>
