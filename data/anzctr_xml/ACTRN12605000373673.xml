  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a single blind randomised controlled trial of Nicotine replacement therapy (HABITROL: patches and/or gum)while still smoking for two weeks prior to Quit Day followed by usual practice, versus usual practice. Usual practice comprises an 8 week programme of NRT patches and or gum and support calls (eg Quitline) or face to face visits for other cessation providers (eg Aukati Kai Paipa), commencing on Quit Day.</interventions>

      <outcome>1) That the use of NRT in the two weeks prior to quitting followed by standard NRT treatment for eight weeks is more effective than standard NRT treatment alone, on smoking abstinence.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3) That the intervention has no more adverse effects than would be expected with usual treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at 3 and 6 months after Quit Day.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4) That the period of familiarisation with NRT is the key factor underpinning effectiveness</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be smokers from throughout New Zealand, who are interested in quitting within the next few days or at most within 2 weeks.

    <exclusivecriteria>People will be excluded from the trial if they meet any of the criteria used by Quitline and other cessation providers to decline NRT or to seek medical approval.  These are as follows:are pregnant or breastfeedingare current users of NRT productsuse non-cigarette tobacco products (e.g. snuff, pipes, cigars)Is not currently using Zyban (Buproprion) or Nortriptylinehave had a stroke or heart related condition in the last 3 months.</exclusivecriteria>
