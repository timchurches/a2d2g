    <statisticalmethods> The  number  of  cases  included  in  this  study  was  simple  randomly  allocated  into  two groups  (30  in  each  group). 
Data  were  analyzed  using  Statistical  Program  for  Social  Science  (SPSS)  version  18.0. Quantitative  data  were  expressed  as  mean  +/-  standard  deviation  (SD).  Qualitative  data were  expressed  as  frequency  and  percentage.


Statistical  analysis:
Sample  size  was  calculated  using  PASS  11.  Based  on  a  pilot  study,  it  was  calculated  that a  sample  size  of  24  patients  per  group  will  achieve  80 %  power  to  detect  a  10 % decrease  in  the  occurrence  in  shivering  in  the  dexmedetomidine  group  compared  to ketamine  group.  The  significance  level  of  the  test  was  targeted  at  0.0500 .  Thirty  patients per  group  were  included  to  replace  any  dropouts.

The  following  tests  were  done:
 
1- Paired  sample  t-test  of  significance  was  used  when  comparing  between  related  samples.
 
2- Chi-square  (X2)  test  of  significance  was  used  in  order  to  compare  proportions  between two  qualitative  parameters.
 
3- Probability  (P-value):
 
       P-value  less than or equal to  0.05  was  considered  
         significant.
 
       P-value  0.01  was  considered  as  highly  significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shivering  is  considered  one  of  the  most  common  adverse  effects  occurring  during  spinal anesthesia. Besides  causing  patient  discomfort, shivering  also  interferes  with  patient monitoring  and  increases  tissue  oxygen  demand. The  present  study  was  conducted  to compare  the  effectiveness  of  iv  low  dose  Ketamine  (0.25mg/kg)  and  dexmedetomidine  iv infusion  in  prevention  of  shivering  during  spinal  anesthesia.

Dexmedetomidine  infusion  exerts  a  beneficial  dual  effect  as  an  anti-shivering  and  sedating agent  during  spinal  anesthesia  without  any  major  adverse  reactions. Therefore,  we concluded  that  dexmedetomidine  infusion  is  a  good  choice  and  better  than  low  dose ketamine  during  spinal  anesthesia  when  shivering  is  considered  a  problem.</summary>
