  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a great deal of lay information to suggest that people with MS or at risk of MS should take oral Vitamin D supplementation. However, no adequately powered scientific study has examined the role of Vitamin D3 supplementation as prevention or treatment for MS. There is insufficient commercial interest in conducting such a study, but the need for evidence is great. If effective, oral Vitamin D supplementation could provide a low cost MS therapy with virtually no side effects.

Sponsored by Multiple Sclerosis Research Australia, we therefore plan to conduct a randomised, placebo controlled, double-blind clinical trial to assess the efficacy of oral Vitamin D3 in preventing the development of Multiple Sclerosis in participants at high risk of MS (participants with a first demyelinating event, FDE).

We will compare three doses of oral daily vitamin D3 (1,000IU 5,000IU or 10,000IU/day) to placebo. After agreeing to participate, participants will be randomly and blindly assigned to one of these four study arms and will continue to take study medication for 48 weeks.

Scope: We plan to enrol 240 participants with FDE from 21 Australian and New Zealand MS trial centres over the course of three years. We may invite additional centres depending on recruitment and trial progress.</summary>
