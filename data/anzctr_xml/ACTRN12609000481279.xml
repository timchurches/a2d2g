  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nicotine pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) for 6 months plus nicotine transdermal patch for 5 months. The pMDI is a typical cannister, commonly used to deliver asthma medication. Cannisters come in 2 different doses: 100mcg, and 200mcg per puff of nicotine. Participants carry inhalers to use as needed. the nicotine patch dose will be titrated according to how many cigarettes each subjects smokes per day, as per the manufacturer's instruction - either 21,14,or7mg. During the 5th month subjects reduce by one dose step at a time over the month, so they have stopped at the end of the month. The inhaler and patches start on the same day - at Visit 1. The quit date is the date smoking ceased at the end of the four week smoking reduction phase.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo pressurized metered-dose inhaler plus active nicotine patch both started on the same day at the baseline visit. Placebo-inhaler is identical to active inhaler except it does not contain nicotine. The inhaler is used at the discretion of the participant and the patches are used daily. Weaning from patches occurs in standard step-wise fashion as recommended by manufacturer during the 5th month of their use. Weaning from inhaler occurs in step-wise fasion (25% each week) during the 6th month of their use. Quit date is the day smoking ceased at the end of the smoking reduction month.</comparator>

      <timepoint>Side-effects and inhaler use are collected at baseline, one week after starting the inhaler; the day after the target quit date, and 1, 3, and 6 months later.  The Cigarette Evaluation Scale is measured at baseline, and 1 month after the target quit date</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> 	This study aims to test whether a pulmonary nicotine inhaler plus nicotine patches can increase 6 month quit rates compared to nicotine patches plus placebo inhaler. Subjects receive 5 months of nicotine patch therapy, 6 months of nicotine inhaler therapy. Subjects reduce their smoking during the first month, after which they stop smoking completely. Quit rates are measured by self report 1 day, and 1, 3, and 6 months after the target quit date.  Abstinence is verified by   carbon monoxide measurements at 1 month after the target quit date.</summary>
