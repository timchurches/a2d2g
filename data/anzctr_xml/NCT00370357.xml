  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if SPL7013 Gel (VivaGel) is safe when applied
      topically once a day for seven consecutive days to the shaft and glans of the penis in
      healthy male volunteers. The study will compare the safety of SPL7013 Gel on the penile
      epithelium and urethral mucosa to the safety of a placebo gel. The study will also assess the
      systemic safety of SPL7013 Gel, systemic absorption of the active ingredient of SPL7013 Gel,
      and the acceptability of the study products to the male volunteers.</summary>
