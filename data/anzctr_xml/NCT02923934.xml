  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ipilimumab
Treatment: drugs - Nivolumab

Experimental: Ipilimumab and Nivolumab - All Subjects will be treated with: Nivolumab at 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg concurrently every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab only at 3mg/kg every 2 weeks until progression (up to 48 total doses of nivolumab)


Treatment: drugs: Ipilimumab
CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) is a key regulator of T cell activity. Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks T-cell inhibitory signals induced by the CTLA-4 pathway, increasing the number of tumor reactive T effector cells which mobilize to mount a direct T-cell immune attack against tumor cells. CTLA-4 blockade can also reduce T regulatory cell function, which may lead to an increase in anti-tumor immune response.

Treatment: drugs: Nivolumab
A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1,PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. Nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation of PD-1, an Ig superfamily transmembrane protein, by its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is primarily expressed on APCs (antigen presenting cells). This results in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells or pathogens. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.

                  enrolment, and all related adverse events have either returned to baseline or
                  stabilized or subjects are not suitable for, or if declining established standard

                  unresectable or metastatic site is available prior to the start of the screening
                  phase, subjects must consent to allow the acquisition of additional tumour tissue

               -  Subject Re-enrolment: This study permits the re-enrolment of a subject that has
                  discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e. subject has not been
                  treated) after obtaining agreement from the medical monitor prior to re enrolling
                  a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.

          3. Age and Reproductive Status

               -  Men and women, &gt; or = to 18 years of age

               -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception.
                  WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30
                  days plus the time required for Nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the
                  last dose of investigational drug.

               -  Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25
                  IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of
                  investigational product.

               -  Women must not be breastfeeding

               -  Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a
                  failure rate of less than 1 percent per year. Men that are sexually active with
                  WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half life of the
                  investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued
                  for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to
                  undergo five half lives. The half life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25
                  days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of the study, men who
                  are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days
                  plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last
                  dose of investigational drug.

               -  Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The three tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are: (i) upper GI malignancies
      (comprising intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal
      cancers).); (ii) neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid
      tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal
      or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer,
      mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa
      cell tumours).

      The role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of
      their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.

      This protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of
      nivolumab &amp; ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.</summary>
