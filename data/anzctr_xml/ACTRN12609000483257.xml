  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mothers receive oxytocin (prepared by chemists) via a nasal spray(24IU) once at the beginning of the session, over two consecutive days. Participants who are given oxytocin are randomly allocated to either interaction coaching/baby massage or informational videos. The videos are of 30 minutes duration and are presented immediately following delivery of the nasal spray.</interventions>
    <comparator>Mothers receive placebo (contains the same ingredients as the oxytocin mixture but without the active ingredient) via a nasal spray(24IU) once at the beginning of the session, over two consecutive days. Participants who are given placebo are randomly allocated to either interaction coaching/baby massage or informational videos. The videos are of 30 minutes duration and are presented immediately following delivery of the nasal spray.</comparator>
