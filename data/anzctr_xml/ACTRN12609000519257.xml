    <interventions>Yoga and meditation as an adjunct to stroke fitness rehabilitation.  The yoga and meditation with exercise intervention group will participate for 8 weeks in an stroke exercise rehabilitation program (once a week) together with a yoga and meditation program (once a week).

The 8-week yoga and meditation program will consist of:

Eight once-a-week group classes of fully modified postures, breathing exercises and meditation practices based on the Satyananda Yoga system of practices.  These practices will be fully adaptable for the individuals with stroke and various types of hemiparesis (eg. Upper body versus lower body).  Classes will be held on the premises of the Centre for Physical Activity in Ageing (CPAA) at room C3.  This will be held on a separate day from the stroke exercise rehabilitation, allowing for rest between the classes.

Yoga and meditation group classes will be 90 minutes in duration:  5-10 minutes of education on yoga; 5 minutes of body awareness/settling in; 25 minutes of modified combination of seated, supine, supported standing asana (adapted exercises) and pranayama (gentle breathing) practices adapted for individual needs as necessary; 30 minutes of guided seated or supine meditation; 15 minutes of questions and sharing of experiences.

Yoga instruction will be delivered by an accredited and insured yoga and meditation teacher, who will be under a casual contract, employed by University of South Australia (UniSA) for both the intervention and wait-listed control groups.  Weili Chan, the principal investigator will be providing supervision of all yoga classes but will have no involvement in actual yoga instruction.

Daily home practice based on written programs developed by Dr. Maarten Immink (University of South Australia, School of Health Sciences), who is an exercise physiologist and accredited yoga and meditation teacher.  Yoga and meditation home practices will consists of 30 minutes of modified exercises, breathing practices and guided meditation based on printed and audio-recorded instructions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The wait-listed control group will only receive usual stroke exercise rehabilitation.  After the 8 week intervention period, the wait-listed control group will have a chance to participate in the Yoga and Meditation intervention together with stroke exercise rehabilitation as well. 

The 8 week CPAA stroke exercise rehabilitation program, which both the experimental and control groups will experience will consist of:

Eight once-a-week supervised group classes with adopted weight-bearing exercises conducted in a gym environment.  Classes are between 50 minutes to 1 hour in length. These classes consist of a variation of wind-resistance cycling machines and treadmill activities (for cardiovascular benefit), pin-loaded weight machines, free weights and tera-band equipment.  Intensity of the program would be reassessed by the CPAA exercise physiologist before the start of the intervention and would vary from individual to individual.  Classes, which are part of the ongoing physical activity program at the CPAA are supervised by an accredited exercise physiologists.</comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Participants to have a minimum of 6 months elapsed time since stroke and able to ambulate either independently or with supervision with or without an assistive device.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be recruited thru invitation in the current stroke fitness classes that are conducted in the Center for Physical Activity in Ageing (CPAA).  Once the participants have contacted the main investigator, they will be assessed if they are eligible for the trial via simple phone interview.  The participants will then be invited via email, phone or mail to take part in the pre-intervention testing by a physiotherapist, Dr. Susan Hillier (blinded to the study), where they will be explained the participant sheets and the consent forms.  Upon completion of the pre-intervention testing, the participants will be allocated a unique non-sequential number before the allocation.

The allocation process will be concealed, by using sealed opaque envelopes and this is done by an independent administrative staff at the CPAA not connected in anyway to the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation will be done using a program developed by Saghaei (2004).  They will be randomised to control and intervention groups.  Unique numbers will be generated for each participant in a non-sequential manner so as to prevent easy detection by the blinded researchers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis commonly face physical disability and some form of emotional or mood imbalance.  Persisting physical and psychosocial disabilities could further worsen the individuals condition due to reduced physical activity, leading to increased risk of fall and increased risk for chronic conditions.

Yoga presents a novel means of addressing post-stroke disabilities since it has the potential to both enhance motor function and mood. An intervention program that includes meditation training may potentially lend to larger improvements in mood, which in turn, may further enhance motor function recovery of balance and gait.  Thus, this research hopes to be able to provide evidence that participation in yoga and meditation program may be a cost-effective and low risk approach to addressing physical and emotional disabilities in stroke survivors.</summary>
