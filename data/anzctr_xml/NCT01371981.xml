  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well bortezomib and sorafenib tosylate work in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib and sorafenib
      tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib and
      sorafenib tosylate together with combination chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for
      acute myeloid leukemia.</summary>
