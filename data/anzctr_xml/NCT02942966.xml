  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy - Freedom from MALE at 6 months - Freedom from major adverse limb events (MALE) at 6 months defined as above-ankle target limb amputation or major re-intervention to the target lesion(s) (i.e. new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy / thrombolysis)</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy - Freedom from POD at 30 days - Freedom from perioperative death (POD) at 30 days</outcome>

      <outcome>Safety - Freedom from MALE at 30 days - Freedom from major adverse limb events (MALE) at 30 days defined as above-ankle target limb amputation or major re-intervention to the target lesion(s) (i.e. new bypass graft, jump/interposition graft revision, or thrombectomy / thrombolysis)</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patency - Target lesion(s) tacked segment(s) patency at 6 months defined as the presence of blood flow using duplex ultrasound. If angiography is available within the 6 month follow-up visit window, it should be used in place of the duplex ultrasound. Evidence of no blood flow within the Tacked segment indicates restenosis/loss of patency.</outcome>

    <summary>This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, non-blinded study designed to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of the Tack Endovascular System in the Mid/Distal Popliteal, Tibial,
      and Peroneal Arteries ranging in diameter from 1.5mm to 4.5mm for the treatment of post
      percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA) dissection(s) requiring repair.</summary>
