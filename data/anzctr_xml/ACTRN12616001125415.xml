  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients will be asked to complete a questionaire for days 3 post surgery. Ms Hughes will contact patients daily for four days and document the following variables (pain, irritation, light sensitivity) as well as total pain relief consumed. . .

Pain score graded on a continous scale from 1-10. 
0 = no pain
10 = severe pain

Patients always receive a drop of topical anaesthetic (tetracaine 1%) immediately prior to surgery. This drop causes a stinging senation/pain in the eye.. As pain is a subjective experience, patients will be asked to quantify their pain following instillation of topical anaesthetic. This information will allow adjustments to be carried out for individual pain tolerance when interpreting pain scores.</outcome>

      <outcome>Ms Hughes will contact patients daily for four days to assess the total amount and type of pain relief consumed each day. The questionnaire also asks patients to self report the type (and time) of pain relief consumed each day based on a list of options ie paracetamol 1g QID/prn, ibuprofen 400mg TDS/prn (with food) and tramadol 50mg QID/prn. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Other studies have recorded pain scores of 5/10 on the day of surgery and scores of 3/10 for the subsequent 3 days. In order to observe a reduction in the amount of pain from 5 to 3 (standard deviation 2) on the day of surgery with an alpha error of 0.05 and study power of 0.8 (Beta = 0.2), we calculated that 16 patients would be required in each arm.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A pterygium is a noncancerous growth on the front surface of the eye (cornea) which can cause redness, irritation and distortion in vision.  The aim of surgery is to restore the normal curvature of front of the eye by peeling the pterygium off the cornea. This is done under local anaesthesia, in the form of eye drops and an anaesthetic injection into the pterygium. The medicine commonly used for injection are lidocaine or bupivacaine, the latter has a slightly greater duration of effect. The anaesthetic wears off shortly after the surgery after which the eye becomes uncomfortable, especially for the first 24 hours following surgery. This is because the cornea is more sensitive than any other structure in the body and the takes 3-7 days to heal. Unfortunately most conventional oral pain relief medicines do not effectively reduce eye pain. 
							          
There are other ways of numbing the eye including a subtenons block where an anaesthetic medicine (mentioned above) is injected around the eye at the time of surgery. This is easily done once the pterygium has been removed as the subtenons space becomes accessible.  This type of anaesthetic not only numbs the eye but temporally impairs ocular motility, causes drooping of the  upper lid and can impair vision for up to 8 hours. The latter is not an issue as a pad covers the eye for the first 24hrs after surgery. This type of regional anaesthesia is very safe and is routinely performed for patients undergoing intraocular procedures such as cataract surgery. Anecdotal evidence suggests this mode of anaesthesia may provide better postoperative pain control for patients undergoing pterygium surgery. The aim of our study is to determine wheather a subtenons block given at the time of surgery, in addition to topical and injected anaesthesia,  provides better short term post-operative pain control for patients undergoing pterygium surgery compared to traditional methods of anaesthesia.
