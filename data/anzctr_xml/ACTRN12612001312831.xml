    <studytitle>Persistent Occiput Posterior: OUTcomes following manual rotation. 

</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Among women who are at least 37 weeks gestation, whose baby is in the occiput posterior position early in the second stage of labour, does manual rotation compared with a "sham" rotation, reduce the incidence of operative delivery?
 (Operative delivery is defined as forceps, ventouse or caesarean section).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manual rotation is a procedure that is most commonly performed at full dilatation if the fetal position is occiput posterior (OP) or occiput transverse (OT).  It entails the use of the accoucheur's hand or fingers to rotate the fetal head from the OP and OT position to the usual OA position.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women randomised to the sham rotation will have a vaginal examination as for the intervention BUT no rotational force will be applied </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In most labours, the baby is delivered head first, face downwards. When the baby is facing sideways (Occiput Transverse) or upwards (Occiput Posterior), the labour may be more difficult, and assisted deliveries including suction cup, forceps, and caesarean section are more likely. When the mother is fully dilated, it is possible to perform an internal examination and to physically rotate the baby to the downwards (anterior) position, but it is unknown if this procedure reduces the chances of an assisted delivery. We plan to run a study looking at whether performing a procedure to turn the baby will reduce the risk of assisted delivery and caesarean section. </summary>
