  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention or service is part of routine clinical care for all participants. It is an intensive clinical weight management program in a real-life setting. The child/adolescent and parent/carer attends the clinic for 5 appointments, over an individualised time frame. During this time, for children/adolescents classified as obese, they have access to consultations with a dietitian, psychologist and paediatrician, the combination of which is determined as clinically indicated. For children/adolescents classified as overweight, the same applies, however no paediatrician consultations are included due to a lack of medical co-morbidities and low medical risk for this group of children/adolescents. All consultations are one-on-one sessions with the clinician, child/adolescent and their parent/carer, and run for approximately 1 hour. The paediatrician consultations cover a comprehensive medical evaluation, the dietitian will give guidance and advice on dietary modifications, promotion of an active lifestyle and nutrition counselling, and the psychologist consultations will focus on behaviour modification strategies and supportive parental involvement. The observation period for all children/adolescents involved in the research project is 24 months following baselines assessment. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pragmatic research project aims to expand and evaluate a recently established paediatric multidisciplinary weight management service and investigate, develop and support proposals for ongoing sustainability. This service focuses on the treatment and management of obesity in children and adolescents, and is being disseminated under real-world conditions by specialist clinicians at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane, Queensland. It is anticipated that this dedicated, multidisciplinary tertiary clinic for children who are overweight and obese will improve measures of body composition, anthropometric measures, nutritional intake, self-reported physical activity, and health-related quality of life over an intensive four month management period, with positive outcomes maintained at 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Patient satisfaction with the service is anticipated to be both positive and constructive. This model of service will also be transferable to other non-tertiary hospital sites, to help in continuing to improve the health and well-being of children, adolescents and their families. Evaluation of the model will also ensure its sustainability</summary>
