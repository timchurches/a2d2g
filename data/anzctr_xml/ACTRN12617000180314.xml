  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a retrospective study of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and colectomy at Auckland City Hospital. Operative data (complications ) for these patients will be obtained from the Otago Audit System (a prospectively maintained registry).  "Days Alive and Out of Hospital" (DAOH) values for each patient will be calculated using  admissions and mortality data held by the New Zealand Health Safety Quality Commission. The follow-up period over which DAOH values will be calculated will be both 30-days and 90-days. </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Days Alive and Out of Hospital is the primary outcome of this study. Days Alive and Out of Hospital will be defined as the number of days spent alive and out of hospital, over a given time period after a patient's operation. Two time periods will be used for this study (30 days and 90 days). Calculating this figure requires the number of Days Alive in Hospital and the number of Days Dead. Days Alive In hospital (DIH) is defined as the number of days spent in hospital over the post-operative period (30 days or 90 days). This will be obtained by adding the duration of each individual hospital stay over this period (including initial hospital stay and re-admissions). Days Dead (DD) is defined as the number of days from the patients death until the end of the  post operative period (30 days or 90 days). DAOH will be calculated as either 30 - (DAIH + DD) or 90 - (DAIH + DD) depending on the time frame used. The data inputs needed to calculate DAOH (admissions, length of stay, readmissions and mortality) are held by the Health Quality and Safety Commission. This data will be accessed to assess DAOH for the patients in our study.

    <statisticalmethods>We have not conducted any calculations regarding sample size and statistical power, because this is the first time that the outcome measure (DAOH) has been used outside of cardiac patients. The aim of this study is to determine whether DAOH accurately distinguishes between patients experiencing operative complications and patients who do not. We have  picked a time range which we  think is practically feasible (5 years) to answer this question. If we are unable  to tease out differences in DAOH values over 5 years then this measure is a poor discriminator, and our study question (regarding the utility of this metric) is answered. We will conduct interim analyses at yearly intervals so that we can determine the minimum time needed for measurement to take place before you can start discriminating out outcomes. 

Rates of the following complications will be recorded:
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
1. Bile duct injury
2. Return to theatre
3. Conversion to open cholecystectomy
Colectomy
1. Mortality
2. Return to theatre
3. Anastomotic leak

Mean DAOH values will be collected for groups of patients suffering each complication. These DAOH values will be compared against the mean DAOH values of patients with no complications, to determine whether DAOH accurately distinguishes between these patient groups.  Measuring complication rates will also allow the construction of Cumulative Sum graphs for each given complication, provided the incidence of outcomes is sufficient. This study design will enable us to definitively answer our study objectives.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study questions are as follows:
1.	Can Days Alive and Out of Hospital (DAOH) be collected from existing data sources for patients undergoing selected general surgical procedures, and does it discriminate between patients who suffer death or other important complications and those who dont with sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be useful as a tool for monitoring the standard of care at a unit level?
2.	Can a set of important technical complications be identified for selected general surgical procedures and their rate of occurrence collected from existing data sources and if so, is the combined rate sufficiently high for useful application in CUSUM analysis of individual surgeons technical performance?

The objectives of the project are as follows:
1.	To apply DAOH to a retrospective cohort of general surgical patients and explore the utility of this metric in measuring overall quality of care.  
2.	To measure the rates of surgical complications, and the effect of these complications on DAOH. 
3.	To measure the rates of surgical complications, and determine whether the incidence of these outcomes is high enough to create CUSUM graphs of surgical performance.
