  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive stages of treatment outlined in sections 1,2 and 3 sequentially.
1. 1 28 day cycle of induction chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin (IV 12mg/m^2 days 1-3), cytarabine(IV 100mg/m^2 days 1-7) and with twice daily oral 50mg midostaurin on days 8-21 of each cycle. Patients who do not achieve complete remission can undergo another cycle of induction therapy
2. Up to 4x28 day cycles, depending on tolerability, of high dose cytarabine (Ara-C) (3g/m^2 IV every 12 hours on days 1,3,5) with twice daily oral 50mg midostaurin on days 8-21 of each cycle. Consolidation chemotherapy should begin once patient has attained complete remission, including neutrophils of at least 1.0 x 10^9/L and platelets of at least 100 x 10^9/L.
3. Maintenance chemotherapy consisting of twice daily oral 50mg midostaurin on days 1-28 of each 28 day cycle for 12 consecutive cycles. Maintenance therapy should be commenced after haematologic recovery between days 36 and 64 from the
commencement of the last consolidation cycle</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of treatment with the drug midostaurin, in combination with intensive chemotherapy for adults with previously untreated core binding factor (CBF) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 15-65 years and have been diagnosed with AML with CBF subtype. You must have received no previous treatment for AML.

Trial details
All participants in this trial will undergo intensive chemotherapy over a period of 18 months, that will include the addition of midostaurin twice a day during some of that time. Midostaurin is a new chemotherapy drug thought to be particularly effective in CBF AML. Participants will then be assessed at regular timepoints for between 1 to 5 years to determine the safety and clinical benefit of midostaurin treatment in combination with chemotherapy.

This Phase II study will: 

Investigate the clinical benefit, safety and potential extended survival following therapy with frontline midostaurin in combination with chemotherapy and during maintenance therapy in adult AML</summary>
