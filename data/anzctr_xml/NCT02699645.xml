          -  Two resting SBP levels measured 5 minutes apart in the range 130-160mmHg recorded in a
             seated position. (Patients with higher SBP can be included if considered by attending
             clinician that management is consistent with local standards of clinical practice)

          -  Geographical proximity to the recruiting hospital and/or follow-up medical clinic site
             to allow ready access for in-person clinic visits during follow-up

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Taking of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor that cannot be switched to any of
             the following alternatives:

               -  telmisartan 20 or 40mg, amlodipine 2.5 or 5mg, indapamide 1.25 or 2.5mg, or

               -  an equivalent class (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB), Calcium Channel
                  Blocker (CCB) or thiazide-like diuretic), or

               -  a beta-blocker

          -  Contraindication to any of the study medications, in the context of currently
             prescribed BP lowering medication

          -  Unable to complete the study procedures and/or follow-up

          -  Females of child bearing age and capability, who are pregnant or breast-feeding, or
             those not using adequate birth control

          -  Emergent side effects that prevent long-term treatment during the 1-4 week active
             run-in phase on open treatment

          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the responsible physician or investigator that
             renders the patient unsuitable for the study (e.g. severe disability [ie modified
             Rankin Score of 4-5] or significant memory or behavioural disorder)</exclusivecriteria>
