    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan in treating children with
      refractory or advanced solid tumors who are receiving anticonvulsants.</summary>
