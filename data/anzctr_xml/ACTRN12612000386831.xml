  <interventions>
    <interventions>Prior to the intubation surfactant extubation (INSURE) procedure, babies will receive standard care plus intranasal remifentanil 2 micrograms/kg.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is standard care plus intranasal normal saline. Standard care is defined as employing comfort and environmental methods as deemed appropriate by staff. Oral sucrose may be used according to NICU standard protocol.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: drugs</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of infants with good or excellent intubating conditions. 

Base-line cardiorespiratory and sleep-wake data will be recorded in order to calculate the immediate post-procedural Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score. Real-time physiological data will be downloaded from monitors for later analysis. These include: blood pressure obtained using an arterial transducer or a non-invasive blood pressure module; heart rate obtained from an electrocardiogram lead attached to cardiogram/respiratory monitor; and oxygen saturation obtained from an oxygen saturation monitor.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 and 3 minutes after intubation. Real-time physiological data will be downloaded from monitors for later analysis.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>1 and 3 minutes after intubation</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of intubation attempts and total duration (limit of 3 attempts OR 20 seconds each attempt OR intubation associated with desaturations and bradycardia).</outcome>
      <timepoint>The duration of the procedure</timepoint>

      <outcome>Neonatal outcome at discharge from NICU (satisfactory  weight gain, equivalent to term corrected, breathing on own without respiratory support, can suck and feed without the need of assistance eg. gastric tube feeding, can maintain body temperature).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of intranasal remifentanil for improving intubating conditions in neonates requiring the INSURE procedure as part of their medical care. Usual pain management (comfort/environmental measures and age/weight-appropriate sucrose) will be provided to all neonates.</summary>
