  <interventions>
    <interventions>12 week program consisting of 8 computerised cognitive behaviour therapy modules focused primarily on cognitive restructuring and graded exposure. Adolescents were supported by their mothers, who received a brief handout outlining psychoeducation, goal setting and graded expsosure and tips for helping their adolescent with the program. Modules took about 20 minutes to complete, in addition, adolescents practiced the skills learnt in the modules as needed. Adolescents received brief therapist support calls in weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 and 11, and their mothers received brief support calls in weeks 1, 4, and 7.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial examined the effectiveness of the Cool Teens computerised program for anxious adolescents compared to a comparable wait list condition. It was hypothesised that the adolescents who received the Cool Teens program would demonstrate significant reductions in anxiety and that these improvements would be sustained at follow up, as compared to the adolescents who underwent the wait period.</summary>
