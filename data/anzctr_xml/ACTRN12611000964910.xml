    <interventions>The prevalence and the correlation of coronary risk factors in a  non-symptomatic and untreated population who received CCTA from Jan 1st 2010 to Jun 1st 2012 in a health exam center. If a patient underwent CCTA twice, compare these data to find the progression of CHD.

      <timepoint>In 7 days after the patient revieved CCTA</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of the patients with abnormal coronary artery by CCTA in the non-symptomatic and untreated population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.On Apr 1st 2011 the result have been calculated for the first time. 
2.At the end of the enrolment (Jan 1st 2012) the result will be calculated again.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation between coronary risk factors and coronary score by bivariant correlation,linear and logistic regression using IBM SPSS 19.01.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.On Apr 1st 2011 the result have been calculated for the first time. 
2.At the end of the enrolment (Jan 1st 2012) the result will be calculated again.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Frequency distribution of MIN score and another CCTA score design  by our team.
MIN score is segment stemosis score, it based on the stegnosis of 16 segments in coronary artery, and the value is responding to the degree of coronary plagues in the patients with moderate or severe CHD. Our own score is similar to MIN score, but the density of plague is also concerned and is considered to have more sensitivity in the non-symptomatic and untreated population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.On Apr 1st 2011 the result have been calculated for the first time. 
2.At the end of the enrolment (Jun 1st 2012) the result will be calculated again.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The distribution of plague in the early phase of coronary atherosclerosis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1.On Apr 1st 2011 the result have been calculated for the first time. 
2.At the end of the enrolment (Jun 1st 2012) the result will be calculated again.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The progression of coronary plague detected by CCTA</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 2 years after his/her enrollment if another CCTA is performed in the same patient.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Coronary computerized tomography angiography (CCTA) is applied extensively in the big cities of China, even as an item of health examination. In this observational study, we want to investigate the proportion of the patients with abnormal coronary artery by CCTA in a non-symptomatic and untreated population, and the degree of their plagues. A statistical analysis is designed based on many items including laboratory examinations and ultrasound to find the correlation between coronary risk factors and coronary score in the early phase of coronary atherosclerosis. Additionally, the progression of CHD will be studied by comparing different data of CCTA in one patient.</summary>
