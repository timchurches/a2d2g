  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Upon completion of participation in the 6108A1-500 study, subjects will be asked to consent
      for this duration of immunity study to provide up to two additional blood samples. SBA &amp; IgG
      testing will be done on these samples taken at 6 &amp; 12 months. The sites participating in this
      duration of immunity study are the same sites participating in the 6108A1-500 study.</summary>
