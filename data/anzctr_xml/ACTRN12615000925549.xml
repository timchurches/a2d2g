  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a Phase 1, open-label, cross-over, randomized study in healthy subjects conducted in two parts. Part A of the study is a three-way cross-over, partially randomized (for the first two treatment periods) design to evaluate the PK, safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics (PD) of two different formulations of donepezil administered from a TDS (Donepezil TDS LF 50 cm2 and Donepezil TDS HF 50 cm2) compared to oral donepezil (Aricept) in healthy subjects. Part B of the study is a two-way cross-over, randomized design to evaluate the adhesive properties, safety, tolerability and PK of a larger patch size donepezil TDS (either Donepezil TDS LF 150cm2 or Donepezil TDS HF 100cm2) with two different backing laminate compositions.

Part A
The following treatments will be administered in Part A of the study:
Treatment A: Donepezil TDS LF 50 cm2 patch: 3 x 50 cm2 patches will be applied (total application area of 150 cm2) and worn for seven days, target dose 10 mg/day. An overlay will be applied to the patches.
Treatment B: Donepezil TDS HF 50 cm2 patch: 2 x 50 cm2 patches will be applied (total application area of 100 cm2) and worn for seven days, target dose 10 mg/day. An overlay will be applied to the patches.
Treatment C: Comparator  donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg (Aricept), as a daily oral dose for seven days.
A washout of at least 15 days between each treatment is allowed.
Part B
Part B will commence after at least the first six subjects have completed Day 11 of Treatment Period 1 in Part A. The TDS
formulations to be assessed in this part of the study will be selected by the sponsor following review of the safety and PK data from the first six subjects in Part A. Based on these results either the two TDS LF or the two TDS HF formulations listed below will be administered in Part B of the study:
Treatment D1: Donepezil TDS LF 150 cm2 patch with backing formulation 1: 1 x 150 cm2 patch will be applied and worn for seven days, target dose 10 mg/day.
Treatment D2: Donepezil TDS LF 150 cm2 patch with backing formulation 2: 1 x 150 cm2 patch will be applied and worn for seven days, target dose 10 mg/day.
Or
Treatment E1: Donepezil TDS HF 100 cm2 patch with backing formulation 1: 1 x 100 cm2 patch will be applied and worn for seven days, target dose 10mg/day.
Treatment E1: Donepezil TDS HF 100 cm2 patch with backing formulation 2: 1 x 100 cm2 patch will be applied and worn for seven days, target dose 10mg/day.
There is a wash-out period of 10 days before starting the second period in Part B. A new set of participants will be recruited for Part B

Part A  Treatments A and B
The following two transdermal patch formulations are being compared in Part A of this study: Donepezil TDS LF 50 cm2 (Treatment A) and Donepezil TDS HF 50 cm2 (Treatment B). Each formulation contains 90 mg donepezil per patch. Both Treatment A and Treatment B are transdermal patch formulations consisting of three layers. These formulations differ from each other with respect to the composition of the middle drugin-adhesive layer and the donepezil delivery is anticipated to be approximately 3-fold higher for Donepezil TDS HF when compared to the LF formulation.
Part A Treatment C
In Australia Aricept is marketed by Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd. It is indicated for the treatment of mild, moderate and severe Alzheimers disease.  Donepezil hydrochloride 10 mg (Aricept), as an oral tablet, will be provided in bottles.   The site pharmacy will dispense in a single use individualized dosing container according to the dosing schedule.

Part B  Treatments D1, D2, E1, E2
The Donepezil TDS LF formulations to be evaluated in this part of the study have a patch size of 150 cm2 and contain 270 mg donepezil per patch.
The Donepezil TDS HF formulations to be evaluated in this part of the study have a patch size of 100 cm2 and contain 180 mg donepezil per patch.
The TDS LF and HF with backing formulation 1 (Treatments D1 and E1, respectively) are comprised of 5 layers and differ in composition from the Part A TDS treatments by the addition of a thin adhesive layer and a stretchable woven fabric between the top backing layer and the drug-in -adhesive layer.
The TDS LF and HF with backing formulation 2 (Treatments D2 and E2, respectively) are comprised of 3 layers and differ in composition from the Part A TDS treatments by the addition of a stretchable woven fabric in the drug-in-adhesive layer.

Patches will be applied across the back for both parts of the study.</interventions>

The investigator site will be aware which treatment each subject receives the study is not blinded. Allocation is not concealed.

Part A
On Day 0 and/or prior to dosing on Day 1, confirmation of continued eligibility and baseline assessments and measurements will be made. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized to ensure a minimum of 12 subjects complete this part of the study. Randomization will be stratified by gender: 2 females: 1 male. Eligible subjects will be randomized by gender to one of the two possible treatment sequences (Treatments ABC or Treatments BAC). Subjects will receive their treatment in the order specified in the randomization schedule.

Part B will commence after at least the first six subjects have completed Day 11 of Treatment Period 1 in Part A. The TDS formulations to be assessed in this part of the study will be selected following review of the safety and PK data from the first six subjects in Part A. On Day 0 and/or prior to dosing on Day 1, confirmation of continued eligibility and baseline assessments and measurements will be made. A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized to ensure a minimum of 12 subjects complete this part of the study.
There are two treatment periods for this part of the study. All subjects will be required to complete both treatment periods. Randomization will be stratified by gender: 2 females to 1 male.

A maximum of 36 healthy subjects will be enrolled to ensure a minimum of 12 subjects complete Part A and B of the study and are included in the analysis. A minimum of 12 healthy subjects per study part is adequate to assess the PK and adhesion characteristics of each TDS treatment.
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written after finalizing the Protocol and prior to database lock. The SAP will detail the implementation of all the planned statistical analysis in accordance with the principal features stated in the Protocol. Any deviations from the SAP will be presented in the final clinical study report.
In general, data will be summarized using either descriptive statistics (number of non-missing observations, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum) or frequency counts and percentages, as appropriate to the type of data. For PK data, descriptive statistics will also include the geometric mean and coefficient of variation.
All data will be summarized and listed separately for each study part.</statisticalmethods>
