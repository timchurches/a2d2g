  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects Achieving Sustained Viral Response (SVR), Demonstrated by Achieving Undetectable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Levels 24 Weeks After Last Planned Dose of Study Treatment - The plasma HCV RNA level was measured using Roche TaqMan HCV RNA assay. The lower limit of quantification was 25 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) and the lower limit of detection was 10 IU/mL. Two results are reported: 1) Protocol defined SVR: undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment without any confirmed detectable HCV RNA between end of treatment visit (up to Week 48) and 24 weeks after last planned dose (up to Week 72); 2) SVR as per FDA guidance (snapshot analysis): undetectable HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment. Analysis was based only on the HCV RNA assessment in visit window (+/-2 weeks); if there were more than 1 assessment in the window, the last measurement was used.</outcome>

      <outcome>Biochemical Response: Number of Subjects With Grade 3 and 4 Shifts From Baseline in Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) Levels - Criteria for grading severity (toxicity) of ALT and AST: Grade 0 (&lt;1.25*upper limit of normal [ULN]); Grade 1 (mild=1.25 to 2.5*ULN); Grade 2 (moderate=2.6 to 5.0*ULN); Grade 3 (severe= greater than 5.0 to 20.0*ULN); Grade 4 (life-threatening= greater than 20.0*ULN). Number of subjects with Grade 3 shift (from Grade 0, Grade 1 or Grade 2 baseline) and Grade 4 shift (from Grade 0, Grade 1, Grade 2 or Grade 3 baseline) are reported. If a subject experienced more than 1 severity grade shifts during post baseline assessments, the maximum severity grade shift was considered.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Noninvasive Markers of Fibrosis: Number of Subjects With Improvement in FibroTest Analysis - FibroTest analysis was a biomarker analysis test used to generate a score that was correlated with the degree of liver damage. The FibroTest score was calculated from the results of a six-parameter blood test, combining six serum markers (alpha-2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, and alanine transaminase). The FibroTest score (F score) may range from 0.00 (Grade F0) to 1.00 (Grade F4), where F0= no fibrosis and F4=cirrhosis. Results were presented separately for subjects who achieved SVR at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment and those who did not achieve SVR at 24 weeks after the last planned dose of study treatment. Improvement was defined as decrease of at least 1 grade relative to baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Total Score - FSS was a 9-item questionnaire where each item was scored on a scale of 1 to 7 (higher scores indicated higher influence of fatigue). FSS total score was calculated as the average of individual items on the questionnaire and FSS total score ranged from 1 to 7, where higher score indicated higher influence of fatigue.</outcome>

An adverse event includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug. SAE: medical event or condition, which falls into any of the following categories, regardless of its relationship to the study drug: death, life threatening adverse experience, in-patient hospitalization/prolongation of hospitalization, persistent/significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, important medical event.
