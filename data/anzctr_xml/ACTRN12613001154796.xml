    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory Phase II trial and, as it is likely that enrolment of the majority of patients receiving HLA-matched sibling transplants will be enrolled into cell-therapy based trials at Westmead, this study therefore will focus on matched unrelated donor transplants. In the five years 2008-2012, Westmead carried out 61 transplants using RIC therapy and unrelated donors.  There were 8 cases of acute GVHD grades III-IV (13%). Based on a similar annual accrual of 12 patients, and an accrual period of 2 years, we expect to be able to enrol 24 patients onto this study. Interim monitoring for rates of acute GVHD grades III-IV will be based on the historical figure of 13% observed using ATG, cyclosporin and mycophenolate as GVHD prophylaxis. GVHD data will be reviewed 100 days after the 12th patient is accrued and if 4 or more cases are observed the trial will be closed. If less than 4 cases are observed the trial will conitue to accrue. Similarly, if after 18 patients are enrolled there are less than 5 cases of GVHD grades III-IV, accrual will continue to a total of 24, while if 5 or more are observed the regimen will be re-assessed or study be closed. These boundaries are based on the charts of Metha and Cain (1984),and are consistent with a 95% confidence of an underlying rate of 13% or lower,</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating whether treatment with cyclophosphamide can prevent the development of graft-versus-host disease after matched (HLA-identical) allogeneic donor transplant in patients with a haematological malignancy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 15-70 years and have been diagnosed with a high risk haematological malignancy suitable for treatment with an allogeneic transplant. You should have a suitable HLA-matched related donor or unrelated volunteer donor identified and available.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive 50mg/kg of Cyclophosphamide on Day 3 and Day 4 post allogeneic transplant. This drug will be administered intravenously (i.e. into the vein) over 1 hour.

Participants will be followed up at 100 days, 1 year, and 2 years post transplant in order to determine rates of graft-versus-host disease. This will be compared to data collected previously in patients who received transplants using Reduced Intensity Condition (RIC) therapy and unrelated donors to determine relative effectiveness.
