  <interventions>
    <interventions>The trial was a 6-month 2-arm parallel group pilot randomized controlled trial at an Independent Boys High School in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney. The participants were randomized to either the intervention or active control programs. The intervention program consisted of 15x60min theory and practical sessions focusing on cardiorespiratory fitness, healthy eating, small screen recreation and behaviour modification and 22x20min lunchtime activity sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control participants received the standard treatment (usual curricular fitness program taught by a PDHPE Faculty member) consisting of 15x60-minute activity sessions.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Sixty students with the lowest cardio-respiratory results were invited to participate in the trial. According to the NSW SPANS survey, in comparison to other boys of similar age, these targeted boys cardio-respiratory fitness results were lower than the 50th percentile (Booth et al., 2006).
