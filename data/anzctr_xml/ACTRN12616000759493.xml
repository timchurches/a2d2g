  <interventions>
    <interventions>L-theanine capsules (each capsule contains 225mg of L-theanine and 25mg excipients). 

One capsule will be taken orally twice per day (totaling 450mg L-theanine OR placebo) for the first four weeks of the the trial. In cases of non-response (determined by reduction in SIGH-A score &lt;35% from baseline), the dose will be doubled (2 capsules twice per day; equating to 900mg L-theanine OR placebo) from week-4 onwards. 

All participants will receive placebo capsules (microcellulose) in a single blinded manner for the final 2-weeks of the trial (placebo run-out from week-8 to week-10).
 
Participants will be required to take the capsules as instructed during the 10 weeks of the study.  At each follow-up visit, the participants will be asked to return their current treatment container with any remaining capsules inside. These will be counted and recorded to determine participant compliance to the treatment regime. </interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo (microcellulose) capsules taken in the same dosage regime as listed above (1 capsule bid from week-0 to week-4, Increased to 2 bid in cases of non-response from week-4 onwards).

      <outcome>Side-effects assessment scale (SAFTEE).  

A key animal model study evaluated the safety of L-theanine administered as a dietary admixture to male and female rats at concentrations providing doses of 0, 1500, 3000 or 4000 mg/kg per day for 13 weeks (Borzelleca, Peters et al. 2006). Results revealed there were no consistent, statistically significant treatment-related adverse effects on behaviour, morbidity, mortality, body weight, clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis. There were no consistent treatment-related adverse effects in gross pathology, organ weights or ratios or histopathology. Studies in humans highlight no clinically significant side effects observable in vital signs, electrocardiograms or clinical laboratory markers when L-theanine was used adjunctively to anti-psychotic medication (Ritsner et al., 2011). Other research has found that the compound has neuroprotective properties (Kim, Lee et al. 2009); immune modulating activity (Bukowski and Percival 2008); and hepatoprotective effects (Li, Ye et al. 2012). </outcome>

    <sequence>Each set of treatments for Weeks 0 to 8 will be coded with a treatment number which has been randomly allocated to a treatment arm using permuted block randomisation. An independent researcher will develop a computer-generated randomisation plan utilising a  predetermined design for two treatment arms and will label bottles with their treatment numbers accordingly. Trial clinicians will then allocate treatment numbers sequentially to enrolled participants. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>From Week-8 to Week-10, all participants will receive placebo capsules (placebo run out and remain blinded). However, researchers will be unblinded for this period of the study. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We will recruit a sample size of 78 participants (39/39 participants in each arm). The study is powered to detect a small to moderate difference between L-theanine and placebo on the efficacy outcome (using data with at least one post-baseline measurement in intention-to-treat analysis). As a small to moderate effect size F of 0.25 is expected with L-theanine over placebo on the SIGH-A, for a two tailed analysis with alpha=0.05 and the study powered at 80% (Z beta=0.80) with a correlation among repeated measures (ANOVA model) over five time-points of 0.5, 78 participants are required (critical F2,77 of 3.97). 

Analysis of data will be conducted with blinding to group allocations. The primary efficacy analysis will assess average treatment group differences for the primary outcome measure (SIGH-A) over the entire study period and use a likelihood based mixed-effects model, repeated measures approach (MMRM). Results from the analysis of dichotomous data (e.g. demographics and genetic data) will be presented as proportions (e.g. Relative Risks), with 95% confidence interval, and Fishers Exact p-value where appropriate. Non-parametric statistics will be used when assumptions for parametric methods are violated. Cohens d effect sizes will be calculated. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted using a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals. Data will be analysed using SPSS 23.0.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and safety of L-theanine (an amino acid constituent of green tea [Camellia sinensis]) as an adjunctive therapy to treat GAD by conducting a phase II double-blind randomised controlled trial. It is hypothesised that L-theanine will be superior to placebo in reducing anxiety in participants with GAD.
