    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria

          1. Male or female and greater than or equal to 18 years of age at the time of signing the
             informed consent. The upper age limit is 70 years inclusive.

          2. Weight at least 30 kg

          3. Written informed consent signed by the subject or legal guardian prior to entering the
             study in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. If the written informed consent is
             provided by the legal guardian because the subject is unable to do so, a written or
             verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained. In Germany, only the subject may
             sign the informed consent form in accordance with ICH guidelines.

          4. A diagnosis of partial epilepsy according to the International League Against
             Epilepsy's Classification of Epileptic Seizures. Diagnosis should have been
             established by clinical history and an electroencephalogram (EEG) that is consistent
             with localization related epilepsy; normal interictal EEGs will be allowed provided
             that the subject meets the other diagnosis criterion (ie, clinical history).

          5. Have uncontrolled partial seizures and require additional AED therapy despite having
             been treated with at least one AED within approximately the last 2 years.

          6. Currently on stable antiepileptic treatment regimen:

               1. Subject must have been receiving stable doses of 1 to 3 AEDs for at least 3 weeks
                  prior to Visit 2

               2. Vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) will not be counted as an AED; however, the
                  parameters must remain stable for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline. The VNS
                  must have been implanted at least 5 months prior to Visit 1.

               3. Benzodiazepines taken at least once per week during the 1 month prior to Visit 1
                  for epilepsy, or for anxiety or sleep disorder, will be counted as 1 AED and must
                  be continued unchanged throughout the study. Therefore only a maximum of 2
                  additional approved AEDs will be allowed.

          7. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan performed within the
             past 10 years that ruled out a progressive cause of epilepsy. If a CT or MRI has not
             been performed within the past 10 years, one must be performed prior to randomization.

          8. Ability to reach subject by telephone.

          9. Use of an acceptable form of birth control by female subjects of childbearing
             potential</inclusivecriteria>

          1. History of any serious drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction (including but not
             limited to Stevens Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with

             insufficiency, a malignant neoplasm, any disorder in which prognosis for survival is
             less than 3 months, or any disorder which in the judgment of the investigator will
             place the subject at excessive risk by participation in a controlled trial

             taking phenobarbital must not be taking phenytoin or primidone

             limit of normal (ULN)

         16. An active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurologic disease, or
             any CNS disease deemed to be progressive during the course of the study that may

         17. Any clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological, or behavioral problems
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the subject's ability
