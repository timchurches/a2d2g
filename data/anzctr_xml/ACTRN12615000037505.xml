  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the addition of the Tongue Tamer system to existing SomnoMed (Registered Trademark) Mandibular Advancement Splints (MAS) in patients not demonstrating a complete response with conventional MAS treatment. The Tongue Tamer is designed to hold the tongue in a more forward position, enhancing the ability of the appliance to keep the airways clear. Tongue Tamers will be inserted into existing devices by SomnoMed technicians and the participant will wear the device nightly for 4 weeks. During this time, daily compliance diaries will be kept to monitor adherence and a final sleep study with the modified device will be performed after 4 weeks. These sleep study results will be compared to each individual's sleep study with the conventional MAS prior to alteration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active: Crossover study. Patients sleep study results will be compared before and after the Tongue Tamer alteration is inserted, after 4 weeks of use. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the efficacy of the Tongue Tamer modification to reduce the overall Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) when compared to the conventional MAS, as determined by a sleep study performed before (up to one year pre-modification) and after the modification. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety of the Tongue Tamer modification, this will be monitored through the daily compliance diary.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks of using the Tongue Tamer modification</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the compliance of patients- number of patients that use the device for greater than 4 hours as recorded by their compliance diary.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks of using the Tongue Tamer modification</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the tolerability of the device- the number of patients who use the device overall, regardless of time used, as recorded by their daily compliance diary. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is a common sleep-related breathing disorder and can be treated using a Mandibular Advancement Splint (MAS), an oral device worn during sleep which protrudes the mandible, improving airway calibre. Approximately two thirds of patients adequately resolve their sleep apnoea with this conventional therapy however; clinical trials have shown that the addition of a tongue restraining device significantly increases MAS effectiveness. This study will investigate the Tongue Tamer (TT) system, designed to be reversibly added to the conventional SomnoMed MAS to passively restrain the tongue. Safety, efficacy, tolerability and compliance of the TT MAS will be investigated in patients not demonstrating a complete response to conventional MAS treatment. </summary>

    <publicnotes>Are you currently treated with a SomnoMed Mandibular Advancement Splint but still not demonstrating a complete resolution of your Sleep Apnoea? 
Would you like to trial the Tongue Tamer Modification System designed to directly hold the tongue in a more forward position, in an effort to enhance the ability of the appliance to keep the airways clear?
Royal North Shore Hospital is currently trialling this new modification for the treatment of Sleep Apnoea. The trial consists of a fully reversible modification to your existing SomnoMed device and a monitored use over approximately 4 week.
