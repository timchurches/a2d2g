  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomized, double blinded trial to evaluate the clinical benefit of sorafenib 400 mg bid  versus placebo in patients with advanced HCC (Child-Pugh A only).   
  The overall treatment period will be divided into 6-week cycles. 
Patient visits for safety and drug accountability will be conducted every 3 weeks. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Hepatobiliary Symptom Index (FHSI-8) Questionnaire will also be completed every three weeks. 
The FHSI-8 and FACT-Hep questionnaires are being completed as part of an assessment of efficacy endpoints. Tumor measurements will be conducted on the first day of each cycle. 
After study drug treatment ends, patients will be contacted every 3 months to determine survival status and to request that they complete the FHSI-8.

Recruitment is expected to be achieved by April 2006.</interventions>

    <summary>The purpose of the study is: Find out if patients receiving sorafenib will live longer. Find out if sorafenib has any effect on patient reported outcomes. Find out if sorafenib prevents the growth of or shrinks liver tumors and/or their metastases. Determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with liver cancer.</summary>
