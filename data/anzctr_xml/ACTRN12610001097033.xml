    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>If the participant agreed to participate in the study they will be randomised to receive truvada with either the standard or reduced dose of efavirenz.  Which of the two regimens they will receive will be chosen at random by a computer and the doctor has no influence on the treatment chosen for them.  Participants will have an equal (1:1) chance of receiving either regimen.  This is a double-blind study so neither participant nor the doctor will be aware of which treatment participants are receiving.  

Participants will be told which treatment they were given as soon as the final study results are released. 

participants are required to attend the clinic on 11 occasions and have one telephone interview over the 96 weeks of the study.

allocation will be done by the study statisticial who will program this to the computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Which of the two regimens participants will receive will be chosen at random by a computer. It will generate a three letter code (usually first letter of the first name and two letters of the last name) and a 5 randomisation number.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The recommended dosage for some drugs currently used to treat HIV infection is highly effective but clinical data suggests that the doses could be reduced without compromising their effectiveness.  Lower drug doses could have fewer side effects and could be tolerated better, making it easier for people to take and stay on their anti-HIV medication.  Dose reduction would also make the drugs cheaper; this would allow more people to be treated and free up money for other important work in the fight against HIV such as education and prevention programs.

Two different regimens containing either the standard dose or a reduced dose of efavirenz will be compared:
I.	efavirenz 600mg + truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine)
II.	efavirenz 400mg + truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine)

Tenofovir, emtricitabine and efavirenz are all licensed as individual drugs for the treatment of HIV disease in many countries around the world.  Efavirenz is only licensed at the standard dose of 600mg.  Emtricitabine and tenofovir are provided as a fixed dose combination that is not currently licensed in every country involved in this study. A fixed dose combination means that the two drugs are incorporated into one pill.</summary>
