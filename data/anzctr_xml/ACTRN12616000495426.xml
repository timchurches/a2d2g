  <interventions>
    <interventions>Enrolled patients will undergo collection of clinical data and tumour and blood specimens, as well as any archival tissue that is available. For those patients who undergo a planned resection or biopsy of a current metastatic tumour specimen, a sample will be collected from residual tissue that contains tumour  this is referred to as fresh tissue.
 Patients that consent to the liquid biopsy (blood collection) will undergo collection of blood at the beginning and end of each systemic therapy. Archival tumour specimens and current fresh biopsy tumour specimens will be stored at designated site-specific laboratories.  Blood products will be stored frozen in a -70C at designated site-specific laboratories.
Enrolled patients will have clinical data collected for the life of the project or until patient death. This may range between 1 to 10 years dependent on when the patient enrolls.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify and validate molecular prognostic and predictive biomarkers in prostate cancer that can be used to identify patients who have poorer survival or who will not respond to particular treatments.
Biomarkers will be identified through modern molecular techniques, which include:
 - Multiplexed microarrays, used to determine relative expression changes
 - Quantitative PCR, used to measure copy numbers of genes and determine relative expression changes
 - Immunohistochemistry to identify expression of proteins
 - Next generation sequencing, used to determine mutations present in prostate cancer
As molecular techniques are constantly evolving, other novel methodologies may be used.
Once potential biomarkers have been discovered statistical analysis will be used to determine significance.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up will occur at each of these timepoints:
Primary diagnosis: tissue will be analysed, and clinical data accessed to determine initial diagnosis.
New diagnosis of metastatic disease: tissue will be analysed, and clinical data will be analysed to see previous treatments, general health, site of new disease.
Treatments: blood samples will be taken at the beginning and end of any systemic treatment given. 
Generally, clinical data will be collected on a patients health for up to 10 years or until patient death.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the level of concordance of molecular biomarkers identified in both primary tumour and metastatic tumour specimens.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Primary tumour sample accessed at enrolment, and metastatic tumour specimen obtained at time of diagnosis of metastatic disease. Clinical data analysed until 10 years post study commencement or until patient death.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations for detection of a biomarker present in either 10%, 20% or 33% of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer have been calculated.  In this scenario, the systemic treatment results in a PSA response rate of 30% or greater.  Additionally, the biomarker is able to identify patients where the same systemic treatment results in a PSA response rate of 5% or less.  Using an Alpha of 0.05 and Power of 0.80, our planned study population of 500 patients is able to detect a clinically significant predictive biomarker (as defined by being present in at least 10% of patients and resulting in a PSA response rate of 10% or less).
Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse data arising directly from this protocol study. The Kaplan-Meier method and the Mantel-Cox log-rank test will be used for survival analyses. Proportions will be compared using the Chi square method or Fishers exact test.  For all analyses, two-sided p values of &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant.  Multivariate survival analyses will use the Cox Proportional Hazards method.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to identify biological markers in tumour and blood samples which may predict clinical outcomes and response to treatment in prostate cancer patients.

Who is it for?: You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, with a diagnosis of prostate cancer of which a tumour specimen has already been taken and is available for further testing. 

Study details: All participants in this study will have a small sample of their tissue (primary and metastatic) that was taken at diagnosis used for research.  Researchers will look at the DNA inside the tissue and see if they can find any 'markers' that may make patients respond better to certain types of treatments. A blood sample will also be taken at the start and at the end end of any treatment you may have. Researchers will also use medical records to correlate any biological markers with disease outcomes. It is hoped that the findings of this study will lead to the identification and validation of biological markers which may allow more personalised treatment for future prostate cancer patients.</summary>
