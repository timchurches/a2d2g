      <outcome>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) Scores - Ratings of Pain Intensity (PI) were made using a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on which 0 = no pain and 100 = worst pain possible. PID was calculated by subtracting the posttreatment score from the baseline score, where the baseline score was the PI rating made prior to the first dose of study medication.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This was a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in subjects who have undergone
      major surgery. Each subject's study participation consisted of a screening visit, a 2-day
      treatment period, and a follow-up visit. Following surgery, subjects were randomly assigned
      to receive intranasally (IN) ketorolac 10 mg, IN ketorolac 30 mg, or placebo when the pain
      intensity (PI) rating equaled at least 40 on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS). Thereafter,
      subjects received study drug every 8 hours, with the last dose given at 40 hours. For pain
      not relieved by the study drug, the subjects had access to morphine sulfate (MS) administered
      via patient controlled analgesia (PCA).

      The primary objective was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy of multiple intranasal (IN)
      doses of ketorolac over 2 days. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of this dosing regimen.</summary>
