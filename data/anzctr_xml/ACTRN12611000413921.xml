    <interventions>The aim of this study will evaluate whether an association of elastic stockings and walking for a short period in the late afternoon (5 o'clock p.m.) after work day reduces leg edema. Volume changes of the both legs of sixteen patients (32 limbs), walk continuously on a treadmill for 30 minutes using elastic compression stockings in upper limbs, model 3/4(legs fold up to the knee) and 20-30 mmHg compression. Will be analyzed in a quantitative, cross-sectional study in order of arrival at the clinic. All participants should not use drugs and wear compression stocking during the days. The intervention will be once only after a days work in an air conditioned room with a treadmill and apparatus for volumetry. All evaluations will be tracked by researcher. The participants will submit to volumetry initial using the water displacement technique, held in a glass container sealed with silicone and plastic device (tap) water to flow when the leg emerged, the water flow is measured in milliliters. Subsequently required to put on 20/30 made-to-measure compression stockings; the compression will only be used for up to 30 minutes during activity. The patients walk on a treadmill for 30 minutes and after removing the stockings volumetry of the legs will again performed.</interventions>
