  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) between modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (ABFM) backbone with or without bortezomib in all randomized patients - Interim monitoring for efficacy and futility will be performed. The study will also be monitored for futility using the method of Freidlin and Korn.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 10 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cumulative incidence rates - Compared for isolated CNS, isolated bone marrow, and combined bone marrow relapse between IR patients on the non-bortezomib containing arm on this study (no CRT) with similar patients on AALL0434 (+ CRT).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 10 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EFS between very high risk (VHR) T-ALL patients treated with high risk (HR) Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) intensification blocks who become minimal residual disease (MRD) negative and those who remain MRD positive at the end of HR Block 3 - The proportion of VHR T-ALL patients with end of consolidation (EOC) MRD &gt;= 0.1% who become MRD negative (MRD undetectable) after the three high-risk BFM blocks of therapy, will be estimated. EFS for these patients (who continue on chemotherapy) will be compared with those who continue to have detectable MRD and who may receive other treatment options including hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Comparison will be descriptive.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  T-ALL: T-ALL patients must be enrolled on AALL08B1 or Project:EveryChild (APEC14B1, if
             open for the classification of ALL patients) prior to treatment and enrollment on
             AALL1231

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) or T-lymphoblastic
             lymphoma (T-LLy) stages II-IV

               -  Note: a diagnosis of T-ALL is established when leukemic blasts lack
                  myeloperoxidase or evidence of B-lineage derivation (cluster of differentiation
                  [CD]19/CD22/CD20), and express either surface or cytoplasmic CD3 or two or more
                  of the antigens CD8, CD7, CD5, CD4, CD2 or CD1a, and are present either in
                  peripheral blood or &gt; 25% in the bone marrow; if surface CD3 is expressed on all
                  leukemic cells, additional markers of immaturity, including terminal
                  deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), CD34 or CD99 will be assessed for expression;
                  cases with uncertain expression will receive additional review within the
                  appropriate Children's Oncology Group (COG) reference laboratory

               -  For T-LLy patients with tissue available for flow cytometry, the criterion for
                  diagnosis should be analogous to T-ALL; for tissue processed by other means (i.e.
                  paraffin blocks), the methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic analysis to
                  establish the diagnosis of T-LLy defined by the submitting institution will be
                  accepted

          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed
             consent; assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients must not have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy for either the current
             diagnosis of T-ALL, T-L-Ly or for any cancer diagnosis prior to the initiation of
             protocol therapy on AALL1231, with the exception of:

               -  Steroid pretreatment: prednisone or methylprednisolone for =&lt; 120 hours (5 days)
                  in the 7 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy or for =&lt; 336 hours (14
                  days) in the 28 days prior to initiating induction chemotherapy; prior exposure
                  to ANY steroids that occurred &gt; 28 days before the initiation of protocol therapy
                  does not affect eligibility; the dose of prednisone or methylprednisolone does
                  not affect eligibility

               -  Intrathecal cytarabine (the CNS status must be determined based on a sample
                  obtained prior to administration of any systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy,
                  except for steroid pretreatment) system chemotherapy must begin with 72 hours of
                  this IT therapy; or

               -  600 cGy of chest irradiation, if medically necessary

                    -  Pre-treatment with dexamethasone in the 28 days prior to initiation of
                       protocol therapy is not allowed with the exception of a single dose of
                       dexamethasone use during sedation to prevent or treat airway edema;
                       inhalation steroids and topical steroids are not considered pretreatment

          -  Pre-existing &gt;= grade 2 sensory or motor peripheral neurotoxicity

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  Diagnosis of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial compares how well combination chemotherapy works when given
      with or without bortezomib in treating patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia or stage II-IV T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Bortezomib may help
      reduce the number of leukemia or lymphoma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. It may also help chemotherapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive
      to the drugs. It is not yet known if giving standard chemotherapy with or without bortezomib
      is more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic
      lymphoma.</summary>
