  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maximum Observed Concentration of MEDI0382 (Cmax) - The first occurrence of the maximum observed plasma concentration determined directly from the raw concentration-time data</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) of MEDI0382 - The area under the plasma concentration-time curve to 48 hours concentration determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum observed concentration (Tmax) - Time to maximum observed concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>apparent clearance (Cl/F) - The apparent clearance will be calculated as CL/F=Dose/AUC(0-inf)</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AUCinf - The AUC extrapolated to infinity will be calculated, where data permit, as the sum of AUC((0-t) and Ct/z, where Ct is the observed plasma concentration obtained from the log-linear regression analysis of the last quantifiable time-point and z is the terminal phase rate constant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Half-life (T1/2) - The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) obtained as the ratio of ln2/z, where z is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data</outcome>
      <timepoint>0-48 hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anti-drug Antibody (ADA) titer - ADA titer through to day 28</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day -1 to day 28</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects with Adverse Events - Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious adverse events (TESAEs)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study onset till 28 days post dosing</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects with Adverse Events - Vital Signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature and respiratory rates)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Study onset till 28 days post dosing</timepoint>
