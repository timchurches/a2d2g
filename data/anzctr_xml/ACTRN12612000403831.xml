  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Single-centre, randomised-controlled trial with a comparison of two protective ventilation techniques in order to determine the effect on the incidence of acute lung injury/ischaemia-reperfusion injury.

Primary aims:
1. To determine the incidence and severity of acute lung injury post lung transplantation.
2. To determine the incidence of inflammatory markers in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples during anf after lung transplantation
3. To analyse the association between inflammatory markers and acute lung injury
4. To determine whether there is a decrease in the level of inflammation and incidence of acute lung injury associated with pressure-controlled, high positive end-expiratory pressure and alveolar recruitment

Secondary aims:
1. To determine whether further protective ventilation techniques should be incorporated into lung transplantation anaesthesia.

Hypothesis:
Pressure-controlled ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressure with the addition of alveolar recruitment will be more beneficial in minimising acute lung injury than low tidal volume protective ventilation alone in lung transplantation after allograft insertion.</summary>
