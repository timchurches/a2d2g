    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1. Potential participants identified from antenatal clinic record.

2. An invitation letter will be mailed to potential participants, followed by an invitation phone call a week later by a member of the research team for recruitment.
  
3. Interested participants will be seen at 36-38 weeks of gestation by the research team during which a Patient Information Sheet will be handed out.  The Patient Information Sheet will contain information about the study including the aim, potential risks and benefits and the contact numbers of the research team. Any doubt or questions from the partipants will be clarified and answered.  An informed consent for participation in the study will be obtained. 

4. A pre-delivery (antenatal) interview and a pelvic floor assessment will be performed at this stage once the client consented to participate.  The pelvic floor assessment will involve a vaginal examination for assessment of pelvic floor strength and a 4D trans-labial ultrasound.  
 
5. In labour, participants who decide not to proceed with epidural analgesia will be excluded.  Participants will be seen by the anaesthetic team who will obtain informed consent for epidural analgesia and insert the epidural as per local protocol.

6. Participants will be randomised into the ‘intervention group’ or ’non-intervention group’.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this pilot study is to investigate whether pelvic floor muscle relaxation by maintaining the epidural infusion in the second stage of labour may reduce maternal birth trauma. The primary outcome measure will be pelvic floor trauma namely perineal tears, vaginal tears, anal sphincter injuries and levator ani avulsions.  Secondary outcome measures include the length of first and second stage of labour,  rate of instrumental delivery and caesarean section, and the clinical efficacy (analgesia,  motor and sympathetic block) of the two epidural regimes to be tested.

RESEARCH HYPOTHESES
1.	Maintenance epidural infusion of 0.2% Ropivacaine + Fentanyl 2microgram/ml throughout the second stage of labour can reduce pelvic floor trauma.
2.	Maintenance epidural infusion throughout second stage does not increase duration of labour, rate of instrumental and operative delivery.
3.	Maintenance epidural infusion throughout second stage of labour provides effective analgesia with a low complication rate.
