  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participation in the field measurement protocol will involve two consecutive night recordings. Two nights will help assess repeatability, increase study power and maximise acoustic and sleep recording opportunity. Research personnel including one trained sleep technician and one sound technician, will visit each participants home to setup acoustic recording and sleep monitoring equipment (including Electroencephalogram [EEG] and Electrocardiography [ECG]) using already established equipment and methods. As much as is possible, experiments will be scheduled around anticipated worst case traffic/wind farm noise nights based on schedules and weather reports.

Participants'  hearing will be tested prior to night 1 of the protocol using an audiometer. To ensure data quality, each evening the research personnel will remain at the participants' home until participants' bedtime and return in the mornings to collect the overnight data. After each night, participants will be asked to rate overall sleep quality and noise relative to their usual sleep. They will collect 5 serial saliva samples immediately upon awakening, over the next 60 min and 12 hours after waking for salivary cortisol (cortisol awakening response) measurements. Hair follicles will also be collected to measure markers of long-term stress. Sleep studies will be scored into sleep stages. They will also be scored for respiratory and arousal events using international standards independent of the acoustic data to assess overall sleep quality (sleep efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and frequency of arousals). In addition, cardiovascular activation responses, including tachy-bradycardias, pulse wave velocity and pulse wave amplitude attenuation responses will also be examined. All discernible sensory-related activation responses including cardiovascular activation associated with isolated k-complexes, 3-15 sec arousals and full awakenings will be selected for further analysis of event rates per hour of sleep, and noise characteristics preceding each activation event type. Noise will be assessed based on spectral content, overall mean and peak unweighted, A-weighted and G-weighted SPLs and random/periodic variability with time. Full-night quantitative EEG and ECG spectral analyses will also be conducted.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome will be sleep efficiency (sleep time expressed as a percentage of time available for sleep under each noise exposure condition) with the propensity for and magnitude of EEG activation (sub-cortical events, micro-arousals and full-awakenings), arousal thresholds to wind farm versus traffic noise, and cardiovascular responses as key secondary outcomes. Comparisons between groups and conditions will be via linear mixed effects model analyses with night, sleep stage and noise conditions as repeated factors within-subjects, individuals entered as a random effect to account for correlated measures and an overall 2-tailed Type I error rate of 5%. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses will be used to assess EEG (sub-cortical, micro-arousal and awakening) event-free survival to each different noise stimulus type between groups and sleep stages.
Sleep efficiency shows low between subject variability (SD ~10%), large insomnia treatment effects and low within-subject variability over consecutive nights (~3%). We estimate that 15 participants per group has 80% power to detect an 11% (clinically significant) difference in sleep efficiency between groups. An additional 20 participants will be included in the sample size to account for possible drop out rates.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A strong push towards greener and more sustainable energy production has led to rapid expansion of wind farm facilities in Australia and world-wide. This has been associated with wide-spread complaints from neighbouring communities, particularly regarding noise emissions, including infra-sound (noise below average hearing threshold), and concerns that this may negatively impact on sleep and health. International studies so far remain inconclusive, particularly regarding noise effects on sleep. However, no studies so far have used physiological recording techniques necessary to properly investigate sleep. Consequently, this study is specifically designed to investigate windfarm noise effects on sleep using measurements normally used to diagnose sleep problems. This field study is the second part of a large three-part project designed to firmly establish what effect windfarm noise has on sleep compared to quiet sleeping conditions (control) and traffic noise, which is already known to disturb sleep and is therefore a useful condition to compare to (positive control).

The overall aim of this study is assess self-reported (subjective) and direct objective measures of sleep quality in the natural home sleep/noise environment to examine relationships between noise, sleep disturbances and other factors.</summary>
