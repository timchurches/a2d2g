    <summary>Patients with stage I and II low grade follicular lymphoma are randomised between standard
      therapy (involved field radiotherapy) and investigational therapy (involved field
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy plus rituximab). The main endpoint is progression free survival
      but overall survival and the influence of t(14;18) status will also be studied.</summary>
