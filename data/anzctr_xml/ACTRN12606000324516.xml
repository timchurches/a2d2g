  <interventions>
    <interventions>1) MKTVIF75HV alone. Duration: 2 months. Dose: initially 18 000 international units orally per day.
2) ASFSADNS. Duration: 48 hours. Dose 60 international units intranasal qid. 

The ASFSADNS intervention is a factorial design intervention at the end of the 2 month parallel design MKTVIF75HV. 

That is, after 2 months of parallel design MKTVIF75HV versus placebo MKTVIF75HV there will be a further 48 hours of factorial design: ASFSADNS with MKTVIF75HV versus ASFSADNS with placebo MKTVIF75HV versus placebo ASFSADNS with MKTVIF75HV versus placebo ASFSADNS with placebo MKTVIF75HV</interventions>
