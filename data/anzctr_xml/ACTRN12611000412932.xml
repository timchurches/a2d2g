  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will receive usual care as well as participate in a 1 hour standing balance circuit
class, involving exercises aimed at improving balance, three times a week for two weeks. These classes will be
held in the rehabilitation gym and run by experienced physiotherapy staff.

The standing balance circuit class consists of 7 stations; each station consists of a different exercise with 3 levels of difficulty. The class is supervised by two therapists with a maximum of 8 patients participating in the group. Each station lasts for 6 minutes. Patients will perform 6 of the 7 stations during the session. Patients are to perform the level of exercise the therapist deems appropriate without using their hands for assistance.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care. Usual therapy in the Rehabilitation unit at Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital consists of daily (Monday to Friday) assessment and treatment by the multidisciplinary team (including medical, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy, and consults with other health disciplines as indicated). Therapy is provided in individual and/or group sessions. The usual care group will not be offered the standing balance circuit class.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is balance. Balance will be assessed by 5 balance tests; feet apart, feet side-by-side, semi-tandem (heel of one foot beside the big toe of the other foot), tandem (heel of one foot in front and touching the other foot), and single leg stance. Each test will be performed without aid or upper limb support and timed up to a maximum of 10 seconds. The total time summed from the 5 balance tests will form the primary measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 2 weeks and 3 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical Functioning. 

This will be assessed using the Basic Mobility and Daily Activity domains of the Computer Adaptive Testing version of the Boston University Activity Measure for Post Acute Care (AM-PAC) (Haley et al 2004). The AM-PAC measures functional outcome by using Item Response Theory. The AM-PAC Basic Mobility domain includes 101 items that address basic movement and physical functioning activities, such as bending, walking, carrying, and climbing stairs. The AM-PAC Daily Activity domain includes 70 items that address basic self care and instrumental activities of daily life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks and 3 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mobility.

This will be assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (Guralnik et al 1994). This includes a chair stand test (5 repetitions) and a 4 metre walking test, as well as 3 of the 5 standing balance tests (tandem stance, semi-tandem stance, and side-by-side stance) performed as part of the primary outcome measure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 2 weeks and 3 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fall incidence.

This will be measured by participant and/or 'person responsible' self-report. In-patient fall data will also be collected via the hospital Incident Information Managment System (incident reporting system).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and at 2 weeks and 3 months after randomisation via interview.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hospital readmissions.

The number of readmissions will be collected by participant and/or 'person responsible' self-report. Data will also be collected via electronic hospital medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months after randomisation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the addition of six standing balance circuit classes to usual therapy over a 2 week period improves balance, mobility and physical functioning among rehabilitation inpatients. Participants will be allocated at random into one of two groups (Usual Care and Additional Training). People in the Usual Care group will receive standard care as offered by the Bankstown Lidcombe Hospital Physiotherapy service. People in the Additional Training group will receive usual care as well as participate in a 1 hour standing balance circuit class, involving exercises aimed at improving balance, three times a week for two weeks. All participants will be assessed at enrollment into the study, 2 weeks later, and again at 3 months. Assessments will include a questionnaire about mobility and activities of daily living, as well as physical tests including a 4 metre walking test, chair stand test, and balance tests.</summary>
