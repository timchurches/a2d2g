  <interventions>
    <interventions>The NanoKnife (Registered Trademark) System with six outputs is indicated for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It has FDA approval [510(k) Number: K080376]. Intended use in this study is to treat radio-recurrent prostate cancer. 
Patients will receive general anaesthesia, followed by intravenous muscle paralysis, a single-shot antibiotic prophylaxis and the insertion of an indwelling urethral catheter. 
Up to 6 Needle-like electrode probes are then placed around the tumour using transrectal ultrasound for guidance during the insertion through the perineum with a 5x5 mm brachytherapy template grid.. The placement of the electrodes aims for focal ablation of the tumour.  This will include a circumferential safety margin of at least 5mm whilst still being mindful of nearby vital structures. Technical considerations include spacing of the electrodes (required to be 10mm to 20mm apart), and an average electrode exposure length per needle of 15mm. The number of electrodes required for each patient is dependent on the volume of tissue to be ablated and will be determined by the treating clinician before the procedure. 
The Nanoknife system is then programmed to start with 10 pulses per electrode-pair with pulse length set to 90 microseconds and intensity of 1500 V per cm. Treatment delivery is then automatically calculated by the system on the basis of the number of electrodes inserted, the respective distances between each electrode and the active electrode length to obtain an optimal electrical field of between 20A and 40A. If the current does not reach the minimum of 20 amps between one or more electrode-pairs, the voltage will have to be increased with 10 percent for that particular electrode-pair. Following the initial 10 pulses, the subsequent 80 pulses will be delivered to achieve a total of 90 pulses.
The total procedure time is estimated to be 1 hour, starting with the administration of general anaesthesia. The actual Nanoknife procedure will take around 30min. 
A Urologist, the coordinating investigator (CI), will perform the procedure once as day surgery at St Vincents Private Hospital. The CI has a great expertise in the treatment of prostate cancer in Australia and has 4 years experience conducting the procedure, primarily in the setting of primary prostate cancer.
Adherence of the intervention is assessed by the treating Urologist. In addition a second medical doctor or nurse is present during the procedure to ensure settings and adjustments are correctly entered in the Nanoknife system. A procedural template will be filled out during the procedure to help with accurate recording of all settings and adjustments made during procedure.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Since it is a pilot-study, the sample size of 40 (10 per participating centre) is based on similar salvage pilot-studies performed with other focal therapy techniques. The comprehensive review of Smit Duijzenkunst et al.(World J Urol. 2016. doi:10.1007/s00345-016-1811-9)  shows samples size ranging from 15 to 91 patients with an average of 33. 

The rate of disease recurrence at 1 year, as well as the adverse events rates will be recorded as an absolute proportion. 
The functional outcomes before and after the procedure will be compared using a paired sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, depending on the distribution.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the safety profile and functional outcomes of salvage focal irreversible electroporation (IRE) in patients with prostate cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with local recurrent prostate cancer after radiotherapy (radio-recurrent prostate cancer) without metastatic disease.

Study details
All participants in this study will undergo a procedure known as salvage focal irreversible electroporation (IRE) as day surgery at St Vincents Private Hospital. The procedure is conducted under general anaesthesia and involves insertion of up to 6 needle-like electrode probes around the tumour. Microsecond electrical probes are then delivered to the tumour area to cause cell death and destroy the tumour. The procedure is conducted by a urologist and takes approximately 60 minutes.

Participants will be monitored for safety throughout the procedure, and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. They will also be asked to complete questionnaires at these time points to assess quality of life and urinary and sexual functional outcomes. Cancer recurrence will also be assessed at 6 month and at one year post treatment.

The results of this trial will build on a currently developing evidence base in order to guide the judicious use of IRE in patients with localised, radio-recurrent prostate cancer.</summary>
