  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will use a 2 stage, mixed methods participatory action research approach to development and validation of a YouthCHAT (an electronic case finding tool) mapped to all HEEADSSS (face to face psychosocial assessment) domains, and assessment of acceptability of its use at the Starship and Tamaki College settings in Auckland, New Zealand..  YouthCHAT stands for Youth version Case Finding and Help Assessment Tool.  Designed in Auckland, New Zealand.  It is a self-report screening tool that covers 10 domains: smoking, drinking, recreational drug use, problematic gambling, depression, anxiety, sexual health, exposure to abuse, anger management, physical activity and takes between 5-10 minutes to complete. Positive screens lead to branching logic linking users to validated assessment tools. HEEADSSS assessment (Home, Education, Eating, Activities, Drugs and Alcohol, Sexuality, Suicide/Depression, Safety) is a clinician-administered interview-based assessment of youth that can identify mental health and substance use problems. Currently, all Year nine (Yr 9) students in decile 1-3 schools, and some attendees at primary care and paediatric services in NZ are screened for wellbeing via HEEADSSS. While HEEADSSS offers a straightforward, holistic, and gradual approach to assessing young people across many domains, it is a face-to-face assessment, not a screening tool. Drawbacks include its lack of validation cost of resourcing and time required for administration (up to 45 minutes). 

Stage 1
The acceptability and utility of YouthCHAT will be evaluated at two settings: with 30 young people aged 13 to 18 years with long-term conditions attending outpatients at Starship Hospital, and 48 Year 9 students attending Tamaki College in 2017 (a sub-set of the 150 students who will participate in the RCT below). A separate focus group will be undrtaken with Maori young people to ascertain and culturally-specific preferences, issues or concerns. Feedback from consenting young people undertaking YouthCHAT will be sought as well as from attending paediatricians and specialist nurses at Starship and from school nurses at Tamaki College. 

Stage 2
A randomised controlled trial of YouthCHAT with HEEADSSS with be conducted with 150 participants at Tamaki College using a counterbalanced design in which one group receives YouthCHAT and then HEEADSSS assessment (Condition 1), and the other HEEADSSS and then YouthCHAT (Condition 2) on the same day. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	Detection rates for each domain for HEADSSS and YouthCHAT as measured by mental health or lifestyle issue present or absent (Tamaki sample only).  Validated scales for anxiety (based on the GAD 7), depression (based on the PHQ9 9) and substance abuse (based on the SACS) are included in YouthCHAT.  HEEADSSS assessment identifies these issues using the clinical judgement of the assessor.

    <statisticalmethods>For the RCT component of the study, Tamaki has an estimated 150 Yr 9 students in 2017 who will be randomly allocated to either Condition 1 (n = 75) or Condition 2 (n = 75). A power calculation shows that given 144 participants there will be 90% power to detect differences between the two assessments assuming a mean duration of 15 minutes for YouthCHAT (SD = 30) and 45 minutes for HEEADSSS (SD = 90). 

Quantitative data will be analysed using Microsoft Excel and SPSS (Statistical Software Package). Analyses will include basic descriptive statistics (e.g., number of youth screened, YouthCHAT summary data; HEEADSSS summary data, demographic characteristics of the sample). t Tests and repeated measures ANOVA will compare differences between the two groups.  Qualitative data will be analysed using a general inductive approach with collated text analysed to identify emerging themes, which are then independently coded by two researchers with consensus reached by adjudication. Data analysis will be conducted at the end of Term 4, 2017.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Context 
Psychosocial problems such as depression, anxiety and substance abuse are common and burdensome in young people, particularly those with long-term physical conditions such asthma and diabetes. Screening for such problems is currently only undertaken routinely using an unvalidated, time-consuming HEEADSSS interview with Year 9 students in decile 1-3 schools and opportunistically in paediatric settings. YouthCHAT (Youth version, Case-finding and Help Assessment Tool) is a relatively new, locally-developed, ipad-based composite screener for identifying similar psychosocial issues to HEEADSSS. Based individually validated screening instruments, it is self-administered within minutes. Preliminary testing has revealed its acceptability to young people, but further research is required to expand its modules to cover all HEEADSSS domains, to evaluate its acceptability for young people with and without long-term physical conditions, and compare its effectiveness against HEEADSSS.

Objectives 
1.	Ascertain acceptability and utility of YouthCHAT for children with long-term physical illness and high school students
2.	Validate three additional YouthCHAT domains against comparable HEEADSSS domains
3.	Compare the performance of YouthCHAT and HEEADSSS in the high school setting
Methods 
Additional YouthCHAT domains will be co-designed with young people at Tamaki College at the end of 2016. YouthCHAT will then be administered to 30 young people at Starship Hospital, and 150 students at Tamaki College, either before or after HEEADSSS (randomised trial with counter-balanced design) during the 2017 school year. 

Potential clinical benefits
YouthCHAT could be an exciting, innovative, efficient means of routine screening for common psychosocial health issues in young people with and without long-term physical conditions.
