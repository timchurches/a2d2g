  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised controlled crossover study of 10 healthy males. 
Test meals are: 400g steak with two Gold Kiwifruit &amp; 250 ml water X 2 : 400g steak with two Green kiwifruit &amp; 250 ml water X1
Visits:  Participants will arrive having fasted overnight following the consumption of a standard meal.  On arrival they will complete VAS scales rating feelings of hunger, satisfaction, fullness and comfort. They will be given the test food and asked to eat it in full at their own pace but within15 minutes. They will immediately be asked to swallow the SmartPIll, attach the transponder and complete further VAS scales which will be repeated each hour for a total of 5 hours.   Participants will be given an ad libitum lunch after 5 hours to assess energy intake. Items will be given in moderate excess and participants will be asked to stop eating when comfortably full but will remain for a time period of 30 minutes.  Meals will be weighed before and after consumption to assess energy intake.  After 5 days, the participants will visit to return the transponder for downloading of the data. After least 7 days, participants will return to consume the next randomised test meal until all three meals have been consumed</interventions>

      <outcome>Energy intake of ad libitum lunch which will be assessed by offering the participants a restricted buffet-style
meal with predominantly cold and one hot meal choice,
along with a selection of beverages. In an attempt to avoid
over-consumption the variation of meal items will be limited. Participants will be advised that they can eat as
much or as little as they chose and that they are to
remain in the room for a period of 45 minutes. The remaining food items will be weighted and the quantity of food consumed estimated.</outcome>

Initial calculations have been made on the available data.VAS data will be analysed using a repeated measures Linear
Mixed Model ANOVA.  MANOVA will be
also used to generate a full model for VAS incorporating
all dependent variables. Energy and macronutrient intake
data from the ad lib lunch meal will be analysed using univariate ANOVA Univariate ANOVA. The trial will be  analysed on the basis of intention to treat (ITT). Statistical significance will be based on 95% limits (P &lt; 0.05).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The consumption of green kiwifruit, Actinidia deliciosa cv. Hayward, has been thought to assist in the digestion of food for many years and this has largely been attributed to the presence of the proteolytic enzyme actinidin.  Actinidin has been shown to enhance the digestion of protein during the digestive process reducing feelings of over fullness and gastric discomfort following a high protein meal. This study aims to examine the effect of consuming green kiwifruit (containing  high levels of the enzyme Actinidin) alongside a high protein meal of 400g steak and measuring the transit rate of the food through the Gastrointestinal tract using SmartPill technology. SmartPill is a wireless single use, ingestible capsule that uses sensor technology to measure pH, pressure and temperature throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract (GIT) over a five day period . They will also be asked to rate feelings of fullness and gastric comfort using visual analogue scales over a 5 hour period.  Following an interval of at least seven days, the participants will then cross over to repeat the study and consume the same meat meal with Gold kiwifruit (contains low levels of Actinidin) as a comparison.</summary>
