  <interventions>
    <interventions>There were four treatment groups in the study. in the control group(CG), patients received complex vitamin B tablets (produced by Shanghai Xinpasi Pharmacy Co., Ltd.),  each tablet contains Vitamin B13mg, vitamin B2 1.5mg, vitamin B6 0.2mg, nicotinamide 10mg, calcium pantothenate 1mg; 2 tablets/time, 3 times/day,oral; in the herbal medicine therapy group, patients received same treatment as the CG plus the Jieduhuayu granules (10g/bag, produced by the Department of Formulation, First Affiliated Hospital, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, Nanning, Guangxi, China. SFDA Approval No. Z20110004), 1bag/time, 2 times/day, oral, so that patients passed 2-3 semisoft stools per day; in the lactulose therapy group, patients received same treatment as the CG plus lactulose (produced by Abbott Healthcare Products B.V.), 15ml/time, 2 times/day, oral, so that patient passed 2-3 semisoft stools per day; in the  herbal medicine combine with lactulose therapy group, patients received plus the complex vitamin B tablets, the Jieduhuayu granules and the lactulose (same dosage and mode of administration as above, respectively). All those four groups were treated for 15 days. Compliance with the therapies were assured  by counting the number of bags of drugs  consumed and by ensuring increased stool frequency and a change to a softer consistency. </interventions>

the P300 is thought to reflect processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization. When recorded by electroencephalography (EEG), it surfaces as a positive deflection in voltage with a latency (delay between stimulus and response), and any score higher than 280ms is considered abnormal.we use Nicolet Bravo S403 brain evoked potential instrument to measure this outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a special type of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MHE patients operating ability and response capability are reduced to a certain level, raising the risks of accidents. Also, if MHE patients are not treated correctly, their MHE will stand a great chance of progressing to hepatic coma, which increases the mortality of those patients. Because of those factors above, we conducted a randomized trial to observe the effects of a particular Chinese herbal formula (Jieduhuayu granules) on the neurophysiological functions of cirrhotic patients with MHE, to seek out an effective formula of Chinese herbal medicine for MHE. </summary>
