  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention program will start from hospital via an individualised discharge education provided by the patients in-charge nurse and the medical specialist (1st stage of intervention). After patients are discharged, in addition to the usual follow-up in the outpatient clinic of hospital, they will be referred to the nearest Community Health Service Centre to receive 6 months follow-up intervention provided by general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses (2nd stage of intervention). Health professionals from both hospital and community health service centres will work in a collaborative way to implement the post-discharge interventions. 

Stage 1: Interventions at hospital:
1. Individualised discharge education:
1.1. Patients will be given two face-to-face individualised health education sessions specific to diabetic patients with hypertension by the in-charge nurse, with one session 3 days prior to discharge and one on day of discharge. The health education includes health behaviour education, disease-associated education and medication education with 15 minutes for each session. A geriatrics conditions screening will also be undertaken using the widely recognised evidence-based screening tool Fulmer Spices Comprehensive Assessment Tool for Older Adults (Aronow et al., 2014). Education on preventing and managing geriatric conditions will be provided by the in-charge nurse based on the finding from the screening.
1.2. Patients will be asked to establish lifestyle modification goals and develop personal action plans with the in-charge nurse. Patients will be provided an Intervention diary-patient version (refer to Additional file 1 in ANZCTR registration record) to document their lifestyle modification goals, personal action plans, progress towards the goals, medication adherence, adverse events and unplanned hospital admission/ the use of emergency care service.
1.3. Patients will be asked to discuss and establish their diet plan with the in-charge nurse. Diet plan will be recorded in intervention diary-patient version.
1.4. Prior to discharge, patients will be given an individualized medication treatment plan by the medical specialist. Individualized medication treatment will be recorded in the intervention diary-patient version.
1.5. When patients are discharged from hospital, they will be referred to the community health service centers by the in-charge nurse for regular follow up over 6 months. In addition, an Intervention record-community nurse and GP version (refer to Additional file 2 in ANZCTR registration record) will be sent to the community nurse by the in-charge nurse on discharge to record required post-discharge interventions and outcomes.
1.6. Discharge planning and referral
1.6.1 The in-charge nurse at the hospital will contact the GP and nurse in community health service centers to fill in the two-way referral letter for patients, and help patients to contact the nearby community health service centers for follow up visit. Patients will be advised the community health service centers they referred to, and the name and contacts of GP/nurse in community health service centers. 
1.6.2 Data in relation to the patients demographic information, pharmacotherapy history, and other clinical information will be sent to the community nurse by the in-charge nurse on discharge.
1.6.3 Three copies of two-way referral letter will be printed and delivered to the doctor/nurse in hospital,patient and GP/nurse at community health service centers in order to establish the collaboration among them.
1.6.4 Patients will take the referral letter and discharge abstract to the community health service centers for the follow up visit.
1.6.5 The in-charge nurse will keep track of the patients referral progress through contact with the patients and community nurses, and ensure patients are referred to the community health service center. 

Stage 2: Regular follow up interventions over 6 months at community health service centers:
1. Fortnightly phone call:
Patients will receive a fortnightly phone call at home from the community nurse to monitor their progress towards setting goals and medication adherence. The approximate duration of follow-up phone calls at each time will be 10 minutes.
2. Monthly community health service centers visit:
Patients will be asked to visit the community nurse and GP at the community health service centers every month for follow up visits. The approximate duration of follow-up visit at each time will be 30 minutes. 
2.1 Patients will receive blood pressure measurement every month by the community nurse. 
2.2 Patients will receive a review and assessment from the community nurse on their adherence to medication and lifestyle recommendations, and their progress toward lifestyle modification goals. The diet management of patients will follow the guideline of Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH). 
2.3 Patients will receive reinforced health education from the community nurse to improve their self-management ability and treatment adherence. Patient will be given health education on preventing or treating geriatric conditions based on the Fulmer Spices Comprehensive Assessment Tool for Older Adults.
2.4 Patients will receive an assessment from the GP on their clinical outcomes, problems of non-adherence to medication, medication side effects, drug therapy problems, drug-related needs and clinical events occurred.
2.5 Patients will be asked to discuss individualized treatment plan and medication adjustment with GP.
2.6 Patients will be asked to document their medication changes in the intervention diary-patient version.
2.7 Patients will be reminded the categories, dosage and frequency of medication required to be taken prior to the next visit by community nurse.
2.8 The GP will discuss with the medical specialist at hospital via email or telephone when necessary to adjust medication. BP, HbA1c and lipid readings will be recorded by the community nurses and formatted as monthly report and then sent to medical specialists for review. Urgent symptoms will be communicated to the medical specialist immediately for additional orders by the GP.

Intervention fidelity
The items of interventions recorded by both community health professionals and patients include (1) Intervention diary- patient version, (2) Intervention record-community nurse and GP version. The community nurses and GPs will be asked to record the interventions they provide to patients. Compliance with required interventions will be matched using these two tools.

    <sequence>A cluster randomized controlled trial will be applied. The trial will commence at hospitals via discharge and continue at community health service centers for 6 months in Nanchang, a capital city of Jiangxi Province in China. Modified stratified random sampling will be applied to recruit participants. This cluster design will minimize the risk of contamination between intervention and control groups and also reflect the classification of public hospitals in China. Healthcare facilities are classified at three levels, namely community health service centers, secondary hospitals and tertiary hospitals. Tertiary hospitals are the final referral hospitals and provide more comprehensive care services for patients compared with secondary hospitals. 

Participants will be recruited from hospitals and continue the trial at community health service centers. Randomization was performed based on the clusters rather than participants. There are 6 secondary hospitals and 5 tertiary hospitals that provide in-patient care for patients with diabetes and hypertension in Nanchang. As part of the ethics application processes, researchers in the project sent out invitations to all of these 11 public hospitals in Nanchang and informed them that 2 secondary hospitals and 2 tertiary hospitals would be randomly selected to the trial on receiving their responses. The numbers of hospitals to be included in the trial was estimated on the sample size calculation. In total, 6 secondary hospitals and 5 tertiary hospitals agreed to participate in the trial. Hospitals that agreed to participate in the trial were given a unique code number. SPSS version 22.0 was used to randomly select 2 hospitals from each level. There are 2 wards in each participating secondary hospitals and 3 wards in each tertiary hospital that provide in-patient care for patients with diabetes and hypertension. These wards were given a unique code number. SPSS version 22.0 was used to randomly assign 2 wards from secondary hospitals and 3 wards from tertiary hospitals to intervention group or usual care groups respectively. The group assignment was undertaken by a PhD fellow who was not involved in the trial and blind to the wards. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was estimated on the basis of a previous randomised controlled trial study in relation to hypertension management for diabetic patients (Edelman et al., 2010). The 7.3 mm Hg significant difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) has been found in their study with a standard deviation of 12.1 mm Hg. Since randomization is done by wards (clusters), the sample size was adjusted in order to take into account the design effect. An intra-class correlation coefficient was assumed to 0.05 and a cluster size of 25 participants, giving a design effect of 1.48. With these assumptions, a sample size of 5 clusters per group with 25 participants per cluster achieved at least 80% power to detect a difference of 7.3 mm Hg SBP between the group means when the standard deviation was 12.1 mm Hg. Allowing for an attrition rate of 10%, we would require 27 participants per cluster.

Statistical analysis will be performed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) statistics version 22 for windows. Two-sample t-tests for continuous variables and Chi-square tests for categorical variables will be used to assess differences between the intervention and the usual care groups with respect to demographic data. 

To estimate mean changes in the primary and secondary outcomes, linear mixed model for repeated-measures will be used, taking into account the correlations between participants repeated measures over time. Fixed effects in the model will include intervention, time, and the two-way interaction of intervention and time. The model will also include participant-level random effects to account for correlation between participants repeated measures over time. The proposed analyses focus on an intervention group by time effect in the generalized linear mixed model.

A cluster RCT that adheres to The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines will be conducted. Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis based on patients assignment. Participants who withdraw or dont complete the 6 month follow up will be included in the analysis. Statistical significance will be determined with P-values of &lt;0.05. Missing data will be handled by using multiple imputation methods as the linear mixed model assumes that missing values will be missing at random.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In China, the primary care system such as Community Health Service Center is underdeveloped. Patients with chronic diseases usually choose tertiary and secondary hospitals when seeking treatment. As a consequence, tertiary and secondary hospitals are overwhelmed with the patients. This situation is worsened by lack of collaboration and communication between hospitals and Community Health Service Centers. The demand of managing hypertension in primary care settings through comprehensive strategies is largely overlooked. Establishing collaboration between hospital and Community Health Service Center is of paramount importance for alleviating this imbalance. The study intervention emphasises collaborative care among health professionals within and between hospitals and Community Health Service Centers in Nanchang, China in managing hypertension for older people with diabetes. The aim of this study is to test a hypothesis that a hypertension management program built on collaboration between hospitals and Community Health Service Centers can improve blood pressure control in old people with diabetes.</summary>
