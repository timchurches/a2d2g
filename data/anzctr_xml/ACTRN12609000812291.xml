  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of on eye performance of three marketed contact lenses used on a daily wear schedule. The contact lenses tested include 1 Day Acuvue Moist, 1 Day Acuvue Trueye and Acuvue Oasys. The trial will last for three months and the performance of the lenses on eye and subjective responses will be assessed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: To evaluate the effect of lens wear on the ocular surface with 1 Day Acuvue Moist, 1 Day Acuvue TruEye and Acuvue Oasys by observing physiological variables including corneal staining.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the baseline visit, 2 week, 1 month and 3 month visits</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome: To evaluate the on eye performance of 1 Day Acuvue Moist, 1 Day Acuvue TruEye and Acuvue Oasys by observing ocular physiological variables such as redness, contact lens variables such as lens fit and subjective variables with questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the baseline visit, 2 week, 1 month and 3 month visits</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants in this trial must:
- be able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent;
- be at least 18 years old;
- be willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the Investigator;
- have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;
- Has vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses;
- may be experienced or inexperienced at wearing contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Participants in this trial must not have:
- Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
- Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
- Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
- Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner;
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial;  
- Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
- Previous corneal refractive surgery;
- Contraindications to contact lens wear;
- Currently enrolled in another clinical trial;
- Participation in a clinical trial within the previous 2 weeks or participation in a short term clinical trial within the previous 48 hours;
- Be pregnant
- Allergy or intolerance to topical anaesthetics</exclusivecriteria>
