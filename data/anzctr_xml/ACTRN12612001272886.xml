  <interventions>
    <interventions>Metformin: Women with fasting blood sugar 95-109 mg/dl will be started on 250mg per oral twice daily and women with fasting blood sugar 110 - 125 mg/dl will be started on 500mg per oral twice daily, half to one hour before meal, which will be increased to achieve glycemic targets (i.e. fasting blood sugar &lt;95mg/dl and post meal blood sugar &lt;120 mg/dl) to a maximum dose 850mg thrice daily. 

Glibenclamide: If glycemic control is not achieved on Metformin alone, Glibenclamide 2.5mg per oral per day will be added and increased till a maximum dose of 20mg per day as required.</interventions>
    <comparator>Short acting (regular) Insullin will be injected subcutaneously 15-30 minutes pre breakfast, pre lunch and pre dinner and Intermediate-acting insulin will be injected subcutaneously at bedtime. Dose will be calculated according to body weight. 

If only Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) is high, then only bed time Intermediate-acting insulin will be started at a dose of 0.1 - 0.2 units/kg.

If only one or two post prandials are high, then regular insulin at a dose of 0.1 - 0.15 units/kg will be started before a particular meal. 

If all the values are high, then basal bolus insulin will be started as Intermediate-acting insullin 0.1 - 0.2 units/kg at bed time and regular insulin 0.1 - 0.15 units/kg before each meal.

Treatment will be continued till delivery.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>As per standard care women did self monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and maintained record of SMBG. This data was recorded on excel files. The outcome was assessed from determining average fasting blood glucose (FBG) and average post meal blood glucose recorded in excel files, for (a) 15 days prior to delivery (b) from recruitment to delivery. Following criteria was used for judgement of glycemic control: Excellent control - FBG &lt; 95 mg/dl, Post Prandial &lt; 120 mg/dl Satisfactory control - FBG 95 - 110 mg/dl, Post Prandial 120 - 140 mg/dl. Uncontrolled - FBG &gt; 110 mg/dl, Post Prandial &gt; 140 mg/dl.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of admission in the hospital for child birth average blood sugars over 15 days prior to delivery will be calculated from the SMBG chart, as mentioned above.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our purpose is to compare the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic agents with insulin in treatment of Gestational diabetes in our population.
Until now the studies have compared either of Metformin or Glibenclamide with insulin. We will study both the drugs in combination where required. Our hypothesis is that oral hypoglycemic agents (Metformin alone or with Glibenclamide where required ) are as effective as insulin in achieving glycemic control in GDM. Moreover oral agents will be much more cost effective and acceptable to pregnant women of mid-low socioeconomic population of Pakistan.</summary>
