  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Bioequivalence study conducted in healthy volunteers with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis comparing two formulations of budesonide nasal spray 64 micrograms actuation with no health condition or problem studied. 

This study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who have a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis. 

Budesonide is a non-halogenated corticosteroid. Budesonide is indicated for the prophylaxis and treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis and symptomatic relief of nasal polyposis.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sequential, placebo controlled, parallel group study design whereby each participant receives an initial 7-day placebo run-in period to establish a baseline and to identify placebo responders. Participants who respond to the placebo will be eliminated from the study. Dosing will take place daily throughout the 7-day placebo run-in period and the 14-day double-blind randomised treatment period.

The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of budesonide (2 x 64 mcg of budesonide per nostril daily)

The placebo treatment is sodium chloride in water (Saline)

No water or food is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing. 

Participants are required to attend dosing at Zenith Technology during the 7 day placebo period for approximately 30 minutes each morning. Participants accepted into the treatment study will then be required to attend dosing at Zenith Technology for a further 14 days for approximately 30 minutes each morning. all dosing is monitored by a staff member to ensure dosing has been completed correctly.



Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing.  A skin prick test will be carried out to determine if the participant has an allergy to mixed grass pollen as well as a nasal allergen provocation test to establish the individual threshold dose to induce a response (sneezing).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioequivalence parameters of budesonide nasal spray (as summarised by average Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) data) for the two formulations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis of covariance will be performed on the differences of average TNSS recorded on days 5, 6, 7 and the morning score on day 8, and average TNSS from days 12 to 21, with the average TNSS on days 5, 6, 7 and the morning score on day 8 treated as the covariate. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the safety and tolerability of budesonide nasal spray determined by pre-study and post-study blood tests and any adverse effects</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse Events, if any, will be monitored and recorded twice daily at 8am and 8pm.  This study will not involve the collection of blood samples for sample analysis but will involve the collection of blood for pre-screening (taken within 21 days of study day 1) and post study (taken within 7 days of the last study day).  Any abnormalities found between pre and post study results will be followed up until resolution.</timepoint>
