Other: Non-drug interventional group - All enrolled participants will provide a blood sample, spirometry , and feedback on their severe asthma symptoms via questionnaires, and health related quality of life and burden of illness through response to self-administered questionnaires. No investigational product will be administered to participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a non-drug interventional cross-sectional study, where the screening visit and
      study visit can occur on the same day. Investigational product will not be administered.
      Approximately 790 subjects with severe asthma will be screened to achieve a total of at least
      750 evaluable study subjects. The study will not include a run-in or follow-up period. This
      study will provide a more reliable description of the severe asthma patient landscape with
      respect to the potential eligibility for treatment with mepolizumab, omalizumab, and
      reslizumab. This study aims to estimate the potential overlap of patients eligible for
      treatment with mepolizumab and those eligible for treatment with omalizumab and/or
      reslizumab. Additionally, the current study will also ascertain and describe reslizumab
      eligibility with respect to both mepolizumab and omalizumab, in the severe asthma patient
      population.</summary>
