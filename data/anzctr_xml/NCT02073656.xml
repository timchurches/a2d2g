  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) administered for 12 weeks in
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment-naive and treatment-experienced (including treatment
      intolerant) participants with chronic genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection who are co-infected with
      HIV-1.

      Participants who experience confirmed post-treatment virologic failure (relapse) at or before
      Posttreatment Week 24 may be eligible to be enrolled in the Retreatment Substudy to receive
      LDV/SOF plus ribavirin (RBV) for 24 weeks.</summary>
