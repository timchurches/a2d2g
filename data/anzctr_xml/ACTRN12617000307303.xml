  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will follow the manualised metacognitive therapy procedure outlined in Rees, OCD: A practical guide to treatment (2009). Eight group treatment sessions of two hours duration each will be held once per week over eight weeks. Sessions 1-2 will cover engagement  (psychoeducation and normalisation, increasing motivation to change, goal setting, treatment rationale, and shifting to the metacognitive mode). Sessions 3-7 will focus on metacognitive therapy (awareness and modification of attentional strategies and maladaptive metacognitive beliefs, including behavioural experiments). Session 8 will detail relapse prevention planning.
The intervention will be delivered by psychologists undertaking postgraduate training in clinical psychology, under the supervision of a Registered Clinical Psychologist.  Supervision will be provided on a weekly basis to ensure adherence to the treatment protocol. The intervention will be delivered at the Curtin University Psychology Clinic. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.), Version 7: The MINI-7 is a short, structured diagnostic interview for the major psychiatric disorders in DSM-5.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MINI will be used to assess the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the project and provide a categorical outcome measure regarding diagnosis at an initial baseline assessment 3 weeks prior to the treatment, the day prior to the treatment, the day after treatment and at 3 month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale (Y-BOCS; Goodman et al., 1989): The Y-BOCS is a semi-structured interview used to evaluate the severity and intensity of OCD symptoms. The scale is a composite measure that includes 10 items, and measures severity through the following five parameters of obsessions (items 15) and compulsions (items 610): (a) time occupied/frequency, (b) interference, (c) distress, (d) resistance, and (e) perceived control. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme), and the scale has a maximum score of 40. This score will supplement the primary categorical outcome measure by providing dimensional data on outcomes. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The Y-BOCS will be used across three baseline data points (three, two and one week prior to intervention, weekly (ie 8 times) during treatment, and at three month follow-up to track obsessive compulsive symptoms throughout the treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox, Holden, &amp; Sagovsky, 1987): The EPDS is a 10 item, self-report measure designed as a screening tool for depressive symptoms for both men and women during the perinatal period. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The EPDS will be used across three baseline data points (three, two and one week prior to intervention, weekly (ie 8 times) during treatment, and at three month follow-up to track depression, which is often comorbid with perinatal OCD.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Thought Fusion Instrument (TFI; Wells, Gwilliam, &amp; Cartwright-Hatton, 2001):
The TFI is a 14 item self-report composite measure that assesses metacognitive beliefs about the power and meaning of intrusive thoughts.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The TFI will be used across three baseline data points (three, two and one week prior to intervention, weekly (ie 8 times) during treatment, and at three month follow-up to track   changes in metacognitive beliefs throughout the treatment program. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Obsessive-Beliefs Questionnaire (OBQ-44; OCCWG, 2005): This questionnaire is a key composite measure of the metacognitive and cognitive belief domains that have been implicated in causal theories of OCD. This is a 44 item measure, and therefore not suitable for weekly use but will provide additional information for the trial regarding metacognitive and cognitive changes consistent with predominant theories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This measure will be used at an initial baseline assessment 3 weeks prior to the treatment, the day prior to the treatment, the day after treatment and at 3 month follow-up.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Individuals with a primary OCD diagnoses with onset or worsening of symptoms, and a significant impact on functioning, within 6 months of having a baby will be included in the study.

    <designfeatures>Three baseline data points will be collected prior to the intervention to provide a comparison point between no intervention (baseline) and the intervention time periods. This will allow us to examine symptom stability prior to the active treatment being introduced, providing better evidence for the role of the intervention in an uncontrolled trial than simple pre and post intervention data. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of clinical effectiveness will be conducted as follows. The MINI-7 will provide a categorical outcome measure regarding OCD diagnosis at baseline, pre, post and follow-up. In addition to this any categorical changes to secondary diagnosis, such as depression, can be assessed with the MINI-7 at baseline, pre, post and follow-up. In addition to this, paired samples t-tests will be used to compare pre and post intervention scores on secondary measures (Y-BOCS, TFI, OBQ-44 &amp; EPDS) to assess the effect size of individual symptom improvement as a result of the intervention. Jacobson and Truax (1991) criteria assessing clinically significant and reliable change indices will be used on the Y-BOCS and EPDS to determine if and at which point in time clients have improved, remained the same, or deteriorated. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The perinatal period has been identified as a period of increased risk for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) onset and worsening, for both mothers and fathers. Preliminary research suggests that metacognitive therapy (MCT) may be an effective treatment for OCD. MCT focuses on correcting misinterpretations about the meaning and importance of intrusive thoughts, and the need to control these. MCT does not involve the use of traditional exposure and response prevention exercises for OCD, often experienced as aversive by participants. Small trials to date have noted low drop out rates for MCT, so it proposed to be well tolerated by participants. 

Preliminary research also indicates that MCT may be an effective transdiagnostic treatment approach, meaning that it may be able to treat multiple psychological problems by targeting shared underlying maintaining factors. In clinically diverse populations, significant improvements were noted in depression, anxiety, worry, rumination and metacognition following a MCT intervention, with treatment gains sustained over 6 month follow-up. In populations with a primary OCD diagnosis MCT was found to be effective with a range of comorbid mental health conditions reflecting transdiagnostic efficacy of the treatment. To date, no studies have evaluated the use of MCT for OCD that has onset or worsened in the perinatal period. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy of an 8-week group MCT program for perinatal OCD. It is hypothesised that:
1.	Participants will show a categorical improvement in OCD symptoms following MCT, demonstrated by no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria for OCD at post-treatment, and maintained at 3-month follow-up.
2.	Participants will show a reduction in symptom severity and intensity of OCD following MCT, demonstrated by meeting clinically significant and reliable change criteria, at post-treatment and maintained at follow-up. 
3.	Participants will show a reduction in co-morbid depressive symptoms following MCT, demonstrated by decreased scores on measures of depressive symptoms.
4.	Participants will show decreases in scores of unhelpful metacognitive and cognitive beliefs following MCT
