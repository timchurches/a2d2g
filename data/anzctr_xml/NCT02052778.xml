  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of TAS-120 and determine the most
      appropriate dose for the subsequent phase 2 safety and efficacy study in patients with
      advanced solid tumors and multiple myeloma with genetic abnormalities.

      The progression of cancers is caused by a complex series of multiple genetic and molecular
      events leading to changes in the patients DNA. The fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGF/FGFR) signaling pathway is important for normal organ, vascular and
      skeletal development. However, FGFR gene abnormalities have been linked to various cancers.

      TAS-120 is a highly potent, selective small molecule inhibitor of FGFR and is therefore is
      being studied as a therapy for cancer.</summary>
