  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial is aimed at evaluating the interrelationship between innate immunity and ginsenoside bioavailability. The trial is a double-blinded parallel design. This design was selected since this is a preliminary study and the time-dependent bioactivity of ginseng red berry metabolites within the body is currently unknown; a parallel design will eliminate any residual bioactivity of the ginseng or placebo. 
Participants will be randomised into 2 groups; group 1 will consume a single dose  of a ginseng red berry supplement containing 750 mg ginseng red berry extract, where as group 2 will consume a matched placebo, which will contain a cellulose food filler equivalent to the berry extract in the ginseng supplement. These supplements are made commerically by Natural F&amp;P Corporation (South Korea) and meet both NZ and Korea food safety requirements for human consumption and will be adminstered to particpants as  3 tablets (each containing 250 mg ginseng red berry extract) with water.
This trial will take place in designated clinical facilities within PFR and be conducted by experienced trial co-ordinators, who are also First Aiders and trained phlebotomist. Particpants will be asked to initially donate a venous blood sample (~ 15 ml) and then consume a supplement (ginseng or placebo). They will then be asked to donate further venous blood samples at specific times (2, 5, 7, 9 and 24 hrs ) over the day. In addtion, participants will be asked to collect their urine (collecting devise and containers will be provided) for 24 hrs..
 
</interventions>
    <comparator>In this trial, we propose to use a matched placebo. This is prepared by the same company that prepared the ginseng red berry supplement (Natural F&amp;P Corporation (South Korea). The control (placebo) supplement contains the same basic ingredients as the ginseng red berry supplement,  but an equivalent amount (750mg) of crystalline cellulose 101 (common food filler) replaces the ginseng red berry extract. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Bioavailability plasma &amp; urine profile of ginseng red berry ginsenoside metabolites will  be analysed by either LC-MS or NMR spectroscopy methods developed by PFR. (i) NMR spectroscopy analysis, plasma will be diluted with buffered deuterated water (deuterium oxide) and directly analysed by NMR spectroscopic methods developed in collaboration with Dr Pat Edwards at Massey University. (ii) LC-MS analysis, protein-free plasma or urine will be fractionated through a series of solid phase extraction procedures following literature methods. The final extraction eluent containing the ginsenosides will be analysed by LC-MS. In both approaches, concentrations of ginsenosides will be calculated using authentic standards.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Plasma samples collected at 0, 2, 5, 7, 9 nd 24 hrs and urine samples collected between  0-3 hrs, 3-6 hrs, 6-12 hrs and 12-24 hrs.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Innate immunity will be evaluated by immune responsiveness profiles in cell-based bioassays. Collected plasma be applied to cell assays evaluating (i) bacterial endotoxin-induced acute inflammatory response or (ii) the ability to up-regulation of anti-oxidant defence pathways. These bioassays will employ the measurement of inflammatory biomarkers (e.g. TNFa, IL-6, IL-10) measured using commerical ELISAs and by assessing the activation of the nrf2/ARE pathway in response to tBHQ in a gene-luciferase reporter cell bioassay.

    <statisticalmethods>All trial data will be captured on study specific visit worksheets and transcribed to an access database (Dotmatrix), held at PFR. The data will be analysed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 9.1 for Windows (version 5.1.2600). Using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Comparison between supplementation groups over time for each measure (independent variable) will also be determined, providing levels of significance for trial effect, treatment effect, and interaction effect between sampling times. Post-hoc tests will also be performed to identify significant differences at each time point. Values will be presented as means +/- standard deviation (or standard error) at a 95% significance level (p = 0.05). Pearsons Product Moment Correlation Coefficients may also be assessed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows to investigate if there are any relationships between certain variables by giving an R-value between 0.0 and 1.00 (or -0.0 and -1.00).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scientific evidence shows that ginsenosides (saponin compounds) naturally present in ginseng species (Korean ginseng Panax ginseng and other Panax species) can confer multiple health benefits, including boosting natural immunity, However this research has been done on the ginseng root, and whilst ginseng berries (red or yellow) show a variety of potentially bioactive ginsenosides, similar to those found in the root, it is unclear whether ginseng berries possess any health properties. In this preliminary feeding study, we hypothesis that consumption of a single dose of a supplement containing a ginseng red berry extract will upon gut metabolism generate bioactive ginsenosides (similar and/or novel) that exhibit health properties that boost natural immunity.</summary>
