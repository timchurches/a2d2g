  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be two intervention groups: One group will be randomised to receive dexmedetomidine preoperatively 45 minutes prior to theatre (2 micrograms/kg made up to 1 mL with saline intranasally) and then after induction of anaesthesia they will receive an infusion of saline (1mL/kg) over ten minutes intravenously.  The other group will receive a 1mL saline nasal spray 45 minutes prior to theatre and then after induction of anaesthesia they will receive a dexmedetomidine infusion 1mL/kg of 1microgram/mL solution over ten minutes intravenously.  The nurse administering the premedication and the anaesthetist administering the infusion will be blinded to group allocation and the solutions will be made to look identical by a clinical trials pharmacist.  The timing of administration will be recorded on the medication chart of the patient to monitor adherence.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Negative behaviours as measured by the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire.  This is a validated behaviour screening tool for children aged 2 to 16.

      <timepoint>Day 3, 14 and 28 post procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Emergence delirium.  This will be measured using the Cornell Assessment of Paediatric Delirium (CAP-D).  This scale has been designed to detect hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed delirium in children.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse effects.  Common adverse effects of dexmedetomidine include bradycardia and hypotension.  These will be assessed and recorded by the recovery nurse by the pulse rate on the pulse oximeter and non-invasive blood pressure measurement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain in recovery.  This will be assessed using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Scale by the recovery nurse.  This validated pain measurement tool is commonly used for children aged 2 months to 7 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post procedure</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain at home.  This will be assessed by a numeric rating scale (NRS) where a researcher will ask a parent via telephone which whole number from 0 to 10 best reflects the intensity of their child's pain with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline characteristics will be compared using students t-test for continuous variables and chi-squared analysis for categorical variables.

The chi-squared test will be used to compare changes in proportion of NBC over time.

Stepwise multiple binary logistic regression will be used to analyse relationships between baseline characteristics and NBC.  Only independent predictor variables will be retained in the final model.

The sample size was calculated assuming an underlying rate of 50% of negative behaviour change on day 3 post procedure and a clinically significant reduction would be 50% to an overall rate of 25%.  For a power of 90%, an alpha-error of 0.05 and assuming a 20% loss to follow-up we would need 98 patients per group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to assess whether the administration of dexmedetomidine either before or during a child's operation affects the incidence of post-hospitalisation behavioural change (PHBC).  It has been reported that PHBC occurs in over 50% of children undergoing a general anaesthetic(1) and manifests as behaviours such as sleep and eating disorders, defiance of authority, nightmares, enuresis and temper tantrums.  The effect is usually short-lived, however in 5-10% of children these behaviours can last up to 12 months.  The risk factors for developing PHBC include underlying anxiety in the child or parent, a traumatic experience at induction of anaesthesia, emergence delirium and pre-school age.  A recent meta-analysis of alpha-2 agonists found that they effectively reduce the incidence of emergence delirium but none of the studies looked at longer term outcomes (2).  This study aims to answer the question of whether dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, can reduce the incidence of PHBC.  

Pre-school age children requiring general anaesthesia for common day-case procedures will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: A dexmedetomidne pre-medication group, an intraoperative dexmedetomidine group and a control group.  Baseline anxiety levels of the child and parents will be recorded using validated tools and the anxiety of the child during induction of anaesthesia will also be recorded.

The primary outcome will be maladaptive behaviours after hospitalisation and these will be measured using the Post Hospitalisation Behaviour Questionnaire for Ambulatory Surgery (PHBQ-AS) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).  These questionnaires on children's behaviour will be administered to the parents by a blinded researcher at day 3, 14 and 28 post surgery.
