Other interventions: polymorphism analysis
SNPs will be genotyped in whole blood samples taken at baseline.

Other interventions: laboratory biomarker analysis
Biomarkers will be assessed in blood and serum samples at different time points.

Treatment: surgery: quality-of-life assessment
Quality of life will be assessed using the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Scales and the IBCSG Trial 35-07 QL Form.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood in the laboratory from patients receiving treatment for
      cancer may help doctors learn more about changes that may occur in DNA and identify
      biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying changes in estrogen levels and grip strength in
      postmenopausal women who have received 4 to 6 years of hormone therapy for breast cancer and
      are currently receiving letrozole on clinical trial IBCSG-35-07.</summary>
