  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Girls on the Go! program is a 10-week intervention designed to assist young women in improving self-esteem, body image, confidence and general health and wellbeing. The program is delivered from an empowerment model whereby the young women are actively involved in the planning and implementation of the activities they feel will best benefit them. Participants engage in discussion and activities design to address a particular topic. Weekly themes include: introductions, body image, safety and assertiveness, a healthy mind, physical activity, trust and confidence and celebration. Areas of health and wellbeing are addressed throughout the program.  The program is facilitated by Youth Workers and takes place outside of the school environment.
There is one session per week. The first Girls on the Go session lasts for 1 hour, the next 8 sessions last for 2.5 hours, the final session lasts for 6 hours and includes a celebration.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Young women meeting the inclusion criteria will be identified by School Welfare Co-ordinators, School Nurses, School Counsellors, Physical Educators, Health and other Teachers.  A “Girls on the Go!” program brochure is provided by investigators to these staff to assist them with identifying eligible students correctly.  Referrals are then made by these school staff members to the Greater Dandenong Community Health Service.  Eligibility for the program is checked by Greater Dandenong Community Health Service staff who then accept this referral.  
The referring school will send a letter to the parent / guardian explaining that a referral to Greater Dandenong Community Health Service has been made.  This letter outlines what the “Girls on the Go!” program entails.  Parents are then required to sign a parent permission form.
The school then notifies Greater Dandenong Community Health Service that the parent permission form has been completed.
The person who enrolls schools into this trial will not be aware of the random allocation sequence at the time of enrolment.  The School Welfare Coordinators who identify young women to be referred for this program will not be aware of the allocation of their school at the time of making the referral.  The researchers gaining consent from participants' parents/guardians will be aware of the allocation of the school at the time of gaining consent.

A telephone call will then be made by an investigator to explain to the research project to the parent/guardian.  A standardised telephone script will be followed.  An interpreter service will be engaged where required.  Verbal consent from the parent for the child to participate in the research project will be sought.
This trial involves randomisation of clusters (schools being the unit of randomisation).  The allocation sequence will be concealed from the person recruiting schools into this trial but not from the person gaining individual participant consent to participate.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random allocation sequence will be generated using a computer random number generator.
This is a central randomisation approach that was then communicated to researchers by e-mail (computer)</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>This will be a matched cluster randomised trial.  Schools are matched into pairs based on size.  The two largest schools are then split, with one being randomly allocated to the intervention and one to the control group. The next two largest are then split, followed by the two smallest.</designfeatures>
