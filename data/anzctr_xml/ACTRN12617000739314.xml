  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of 450 mg paracetamol/30 mg codeine phosphate hemihydrate/5 mg doxylamine succinate tablet on one occasion and the innovator formulation of 450 mg paracetamol/30 mg codeine phosphate hemihydrate/5 mg doxylamine succinate tablet on one occasion with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test tablet formulation.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 
Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours before receiving each dose and to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance and will be monitored and for 24 hours after dosing.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose (1 x 450/30/5 mg) will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of paracetamol/codeine/doxylamine (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for paracetamol, codeine and doxylamine using a fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.</outcome>

    <concealment>All formulations will be labelled as Formulation A and B. The identification of each treatment will only be known to the Managing Director and the Section Head - Trials and Regulatory Affairs.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant will be identified by a 3 digit screening number and a 2 digit subject number. The screening number will be issued once the participant has given written consent to participate in the study and the two digit subject number (randomisation number) after acceptance into the study.
Sequence generation will be by using a simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation)</sequence>
