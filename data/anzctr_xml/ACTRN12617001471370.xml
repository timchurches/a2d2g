    <interventions>This is a single center, phase 1, randomized, open-label, single dose,
crossover study in healthy adult subjects designed to compare the
PK and PD of two injection modalities of ACP-011 to confirm
bioequivalence (BE). PK (hGH) will be evaluated by Cmax and AUC, and the PD (IGF-1) will be evaluated by Emax and AUEC. ACP-011 will be administered at a fixed nominal dose of 13.3 mg hGH corresponding to 0.20 mg hGH/kg subcutaneously (SC) to healthy subjects via syringe and needle versus the auto-injector during two separate periods separated by interval washout period.

The screening period will occur between Days 28 and 2; subjects will be admitted to the clinic site on Day 1. 

Two treatments modalities will be available,

ACP-011 administered by syringe and needle (termed A) 
ACP-011 administered by auto-injector (termed B). 

Approximately 26 healthy male subjects will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two treatment modality sequences, AB or BA.

A (or B, depending on sequence) will be given during Period 1, followed by B (or A, depending on sequence) in Period 2 with an interval of at least 14 days in between.

Treatment modality A consists of a single subcutaneous injection of ACP-011 13.3 mg hGH administered via syringe and needle to the abdomen. Treatment modality B consists of a single SC injection of ACP-011 13.3 mg hGH administered via the auto-injector. Both injections will be administered to the same quadrant of the abdomen.

On the morning of Day 1 of Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of ACP-011 according to the assigned administration method. On the morning of Day 1 of Period 2, subjects will cross over to receive a single dose of ACP-011 via the alternate
administration method. Each dose will be followed by 15 days of PK and PD sampling.

Subjects will be admitted on Day 1 and remain in the clinic until the morning of Day 8. They will return for outpatient visits on Days 9, 11, and 15 in each treatment period for safety, PK, and PD assessments. Discharge from the study will occur after all assessments are completed on Day 15 (cumulative Day 44) of Period 2.

    <statisticalmethods>A total of 26 subjects evaluable for bioequivalence are planned for the study to provide 95% power to demonstrate bioequivalence with 0.25 coefficient of variance (CV), and 84% power with 0.30 CV, assuming equal PK profile between the two drug administration methods.

For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum). Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized for all subjects. The number of subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects who complete the study will be presented. Frequency and percentage of subjects who withdraw or discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, will also be summarised.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Anlysis

hGH serum concentration data will be listed and summarized by time point for each dose and analyte using descriptive statistics, including but not limited to: number of subjects, mean, SD, coefficient of variation (CV), median, minimum, and maximum. HGH serum concentration versus time profiles for each subject will be presented graphically using actual sampling times.

The PK parameters of hGH will be analyzed using non-compartmental modelling based on the actual sampling times. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics (including, but not limited to: number of subjects, mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, and maximum).

Geometric means will be reported for at least Cmax and all AUCs. Actual sampling times, rather than scheduled sampling times, will be used in all calculations of PK parameters. However, for ease of presentation, scheduled sampling times will be used to present results in tables, listings, and figures.

The PD parameters of IGF-1, IGF-1 SDS will be summarized by time point for each dose using descriptive statistics, including, but not limited to number of subjects, mean, SD, CV, median, minimum, and maximum.

Geometric means will be reported for at least Emax and all AUECs. Actual sampling times, rather than scheduled sampling times, will be used in all calculations of PD parameters. However, for ease of presentation, scheduled sampling times will be used to present results in tables, listings,
and figures.

The primary PK endpoints to determine bioequivalence are AUC0-168 and Cmax of hGH.. The primary PD parameters to determine PD bioequivalence are AUEC0-336 and Emax of IGF-1. An analysis of variance model (ANOVA) will be used to compare the two administration methods
(intra-subject) for each of the log transformed PK/PD endpoints. A 90% confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for the ratio of population geometric means of exponentiated LS means (Treatments B/A). PK and PD bioequivalence will be concluded if the 90% confidence limits
fall within 80-125% for the corresponding primary endpoints.

Safety Analysis

Adverse events will be coded by preferred term and system organ class using the latest version of MedDRA and summarized by treatment and overall. Adverse events will also be summarized by severity, relationship to study drug, SAEs, TEAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of study
drug. The incidence and quality of injection site reactions and positive immunogenicity results will be summarized by treatment.Actual values and changes from Baseline for clinical laboratory results and vital sign measurement results will be summarized by treatment at each time point using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum). Clinical laboratory data, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, injection site reactions, and immunogenicity results will be presented in data listings.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate an alternative method of administration, an auto-injector device containing ACP-011 compared to the usual needle and syringe. 

This research project is testing and comparing  the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (the amount of study drug and its breakdown products in your blood), pharmacodynamics (how your body is affected by the study drug) and immunogenicity (how your immune system is affected by the study drug) of ACP-011. 

Approximately 26 healthy male participants will be enrolled across 2 cohorts (groups). Each cohort will consist of 13 participants. 

The study medication will be administered through two methods over two periods,  Particpants will  receive both treatment methods in a particular sequence. The dose of study drug will be the same for each method.

Participants will not have a choice as to which method or treatment sequence assigned, this will random (like flipping a coin). After the first treatment period, there will be a 14 day period where there will not be any study medication given. This period is known as a wash-out period. 

Treatment A: consists of a single subcutaneous (SC) (just under the skin) injection to the abdomen administered via syringe and needle.
Treatment B: consists of a single SC injection administered via the auto-injector to the same quadrant of the abdomen as the previous injection (depending on sequence).

Total participation in the study  consists of 45 days which is broken up into 3 phases: 

-	Screening Phase: During which participants will undergo suitability assessments 
-	Treatment Phase: During which participants will be required to stay overnight in the unit for 8 consecutive nights on two separate occasions. Following this participants will be required to attend the study centre on 3 separate occasions 
-	Washout Phase: in between the inpatient stays, where no study visits are required.
