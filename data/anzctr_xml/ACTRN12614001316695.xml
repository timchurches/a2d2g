  <interventions>
    <interventions>Protected mealtimes aims to protect mealtimes from unnecessary and avoidable interruptions, through providing a supportive environment for eating. It supports staff to provide patients with support and assistance with meals, and is therefore a systems approach to address the vast problem of in-hospital malnutrition. 

This study will compare the implementation of a protected mealtimes intervention with usual care in the subacute setting. The study aims to positively improve food intake at mealtimes, therefore treating and preventing malnutrition developing. The implementation will have three steps:
1. Pre-implementation - decreasing barriers to implementation through engagement of key stakeholders, staff training, planning the implementation etc. The study has support from the Eastern Health Executive team, with the absence of support throughout the organisation known as a barrier from previous studies of protected mealtimes. The study will fall under the auspices of the Nutrition Expert Advisory Committee.
Senior staff training and engagement will commence in July 2015.  Training of nursing staff and other treating team members will occur in the week prior to the intervention so as not to affect baseline data collection.  There will be three group training sessions on each ward during this pre-intervention week, all administered by the lead researcher.  These training sessions will be multidisciplinary.  
The study will run for four weeks, including one week of baseline data collection (usual care) then the intervention introduced in one ward per week.
2. Implementation of protected mealtimes through the planned study design
Protected mealtimes will be implemented consistent with the British Caterer's Association Protected Mealtimes Policy 2004, available at: www.hospitalcaterers.org/documents/pmd.pdf
The intervention period will be 1-3 weeks.
3. Evaluation of the intervention will be two fold - compliance with the protected mealtimes implementation will be evaluated by the dietetic team who will assess compliance using the checklist from Hickson M, Connolly A, Whelan K. Impact of protected mealtimes on ward mealtime environment, patient experience and nutrient intake in hospitalised patients. J Hum Nut Diet 2011; 24:370-374.
Further, the nutritional intake of patients will be evaluated using the nutritional analysis software, Foodworks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The study design is a cluster randomised trial, whereby all clusters (wards) will commence the study simultaneously.  The order and location of the interventions will randomized using a computer generated random number sequence.  Subacute wards on multiple sites will be utilised to support the stepped wedge study design.   
Through utilisation of this study design, participants will form their own controls.</comparator>

This will be monitored by Eastern Health dietitians during the study period through use of the checklists of: Hickson M, Connolly A, Whelan K.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Handgrip strength is an indicator of muscle function and protein status. This will be measured by researchers at the bedside within 24 hours of the malnutrition assessment with a Jamar (Registered trademark) Plus + Hand Dynamometer. The measurement will be taken with the patient sitting upright in a chair or bed with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees, the forearm neutrally positioned and the wrists dorsi-flexed at 30 degrees as recommended by the American Society of Hand Therapists (ASHT). Using the non-dominant hand, three measurements will be taken and the mean value will be calculated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Handgrip strength will be assessed within 24 hours of the malnutrition assessment.  </timepoint>

      <outcome>Functional Independence Measure</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be collected from the medical record of participants, at study commencement and completion (week 1 and week 4) if they have been conducted.  This measurement will not be undertaken by researchers.</timepoint>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations for the study have been conducted to close the energy deficit from actual intake (in the 2013 study of 5900kJ+/-2074kJ) to energy requirements (7801kJ+/-1713kJ).  This study has been powered for a stepped wedge design, and 84 observations of 24 hour dietary intake are required across the study sites to have 84% power to detect a significant difference of 0.05 in the primary outcome.  An average cluster size of at least seven participants is required.  One cluster (ward) will be randomised per step, with three clusters (wards) included in the study.
Outcome data will be recorded on a hard copy template, manually coded and entered into Microsoft Excel, supervised by the principal researcher. Statistical analysis will be performed with Help Stepped wedge (University of Birmingham) with p&lt;0.05 considered statistically significant. 
Descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation (SD), number (n), frequency (%)) will be used to describe the demographic and baseline characteristics of the sample.

The outcome analysis will primarily consider the change in outcomes between baseline and intervention. Statistical analysis will be supported by a specialist statistician. The mean (SD) change in energy (kJ, kJ/kg body weight) and protein (g, g/kg body weight) intake, Functional Independence Measure score and hand grip strength (kg) will be calculated. Difference in the mean change between groups will be investigated.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is known that 30-50% of inpatients are either malnourished or at risk of developing malnutrition, including those at our Eastern Health facilities. A range of strategies have been tried to reduce weight loss during admission, but few have proven effective. Protected mealtimes is a strategy that aims to protect mealtimes from unnecessary and avoidable interruptions, through providing a supportive environment for eating. It supports staff to provide patients with support and assistance with meals, and is therefore a systems approach to address the vast problem of in-hospital malnutrition. 

This study will compare the implementation of a protected mealtimes intervention with usual care in the subacute setting. The study aims to positively improve food intake at mealtimes, therefore treating and preventing malnutrition developing. A high quality study design will be used, with the intervention introduced incrementally across three subacute sites. Evaluation will focus mostly on energy and protein intake, with compliance with the implementation also evaluated.

The observational studies of protected mealtimes to date have shown promising clinical outcomes effects, but these effects have been limited due to reports of barriers to implementation of the strategy. These will be addressed through the design and implementation of this translational study. The research is supported by an NHMRC Fellowship, enabling a high quality study to be undertaken.</summary>
