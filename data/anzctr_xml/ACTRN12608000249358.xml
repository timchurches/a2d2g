  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hospital versus home based induction of labour
This study aims to find out whether or not it is good practice to permit pregnant women to go home to rest after they have had induction of labour started.  The study is important because it will identify potential advantages and disadvantages to this approach, so that women can make properly informed choices about their care.</summary>
