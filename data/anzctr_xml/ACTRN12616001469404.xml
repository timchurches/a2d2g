    <interventions>Introduction of solar-powered oxygen concentrators into 36 health centres in Papua New Guinea. This project will evaluate the implementation issues in the national scale-up of oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters in the rural areas PNG, a high mortality developing county.  The implementation steps include defining the criteria for facilities where this technology (oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters) are appropriate, assessment of power supplies and power requirements of each health facility, the optimal design of a solar power system to power the equipment, defining specifications for oxygen concentrators  and other oxygen equipment that will function in remote environments, implementation logistics in remote settings, developing the engineering capacity required to sustain such a program at scale, and training on oxygen equipment and the treatment of children with severe respiratory infection.

Training is both in workshops in each province, and on-site training, where a team member visits the health facility as part of improved monitoring and supervision, and conducts training at that time.  The treatment of pneumonia follows standard WHO treatment based on the Hospital Care for Children guidelines, and the oxygen therapy guidelines (WHO Clinical use of oxygen in children).

The implementation is expected to take 6 months, but because it is multifaceted and multi-site it may extend beyond this depending on the feasibility in different locations.

The project will evaluate these issues down to a rural district hospital and major health center level (i.e. the smallest health centers that admit children).  Implementation involves the National Department of Health, the provincial paediatricians, local technicians, and a solar contractor.

The programmatic and implementation issues we will evaluate include technical questions regarding power supply irregularity in remote settings, the role of solar power, the optimal concentrator to use in remote tropical environments, the role and utility of hand-held oximeters particularly when used by nurses and community health workers, training issues in oxygen concentrators and the use of pulse oximetry, program costs, the engineering capacity required to maintain a program, the integration of these technologies with clinical guidelines for the standard treatment of children with pneumonia and integrated case management, and referral problems.  These issues have not been addressed in a systematic way in developing countries and they are impediments to progress in improving childrens access to better care for severe pneumonia.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical, prior to the use of oxygen concentrators and solar power in these health centres.  This baseline data is from routine health facility recording information from admission record books in the 36 health facilities.  The baseline data will be gathered from January 2013 to December 2015.  The duration may vary depending on the completeness of the routine health admission books, but we will aim for at least 2 years, and optimally 3 years of pre-intervention data. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main learnings from this project will be to better understand what is required to achieve a national scale with effective oxygen systems, including the use of oxygen concentrators and pulse oximeters, especially the challenges of achieving this at a district hospital and health centre level, with alternative renewable power sources.  The methods of assessment will be qualitative evaluations throughout the implementation process, and interviews with stakeholders.. </outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years.  The time-points for qualitative evaluations and interviews with stakeholders will be at baseline prior to implementation, completion of implementation, and every 6 months thereafter up to at least 2 years post implementation.  The issues assessed at different time points will differ - from early on methods of implementation and the successful approaches, to later issues f sustainability and what worked and what did not.  </timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Health facilities in remote rural PNG.  Health facilities will be included if they have a high burden of pneumonia, difficulty getting access to oxygen, difficulties with mains power supply, and the staff are motivated to be involved.
This study does not involve the allocation of patients to a treatment group, but involves the evaluation of the implementation of a public health program, which would be expected to have an impact on clinical outcomes.  There are no individual patient data recording, or individual patient recruitment, the evaluation is based on routine health facility data.  Thus the criteria below are merely indicative of children managed in the 36 health facilities, not selection criteria for recruitment.  Data on children aged 1 week to 15 years, recorded in the admission record books of the health facilities, will be gathered to assess the pneumonia case fatality rate outcome.</inclusivecriteria>
