  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brief motivational interviewing counseling session provided by a trained oral health counselor with parent/carer of child at approximately 8 weeks age and then at 3-4 months of age and at 6 months of age. Brief motivational interviewing approach, which has been used in many different settings, relies on a brief empathic counselling session where the client is helped to explore and verbalize the reasons for changing the health behaviour, and find the reasons for the change themselves. The impetus for change stems from the person and is not imposed by the counselor; the client is the initiator and an active participant in the change process and not merely a recipient of information being delivered by an expert. The counseling sessions will take approximately 45 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be provided with standard "Lift the Lip" oral health screening of the child by child health nurses of the Health Department of WA at 8, 18 and 36 months of age</comparator>

      <outcome>caries incidence and increment.
Children will be examined for incidence of dental caries and the presence of enamel defects by blinded, calibrated examiners at 12, 24, 36 months of age, using the criteria specified by Workshop on Reporting Early Childhood Caries and modified Development Defects of Enamel Index.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine if an early oral health promotion intervention using a brief motivational interviewing counseling session among parents of new-born children will affect the occurrence of early childhood dental decay. The hypothesis being tested is that the motivational interviewing intervention will reduce the occurrence of early childhood dental decay compared with standard "Lift the Lip" screening program.</summary>
