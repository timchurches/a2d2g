  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention program will take place over 6months. The main intervention will be a booklet that will focus on healthy eating and physical activity, information on chronic diseases, physical activity and nutrition guidelines, goal setting, relapse prevention techniques.
Trained Research Assistants will conduct five group based face to face education sessions of 30 minutes each on nutrition, physical activity, goal setting and relapse prevention. Four sessions will take place over the first two months with the fifth session taking place in the last month of the intervention period.
Monthly newsletters providing supplementary information to booklet.
Fortnightly phonecalls.
Pedometers and resistance bands with information, demonstrations and materials to encourage usage.
Calendars to record physical activity and nutrition information.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will be recruited at same time as the intervention group, but not receive any intervention. Their only participation will be via self completed questionnaires at baseline, 6 months and 12 months.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria: Randomly selected sample of seniors from low and medium SES groups from the Perth metropolitan area insufficiently active (not achieving 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on at least 5 days/wk); aged 60 to 70 years old and healthy to the extent that participation in a low-stress physical activity program would not place them at risk.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>If they receive a low score on the Readiness for Physical Activity Questionnaire (PARQ) and cannot gain medical clearance to participate in the program.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The Survey Research Centre at Curtin University will match telephone numbers (of the 7200 names from the Federal Electoral Role) and make the initial contact. Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was "off-site" and not involved in implementation of the trial on site.  Prior to the initial contact by the Survey Centre, a postcard will be sent to subjects with information on the program and informing them they will receive a phone call within the next 2 weeks. During the initial contact, the purpose of the call will be explained and the caller will determine if the subject meets the selection criteria. The subjects will then be assigned to either the intervention group or the control group using a table of random numbers. A consent form and a self-completion questionnaire will then be sent to the willing subjects. They will be contacted by letter and 6 and 12 months to complete questionnaires. In accordance with ethics approval, participants will not be informed that the study is a Randomised Control Trial (RCT).</concealment>
