  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with chronic renal impairment were administered low dose metformin, 500mg oral capsule daily for 6 weeks. Patients on dialysis were administered metformin at lower doses of 250mg daily for 6 weeks. At least 8 clinic visits were required for routine clinical care, including pathology tests.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, fixed regimen clinical study. Enrolled patients were administered low dose metformin (250mg or 500mg) to examine the effect and exposure of metformin in patients with chronic renal impairment. Patients were monitored frequently to ensure metformin concentrations and lactic acid concentrations were not high. The aim of this study is to determine whether metformin can be safely administered to patients with renal impairment.</summary>
