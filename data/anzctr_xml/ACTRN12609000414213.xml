  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will assess changes in physical activity and health-related fitness over a 6-month period. The study will evaluate the Physical Activity Leaders (PALs) program, which is a school-based physical activity intervention for low-active adolescent boys in economically disadvantaged secondary schools.  The program will provide students with an opportunity to increase their knowledge, skills and attitudes toward physical activity and nutrition. The PALs program was developed in reference to Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and the program will target the following mediators of behaviour change: self-efficacy, social support and self-monitoring. The intervention will include the following components:

1) Health-related fitness activities - the physical activity sessions will focus on resistance training and circuit training using elastic tubing resistance training devices. 
2) Interactive seminars - the seminars will focus on strategies to promote physical activity and healthy eating, training principles and fitness programming. A summary of the key messages to be reinforced in the physical activity sessions and interactive seminars are listed below:

a) Monitor your physical activity, fitness, and nutrition levels
b) Use training principles to set goals for physical activity and fitness
c) Reduce your time spent watching television, using the computer and playing electronic games immediately after school
d) Provide physical activity social support for your family and friends
e) Keep track of fruit and vegetable intake (using goals/diary) and aim for 2 pieces of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables each day
f) Drink more water and swap sugary drinks for diet drinks
g) Consider your portion sizes and eat at the dinner table
h) Reduce your junk food snacks

Total number of sessions are provided below:
1) 8 x 90 minute sessions focusing on health-related fitness activities. These will be delivered during school sport (Term 3).
2) 8 x 30 minute sessions focusing on enjoyable physical activities. These will occur during lunch-time (Term 3). 
3) 3 x 40 minute interactive seminars focusing on physical activity and nutrition and fitness leadership delivered during school sport or at lunch-time (start of Term 3, end of Term 3 and end of Term 4).
4) 6 x 30 minute physical activity mentoring sessions working with year 7 boys. Mentoring will take place during lunch-time (Term 4).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometric. (1) Height and weight- will be measured to using a portable scale and stadiometer. (2) Waist circumference- will measured using non-extensible steel tapes. (3) Fat mass and fat-free mass- will be determined using the ImpSFB7 bioelectrical impedance (BIA) machine. The ImpSFB7 is a single channel, tetra polar bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) device.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 10-weeks and 6-months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Physical activity- will be assessed using Yamax pedometers, which will be worn for 5 week days and 1 weekend day. (2) Muscular strength- will be assessed using an isometric leg strength test and the 7-stage abdominal strength test. (3) Muscular endurance- will be assessed using the wall squat test and a timed push-up test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 10-weeks and 6-months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Mediators of behavior change- a questionnaire will be used to assess the following- physical activity self-efficacy, social support for physical activity, resistance training self-efficacy, resistance training outcome expectancy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 10-weeks and 6-months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) Physical self-perception will be assessed using the Physical Self-Perception Profile for adolescents (Fox and Corbin, 1989).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 10-weeks and 6-months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutrition behaviours will be assessed using items from the NSW Schools Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (SPANS)</outcome>

    <concealment>Four low socio-economic status (SES) secondary schools from the Hunter Region will be invited to participate in the study. Schools will be classified as low-SES based on the Priority Schools Program (PSP). The PSP was set up in 2006 by the NSW Department of Education &amp; Training. Additional funding, staffing and consultancy are provided through the PSP to targeted government schools that support students from communities with the highest concentrations of low SES families.

1) Initial contact - Schools that satisfy the criteria above will be initially contacted by letter. School principals will be sent letters inviting their school to participate in the study.

2) Recruitment â€“ Once schools have expressed interest in the project, the chief investigator (CI) will contact the schools and request an opportunity to present the research proposal to the physical education (PE) teaching staff. The PE staff will then be asked to identify students who they perceive to be low-active and/or not currently participating in organised sport or physical activity. Interested students will be provided with information and consent letters.
Once baseline data has been collected randomisation will occur at the school level.</concealment>
    <sequence>A simple randomisation method of coin tossing will be used to allocate schools to treatment conditions. This method ensures an equal chance of allocation to each group.</sequence>
