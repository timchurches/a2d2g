      <outcome>Frequency of adverse events as recorded on an Adverse Events Log. The expected adverse event profile of Hominax is a combination of adverse events reported for its components, namely: constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, headache, restlessness, stomach discomfort, loss of appetite, tremors, insomnia, shortness of breath, mild upper gastrointestinal tract infection, allergic reaction, irritability, heartburn, chest tightness, fatigue, paraesthesia, nosebleeds, decreased urine, rapid pulse, cough, heart palpitations, increased sweating. The expected rate for each of these adverse events is infrequent and the expected severity is mild to moderate. Hominax is considered relatively safe with no drug related serious adverse events expected at the prescribed dose.  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>We assume that the active treatment will improve concentration, morphology and motility simultaneously.  We set the lower limit of clinical significance of these improvements at 0.5 standard deviations; which we estimate to be simultaneous improvement in average concentration from 15 x106 to 20 x106, in morphology from 4% to 6% and in forward motility from 30% to 40%.  We assume 0.3 correlation between each of concentration, morphology and motility and 0.5 correlation between baseline and follow-up measures.  Morphology is scored between 0 to 100 per person indicating the proportion of sperm with healthy shape morphology. Similarly motility is scored between 0 and 100 per person indicating the proportion of sperm demonstrating good forward movement. Analysis will be conducted using multivariate methods (such as MANOVA).  In order to detect a clinically significant improvement in sperm quality with 80% power at the 0.05 significance level requires a total sample size of 98 completed participants which requires 122 randomised participants (61 per group) to allow for an estimated 20% withdrawal rate during the study.

Secondary analyses on single outcome variables will have 80% power to detect a 0.6 standard deviation greater improvement in the treatment group than the placebo.

Analyses of semen quality will be conducted using multivariate methods (such as MANOVA) and secondary analyses on individual outcomes will be conducted using the equivalent ANOVA. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a clinical trial examining the effectiveness of a vitamin supplement, Hominax, in improving sperm health in men with mild to moderate male factor infertility. We are testing whether Hominax is more effective than placebo (dummy) pills in improving sperm health. It is possible that Hominax can help prevent damage to sperm. Men with infertility will be allocated randomly to receive either Hominax or a placebo pill for 24 weeks. Sperm samples will be tested to look for a difference in sperm health between the two groups at the end of treatment. </summary>
