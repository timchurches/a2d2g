             alternatives of receiving the BVS Everolimus Eluting CSS and he/she or his/her legally
             authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any Clinical
             Investigation related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee of
             the respective clinical site.

          3. Patient must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia, positive functional study or a reversible change in the
             electrocardiogram (ECG) consistent with ischemia)

          4. Patient must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery

          5. Patient must agree to undergo all clinical investigation plan-required follow-up
             visits, angiograms, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), Palpography (optional), optical
             coherence tomography (OCT) (strongly recommended), multislice computed tomography
             (MSCT) (optional) and coronary vasomotion (optional)

          6. Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical investigation for a period
             of two years following the index procedure

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          1. Target lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with visually estimated
             nominal vessel diameter of 3.0 mm

          2. Target lesion(s) must measure = 14 mm in length by visual estimation

          3. Target lesion(s) must be in a major artery or branch with a visually estimated
             stenosis of = 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of = 1

          4. If two target lesions meet the inclusion criteria they must be in different major
             epicardial vessels left anterior descending artery (LAD) with septal and diagonal
             branches, left circumflex artery (LCX) with obtuse marginal and/or ramus intermedius
             branches and right coronary artery (RCA) and any of its branches

          5. If two target lesion(s) are being treated, each of these lesions must meet all
             angiographic inclusion/exclusion criteria

          6. Non-Clinical Investigation, percutaneous intervention for lesions in a non-target
             vessel is allowed if done = 90 days prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after
             the index procedure

          7. Non-Clinical Investigation percutaneous intervention for lesion in the target vessel
             is allowed if done &gt; 6 months prior to or if planned to be done 6 months after the

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          1. Target lesion(s) meets any of the following criteria:

               1. Aorto-ostial location (within 3 mm)

               2. Left main location

               3. Located within 2 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX

               4. Located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft or distal to a diseased
                  (defined as vessel irregularity per angiogram and &gt; 20% stenosed lesion, by
                  visual estimation) arterial or saphenous vein graft

               5. Lesion involving a bifurcation = 2 mm in diameter and ostial lesion &gt; 40%
                  stenosed by visual estimation or side branch requiring predilatation

               6. Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to wire crossing

               7. Excessive tortuosity proximal to or within the lesion

               8. Extreme angulation (= 90%) proximal to or within the lesion

               9. Heavy calcification

              10. Restenotic from previous intervention

          2. The target vessel contains visible thrombus

          3. Another clinically significant lesion is located in the same major epicardial vessel
             as the target lesion(s) (including side branches)

          4. Patient has a high probability that a procedure other than pre-dilatation and stenting
             and (if necessary) post-dilatation will be required at the time of index procedure for
             treatment of the target vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon or brachytherapy)</exclusivecriteria>
