  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) Improvement of =15 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly indicates improvement and a decrease in the number of letters read correctly indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 39/Final Visit</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average Change From Baseline in BCVA in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). The average BCVA is calculated across study visits for each patient. A positive number change from baseline indicates an improvement and a negative number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 39 Months</timepoint>

      <outcome>Percentage of Patients With a BCVA Improvement of =10 Letters From Baseline in the Study Eye - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters) in the study eye. The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity).

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Retinal Thickness as Measured by Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) - OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system that provides high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina from which retinal thickness can be measured. A negative number change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive number change from baseline indicates a worsening.</outcome>
