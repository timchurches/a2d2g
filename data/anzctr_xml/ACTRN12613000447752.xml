    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis is a mixed linear model incorporating a fixed effect for order of administration and random participant effect.  If there is no missing data, this is equivalent to a paired t test.  Further exploratory analyses will include using baseline PtCO2 as covariate.  
The sample size of 24 has 80% power, type I error rate 5%, to detect a difference of 2.4 mmHg. This is half the difference found in a study of participants with obesity hypoventilation syndrome which reported a mean (standard deviation) paired difference of 5 (4) mmHg.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Airvo device has been developed to deliver oxygen to patients. It is not known, however, how this method of delivery influences blood carbon dioxide levels. In some patients there is a chance of oxygen causing hypercapnia (elevation in blood carbon dioxide), this includes those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

To understand clinical utility and safety, it is crucial to determine how supplementary oxygen administered by the Airvo device influences carbon dioxide and compare this with similar oxygen concentrations delivered by nasal cannulae.
