  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two groups of emergency patients who require temperature measurement as a part of their clinical assessment will have a single set of temperature measurement taken upon arrival in the emergency department. The first group will be adults, 18 years and over, who will under go tympanic, temporal artery and oral temperature measurement.  The second group will be infants 3 months and younger who will have temporal artery, tympanic and rectal temperature measurement performed. Patients will be recruited over a year.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare temperature measurements of an adult and small infant population in the emergency department to determine which technique provides the best indicator for detection of fever. The aim is to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of tympanic and infrared skin thermometers compared to rectal temperature in infants and oral temperature in adults in the emergency department.  
The findings will aid in the development of a consistent, evidence based approach to temperature measurement in Frankston Hospital Emergency patients.</summary>
