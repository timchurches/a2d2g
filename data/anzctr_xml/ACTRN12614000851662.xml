  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (statin) indicated as an adjunct therapy to diet to:
Reduce the risk of MI and stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes without CHD, but with multiple risk factors. 

Reduce the risk of non-fatal MI, fatal and non-fatal stroke, revascularization procedures, hospitalization for CHF, and angina in patients with CHD. 

Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, apo B, and TG levels and increase HDL-C in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. 

Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and primary dysbetalipoproteinemia.

Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). 

Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, and apo B levels in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age, with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Test 1: Atorvastatin 80 mg coated tablets. 

Test 2: Atorvastatin 80 mg tablets. 

Treatment is with a single daily dose of 80 mg of Atorvastatin via oral administration. Three treatments (single dose), 3 periods (one day per period) and two-week washout between each period for the removal of the previous dose.
At least 72 hours before the time fixed for the study, the volunteer will receive in writing the appropriate citation where the place, date and time of the baseline is established. As the following notes for the week before the study: No Smoking (passively, as they are not smokers), not drink alcohol, do not consume xanthine beverages (cola, coffee, tea, chocolate, etc.) not consume grapefruit natural juice, not eating grilled food, do not use any other drug from the week before the study. Each volunteer will be welcomed by doctors and nursing staff involved in the study and they ask about the indications received 72 hours prior. They will be placed in facilities Ipharma SA de CV, will receive a light dinner (less than 800 kcal), low residue. You can drink water until 10:00 PM. Will rise at the time indicated by the staff in the clinical area and take a bath. A member of staff will move to room 1 and 2 as appropriate to randomization.
Each subject will be assigned to three experimental units EU, one for each trial period, so that 01 to 60 is for the period 1 (P1) and 61 to 120 at period 2 (P2) and 121 to 180 for the period 3 (P3). 

The staff of each experimental unit consists of nurses, doctors, staff quality area, support staff; as well as the principal investigator. 

Each subject will be placed a catheter (Inthracat or equivalent) in the vein of the elbow, they made the decision at time 0 and after this will be administered the drug orally under the supervision of physicians. 

After drug administration the blood samples were obtained at different times by the staff Ipharma, these will be recorded in the logs corresponding times, will be delivered to preparation laboratory of the Institute for registration, processing and storage. 

After about four hours after drug administration, volunteers will be provided fruit and 500 ml sports drink. From about 5 hours may drink water. 

After about 8 hours Administration medication, a light lunch will be provided to volunteers. 
After about 12 hours administration, they will provide a light dinner volunteers. 

After taking 24 hours corresponding sample were withdrawn venous catheter and volunteers remain another hour in the Institute. The proof of this first period will terminate after the last blood sample. 

The procedure will be similar for periods 2 and 3, with the only difference of treatment allocation, as appropriate to randomization. 

At the time of the study and throughout the sampling period will perform a general physical examination protocol including vital signs at the beginning, during and at the end of each period, allowing us to detect the most common adverse effects such as: hypersensitivity, rash, cardiopulmonary complications, etc.

Post-experimental phase 
All volunteers will be interviewed one week after the third period. These interviews will be questioned about possible side effects voluntary late onset. The information gathered will be recorded in their records.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation was made from the coefficient of variation intra-subject weighted equal to 40.27%. For the calculation was considered a type I or alpha error, maximum of 5% and a type II or beta, more than 20% errors, the latter implies a minimum power of 80% and an acceptance range for the confidence interval to 90 % geometric mean ratio test / reference least squares estimate for ABCs and Cmax parameters, addition to a design by William 3x6x3, 3 formulations, 6 sequences and 3 administration periods. 

For the above calculation the statistical package "PowerTOST" from R software was used.

Descriptive statistics of plasma concentrations. 
Procedure for data capture and R-Project WinNonlin program. The results of laboratory and clinical area will receive in progressive order. Will be presented and will graph the average plasma concentration and its standard error (raw and log-transformed data). 
Descriptive statistics of pharmacokinetic parameters to evaluate:
Area under curve from time zero to the last measurement (AUC0-t)
Area under curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-8)
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax)
Time to peak plasma concentration is reached (Tmax)
The pharmacokinetic parametersAUC0-t and AUC0-8 are estimated by the linear and log trapezoidal method with WinNonlin respectively, while Cmax and Tmax are obtained directly from the chromatographic analysis data. 
Averages, error or standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the estimated pharmacokinetic parameters are presented. 
Histograms of the ratios and logarithmic transformation of the test drug / reference pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-8 and Cmax are displayed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the present study the bioequivalence of three different drugs, the same type of pharmaceutical form at the same dose, containing the same drug (atorvastatin), but may have different excipients was evaluated. Compared if their plasma pharmacokinetic parameters, expressed as area under curve from time zero to the last measurement (AUC0-t); area under curve from time zero to infinity (AUC0-8); maximum plasma concentration (Cmax); and time to peak plasma concentration is reached (Tmax), have similarity to each other. 
In 60 healthy male non-smoking volunteers, bioequivalence of drugs R (reference), Test 1 (T1) and test 2 (T2) was evaluated through a design WILLSON 3 periods, 3 treatments and 6 sequences. 
The analysis of plasma levels of atorvastatin was performed by extracting the proteins and subsequent quantification by HPLC/MS-MS in a concentration range of: 0.5 to 100 ng/mL. 
The Atorvastatina/A95-10Bis study was conducted in a timely and manner required. 
Adverse effects: No adverse reactions occurred during, and after the end of the clinical protocol. 
Clinical protocol deviations: There were no clinical protocol deviations. 
Selection of subjects: All volunteers included in the study successfully met the criteria for selection and inclusion. 
It is established that drugs test T1 and T2 in the same substance atorvastatin, are bioequivalent.</summary>
