  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study, no intervention applied.
Measures will be taken at discharge from physiotherapy post stroke, 6, 12 &amp; 24 months post this time.
The measures that are being taken include:
- Physical activity: the participants will wear a Sense-wear activity monitor for 5-7 days at each assessment point. The Sensewear activity monitor will measure energy expenditure, number of steps, position and physical activity duration. Questions will also be asked regarding regular physical activity.
- Cardiovascular risk factors: seated blood pressure,  waist circumference, BMI &amp; brief questions about smoking, diet &amp; alcohol intake. Blood cholesterol &amp; blood glucose measures will be taken at baseline, 12 &amp; 24 months only.
- Physical mobility measures: 10 metre walk test, timed up &amp; go, 6 minute walk test &amp; functional ambulation category.
- Fatigue Severity Scale
- Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale
- Montreal Cognitive Assessment
- Self-Report Barthel Index</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate and track physical activity levels in the two years following discharge from physiotherapy after first ever stroke. 

Each participant will wear a Sense-wear activity monitor for 5-7 days to measure physical activity at each of the 4 assessment points (see below). Participants will also be asked questions regarding their regular physical activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post discharge from physiotherapy (baseline), 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post baseline assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate cardiovascular risk factors in the two years following discharge from physiotherapy after first ever stroke.

Cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed via standardised questions regarding smoking, alcohol and diet, seated blood pressure measurements, waist circumference and BMI measurements. Blood tests will also be taken in the week post assessment for measures of blood cholesterol &amp; blood glucose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post discharge from physiotherapy (baseline), 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post baseline assessment.
Please note blood tests will only be performed at baseline, 12 &amp; 24 months (ie not at the 6 month timepoint).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To discover which groups of stroke survivors are most vulnerable to reduced physical activity and physical mobility and may therefore be at an increased cardiovascular risk. 

Physical activity will be monitored via the Sense-wear activity monitors as described above.
Physical mobility will be assessed via simple clinical tests - the 10 metre walk test, the timed up &amp; go, the 6 minute walk test &amp; the functional ambulation categories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post discharge from physiotherapy (baseline), 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post baseline assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate physical mobility status via simple outcome measures in the year following discharge from rehabilitation after first ever stroke.

Physical mobility will be assessed via simple clinical tests - the 10 metre walk test, the timed up &amp; go, the 6 minute walk test &amp; the functional ambulation categories.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post discharge from physiotherapy (baseline), 6 months, 12 months and 24 months post baseline assessment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a major cause of disability in Australia, it affects over 50,000 people annually. Stroke survivors are at increased risk of health problems, particularly a second stroke. Many of the risk factors for a second stroke, such as smoking, poor diet and lack of physical activity could be reduced with increased awareness, education and support.

We plan to conduct a longitudinal study to investigate physical activity levels and cardiovascular risk factors in the 2 years following discharge from therapy after first ever stroke.  Participants will be reviewed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months following this. They will answer questions around their medical history and health status, complete questionnaires, have physical measurements taken (for example, blood pressure and walking tests) and be given activity monitors to wear for 5 days. At the baseline, 12 and 24 month assessments they will also be asked to have a blood sample taken within the following week.

We hope to identify relationships between physical activity, cardiovascular risk, physical function and fatigue levels. This study has not previously been undertaken and will provide essential information for clinicians, allowing them to target their interventions to specific risk factors and reduce risk of further stroke. If a link between physical activity and cardiovascular risk is demonstrated, a strong rationale will be provided for therapies that improve physical activity participation.
