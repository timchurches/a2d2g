    <interventions>Comparison of time taken to obtain results from urine and whole blood testing using point of care B-hCG testing cartridges, and blood samples sent to the lab for serum testing.
Blood drawn from the patient will be sent to the lab for testing as per our usual practice. The time taken to obtain a result since the patient's presentation to the Emergency Department will be calculated. Three drops from that sample drawn will be tested using the bedside BhCG test cartridge, and the time taken to obtain a result from that since the patient's presentation will be calculated. When the patient is able to provide a urine sample, the urine will be tested using the bedside BhCG test cartridge, and the time taken to obtain a result from that since the patient's presentation will be calculated. These times will then be compared to find which is the most efficient method to obtain a BhCG result, and if there is a difference depending on time of day of patient presentation.
Clinicians are likely to be aware of the results from the urine and whole blood point of care tests, but only the lab serum B-hCG result will be used to determine patient care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Urine and blood samples from each patient will be compared against each other for time taken to obtain results. The reference standard will be the time taken to obtain a result from a blood sample sent to the lab (serum BhCG result). The comparator tests will be whole blood tested on the point of care BhCG test cartridge, and urine tested on the point of care BhCG test cartridge.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size:
 n1 + n2 = (4o2 (Z 1-a/2 + Z 1-ß)2) / (µ1 - µ2)

o = sample mean = 130 mins (calculated based on an analysis of times taken to obtain results from whole blood sent to the lab for 50 sequential patients)
Z 1-a/2 = 1.96 for a = 0.05
Z 1-ß = 1.282 for Power = 1-ß = 0.9
µ1 - µ2 = difference to be detected = 15 mins

n1 + n2 = 630 --&gt;  n = number of observations to be done in each group
--&gt; 315 participants required as 2 observations for comparison will be done on each participant

This is the calculation for the comparison between times taken to get a result from whole blood being used on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge and the blood sample sent to the lab for a serum B-hCG result. At this stage, the times taken to obtain a urine result from patients is not clearly recorded, so it is not possible to calculate a sample mean. A post-hoc analysis will be done for the comparison between times taken to get a result from whole blood being used on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge and urine being used on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge to ensure that the sample size is adequate to power the study to detect a 15 minute difference.

Assuming a similar sample mean for time taken to obtain a urine BhCG result, 315 participants would be required to make that comparison as well.

--&gt; participants require for the study = 630

This is being done concurrently with a study to validate the sensitivity and specificity of whole blood being used on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge. 1098 patients will be recruited for the study.


Analysis:
A paired T-test will be done to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean times to results using each B-hCG testing method of greater than 15 minutes. The times to results using whole blood on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge will be compared with the times to results from whole blood samples sent to the lab for serum B-hCG testing. The times to results using whole blood on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge will be compared with times to results using urine on the point of care B-hCG test cartridge.

The results will also be divided into patient presentations by shift times (Day = 0800-1600,Evening = 1600-0000, Night = 0000-0800). A further analysis will be done to see if the efficiency of testing methods changes depending on the time of patient presentation.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the utility of the use of whole blood for point of care testing for B-hCG to rapidly differentiate pregnant and non-pregnant patients. This is important in time-critical conditions such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy. It would also expedite things in the situation where medical imaging involving ionising radiation is delayed until pregnancy can be excluded.
The current testing options are a urine point of care test, or a serum sample sent to the
pathology lab. The point of care test pack inserts state that whole blood cannot be used with them, but in practice they have been used that way and expedited decision-making. A convenience sample of female patients of reproductive age presenting to the Emergency Department who would typically have their pregnancy status checked, will be recruited to the study. A whole blood B-hCG (point of care), a urine B-hCG (point of care), and a serum sample for quantitative hCG will be tested.
The blood sample will be sent to pathology for a quantitative serum B-hCG result, and will be used as the standard for comparison. A result of &lt;1.2 units/L is a negative pregnancy test. The results from the urine and whole blood point of care tests will be compared against this, to determine their sensitivity and specificity in a separate analysis.
The time taken to obtain a result from the point of care B-hCG testing using urine and whole blood will be compared against the time taken to obtain a result from the sample sent to the lab. We will then be able to compare the differences between length of time taken to obtain a urine or blood sample, and the differences between length of time taken to obtain test results for each of these samples.</summary>
