  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a crossover study.  Subjects are required to perform: Visit 1 - One incremental cycle test (ICT) and two 6MWTs. Visit 2 - A ten-minute constant work rate (CWR) cycle exercise prescribed from the 6MWT and a ten-minute CWR walking exercise at 80% of average speed of the better 6MWT. Visit 3 - Two incremental shuttle walk tests (ISWT). Visit 4 - A ten-minute CWR cycle exercise prescribed from the ISWTs and a ten-minute CWR walking exercise at 70% of peak speed of the better ISWT. The duration of the wash-out period between exercise periods or exercise tests is 30 minutes. Each visit will be 2-3 days apart and all testing will be completed within 2 weeks. The order of exercise testing will not be randomised because  the intensities of the constant work rate (CWR) cycle and walking exercise periods need to be prescribed from the cycle and walking tests.</interventions>
    <comparator>A prospective cross-over study in which participants are involved in exercise testing and training as described above. No comparator / control is involved</comparator>
