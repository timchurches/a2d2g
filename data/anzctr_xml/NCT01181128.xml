    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Factor VIII (rFVIIIFc)
Treatment: drugs - Advate®

Experimental: Individualized (Tailored) Prophylaxis - On rFVIIIFc Day 0, all participants underwent pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc to estimate their PK parameters and guide the appropriate dose or interval of dosing. A subset of participants (Sequential PK subgroup) also had PK analyses performed with a single dose of 50 IU/kg Advate (Advate Day 0) within 8 weeks prior to rFVIIIFc Day 0. A &gt;= 96 hour washout was performed before the PK dose of Advate or rFVIIIFc was administered. Repeat PK profiling with a single dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was conducted at Week 14 or after 12 to 24 weeks of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc.
After PK assessments, all participants started twice weekly treatment with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via intravenous (IV) injection on Day 1 and 50 IU/kg on Day 4, followed by individualized dose and interval modification within the range of 25 to 65 IU/kg every 3 to 5 days, as determined by rFVIIIFc PK analysis, to maintain a trough level of 1% to 3% (or higher, as clinically indicated) FVIII activity.

Experimental: Weekly Prophylaxis - 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc via IV injection every 7 days

Experimental: Episodic (On-Demand) Dosing - 10 to 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc via IV injection, as required to treat a bleeding episode

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence Rate of FVIII Inhibitor Development - An inhibitor test result =0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/mL, identified and confirmed by re-testing of a second sample obtained within 2 to 4 weeks, was considered positive. Both tests were to be performed using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay by the central laboratory. The incidence rates along with the 95% confidence interval (CI) were summarized for all titers for subjects with 50 or more exposure days (EDs) to rFVIIIFc and a valid inhibitor test after the 50th exposure. In addition, the incidence rates for all subjects regardless of their exposure days to rFVIIIFc were also summarized. The 95% CI was calculated using Clopper-Pearson exact method.</outcome>

      <outcome>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Adults (Haem-A-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 14 - The Haem-A-QoL consists of items pertaining to 10 domains specific to living with hemophilia and was administered to adult participants (17 years and older). The 10 domains are: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, sports/leisure, school/work, dealing with hemophilia, and treatment (time frame for all 7 domains, during the last month) and future, family planning, and outlook for the future (time frame for all 3 domains, recently). Lower scores represent better QoL; therefore, a negative change from baseline represents improvement during the course of the study. Scores on a scale range between 0 and 100. Participants in Arm 1 were stratified by their prestudy regimen (either prophylaxis or on-demand).</outcome>

      <outcome>Hemophilia-Specific Quality of Life Index for Children (Haemo-QoL) Questionnaire: Change From Baseline to Week 14 and Week 28 in Haemo-QoL III Total Score - The Haemo-QoL III, a quality of life assessment instrument for adolescents with hemophilia, was administered to participants from 13 to 16 years old. This instrument assesses domains specific to living with hemophilia and consists of 12 domains: physical health, feeling, view of yourself, family, friends, others, sports and school, treatment, perceived support, dealing with hemophilia, future, and relationships. Total HAEMO-QoL score is the sum of all raw scores for all subscales for participants for whom at least the minimum number of required questions have been answered. Total scores are presented as the Transformed Scale Score (TSS) from 0-100%, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life. A negative change indicates improvement.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc
      administered as a prophylaxis (Arm 1), weekly (Arm 2), on-demand (Arm 3), and surgical
      treatment regimen; to evaluate the efficacy of the rFVIIIFc tailored prophylaxis regimen (Arm
      1); to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as an on-demand (Arm 3) and surgical
      treatment regimen. The secondary objectives of this study are: to characterize the PK profile
      of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, Advate®; to
      characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding in a
      prophylaxis regimen, maintain hemostasis in a surgical setting, or to treat bleeding episodes
      in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting.</summary>
