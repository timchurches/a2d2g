  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chiropractic manipulation of the neck will be administered to the experimental group with or without massage. Chiropractic manipulation will consist of gentle application of manual high velocity low amplitude thrust procedures commonly practised by chiropractors. Treatment will be delivered twice a week over a period of 8 weeks. All treatment sessions will take 30 minutes each. The decision to include or exclude massage will depend on the clinical judgement of the treating investigator in determining whether hypertonicity exists in the muscles of the neck.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be administered a sham manipulation procedure known as the Outcomes of Usual Chiropractic, Harm &amp; Efficacy (OUCH) protocol as previously published (1). Briefly, this will involve the application of the practitioners hands to the participants neck as well as detuned ultrasound and the "sham" thrust of an Activator TM instrument set at zero. These treatments will be given twice a week over a period of eight weeks. Each sham treatment session will take 30 minutes.

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis will be performed using SPSS software for Windows (version 20). Results are expressed as mean (95% confidence intervals) or median (range) where appropriate. Student's t-test and chi-squared analysis will be used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Factors effecting final DHI scores will be evaluated with ANCOVA. Participant's age and baseline values for the corresponding dependent varibles will serve as co-variates in these analyses. Since this is a feasibility study a sample size calculation is unnecessary. This study will act as a pilot for the larger RCT planned for a subsequent stage where 44 subjects will be needed per group for 90% power in detecting a 20% change in the primary outcome measure (DHI), also factoring in a 30% rate of drop-out. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary focus of this study is dizziness in the community dwelling elderly. Neck pain and dysfunction can cause dizziness and may be an important under-investigated risk factor for falls in the elderly. Neck manipulation is known to be effective for neck pain. There is also preliminary evidence that physical treatments administered to the neck (including manipulation) may improve dizziness. This study will use clinical rigorous research methods to determine whether chiropractic manipulation can be used to successfully treat dizziness, thereby lowering the likelihood of falls in the elderly. Falls in the elderly are a significant public health problem in need of new and innovative management strategies. </summary>
