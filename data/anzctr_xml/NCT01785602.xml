  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) - Investigators assessed presence and severity of erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification in four body areas: head/neck (H), upper limbs (UL), trunk (T), and lower limbs (LL). Investigators assigned a severity score from 0 - 3 for each area (none=0, mild=1, moderate=2, and severe=3). Investigators could assign half-points. Investigators also assigned an area score from 0 (no atopic dermatitis lesion in the area) to 6 (entire area is affected) for each area. The weighting factor was 0.1 for head/neck, 0.2 for upper limbs, 0.3 for trunk, and 0.4 for lower limbs. The total body score for each body region was obtained by multiplying the sum of the severity scores of the four key signs by the area score, then multiplying the result by the constant weighted value assigned to that body region. The sum of these scores gave the EASI total, ranging from 0 to 72. A higher score represented greater disease severity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
