  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. The primary complaint of pain is in the area between the 12th rib and buttock crease. This may, or may not, be accompanied by leg pain.
2. A new episode of low back pain, preceded by at least one month without low back pain.
3. The duration of current symptoms is less than 6 weeks. 
4. Average pain intensity equal or more than 3/10 on numeric rating scale (NRS) during the past week.
5. The duration of current symptoms is less than 6 weeks.
6. At-risk of developing chronic LBP (at-risk status will be determined using responses to seven questions: self-rated general health, presence of leg pain, previous episodes, compensation status, current pain intensity, depressive feelings and self-perceived risk of persistence).
7. Sufficient fluency in English language to understand and respond to English language questionnaires and to engage with the psychoeducative and sham interventions.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A primary care practitioner will identify potentially suitable participants during the the consolation for low back pain. After providing information on the study, and if the participant agrees, he/she will contact the study researcher by telephone or email with the patient contact details. The researcher will contact the participant by telephone within 24 hours to screen for inclusion in the study and to arrange an appointment at a mutually convenient time when the patient will read the Patient Information Sheet and sign the consent form. At this appointment, once the study researcher has obtained baseline data, the patient will be randomized. All participants will be reminded to continue with the care provided by their primary care clinician for their low back pain. The randomisation schedule will be used to create 202 consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes containing allocations.</concealment>
    <sequence>A researcher not involved in patient recruitment or data collection will create a randomisation schedule using randomisation software. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eighty percent of adults will suffer back pain at some time during their life. More than one in three will develop chronic back pain and cost Australia about $9 billion per year. We can now identify those who will develop chronic back pain early. This project will test a new method of treating these people who are risk of chronic back pain. We predict that our short and targeted intervention will stop these people from developing of chronic back pain and this will lead to massive savings to the Australian community</summary>
