  <interventions>
    <interventions>COMPOSE  intervention consists of sensorimotor training tasks with graded progression of difficulty (progressing from easy to more difficult discriminations) within each specific parameter in order to challenge the system and encourage neural plastic changes in interconnected networks. Parameters include motor parameters (distance, speed, and object size) and sensory parameters (surface hardness, surface texture and surface friction).  The intervention phase consists of 10 treatment sessions of COMPoSE intervention (each 1.5 hour) over a period of 3 weeks.  4 treatment sessions will be delivered in week 1 and 3 treatment sessions in week 2 and 3. Treatment will be provided by a physiotherapist at the Hunter Medical Research Institute, NSW Australia.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The participants will be included if: they are adults aged 18+ years, having a confirmed diagnosis of  stroke (haemorrhagic or ischaemic); 2) they have sufficient voluntary muscle contraction in the paretic upper limb to reach forward and generate the beginning of prehension; and they have either or both of 3) they have remaining upper limb movement deficit defined as being unable to pick up a 6mm ball bearing from the table top between index finger and thumb, and place it on a shelf 37 cm above table (item from Action research Arm test) or 4) they have somatosensory impairment in the upper limb identified by any of the following: the texture discrimination tests (Tactile Discrimination Test and Fabric Matching Test), limb position sense (Wrist Position Sense or  Test) and tactile object recognition (functional Tactile Object Recognition Test); 5) they have no obvious motor dyspraxia as assessed by ability to imitate a reaching movement with the non-paretic upper limb; 7) they are able, prior to the stroke, to use the paretic upper limb to lift a cup and drink from it; 8) able to follow a 1-stage command i.e. sufficient cognitive ability for interventions in this trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses:
Repeated measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) on raw scores and change score methods adjusting for baseline measures will be performed along with Bonferroni-Holm correction post-hoc analyses.

Sample size calculation:
A sample size of 16 participants will give 90% power to detect a difference of 8% for time of peak velocity (%)(9SDs),  1.02 sec for time of peak grasp aperture(sec) (0.85 SDs). 11.1 change score on the standardised somatosensory deficits (11SDs, 5% significance level).
The sample size needed for the trial was calculated a priori to ensure sufficient statistical power. The variance and effect size needed for kinematic parameters to calculate the number of patients was estimated from the results of a previous study on arm recovery after stroke (van Vliet and Sheridan, 2007). Standardised somatosensory deficits score will be calculated from the pooled results of the standardised Fabric Matching Test, Wrist Position Sense Test, Functional Tactile Object Recognition Test scores. The values for mean change and standard deviation of the standardised somatosensory deficits score will be adjusted based on results from a recent study (Carey, Macdonell, 2011).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>77% people demonstrate arm motor impairment following stroke, making everyday tasks like using a knife and fork, and doing up buttons, impossible for many. Around 67% of these people also experience impairment in their ability to sense touch and know where their limbs are in space. This project consists of training both movement and sensation with the aim of improving arm function for stroke survivors. This study will determine whether it is beneficial to deliberately do sensory and motor training together. If effective, the widespread implementation of COMPOSE training could potentially increase upper limb function of stroke participants worldwide, improving quality of life and capacity to to return to work, leisure and family roles. Participants will attend the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle for 4 sessions of measurements over 2 weeks, 10 sessions of treatment over 3 weeks, 1 measurement session immediately after the 3-weeks intervention and after 1-month. </summary>
