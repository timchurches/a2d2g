    <studytitle>Dietary Fats and Biomarkers of Human Health: Excess Saturated Fat or Lack of Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Second Chronic Study)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Would it be an excess of saturated fat in the diet or a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids the responsible for increased blood lipid levels? And what would be the effect of the background diet in healthy adults consuming adequate omega-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be asked to consume 4x1g fish oil capsules (2.4g EPA:DHA 100:500) daily for 4 weeks; then they will be randomly assigned to one of two diets, either a high saturated fat (SFA) diet or a high n-6PUFA diet, both combined with n-3PUFA (fish oil), which they will consume for 10 days. Subjects on the saturated fat diet will consume daily 24g butter (which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), 40g white chocolate and 4x1g fish oil capsules; they will also be advised on how to use more foods containing saturated fat for cooking and reduce n-6PUFA containing oils. The patients will donate blood, give information on medical and supplement usage and physical activity and they will have their anthropometric measurements taken, at baseline, at 4 weeks and after 10 days of consuming the SFA diet. Subjects will also complete a 3 day food record, at baseline, at 4 weeks and after 10 days of consuming the SFA diet.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
This study aims to demonstrate that total cholesterol in group A (saturated fat) is not higher than group B (n-6 PUFA). Dietary fat manipulation (saturated vs n-6PUFA) increases plasma total cholesterol by 15% (0.64 mmol/L) within 8 days [1]. Therefore, assuming SD=0.76 mmol/L, 22 subjects per group will provide 80% power to demonstrate that group A does not have higher total cholesterol (i.e non-inferior) than group B (a= 0.05). Allowing for 15% dropouts, n=51.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Consumption of foods rich in saturated fats have been associated with elevated blood lipid levels and adverse health effects. However studies using animal models have demonstrated that dietary saturated fats raise blood lipid (cholesterol and triglyceride) levels only when the diet is deficient in omega-3 fatty acids (n-3PUFA). If the same is true for humans, this research will have important implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases. Therefore we hypothesize that saturated fat consumption does not raise blood lipid levels if the diet is sufficient in n-3PUFA. We also hypothesize that the benefits of n-3PUFA can be optimized when consumed in combination with saturated fats. This is a randomized controlled, dietary intervention trial, in parallel design with healthy adults. Subjects will be asked to consume 4x1g fish oil capsules (2.4g EPA:DHA 100:500) daily for 4 weeks, then they will be randomly assigned to one of two diets, a high saturated fat (SFA) diet or a high omega-6 fatty acid (n-6PUFA) diet both combined with n-3PUFA (fish oil), which they will consume for 10 days. Subjects on the SFA diet will consume daily 24g butter (which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), 40g white chocolate and 4x1g fish oil capsules, they will also be advised on how to use more foods containing saturated fat for cooking and reduce n-6PUFA containing oils. Subjects on the n-6PUFA diet will consume 20g margarine (which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), 42g sunflower seeds and 4x1g fish oil capsules, they will also be advised on how to use more foods and oils containing n-6PUFA for cooking, and reduce saturated fat. Participants will donate blood, give information on medical and supplement usage and physical activity and they will have their anthropometric measurements taken, at baseline, at 4 weeks and after 10 day of consuming either the SFA diet or the n-6PUFA diet. Subjects will also complete a 3 day food record.</summary>
