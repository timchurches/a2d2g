  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete a self-administered baseline questionnaire presented as a secure web-based application on a mobile small screen tablet, unassisted, in the general practice waiting room and receive general prevention information on melanoma- this will include information on what is melanoma, melanoma risk factors, primary and secondary prevention measures, and how to balance sun protection with the vitamin D levels. We anticipate the questionnaire will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Additionally, intervention group participants will receive personalised melanoma risk information and prevention recommendations based on their risk levels. The personalised melanoma risk information and prevention recommendations will be based on the participant's self-assessed melanoma risk factors from the baseline questionnaire, and presented to the participant on the secure web-based application on a mobile small screen tablet which will also be printed out. </interventions>

Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SAS statistical software with a two-sided significance level set to 0.05. 

We anticipate participation and repeat participation of 75%. Based on previous studies, where the standard deviation for their composite sun protection score (which includes information on seeking shade, sunscreen use, wearing sunglasses, wearing a hat and protective clothing) was 2.50 and the annual prevalence of clinical skin examination in the general population was 20%, the 196 of 265 enrolled participants who complete the follow up questionnaire would allow us to detect an average difference of 1.00 in the composite sun protection score and 20% in skin examination (each with 5% significance and 80% power).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess if melanoma prevention behaviours can be improved by providing individuals with personalised melanoma risk information and prevention recommendations based on their level of risk.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have the capacity to give informed consent in English.

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in both groups will receive general prevention information on melanoma. One group will then additionally receive personalised melanoma risk information and prevention recommendations based on their risk levels. Risk levels will be based on self-assessed melanoma information.

Participants will be assessed on melanoma risk perceptions, melanoma risk reduction intentions and melanoma prevention behaviours 6 and 12 weeks after the intervention by follow up questionnaire.

This research will help determine if providing individual melanoma risk information improves melanoma prevention behaviours in healthy adults.
