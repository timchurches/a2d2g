  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be provided with a one-on-one training session  at the National Cancer Institute, Cairo, Egypt that will include a discussion of each participant's belief in his or her ability to be physically active and physical activity preferences. These sessions will be supervised by physiotherapists. Participant will undertake a 12 week physical activity program that will be tailored to suit the ability of each participant. The exercise program will be guided by Exercise Guidelines for Cancer of the American College of Sports Medicine.The general program that will be individualised for each participant will include three sessions per week, each session 30 minutes. Each session will involve aerobic exercise, balance and flexibility exercises. Balanced exercises as standing on one foot and flexibility exercises as shoulder and upper arm stretch and yoga. The aerobic exercise will include different modes of training ( walking, cross training, jogging and cycling) for 20-30 minutes, of an intensity of 40%-70% of predicted heart maximum rates or 8-13 on the 15-point Borg's scale for rating of perceived of exertion. It is unexpected that cancer cachexia patients will be able to do jogging or cycling but every patient will have individualised modes of training according to their ability. All the program will be under direct supervision of physiotherapist so we will be able to monitor adherence to the intervention.</interventions>
