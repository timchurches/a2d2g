  <interventions>
    <interventions>Acute tryptophan depletion through the ingestion of a amino acid mixture without triptophan (100g), which stimulates the liver to produce proteins and leads to competition to cross the blood-brain barrier. This mixture is administered only twice: in the morning of the test day and in the morning of the control day (both at 9.30 a.m.). The mixture was orally administered.
Its effects are rapidly reversed with reinstatement of the normal alimentation so the week between test and control procedures functions as wash-out period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Amino acid mixture with L-alanine (5.5g); L-arginine (4.9g); L-cysteine HCl H2O (3.91g); Glycine (3.2g); L-histidine (3.2g); L-isoleucine (8.0g); L-leucine (13.5g); L-lysine HCL	(11.0g); L-methionine (3.0g); L-phenylalanine (5.7g); L-proline (12.2g); L-serine (6.9g); L-threonine (6.5g); L-tyrosine (6.9g); L-valine (8.9g); [total: 100g]. 

The same mixture as applied in the intervention day [100g] plus L-tryptophan 2.3g function as placebo as it does not leads to depletion.

Both mixtures are administered per mouth in the morning of the test day (100g) and in the morning of the placebo day (100g + 2.3g of tryptophan). Both mixtures are administered only once a day at 9.30 a.m.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual analogue scales anchored to the following terms (in Portuguese): Suffering caused by traumatic memories, as tough the event was reoccurring , out of your body, emotionally numb, anger, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, startle, palpitations, guilt, helplessness, sadness, similar to what you used to feel before treatment</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline (9.00 a.m.) and after the administration of the drug at 11.00 a.m., 1.30 p.m., 2.50 p.m., 3.00 p.m., and 4.00</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Davidson trauma scale (state version). In the state version we exclude the itens that measure "distressing dreams", "going into situations which reminds the event" and "trouble falling asleep". Patients only have to score the severity for what they are feeling "right now" and the total score is used to measure the symptoms.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first-line treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder but their mechanism of action is unclear. Though an effect on stress resilience is postulated Serotonin helps regulate stress responses in other anxiety disorders. The main objective of this study is to examine the role of serotonin in resilience to trauma-related exposure through tryptophan depletion paradigm. Our main hypothesis hypothesis is that exposure to trauma-related stimuli leads to greater subjective and physiological responses under acute tryptophan depletion than under control conditions.</summary>
