  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be allocated one type of urea based moisturiser sufficient for the duration of study, with the brand name of the moisturiser concealed for single-blinding purposes. Participants will be instructed to apply moisturisers to both feet once daily after washing their feet with lukewarm water, such as after a bath/shower. 
Participants will also be required to complete an application diary for each moisturiser application, recording what day they applied the moisturiser and any concerns they have with it. 
The Xerosis status of participants will be assessed during the first consultation and subsequently at 4 weeks intervals for total duration of 8 weeks.

There will be 3 treatment groups. Each group will receive one of the following moisturizers: Dot Heel Repair Balm (10%) (Registered Trademark), Walkers 15% Urea foot cream (Registered Trademark) or Walkers 25% Urea foot cream (Registered Trademark). Each moisturizer has a different concentration of urea, prompting us to evaluate and compare the clinical effectiveness between each. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different commercially available moisturizer in managing xerosis, a common skin condition in general population.  These moisturizes will include different concentrations of urea and will be tested in the general population. Through the use of validated measurement tools, which include the Xerosis Assessment Scale (XAS) and Specific Symptom Sum Score (SRRC) we will be able to measure the efficacy of each moisturizer. Other areas of further interest and secondary outcomes to the project include evaluating the associated side effects, cost, ease of use and the overall patient satisfaction with each moisturizer.</summary>
