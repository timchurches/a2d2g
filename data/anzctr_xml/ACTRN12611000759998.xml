  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive an Edwards Lifesciences silicone double lumen 13.5F short-term dialysis catheter (STDC) (manufactured by Medical Components, Harleysville, PA, USA). The Edwards Lifesciences STDC is designed with a proximal return lumen and three return side ports lying within 3 cm of the proximal tip. There are four arterial side ports that lie within 3.5cm and 6 cm distal of the proximal end. 
In this study, patients will be randomized to receive either a shorter length STDC [15 cm if placed through the right great thoracic vein(GTV) and 20cm if placed through the left GTV] aiming at placing the tip of the STDC in the SVC or a longer length STDC [20 cm if placed in the right GTV and 24cm if placed in the left GTV] aiming at placing the tip of the STDC in the proximal right atrium (RA). The full length of the STDC will be placed inside the GTV by securing the hub of the STDC against the skin at the insertion site. Because the STDCs are labelled clearly with its length at the distal hub of the catheters it was impossible to blind treating clinicians in this study. Other than the length and depth of the STDC placement, the treating physicians were responsible for all other aspects of the continuos renal replacement therapy [CRRT] and clinical care, including when to initiate and cease CRRT, escalation of anticoagulation during CRRT including the use of systemic anticoagulation or citrate dialysis if dialyzer lifespan was judged to be unacceptably short, and whether a change in STDC was necessary due to vascular access problem or catheter-related infection. Dialysis data will be collected from the bedside nursing chart for the duration  of the CRRT (if less than 10 days) or until a maximum of 10 days after the initiation of CRRT. Dialysis data was no longer collected if the patient meet one of the exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria include the use of systematic anticoagulation or citrate dialysis, the placement of the STDC in the femoral vein or requirement of a tunnelled long-term dialysis catheter. Patients requiring a change in STDC due to suspected catheter-related infection or vascular access problem would receive a STDC with its proximal tip targeted at the same position according to their initial randomization status and remain in the study until they reach an above endpoint. Therefore some patients will require more than one intervention. Data about complications from placing the STDC will be collected for the duration that the STDC remains insitu regardless of whether the patient is receiving CRRT, intermittent haemodialysis or no renal replacement therapy. All patients receive a portable CXR following the insertion of a STDC. Two thoracic radiologists, who are blinded to the randomization status of the patients, will reported the position of the proximal tip of each patient and this report was not available to the treating physicians.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A well functioning short-term dialysis catheter (STDC) is of paramount importance in establishing a sufficient, reliable blood flow necessary for the delivery of adequate dialysis during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The optimal position for the proximal opening of a STDC in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is not well studied and remains controversial. Placing the proximal tip of a STDC in right atrium (RA) may improve blood flow through the STDC and CRRT circuit by reducing the impedance caused by collapsing great thoracic vein (GTV) vessel walls against the STDC when placing the tip of the catheter in the superior vena cava (SVC). Improving blood flow through the CRRT circuit may, in turn, improve dialyser lifespan, dialysis dose delivery, reduced blood loss and thus reduce the costs and nursing workload from setting up of new CRRT circuits. 
At the centre of this debate is the safety of positioning the proximal tip of a STDC in the RA. When utilizing the GTV, either internal jugular or subclavian vein, for central vascular access, traditional teaching is to avoid placing the tip of the central venous catheter (CVC) in the RA to reduce the risk of atrial arrhythmia, RA wall perforation and cardiac tamponade. Recent evidence, however, suggests that it is the techniques of CVC insertion that are more important than the position of the tip of the CVC in determining the subsequent risk of atrial perforation and cardiac tamponade. Furthermore, it is common practice for long-term tunnelled dialysis catheters to be placed in the RA for improved flow with reports of atrial perforation and cardiac tamponade from such practices being exceeding rare. We hypothesized that placing a soft silicone STDC in the RA is safe, may prolong dialyser circuit lifespan, and improve dialysis intensity delivery of CRRT when compared to placing the proximal tip of the STDC within the SVC in critically ill patients with AKI requiring CRRT.</summary>
