    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The Stage 1 portion of the study utilizes a 3:1 ratio assignment between active and placebo at each dose level in sequential cohorts . The Stage 2 portion of the study utilizes a sample of 42 normal subjects randomly assigned to 4 treatment groups (Itolizumab NS0 IV, Itolizumab (Bmab 600) IV, Itolizumab (Bmab 600) SC and placebo in a 2:2:2:1 ratio). Twelve subjects per active treatment group should be adequate to study comparative PK of the IV formulations. It is expected that the Bmab 600 SC will demonstrate between 50 and 70% absolute bioavailability with low CV based on historical data. 

No statistical assumptions were used to support the sample size calculations. The sample size of 8 subjects per cohort in stage I of the study is based on the standard practice followed in first in human dose escalation studies. The sample size for stage II is empirically chosen to compare pharmacokinetics between two products. A sample size of 12 subjects per group is conventionally regarded as acceptable for pilot studies comparing pharmacokinetics between two formulations. The statement It is expected that the Bmab 600 SC will demonstrate between 50 and 70% absolute bioavailability with low CV based on historical data is referring to the PK data obtained from IV administration of Itolizumab NS0 to patients. This statement is included to explain that we dont expect a very high CV hence the conventional sample size of 12 subjects should be enough to obtain meaningful data on comparative pharmacokinetics. 

Adverse events will be summarized overall, by severity, and by relationship to study drug.
All evaluable subjects completing the study will be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacokinetic parameters for Itolizumab plasma concentration will be calculated using non-compartmental analysis.
Comparison of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters for the two formulations be performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and the two one-sided t-tests procedure. 
Bioavailability of Itolizumab (Bmab 600) SC will be determined by comparing exposure with that of Itolizumab (Bmab 600) administered intravenously. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What is this study about? Biocon Research Limited (India) is developing itolizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody which is aimed at modifying disease course of various auto-immune diseases. The aim of this study is to study the safety and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of Itolizumab (Bmab 600) given subcutaneously and also compare the PK of two formulations of itolizumab given intravenously and subcutaneously and determine the absolute bioavailability of Bmab 600 given subcutaneously..
Who is this study for? This study is for healthy volunteers aged between 18 and 50 years and Body Mass Index between 18-30 kg/m2.
What is involved? The study has 2 Stages. Stage 1 will investigate the safety and tolerability of Bmab-600, when administered to healthy volunteers as a subcutaneous injection. That is to find out how it makes people feel and whether there are any side effects or changes to laboratory results. 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of single, ascending doses of Bmab-600 will also be investigated. Pharmacokinetics is a science that looks at how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and then removes the study product from the body. This will be done by analysing the levels of Bmab-600 that are present in blood at various times following each dose. It will also evaluate whether there are any effects on immune system.
Stage two will compare the two formulations of itolizumab  It will investigate if these formulations are processed by the body in the same way, and if they have the same effect.
There will be a screening visit which could be up to 28 days before the dosing day and a 3 day confinement period at the study centre. After that, there will be approximately 9 out patient clinic visits. Individual participation in the study will be up to 16 weeks.</summary>
