    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - LDE225
Treatment: drugs - TMZ

Experimental: Sonidegib (LDE225) - 600 mg orally for adults and 500 mg/m2 orally for children

Active Comparator: Temozolamide (TMZ) - 150 to 200 mg/m2 for 5 sequential days every 4 weeks according to prescribing information until the study was amended to a single arm study.
