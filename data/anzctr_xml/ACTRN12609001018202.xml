  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is primarily designed to assess the safety of two different doses of allogeneic Mesenchymal Precursor Cells (MPCs) combined with Hyaluronan when injected into the knee joint following Anterior Cruciate Ligament reconstruction. Long term safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single injection of two different doses of allogeneic MPCs + Hyaluronan compared to Hyaluronan alone will be assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months following MPC injection. This study aims to provide prelimanary data to support dose selection for future studies.</summary>
