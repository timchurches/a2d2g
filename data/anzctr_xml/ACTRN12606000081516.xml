    <interventions>The proposed pilot study will evaluate the effect of a prescribed aerobic exercise intervention program on levels of physical fitness, body weight, cognitive ability and quality of life among children and adolescents who have suffered from moderate and severe traumatic brain injury. The program will last for 12 weeks with 2 sessions per week according to the requirement for significant effects which have been reported in the literature</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognition/attention.

Outcome measures have been selected to assess impairment, activity and participation according to the WHO international classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO, 2001). Instruments used in these assessments are all validated and standardised clinical tools that are commonly used in clinical practice.
Changes to cognition, behaviour and attention will be assessed by the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF, Gioia et al, 2000). The BRIEF inventory is a multidimensional questionnaire specifically designed for assessing the behaviour and cognitive status, particularly executive functions, of children and adolescents aged between 5 and 18 years. This is a fully validated and standardised instrument, and is used as standard practice for the assessment of children with TBI in the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine CHW.</outcome>

Instruments used in these assessments are all validated and standardised clinical tools that are commonly used in clinical practice.
Functional status (ie ability to complete activities of daily living such as dressing, toileting, feeding) will be measured using the WeeFIM System (UDS MR, 1998) which is designed as a functional assessment for children and adolescents with acquired and congenital disability (UDS MR. 1998). </outcome>

Instruments used in these assessments are all validated and standardised clinical tools that are commonly used in clinical practice.
Mobility will be assessed using a 6-minute walking and the 10 metre velocity tests which are current practice in the Rehab Department. </outcome>

      <outcome>General quality of life.
Outcome measures have been selected to assess impairment, activity and participation according to the WHO international classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (WHO, 2001). Instruments used in these assessments are all validated and standardised clinical tools that are commonly used in clinical practice.
The health specific (but not condition specific) quality of life of patients will also be assessed by using the Child Health QuestionnaireParent Report (CHQ-PF50, Landgraf, &amp; Ware, 1996). In terms of the general state of physical fatigue, there is no assessment instrument currently available.</outcome>
