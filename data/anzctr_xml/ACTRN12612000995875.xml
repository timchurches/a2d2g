  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to assess the health and functional outcomes at 26-27 years of a large cohort of New Zealand babies born with very low birthweight (&lt;1500g) in1986 and included in a prospective study. Very low birthweight babies account for nearly 2% of all births but 75% of neonatal intensive care unit workload. Although no NZ data exist, overseas studies suggest such young adults have increased risks of physical and health problems, educational underachievement and poorer social functioning than their peers. The group was last assessed at age 7- 8 years. We have now retraced 250 young adult survivors (77% of the group) and will bring them to Christchurch for two days of medical and psychological evaluations. A comparison group of 100 full term adults of the same age will also be assessed. Findings will inform health, education and social policies concerning very preterm survivors as well as future newborn care.</summary>
