  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study intervention will be commenced immediately after randomisation and within 72 hours (cohort R1) or between 30 +/- 2 days (cohort R2) after commencement of therapeutic anticoagulation according to initial consent and election for treatment.
Standard of care anticoagulant therapy is low molecular weight heparin of choice injected subcutaneously (protocol recommends dalteparin 200 IU /kg once daily as per Product Information) . The study intervention will be Rivaroxaban 15mg twice daily per oral for 3 weeks and then 20mg once daily thereafter.
Rivaroxaban: oral tablet
Duration of administration: 6 months
monitor adherence: clinic review
Cohort R1 refers to patients who are randomised to oral rivaroxaban or standard of care within 72 hours of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. 
Cohort R2 refers the patients who are randomised to oral tablet rivaroxaban or standard of care at timepoint 30 days +/- 2 days of diagnosis of venous thromboembolism.. </interventions>
    <comparator>The standard of care anticoagulation in this study is with LMWH. The best evaluated regimen is as published in the CLOT in Cancer with dalteparin (Fragmin) 200IU/kg given subcutaneously once daily (to a maximum dose of 18.000 IU per day) with a dose reduction to 150 IU/kg after 30 days. Enoxaparin either 1mg/kg twice daily with dose reduction to 1.5 mg/kg once daily after 30 days also acceptable. LMWH schedules will be adjusted for renal impairment.
Low molecular weight heparin is administered by subcutaneous injection as per usual standard of care. 

The determination whether each participant will receive dalteparin or enoxaparin and the dose received will be at the discretion of the treating physician.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint of the study is the combined endpoint of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and major (including fatal) bleeding. The definitions of these outcomes are stated in protocol and are diagnosed by the treating physician with corroboration from medical records. An independent outcome adjudication committee will verify all reported major bleeding events and a random selection (~10%) of CRNMB.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary endpoint will be evaluated at 6 months post randomisation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints include CRNMB major bleeding and fatal bleeding assessed individually and combined at 3 weeks.
Major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be assessed using the standard ISTH (International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis) bleeding assessment tool. Fatal bleeding is defined by death related to bleeding according to treating clinician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints include CRNMB major bleeding and fatal bleeding assessed individually and combined at 3 months, 
Major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding will be assessed using the standard ISTH (International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis) bleeding assessment tool.  Fatal bleeding is defined by death related to bleeding according to treating clinician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 Months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints include CRNMB major bleeding and fatal bleeding assessed individually and combined at 6 months (note this includes a combined endpoint of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months as a cumulative total) , </outcome>
      <timepoint>6 month post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All cause mortality. 
If patients do not attend planned 6 month followup, a phone call will be made to the family and a check of medical records will be instituted to determine if patient has died. 
Treating physician will also be notified by palliative care units if patient dies in palliative care. </outcome>
      <timepoint> at 6 months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other vascular events (protocol states this includes myocardial infarction, stroke, other vascular thromboembolism). 
Myocardial infarction will be defined by standard changes on ECG (electrocardiogram) associated with significant rise in blood troponin levels. 
Stroke will be defined as sudden onset neurological deficit with or without evidence of changes on non-contrast CT brain scan or brain MRI scan. 
Other vascular thromboembolism will be defined as clinical diagnosis of any other organ damage (non heart, non-brain) attributable to blood clot. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint> at 6 months post randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptomatic and objectively confirmed recurrent vein thrombosis (either deep vein thrombosis at any site or pulmonary embolism). 
Deep vein thrombosis will be confirmed using doppler ultrasound. 
Pulmonary embolism will be confirmed using either ventilation/perfusion scan or CT pulmonary angiogram. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At 6 months after randomisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety of rivaroxaban for the treatment of thrombosis associated with cancer, in comparison to the standard care treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have active cancer and require therapeutic anticoagulation for a new diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  The duration of anticoagulant treatment should be for at least 6 months. 

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either treatment with rivaroxaban or treatment as per standard care with LMWH for at least 6 months. Patients can either be enrolled within 72 hours of diagnosis, or at day 30 +/- 2 days. Participants will be assessed six months later for side effects of treatment, including any bleeding which has occurred.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether rivaroxaban is a safe alternative to LMWH for the treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis.</summary>
