    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of a single dose of IVIb administered over 5-7 minutes by doing blood analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Predose, Immediately after
completion of the intravenous Clinical Trial Material (CTM) administration then at Hours 0.25,

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of IVIb by assessing the
frequency, severity and duration of treatment-emergent adverse events,
including those related to the infusion site, in healthy adult participants who received a single dose of IVIb and oral placebo administration given concurrently as compared to a crossover oral ibuprofen and intravenous placebo administration. This will be done by frequently asking the volunteer non leading questions regarding there well-being, also visual observation looking for volunteer deteriation.
Adevrse Events iexamples: swelling and redness at infusion site, nausea and headache.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Predose, Immediately after
completion of the intravenous CTM administration then at Hours 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours after treatment.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research study is being conducted for the pharmaceutical company Cumberland
Pharmaceuticals Inc. You are being asked to take part in this research study because we want to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (the way the body absorbs the drug) of a single dose of ibuprofen administered intravenously (in the vein) over 5-7 minutes.
A screening procedure will determine if you are eligible to enter the study. If you are
accepted, you will be required to attend the study centre for 2 treatment visits.
When you return to the research center, you will be randomised into one of two treatment sequences. Randomised means you will be assigned to a group by chance. The two treatment sequences in this study are:
Sequence A: A single dose of intravenous ibuprofen (IVIb) and an oral (capsule) placebo (starch filled capsule) given concurrently on Day 1 of the Treatment Period followed by a single dose of oral ibuprofen (capsule) and intravenous (IV) placebo (saline solution) given concurrently on Day 8 of the Treatment Period. Day 2-7will be a washout period. During the
washout period no study drugs or study tests will be done.
Sequence B: A single dose of oral ibuprofen and intravenous (IV) placebo given concurrently on Day 1 of the Treatment Period followed by a single dose of intravenous ibuprofen (IVIb) and oral placebo given concurrently on Day 8 of the Treatment Period.
Blood samples will be collected in treatment visits 1 and 2 (16 samples per visit) by either cannula (small plastic tube inserted into a vein in your arm) or venipuncture. Approximately a total of 222 mL of blood will be collected during the study, which includes the amount required for the clinical laboratory tests and for the measurement of Ibuprofen in your blood.</summary>
