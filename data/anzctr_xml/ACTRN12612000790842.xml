  <interventions>
    <interventions>SayWhen is a source of information, advice, brief intervention and referral options. The aim of the intervention is to reduce risky drinking. The site is self-guided with no interaction or assistance. Cognitive behavioural strategies are promoted to encourage healthy decisions around drinking. The site provides an opportunity to track drinking and encourages users to record and monitor their alcohol use. We recommend that participants access the site once per week with access to the website available for 3 months</interventions>
    <comparator>Internet-based alcohol information providing brief overview of 'what is low risk drinking', 'what is a standard drink' and links for further information. This is a separate website from the intervention condition. Participants are able to read through the information for a length time at their discretion.  They are able to access the information with as much or as little frequency as they choose and we recommend that the access the site on the first occasion.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Identifying alcohol misuse early and delivering simple advice can be effective in moderating peoples drinking patterns and related harms such as injury. The evidence indicates that for every eight people who receive advice, one will reduce their drinking to low risk levels. The internet is becoming an increasingly recognised tool for delivering self-help materials. The project seeks to evaluate change in alcohol use and injury (self-reported) after participation in an internet delivered program compared with an information only control condition.</summary>
