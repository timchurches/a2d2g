    <interventions>Psychological intervention based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).
a) ACT is a behavour therapy that involves 6 core process: Defusion, acceptance, contact with present moment, self as context, values identification and committed action. Act focuses on helping clients to accept unpleasant thoughts and feelings when doing so promotes valued living. It incorporates visual metaphors and experiential role plays suggesting it maybe modifiable for use with a cognitively impaired population.
b) Sessions will be undertaken weekly for 2 hours for a period of 6 weeks with a 7th session after a month (7 sessions in total)
c) Duration of the intervention will therefore be 10 weeks
d) Treatment will be administered by a clinical psychologist experienced in both ACT and traumatic brain injury (TBI) to groups of 2 clients.

    <comparator>Befriending protocol 
a) Befriending provides a non therapeutic active control that provides social support and combats isolation. It has been developed to provide the clients with approximately teh same amount of therapist contact as the active treatment. The therapist is empathic and non directive and sessions focus on neutral topics such as hobbies, sports and current affairs. Befriending aims to control for the following empirically supported factors: Time, client expectancy, therapeutic or working alliance and therapist factors (such as warmth, understanding) without employing any techniques specific to major models of psychotherapy.
b) Duration will be the same as teh active treatment that is 2 hours per week for 6 sessions with a 2 hour follow up after one month for session 7. 
c) Overall duration will be 10 weeks
d) Undertaken by a clinical psychologist (the same as the active treatment) in groups of 2 clients
e) Content of the sessions will be directed by the participants interests and will include learning a card game, discussing a movie or sport or current affairs, going to a coffee shop for example. The content of the sessions will be generated in the first session from a list of suggestions and by brainstorming with the participants.
f) no additional homework tasks will be given
After the befriending protocol has completed, participants will be offered individual treatment by the clinical psychologist at the brain injury unit.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinically significant levels of emotional distress and behavioural avoidance are quite frequent after a traumatic brain injury. Interventions with a traumatic brain injured (TBI) population have demonstrated general benefits of group programmes in addressing some of these issues but to date, programs have utilised cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a treatment protocol. At this time, there appears to be no published studies using acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with a TBI population. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is one of the third wave of behavioural therapies. It aims to change our relationship with internal experiences (thoughts, feelings, memories and physical sensations) so they no longer act as barriers to valued behaviour. The aim of the study is to implement a psychological treatment program to improve psychologically functioning following a traumatic brain injury utilising Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). With improved psychological functioning it is anticipated that participants will increase their participation in rehabilitation and movement towards a more valued life.

The study will be a randomised controlled group treatment programme. Clients of the brain injury rehabilitation unit demonstrating clinically significantly levels of psychological distress will be randomly allocated to either the treatment group or the control group (consisting of an active control based on Befriending protocol). It is anticipated that the treatment will be offered over a two year period. The intervention will consist of six by two hour group treatment sessions offered weekly at the brain injury unit with a one month follow up session. Content of the sessions will be based on ACT theory including identification of values, defusing techniques, self as context and mindfulness. Testing will be undertaken prior to the commencement of treatment and after the one month follow up with brief measures being undertaken weekly at the beginning and conclusion of each treatment sessions relating to motivation and capacity to complete homework tasks. Demographic information will be collected and elicited from the existing brain injury unit database. Participants on the wait list control will be given the opportunity to participate in the intervention after the second outcome measures are undertaken.

De-identified data form the outcome measures will be analysed statistically for changes pre and post intervention. De-identified demographic and medical information will provide descriptive data about the participants. Attendance at other therapy appointments in the brain injury unit will be reviewed to measure level of participation.</summary>
