    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the difference between the two treatment arms in mean urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) at the end of the treatment period of 48 weeks, adjusted for baseline UACR. 
Baseline UACR is defined as the geometric mean of 4 UACRs, which consist of the 2 consecutive daily first void UACR values at Visit 2 (2 weeks before randomisation) and the 2 consecutive daily first void UACR values at Visit 3 (randomisation). 
UACR at the end of the treatment period of 48 weeks is defined as the geometric mean of 4 UACRS, which  consist of the 2 consecutive daily first void UACR values at Visit 8 (46 weeks of treatment) and the 2 consecutive daily first void UACR values at Visit 9 (48 weeks of treatment). 

</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome: The difference between the two treatment arms in mean UACR at 24 weeks of treatment, adjusted for baseline UACR.  The UACR at 24 weeks of treatment is defined as the geometric mean of the 2 consecutive daily first void UACR values at Visit 6 (24 weeks).  UACR will be assessed by performing biochemistry test on the urine samples. </outcome>
