    <interventions>The primary aim of the project and its consortium partners is to evaluate innovative home-based technologies for continuous monitoring and prevention of falls in community-dwelling older adults. This approach will enable tailoring individualised prevention programs coached by iStoppFalls, including exercise and education. Various different home-based technologies are employed: 
1. The PC/ Microsoft Kinect 'Registered Trademark' based fall preventive exercise game (exergame ) facilitates real preventive exercise training, where data is acquired by unobtrusive sensing by PC/ Microsoft Kinect 'Registered Trademark'.
2. The Knowledge Based System (KBS) enables secure data management. 
3. The iTV application utilized the Microsoft Kinect 'Registered Trademark' device. It provides all the relevant KBS data (personal health advisor), and thus provides the necessary information to include fall-related education and other exercise-related components.
4. The Philips Senior Mobility Monitor (SMM) unobtrusively and regularly monitors mobility in daily life.
The 16-week exercise intervention primarily targets balance and strength properties and is suited to the functional level and interests of older people. The content of the iStoppFalls fall prevention exercise program was based on evidence-based fall prevention interventions targeting muscle strength and functional balance and mobility in older adults. The exercises selected for the prevention program were adapted to be incorporated into a videogame setting. The strength exercises were adapted into a videogame-based training program and the balance exercises into balance games. To maintain the challenge of the games to maximise improvements in ability and skill level, the level of difficulty is gradually increased within each game.

Sixty community-dwelling older people will be advised to complete a minimum of 3 sessions per week (30 to 60 minutes/session), adding up to at least 120 minutes of system use per week. The intervention will be unsupervised and participants will exercise in their own homes. Instructions will be provided at the beginning of the study period when the system is installed. To encourage adherence, participants will be contacted by phone after weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 or if data upload shows non-adherence in between (non-use of the system for 5 days). In addition participants will be provided with a phone number to call if they have questions or problems related to system.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive no intervention, but an information brochure about common fall risk factors.
Participants in the control group will be provided with and education booklet about different fall risk factors (i.e., vision impairment, medication use, foot pain, vitamin D insufficiency) at the beginning of the trial and asked to maintain their usual activities. Participants will be provided with a phone number which they can call if they have questions or problems related to content of the educational material.

    <statisticalmethods>between-group:

Differences at baseline will be explored using Chi square (discrete variables) and Student t-tests (continuous variables).
Between-group comparisons of continuous measures will be made using general linear models (ANCOVA) controlled for baseline performance and other confounding variables if required. Negative binomial regression will be used to test for differences in fall rates between groups.

An intention-to-treat approach will be used for all between-group analyses.

The estimated sample size of 52 participants is based on a large effect for the PPA as outcome measure (effect size f=0. 40, ANCOVA, Alpha 5%, Power 80%, Numerator df 1, Number of groups 2, Number of covariates 1). With an anticipated dropout of 15%, 60 participants will be recruited.

The Alpha level will be set to 5%.

within-group:

Paired t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA will be used to analyse changes within groups and to explore subgroups (e.g. different doses) in the intervention group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project addresses the urgent health care problem of falls in old age that affects a rapidly increasing number of people in Australia and is geared towards self-management of fall-related risk factors in old age. Technology-based solutions have potential to increase accuracy of fall prediction tools and develop standardized tailored intervention strategies. The emphasis of the project is not on laboratory research, but on active implementation of existing technologies and evidence-based fall prevention strategies for older people living in the community. The primary aim of the project is to develop and evaluate innovative home-based technologies for continuous monitoring and prevention of falls risk in older people.</summary>
