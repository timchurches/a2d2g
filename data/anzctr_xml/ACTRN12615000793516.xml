  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with P. falciparum infection are orally treated with standard 3-day dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin Registered Trademark, DHA 40 mg and PP 320 mg, Zhejiang Holley Nanhu Pharamaceutical Co. Ltd, Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, China). Supervised dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is administered once daily for 3 days (D0, 24h, 48h) by the research team. Dosing is based on body weight, in accordance with the national treatment guidelines: (i) &lt; 19 kg, 1 tablet/day; (ii) 19-29 kg, 1.5 tablets/day; (iii) 30-39 kg, 2 tablets/day; (iv) &gt; or = 40 kg, 3 tablets/day. For children unable to swallow tablets, DHA-PP was dissolved in 5 ml of water.

Patients are  observed for one hour post-dosing and redosed full or half dose if vomiting occurred within 30 minutes or between 31 and 60 minutes, respectively. Those who vomited after the second dose are withdrawn from the study and given parenteral rescue treatment (intramuscular artemether).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients with treatment failures. Patients will be classified as early late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>- age between 2 and 60 years except unmarried females between 12 and 18 years old (potential unpredicted pregnancy);
- mono-infection with P. falciparum detected by microscopy; P. falciparum parasitaemia of 500-200,000/microliter asexual forms;
- ability to swallow oral [by mouth] medication;
- ability and willingness to comply with the study protocol for the duration of the study and to comply with the study visit schedule

- Patients were evaluated clinically and parasitologically based on the specific inclusion criteria: over two years of age; fever (above 37.5 degrees Celsius) or history of fever in the last two days; P. falciparum mono-infection with parasite density between 500 to 200,000 asexual parasites/microliter and the exclusion criteria of the study;
- If a patient is eligible for the study the researcher asks if the patient can involve in the study by explaining all the process, procedure and all potential risks of drug side effects.
- If the patient agrees to participate in the study then the patient needs to sign in an inform consent.
- The patients are to stay at the health facilities for 3 or 4 days until the parasites completely clear from their bodies
- The patient has to come back to the study site for follow up on weekly basis over 42 days.
- During the follow up the patient receives the physical and parasitological examination (i.e, blood slide). </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>- The primary outcome was evaluated by a per-protocol analysis with an exact two-side 95% confidence interval .
- Kaplan-Meier analysis with a log-rank test were applied for the comparison of the proportion of subjects with treatment failure among several groups enrolled in the 4 differents sites. 

As the treatment failure rate to DHA-Â­PIP in the area is 10%, 10% has been chosen. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 8%, a minimum of 54 patients must be included. With a 10% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 42-day follow-up period, 60 patients should be included in the study per site the 4 differents sites (Tasagn Health Centre, Promaoy Health Centre, Oral Health Centre and Sandan health centre).</statisticalmethods>
