      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Week 12 - Physical function was assessed by HAQ-DI. It consisted of at least 2 questions per category, participant reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week rated on a 4-point scale where 0 = no difficulty; 1 = some difficulty; 2 = much difficulty; 3 = unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of category scores and divided by the number of categories answered, ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = unable to do, high-dependency disability. Least-squares (LS) means and standard errors (SE) at Week 12 were obtained from a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline HAQ-DI as a covariate.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-3L VAS Scores at Week 12 - The EQ-5D-3L is a standardized, generic measure of health outcome. EQ-5D was designed for self-completion by participants. The EQ-5D was specifically included to address concerns regarding the health economic impact of RA. The EQ-5D-3L comprises 5 questions on mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status with 3 possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problems, 3=severe problems) and a vertical VAS that allows the participants to indicate their health state today that can range from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable).

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in RAID Scores at Week 12 - RAID score is a composite measure of the impact of RA on participants that takes into account 7 domains: pain, functional disability, fatigue, physical and emotional well being, quality of sleep, and coping. The RAID is calculated based on 7 NRS questions. Range of the final RAID value is 0-10 where 0= not affected, very good and 10 = most affected weighted and calculated with a total score range of 0 (not affected, very good) to 10 (most affected). A higher RAID value indicates worse status and lower indicates not affected. LS mean and SE at Week 12 were obtained from a MMRM with treatment, region, number of previous anti-TNFs, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline RAID scores as a covariate.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Individual ACR Components - TJC and SJC at Week 12 and Week 24 - ACR components were: TJC, SJC, physician global VAS, participant global VAS, pain VAS,HAQ-DI &amp; CRP. 68 joints were assessed for tenderness (TJC scoring 0-68) and 66 joints for swelling (SJC scoring 0-66). The 66 SJC evaluated the following joints: temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, acromioclavicular, shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal, interphalangeal of thumb, distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, knee, ankle mortise, ankle tarsus, metatarsophalangeal, interphalangeal of great toe, and proximal/distal interphalangeal of the toes. The TJC examined hip joints, in addition to the joints assessed for SJC. Increase in number of tender joints/swollen joints indicated severity.

    <summary>Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate that sarilumab added to disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were
      effective for:

        -  reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 24 and

        -  improvement of physical function at Week 12

      in participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were inadequate responders or
      intolerant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) antagonists.

      Secondary Objectives:

      The secondary objectives were to investigate the effects of SAR153191 (REGN88) when added to
      DMARD therapy, in participants with active RA who were inadequate responders or intolerant to
      TNF-a antagonists, for:

        -  Reduction of signs and symptoms at Week 12;

        -  Improvement in physical function at Week 24;

        -  Improvement in disease activity score as measured by other American College of
           Rheumatology (ACR) derived components at Weeks 12 and 24;

        -  Improvement in quality of life as measured by participant reported outcomes (PROs) at
           intermediate visits and Week 24.

      To assess the exposure of sarilumab added to DMARD therapy in this population.

      To assess the safety of sarilumab in this population.</summary>
