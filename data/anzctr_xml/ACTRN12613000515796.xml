  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a purse string suture (1.0 proline suture) tied over the femoral venous puncture site that pulls the skin and subcutaneous tissues together to achieve pressure and haemostasis. Participants will receive the intervention once following their ablation procedure by the cardiologist who performed the ablation. It will be in place for 4 hours (at which time it is cut at the skin and pulled out) and patients will be followed up for 24 hours following their procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Manual pressure (pushing with hands) over the femoral vein. Administered by one of the cardiology nurses assisting with the procedure. This will be administered once following the ablation procedures until haemostasis is achieved (minimum of ten minutes). </comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Surgery</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Groin complications (eg. Bleeding/haematoma formation). Bleeding/haematoma will be assessed visually and with palpation and graded as bruising/haematoma &lt;10cm or &gt;10cm in diameter. If indicated an ultrasound may be used to look for complications such as arteriovenous fistula (very rare in this situation).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the procedure, at four hours following and at one day following the procedure. Additional reviews will be performed if ongoing bleeding occurs. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient discomfort in achieving groin haemostasis. Assessed by a subjective pain scale ranging from nil through to mild then moderate then severe discomfort as perceived by the patient. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of performing the suture/manual pressure. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to achieve groin haemostasis. Assessed by measuring the time from suture insertion or pressure application to when bleeding and/or bruising has ceased. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Following the procedure and up until the point where bleeding/bruising is controlled.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients undergoing cardiac ablation procedures at John Hunter Hospital and Lake Macquarie Private Hospitals who require anticoagulation for the procedure. Patients undergoing ablation procedures at these hospitals who would ordinarily require the use of a size 11 French sheath in the femoral vein who may or may not also require anticoagulation. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to determine whether a purse string suture to a patients groin is more or less effective than manual pressure
in preventing complications such as bleeding and bruising following ablation procedures.
We intend to randomise patients in a 1 to 1 fashion to either use of a purse string suture or manual pressure over
the femoral vein to achieve haemostasis following ablation procedures. We intend to randomise patients in this
fashion who need anticoagulation for their procedure with the
hypothesis that the purse string suture is a more efficient and more effective way to provide groin haemostasis for patients post ablation.</summary>
