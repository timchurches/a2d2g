    <interventions>The research team will recruit a minimum of 30 participants who will be adults, gender non-specific, working as health care providers (doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacist and others directly involved providing patient care) within the NWRH. There is no upper limit with regards to age of the participants.
Volunteer health workers and persons who do not provide direct patient care activities such as kitchen staff, cleaners and secretaries, will be excluded from participating.
The design of the 3-day study is prospective and observational and participants will:
Act as patients and interact with a Robot named NAO, a commercially available robot built by Aldebaran Robotics (58cm tall, weighing 4.3Kg).
Participant information will be provided to the study participants prior to their encounter with NAO and an informed consent will be obtained.
They will evaluate the Robots ability to interact as a clinical care provider, performing a simple breathing exercise as guided by the Robot using voice prompts and gestures.
Participants will then fill out a questionnaire at the end of their encounter with the Robot.
The above (both the interaction with NAO plus the completion of questionnnaire) is expected to take each participant approximately 15 minutes.
Participant answers will be analysed by the research team.  NAO will not have any direct physical contact with the study participants and at times a robot engineer and a health professional involved in the study will be present with NAO.

    <statisticalmethods>A Likert Scale will be utilized for this purpose. Participants will provide their responses to 7 questions on a ranked scale from 1 to 10 (from lowest to highest). We will then calculate a total score and a mean score for the individual scale items. The Cronbach alpha test will be utilized to provide evidence that the components of the scale are sufficiently intercorrelated and to measure the degree of internal consistency. A Cronback Kappa test will be performed to measure inter-rater reliability. Data will be visualised with appropriate charts. 

Given this being a perceptual study with no similar studies to compare, a sample size of minimum 30 is arbitrarily chosen</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the research is to explore the perceptions of health care professionals posing as patients to the provision of a simple patient care activity by a specially programmed humanoid Robot.

The sentinel questions to be addressed are:
Will study participants accept a humanoid Robot in a care provider role?
Is it possible for study participant to place trust on such a humanoid?
Can a machine effect care with empathy by displaying appropriate emotions?
What concerns arise among the study participants?

Study participants are Doctors, Nurses, allied health professionals who provide direct clinical care. They will 'pose' as a patient before the humanoid robot and assess some components of the core clinical skills of the robot namely sense of safety, efficacy of care, empathy, communication skills, supportiveness, trust level and acceptance. Their responses on a standardised scale will be analysed and published.

This study could pave the way to explore the utility of robots as real health care providers by systematically understanding the perceptions of health professionals as a first step. </summary>
