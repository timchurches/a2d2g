  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will take part in two inpatient periods, with a minimum of a 4-day washout between periods. Participants will receive a single 50mg dose of oral XCalibur (sildenafil) capsule during one inpatient period and a single oral dose of Viagra film-coated tablet during another inpatient period.  No food is allowed for 10 hours before taking study medication and for 4 hours after the dose.  Water and other non-caffeinated beverages are allowed except for 1 hour before and after study medication.  Participants will be admitted to the clinical research unit the evening before each in­patient period and will remain in the clinic until 14 hours post dose. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive a single oral dose of Viagra 50 mg tablet. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of XCalibur to Viagra using standard bioequivalence criteria. The method of evaluation for the Primary Objective will be standard bioequivalence criteria (90% CIs) of test product versus reference product for Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and observed maximum plasma concentration. The pharmacokinetic analysis will be based on plasma concentrations of sildenafil</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 hours post-dose</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison of the safety and tolerability of XCalibur Trademark capsule and Viagra Registered Trademark film-­-coated tablet through assessment of adverse events. The most common expected adverse events associated with sildenafil (the active ingredient in the study medication) include hypotension (low blood pressure), flushing and headache. Adverse events will be collected through adverse event probes and collection of vital signs.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Collection of adverse events will begin at time of initial dose of study medication through the follow-up visit (5 days after the last dose of study medication). Vital signs will be monitored pre-dose, at 30 minutes, and at hours 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 14 after taking study medication. Adverse event probes will be completed at the same time as  post-dose vital signs.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>iX Biopharma Pty Ltd is developing  a new capsule formulation of sildenafil for treating erectile dysfunction. Sildenafil as a drug has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia, but the capsule formulation of sildenfil has not been approved by the TGA Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia or in any other country.  This particular formulation of sildenafil, XCalibur (the study drug), and its use in this study are experimental.  The study drug will be compared to the pre-existing tablet formulation Viagra.
