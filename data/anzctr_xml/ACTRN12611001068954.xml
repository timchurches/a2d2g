  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist in a oral administration of a commercially available extensively hydrolized casein formula (EHFC) containing Lactobacillus GG (for at least 1x10 6 CFU/g of formula powder). The amount of EHFC ranged from 500 to 1000 ml everyday until oral tolerance acquisition depending on the body weight and age of children. Children enrolled will receive this dietary intervention and oral food challenges will be performed to explore tolerance acquisition every 6 months until tolerance acquisition for 3 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive commercially avaliable extensively hydrolized casein formula (EHCF) with the same composition with the exception of absence of LGG. Children enrolled will receive this dietary intervention and oral food challenges will be performed to explore tolerance acquisition every 6 months until tolerance acquisition for 3 years.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of allergic manifestations in children with CMA including atopic eczema, allergic urticaria, asthma, allergic rhinitis. Every 12 months sensitization to common dietary and respiratory antigens will be assessed by skin prick tests (SPT) and prick by prick tests. Atopic manifestations  will be accurately evaluated according to previously validated criteria. In particular, atopic eczema will be diagnosed on the basis of the modified diagnostic criteria: 1) typical morphology and distribution of skin lesions (face, neck and scalp, flexural folds, hands, and extensor sides of the extremities); 2) pruritis (signs of scratching); and 3) tendency toward chronicity (duration 14 days, chronically relapsing, or both). The morphologic diagnosis of atopic eczema will be confirmed on skin examination by a second physician with great experience in allergology. Final diagnosis will be obtained only if all 3 diagnostic criteria will fulfill. Allergic urticaria will be diagnosed if at least 2 episodes of itching eruptions or swelling with typical appearance, will be observed. In case of a single episode, positive allergy screening tests or provocation response with the suspected allergen will be evaluated for definite diagnosis. Allergic rhinitis will be diagnosed if the children will have on most days two or more of: nasal discharge, blockage, sneezing, and itching. For diagnosis, temporal relations will be established between these symptoms of allergic rhinitis, symptoms with allergen exposure, relief of symptoms by antihistamine treatment, and evidence of atopic sensitization (ie, positive allergy screening tests). 
Diagnosis of asthma will be based on an algorithm created by an international pediatric asthma consensus group. Asthma will be diagnosed if a child will present chronic or recurrent cough, wheeze or shortness of breath, or both, suggestive of asthma, and if other diagnoses will be excluded and trial antiasthma treatment will be effective.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lactobacillus GG (LGG) is the most studied probiotic in the prevention and treatment of atopic disorders. Wide and well-designed clinical studies have provided several evidences on the efficacy of LGG as preventive or therapeutic strategy in pediatric atopic disorders. More recently, in vitro studies have provided evidences on the potent  immunoregulatory role and on the influence on intestinal microflora composition (toward a more beneficial composition in the prevention and treatment of atopic disorders) elicited by LGG. Finally, we have recently demonstrated that the addition of LGG to an extensively hydrolysed casein formula is able to reduce the time of tolerance acquisition in children with CMA. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether early nutritional intervention with LGG added to an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula (EHCF, Nutramigen LGG -registered trademark-, Mead Johnson, Italy) to treat CMA in children could be able to influence the incidence and prevalence of other allergic manifestations and of sensitization to main allergens in a follow-up of 3 years.</summary>
