  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women rest in the left lateral position for 5 minutes (timed by one of the study investigators) and then they have haemodynamics, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation measured. The women are then placed in the prone position and rested for 5 minutes (timed by one of the study investigators) and then then have haemodynamics, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation measured. The women then return to the seated or lateral position.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Healthy pregnant women:
Healthy term (greater than or equal to 37 weeks gestation) pregnant women will be defined as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification I or II, with no significant medical or surgical illness. Age 18-45 years
Women with gestationally acquired hypertension greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation:
Women aged 18-45 years will be included in the study if they meet the diagnostic criteria for either gestational hypertension or preeclampsia.

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All enrolled women will receive the same treatment. 
Recruitment of healthy pregnant women:
It is anticipated that most healthy term pregnant women will be recruited from the elective caesarean section operating list. Once a term healthy pregnant woman has been identified the investigator will assess whether the woman is eligible to participate in the study. If she is eligible to participate, the investigator will speak to the woman privately and ask her if she is willing to be involved in the study. Written information in the form of the participant information and consent form will be given to her. The study will be performed in a private room.

The recruitment of women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension:
This will occur throughout the hospital. This will include  the emergency department, day admission/assessment area, pregnancy clinics, hospital wards and birthing suite. The investigator will visit these areas of the hospital to check whether a woman with hypertension has presented there. Once a woman with hypertension has been identified the investigator they will assess whether the woman with hypertension is eligible to participate in the study (see exclusion /inclusion criteria). If she is eligible to participate, the AI will speak to the woman privately and ask her if she is willing to be involved in the study. Written information in the form of the participant information and consent form will be given to her. Most of these women will be in a hospital bed or private assessment area and so will not need to be moved to another location to discuss the study.  After consent, if the woman is not already in a private room, she will be moved to a private room with a bed and undertake the study.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Rationale for the sample size:
The primary comparison measurement is blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) before and after being placed in the prone position. We have published our preliminary study that determined the mean and standard deviation of SBP (119 +/- 13.0 mmHg) and DBP (72 +/- 11.6 mmHg) in healthy term pregnant women and the mean and standard deviation of SBP (147 +/- 7.8 mmHg) and DBP (93 +/- 6.5 mmHg) in women with preeclampsia. For this study, assuming a clinically relevant difference in mean blood pressure, with the change in posture from the lateral position to the prone position, of 10 mmHg, and a power of 80% and a 5% type 1 risk, using a two tailed test, the following numbers are required in each group:
1. Healthy term pregnant women  28 women (for a 10 mmHg difference in SBP) 23 women (for a 10 mmHg difference in DBP)
2. Hypertensive women - 11 women (for a 10 mmHg difference in SBP) 8 women (for a 10 mmHg difference in DBP)

In coming to the final study numbers we have made three assumptions:
1. Given that the definition of hypertension in pregnancy treats the SBP and DBP as independent i.e. the definition is Systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than or equal to 140 mmHg And/or Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 90 mmHg we have not used correlated means. 
2. The standard deviations in this study may be different from the original study so we have increased study numbers to accommodation this
3. Regarding the decision to choose a 10 mmHg mean blood pressure difference, given that the intervention to possibly reduce the blood pressure is a physiological one, it is unlikely, within the five minute time frame, that the blood pressure drop would be greater than 10 mmHg, however any less of a reduction than 10 mmHg is unlikely to be clinically relevant. A blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg is clinically relevant as it may reduce the blood pressure to a threshold where treatment may not be necessary or the diagnostic threshold for the diagnosis is not met (if SBP/DBP greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg). In addition we have found that healthy pregnant women have found the prone position comfortable and we would like to assess the preferred resting position in more women than is needed for the pure comparison statistic.

Therefore total study numbers:
1. 50 healthy term pregnant women
2. 15 hypertensive pregnant women


Data collected:
Demographic and obstetric data will be displayed as mean and standard deviation, median with interquartile ranges, or number and percentage as appropriate. Analysis of the blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen levels (using pulse oximetry) will be made using a General Linear Model with significant p value defined as less than 0.05 after performing F tests on the collected data. The null hypothesis will be rejected if p less than 0.05 for each of the variables. All analyses will be performed using Stata/MP 13.1 (Stata Software Inc.,Chicago IL).

Additional participant numbers: Healthy pregnant women have found the prone position comfortable and we would like to assess preferred position in more women so have increased the sample size to a convenience sample of 50 women in total in the healthy pregnancy group </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prone position is a body position in which a person lies horizontal with the chest down and back up. With appropriate pillows and positioning, it is a safe position for pregnant women and because of this the position is utilised in the allied health fields and for relaxation and massage in pregnant women.  In this position uterine compression of the large maternal vessels is alleviated.  Yet, despite this, the prone position is rarely used in the medical setting in pregnant women and there is very little information about the position in the medical literature. There is no published information about the prone position in women with hypertension in pregnancy including preeclampsia. 

We have recently published a new unified theory of preeclampsia. It proposes that the development of hypertension in pregnant women is an adaptive response to the demands of a growing fetus and is driven by an imbalance between maternal oxygen supply to the fetus (which may be caused by inadequate blood flow to the uteroplacental unit) and fetal oxygen demands. 

When thinking about the prone position in the light of this new theory we hypothesise that placing a pregnant women, with new onset pregnancy associated hypertension, into this position may reduce her blood pressure by eliminating abdominal compression of blood vessels thereby reducing abdominal vascular resistance and improving blood flow.

This proposed study aims to test this hypothesis.
