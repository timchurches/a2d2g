  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is based on cognitive training.  It does not involve pharmacological agents.  Participants are randomly assigned to a Control or Training condition, based on a random permutation calculator (http://www.randomizer.org). 

Participants in the Training condition are required to utilize the NoGo training app once a day to play 10 games, taking about 1 minute per game. Training is completed at a time and place convenient to the participant.  The NoGo app requires participants to press buttons to select images of healthy foods (e.g. fruit, vegetables and activities) as quickly and accurately as possible and not press to select less healthy choices (e.g. hamburgers, chips, cupcakes, etc).  Training will take place for 10 minutes per day over a 14 day period, which equates to a total training time of 140 minutes over 2 weeks. 

Adherence is monitored by the training application, which records the task performance data and training date/time.  The research team will monitor training rate and contact participant if the rate is too slow.

      <outcome>Healthy Eating Quiz 

The Healthy Eating Quiz is a food frequency questionnaire containing 70 items relating to the frequency of healthy food consumption over the past 7 days, rated on a Likert Scale from Never to 5 or more times a week. It also asks about water consumption each day (less than 4 glasses per day/more than 4 glasses a day) and how frequently sauces and spreads are used (never/once a week or more). It includes 8 subgroups; fruit, vegetables, meat proteins and vegetarian proteins, grains, water, dairy, and extras (i.e. sauces and spreads). Participants were asked to rate approximately how many serves of items within these food groups they had consumed in the past week. Food frequency questionnaires are widely used to assess eating habits.

      <outcome>Food Consumption Test 

The Food Consumption Test was used to examine immediate changes in food consumption following the ICT. It was based on the bogus taste tests used in previous research, but without the associated element of deception. Participants were informed that they would receive a refreshment break during the session in which snacks would be offered, and that they could eat as little or as much as they liked. Participants were presented with four bowls containing snack-sized portions of 2 healthy (156 g of unsalted nuts and 216 g of grapes) and 2 unhealthy food options (60 g of plain potato chips and 161 g of chocolate candies, M&amp;Ms). While nuts and grapes are still high calorie choices, these foods were chosen as they represent real world choices that participants would be faced with. For example, while grapes are still high in sugar, they are high in natural sugar and are non-processed. Thus they represent a healthier choice than M&amp;Ms (which are processed and high in sugar and saturated fat) for individuals when craving a convenient, sweet snack food. Food was presented for 10 minutes whilst the experimenter cleaned equipment used previously in the experimental session, facing away from participants. After the participant left the lab, the food was weighed, consumption was recorded, and the number of calories consumed was calculated. Before completing the FCT, participants were asked covertly (questions were embedded in a larger general health questionnaire) to rate their current levels of hunger and food craving to account for differences in the food consumption test results between conditions.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) 

Participants completed the 51 item TFEQ which contained a combination of true/false questions (e.g., Sometimes when I start eating, I just cant seem to stop) and items rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., How frequently do you avoid stocking up on tempting foods? Rated: not at all/slightly/moderately/almost always). The TFEQ contains three subscales- cognitive restraint, disinhibition, and hunger, measuring the ability to resist foods, and overcome internal and external food cues. The TFEQ has been widely used in overweight and obese populations, and is psychometrically valid in obese and non-obese populations.

      <outcome>Go/Nogo task

Two auditory Go/Nogo tasks that varied in reaction time deadline (RTD) were used to assess general IC ability. Tones were presented at 1100 and 2000 Hz for 200 ms, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of either 2500 (longer RTD) or 1250 ms (shorter RTD). These specific time intervals were pilot tested for this study in an adult population.  Shorter RTDs increase task demands by inducing rapid responding to Go stimuli making the inhibition of motor responses on infrequent Nogo trials more difficult and increases the likelihood of errors. As a result, this study used two separate tasks with varying task demands (longer RTD and shorter RTD) to better assess potential effects of the ICT training. Tasks were created in Presentation Version 11, and tones were presented at 60 dB binaurally though Sennheiser HD201 headphones. Participants were required to press a response button on a game controller upon presentation of the frequent Go tone (70% of presented stimuli), and to withhold response upon presentation of the infrequent Nogo tone. Participants completed 10 practice trials to ensure they understood task instructions, and then completed 100 trials, taking approximately 2.5 minutes to complete. Assignment of each tone as Go/Nogo, and the order of tasks, was counterbalanced across sessions and participants. This task was used to assess how the IC training affected general IC ability, but used a different medium (auditory rather than visual) to reduce practice effects and make comparison to the control group more equal.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A strong effect size (o.80) was expected as a recent meta-analysis shows optimal effects are achieved with Go-Nogo training tasks using stimuli tailored to the specific behaviour.  The expectation for increased effect size is due to these factors, as well as the increased duration of training (14 sessions). A power analysis using Gpower indicated that a total sample
of 6o participants would be needed to detect large effects (d=0.80) with 90% power using a t test between means with alpha at .05.

One way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) were used to assess baseline differences between Training and Control conditions, and to assess NOGO training app performance data. 

Additionally, Time (1, 2) x Condition (Waitlist, Training) mixed design ANOVAs were used to assess the FCT, HEQ, and TFEQ, with planned follow-up analysis splitting data by Condition and assessing the impact of Time. ERP latency analysis was restricted to the frontal midline location (Fz), as the N2 and P3 components showed a frontal maximum. Go and Nogo ERP data was subject to a Condition x Time x Stimulus (Go, Nogo) x RTD (Longer, Shorter) mixed factorial ANOVA. ERP amplitude analyses included an additional Lateral (Left, Midline, Right) factor. Planned contrasts within the Lateral factor compared the right and left hemispheres. Here we focus on interactions between Time and Condition, and Time x Condition x Laterality for ERP amplitude analysis. Alpha level was set to .05 for all analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to investigate the efficacy of computerised inhibitory control training on unhealthy food consumption in obese adolescents and adults. Outcome measures will include consumption of various food types, attitudes towards food, and electrophysiological indices of approach/avoidance during exposure to food stimuli. Training will involve daily sessions playing an iOS app designed to reduce responses to unhealthy food, while encouraging responses to healthy foods. Using a waitlist control design the study will test both the efficacy of the app, and the viability of the intense training schedule. </summary>
