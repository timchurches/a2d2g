    <concealment>Potential patients will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the patient meets all the enrolment criteria and he/she or a parent/guardian (in case of children) consented to participate in the study, the patient will be recruited in to the study. All antimalarial treatment will be given by a study team member under supervision. Thereafter, patients are required to undergo regular clinical reassessment. Blood films for parasite counts will be made on days 2, 3 and 7 and then weekly for the remainder of the follow-up period, i.e. on days 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42.
As a one arm prospective study, diheydroartimisinin+ piperaquine will be given to the seletced patients (100 patients per site) infected with P.falciparum or P.vivax).</concealment>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in 6 sentinel sites in Indonesia.
Background: Based on the local efficacy studies in 2005, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP) is recommended as the first line treatment for falciparum and vivax malaria in Indonesia in 2008. The National Malaria Control Program has put efforts in ensuring proper drug administration and regulation to prevent the emergence of drug resistance problem. In view of this, after 4 years of deployment it is important to evaluate the efficacy of DHP in different parts of Indonesia with different level of malaria transmission.
Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of DHP for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections in in 6 sentinel sites in Indonesia.
Methods: An antimalarial drug efficacy trial will be conducted in 6 sentinel sites in Indonesia: Bangka Island (South Sumatra), Samarinda (East Kalimantan), Tomohon (North Sulawesi), South Halmahera (South Maluku), Flores (East Nusa Tenggara) and Timika (Papua). The participants will be older than one year to 65 years old with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum or P. vivax infection. Patients will be treated with once daily DHP (containing 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine) for 3 days, administered as a weight per dose regimen of 2.25 and 18 mg/kg per dose of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. The study will be conducted from August 2014 to July 2015. 

The results of this study will be used to assist the Ministry of Health of Indonesia in assessing the current national treatment guidelines for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria.
