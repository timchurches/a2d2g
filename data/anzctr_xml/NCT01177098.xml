  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Worse Eye Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Each Hour Evaluated at Week 12 - Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. IOP was evaluated at Baseline and Week 12 at Hour 0, Hour 2 and Hour 8 in the worse eye, defined as the eye with the worse (higher) IOP at baseline. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in IOP (improvement).</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average Eye Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Each Hour Evaluated at Week 2 - Intraocular pressure (IOP) is a measurement of the fluid pressure inside the eye. Average eye IOP is the average IOP of both eyes and was evaluated at Week 2 at Hour 0, Hour 2 and Hour 8.</outcome>
