  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Radical prostatectomy (RP) is the most common curative approach offered to men with newly
      diagnosed prostate cancer. Unfortunately, up to half of these patients will have factors
      placing them at high risk of their cancer recurring. Having radiotherapy after RP is known to
      improve cure rates, but what is not known is whether it should be given straight after the
      operation or only when there is a rising PSA after surgery indicating active cancer.
      Immediate RT may not benefit all men, and can cause serious side effects such as bladder and
      bowel problems and impotence. International lack of consensus on the optimal timing of RT has
      resulted in varied clinical practice. This phase 3 trial will compare the two approaches.</summary>
