  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is, consumption of one dose of tomato, containing 5-20 mg of novel tetra-cis lycopene or containing 5-20 mg standard trans-lycopene.  A blood sample will be obtained at 0, 4, 5 and 6 hours and a urine sample will be obtained at 0 and 24 h.  There will be a 2 week wash out peroid before consumption of one dose of the altenative variety of tomato.  Samples are collected as with the first dose.</interventions>

    <concealment>Once assigned to the study, participants will be asked to draw a code from a box containing equal numbers of 2 codes (totalling the amount of participants in the trial).  These codes will be given to the research coordinator whom has previously allocated the codes to the 2 varieties of tomato.  The tomato variety each participant selects is the variety they will be given first.  Participants will consume their tomato diced in a booth and asked not to discuss the fruit with other participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lycopene is a carotenoid, present in tomatoes, which has linked to beneficial effects on human health, such as prevention of prostate cancer.  Lycopene found in human blood, plasma and tissues contain high levels of cis isomers of lycopene, whereas the trans isomer is the main dietary source of lycopene.  Interestingly, processing of tomatoes converts trans isomers to cis isomers and the latter being regarded as more bioavailable, since they are more soluble and better absorbed in the gut.  Although it should be noted that isomerisation may also take place in vivo.  Processing of food can lead to loss of beneficial nutrients and therefore being able to consume fresh unprocessed tomatoes rich in cis isomer lycopene rather than a processed tomato product may provide additional nutritional benefits.  </summary>
