  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention is delivered in addition to usual care. Multimedia falls prevention education with between 2 and 4 individual health professional follow-up sessions for each patient in the week prior to hospital discharge and one follow up telephone call for each patient made in the fortnight after hospital discharge to consolidate the education. Each participant in the intervention group to receive education individually by being shown a DVD and also being given written materials with workbook. Patient receives individual tailored discussion and feedback that allow them to develop goals and strategies. Participants receive between 3 and 6 individual sessions depending on their falls risk and individual medical conditions. Personalised Telephone call counselling and feedback based on earlier goals concludes education. No group activities.</interventions>

    <concealment>Eligible patients approached and written consent sought.  Participants are allocated to groups in a 1:1 ratio in consecutive order after enrolment by the research assistant.  The allocation is performed by the researcher who phones the co-investigator who is off site and not involved in recruitment, data collection or providing interventions.  The co-investigator opens an opaque sealed envelope with the participantâ€™s study identification number on it.  The paper inside the envelope contains the group allocation</concealment>
    <sequence>The envelope order is determined by a computer generated random number sequence that is produced by a project collaborator at an external university who is not involved in recruitment, intervention or data collection.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people who have just been discharged from hospital are high risk of falls and injuries such as hip fracture and are also at risk of medical complications and unplanned readmissions to hospital.  Health workers have identified that better health care is urgently required for these patients.

We recently conducted a large trial that identified that providing patient education reduced falls in hospital by over half in older patients with normal cognition.  Therefore the aim of this research is to examine whether providing a similar patient education program for older people just before they are discharged from hospital can also reduce falls at home.  This study will test the design of the discharge education.  If the education successfully improves older peoples ability to engage in falls prevention behaviours after discharge, the researchers plan to test the education in a larger trial to directly examine its effect on falls and falls injuries.

The research aims are:
Evaluate the effect of providing a tailored multimedia falls prevention education program delivered by a health professional in hospital prior to discharge and in addition to usual care, on older patients levels of engagement in falls prevention strategies in the first month after hospital discharge.</summary>
