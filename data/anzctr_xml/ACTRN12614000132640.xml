  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study seeks to determine concurrent validity of the CSMi HUMAC (Registered Trademark) Balance device against a gold standard force platform measurement (Neurocom EquiTest (Registered Trademark) System).
The 2 different devices will be used to assess balance in 2 populations: 1. a healthy group of community dwelling individuals aged &gt;60 years (N=20); 2. a group of community dwelling individuals aged &gt;60 who have had a stroke (subacute or chronic, ie &gt; 6 weeks post stroke)(N=20).
In a randomized order, subjects will undergo an assessment on each device over the course of about 1 hour.  Assessment on the HUMAC device will include a modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance (mCTSIB) and a Limits of Stability (LOS) test.  On the NeuroCom device a modified Sensory Organization Test (mSOT) and a LOS test will be performed.  The mCTSIB and mSOT each have 4 conditions inwhich a subject stands still and has their balance assessed.  The conditions include standing eyes open on a stable surface, standing eyes close on a stable surface, standing eyes open on a compliant surface, and standing eyes closed on a compliant surface.  LOS testing requires subjects to stand still and then shift there weight as far as possible in 8 directions (N,NW,W,SW,S etc). 
Subjects will be given 3 minute rests between each test condition on either device as well as 5 minute rest when changing between devices.</interventions>
    <comparator>The ability of CSMi Humac (Registered Trademark) Balance device to accurately detect balance impairments will be assessed by comparing the outputs it give to those produced by the Neurocom EquiTest (Registered Trademark) System, which is considered to be the gold standard for assessing balance impairments.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential study candidates who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to join the study.  Participants will be given practice trials of all balance tasks on both devices to familiarize themselves with the testing procedures, devices and tasks. 
After the practice trial, and a five-minute rest, participants will undergo balance assessments on each device in a randomized order.  Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
