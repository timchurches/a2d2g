  <interventions>
    <interventions>Initial baseline evaluation of driving simulator performance will be performed in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and matched healthy subjects under three conditions of normal sleep, restricted sleep (4 hrs) and alcohol (0.05 g/dL) in a random order one week apart. Patients will then undergo a laboratory based countinuous positive air-way pressure (CPAP) titration study, issued a CPAP machine and encouraged to use it as much as possibe but at least 4 hours per night for a minimum of 3 month. Control subjects were not on any treatment and were asked to continue their normal activities.</interventions>
    <comparator>3 months follow-up driving simulator assessments under the three conditions of normal sleep, sleep restriction and alcohol. Control participants will not be on any treatment for three months, but will be followed-up and driving will be also assessed at 3 months.</comparator>
