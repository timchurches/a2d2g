  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome> plaque (bacterial) accumulation as assessed using:

1) In the field of dentistry the plaque index by Silness and Loe 1964 is assessed by visually inspecting the teeth for the amount and extent of plaque accumulation and is graded from 0-3. 

0= no plaque
1= minimum plaque accumulation
2= moderate plaque accumulation 
3= abundant plaque accumulation

The professional description is 

0 - No plaque

1 - A film of plaque adhering to the free gingival margin and adjacent area of the tooth, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. But only by using disclosing solution or by using a probe.

2 - Moderate accumulation of deposits within the gingival pocket, on the gingival margin and or adjacent tooth surface, which can be seen with the naked eye.

3 - Abundance of soft matter within the gingival pocket and/or on the tooth and gingival margin.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>three weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>plaque (bacterial) accumulation as assessed using:

2) In the field of dentistry the plaque accumulation by Rustogi et al. Modified Navy Plaque Index (RMNPI)s assessed by visually inspecting the teeth for the presence of plaque (1) and absence of plaque (0).

The professional description is :

The RMNPI plaque is evaluated as either present or absent (1 or 0) on each of the nine areas of the buccal and lingual tooth 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>three weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>plaque (bacterial) accumulation as assessed using:

3) In the field of dentistry the plaque index - modified Lobene stain index 1968 is measured by applying a pink dye on the tooth and will be visually inspected by the extent the colour is retained on the tooth.

1= present 

The professional description is 

The tooth will be divided into six areas 

Buccal surface: Anterior tooth  labial (I), approximal (A), gingival (G)

Posterior teeth - buccal (B), approximal (A), gingival (G)

Palatal surface: Anterior tooth - palatal (P), approximal (A), gingival (G)

Posterior teeth  palatal (P), approxiaml (A), gingival (G)

When at least one area of the considered teeth in a patient was found to be pigmented that area will be considered to be positive at the patient level

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> gingival (gum) inflammation as assessed using:

0= pink
1= dark pink
2= red
3= dark red 

The professional description is 

0  No inflammation

15-20 participants in each of the Groups A, B,C,D,E,F 
90-120 participants overall
Sample size was calculated from Marchetti et al (2011) who investigated the difference in plaque scores between an alcohol and non-alcohol based mouthwash between two groups. Using the means of 71.6 (+/- 13.4)  and 58.6 (+/- 12.5) for the non-alcohol and alcohol based mouthwashes, respectively, a two-sided test, an alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.80, the sample size was determined as 16 participants per group.



All data will be analysed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) V21. Data       will initially be analysed descriptively using graphs and tables. Crosstabs will be used to determine group percentages across the ordinal and nominal data measuring the levels of gingival inflammation (for example, periodontal and gingival indexes). Means and standard errors will be used for the parametric data obtained from the VAS measures in the self-report questionnaire.
Statistical significance will be calculated using p &lt; 0.05. Differences between the groups will be determined using Kruskal Wallis test on the ordinal and nominal data of the gingival inflammation indices and ANOVA with multiple comparison (Bonferroni corrected) for the VAS measures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants between the age of 18  35 yrs old that fulfill the inclusion criteria will be chosen to take part in the study.  All participants will be randomly assigned to one of six groups 14 days prior to commencement of the study.  All the participants will receive a dental clean and will be advised to stop the use of their regular mouthwash.  When the experiment begins (day 0) participants will be advised to follow the experimental oral hygiene protocol.  And they will be advised to use one of five mouthwashes (or water which is a negative control).  Five different gum measurements will be measured and the soft tissue health will be noted at all four visits from the start of the experimental period.  At the last visit participants will be requested to fill a questionnaire form as well.  In addition they will also receive a dental clean to remove bacterial accumulation on their teeth and extrinsic tooth staining.

There is significant evidence in the current literature that commercial alcohol containing mouthwashes such as Savacol (Registered Trademark) and Listerine (Registered Trademark) reduce bacterial accumulation and gum inflammation.  However despite some progress, there is a huge gap in clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of commercially available non-alcohol containing mouthwashes such as Savacol (Registered Trademark), Listerine Zero (Registered Trademark) and a herbal mouthwash  Dr Organics Aloe Vera (Registered Trademark) mouthwash, in the prevention of bacterial accumulation and gum inflammation.  This study is expected to give us more evidence about the benefits that these non-alcohol containing mouthwashes can provide to our patients.
