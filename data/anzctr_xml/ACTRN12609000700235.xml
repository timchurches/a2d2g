  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention was based on Neurodevelopmental principles. The protocol included 2 sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Each session lasted 1 hour and was supervised by a trained physiotherapist. 
All the sessions started with stretching exercises and handles aimed at improving the child mobility. Then, the children performed voluntary exercises such as training on walking, going up and down stairs and standing up from sitting position. Increased demands such as high speed and load addition were provided according to the child conditions.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Employing measurement tools which assess the refinement of motor skills in cerebral palsied children is relevant to physical therapists. Nevertheless, the applicability of functional mobility tests, namely the Timed up and go (TUG) and the Timed up and down stairs (TUDS) has not been investigated before. Objectives: To verify the applicability of TUG and TUDS, as well as of the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) dimensions, in measurement of changes occurring in children with cerebral palsy after an intervention program. Methods: Six children with spastic cerebral palsy and classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System as level I or II were enrolled in the study. They were assessed by using TUG, TUDS and GMFM before and after an 8-week intervention program based on neurodevelopmental principles. Results: TUG has detected that the time children spent during the task of standing from sitting position and walk was decreased after intervention, and TUDS has detected that the time children spent during the task of going up and down stairs was also decreased. GMFM detected changes at dimension D (standing) and E (walking, running and jumping). Conclusions: TUG and TUDS are applicable and effective tools which enable the measurement of changes in functional mobility after an intervention program in children with cerebral palsy. These tests are also shown to complement information provided by GMFM.</summary>
