    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of this study is to examine if it is safe to conduct a phase III study of pyridostigmine with the primary outcome being assessments of the safety of the use of pyridostigmine in palliative care patients.
This will be measured by at least 80% of the subjects to complete seven days of pyridostigmine without significant drug-related Adverse Reactions.
The adverse reactions will be assessed daily using the NCI criteria for specific adverse effects of pyridostigmine including nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhoea, increased bronchial secretions, sweating, bradycardia, hypotension &amp; rash. These are measured on 0-5 scale with a score of 3 or more for any adverse effect meaning that this participant will be withdrawn. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 7 days of receiving pyridostigmine.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the feasibility of conducting a phase III study by analysing the willingness of people to be recruited and clinicians to refer and the reasons for non-recruitment at screening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at screening and analysed at the completion of the study.</timepoint>

      <outcome>To assess the feasibility of conducting a phase III study by analysing the acceptability of the study processes.

Acceptability of the study processes will be measured by assessing compliance with the colon transit test; the percentage of completion of the study questionnaires and diary; and compliance with taking pyridostigmine twice daily for seven days.</outcome>

      <timepoint>After 7 days of taking pyridostigmine. This data will be collected in the participant diaries and at baseline, day 7 and study cessation (after 7-days of treatment or when the participant ceases taking pyridostigmine).
If the participant ceases taking pyridostigmine prior to the end of the 7 days, the diary will be ceased at the same time.</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the efficacy of pyridostigmine by comparing if there is a net increase in pain scores as measured by the SAS when the anticholinergic medications people are receiving are as adjuvant agents to improve analgesia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be collected in the participant diary using the Symptom Assessment Scale (SAS). This will occur daily from baseline until day 14 or study cessation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the efficacy of pyridostigmine by whether there is an improvement in the persons self-reported Global impression of change over the first 7 days compared to the second 7 days</outcome>
      <timepoint>This will be assessed on day 7 and study cessation (after 7-days of treatment or when the participant ceases taking pyridostigmine) using the Global Impression of Change (GIC) Scale.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Constipation is a common, distressing and serious problem, affecting between 50-90% of people referred to specialist palliative care services. Approximately half of these people do not achieve adequate management of their constipation. The number of people who do not achieve satisfactory symptom relief is not acceptable. So the researchers conducting this study are looking to see if there are more effective ways to treat constipation.
The aim of this study is to explore whether people who are currently taking anticholinergic medications and suffer from constipation, will respond better to a cholinergic agent (pyridostigmine), without affecting other symptoms.</summary>
