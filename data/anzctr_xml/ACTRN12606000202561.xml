  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of lung cancers diagnosed worldwide. Surgical resection offers the best chance for cure for those patients diagnosed with early-stage disease, however, the vast majority of patients experience eventually relapse or metastasis. The rationale of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for early stage NSCLC lies in the possibility of eradicating micro-metastasis disease, so it appears to improve survival by reducing the occurrence of distant metastases. Meta analysis, CALGB 9633, JBR 10 and ANITA trials have shown postoperative (adjuvant) CT after complete resection will prolong survival. On the other hand, Depierre et al had conducted a trial to demonstrate preoperative (neoadjuvant ) chemotherapy in early stage NSCLC appears to improve survival. We need a head to head trial to comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant chemotherapy to answer which treatment model is better to early stager NSCLC. Based on proven activity and survival benefit in advance NSCLC, docetaxel has been introduced into neoadjuvant therapy, even as a potential option in adjuvant setting. The objective of the trial is to determine whether 3 cycles of TP after complete operation will improve survival when compared with 3 cycles of TP prior to complete resection for NSCLC.</summary>
