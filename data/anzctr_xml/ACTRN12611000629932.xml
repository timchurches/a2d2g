  <interventions>
    <interventions>Environmental enrichment: Access to tasks and equipment aimed to increase physical, cognitive and social activity. Example, Nintendo Wii, music books, jigsaw puzzles. Patients have free access to these materials for the two week period of the intervention (and further if they remained an inpatient in the ward) to use at their discretion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Typical rehabilitation environment (un enriched). Patients in the typical rehablitation environment recieve only traditional allied health therapies during working hours. There is no recreational therapy groups, or recreational or diversional therpist and patients are not provided with any material to occupy their time whilst not in therapy.
.All patients who were admitted to the rehabilitation ward for stroke rehabilitation were screened for eligability. Historical data was collected over a 2-3 week period for each patient who consented to participate in the study. The historical data was collected from the time period, 22nd April 2010 until 20th August 2010 in the rehabilitation facility, Rankin Park Centre, New Lambton, 2305.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Activity levels: Proportion of the day spent in physical, cognitive and social activity (%). Behavioural mapping tool was used to estimate the proportion of time spent in each activity during 4, 12 hour days (1 weekday and 1 weekend day in the first week, with the same weekday and weekend day repeated 2 weeks later).
Behavioural mapping observations were made every ten minutes in which the location, people present and activity were noted for each participant.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>An observational study to explore if stroke survivors exposed to an enriched environment during their rehabilitation stay, have greater activity levels than stroke survivors receiving rehabilitation in a typical rehabilitation ward (non enriched setting). It is hypothesised that exposure to an enriched environment will increase activity levels during non therapy times.</summary>
