  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a crossover study design. All participants will complete both the intervention and comparator treatment. 

During the intervention, participants will receive 4 weeks, 3 x 30 minute sessions per week of exercise using Nintendo Wii-Fit games and activities. Games and activities will be selected from the Wii suite relevant to participant deficits and interests. The experimental group will continue to receive usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Due to clinical contrainsts there will no formal washout period. However, it is anticipated that up to 5 days washout period will occur.</interventions>
    <comparator>During the comparator treatment participants will receive 4 weeks of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Usual physiotherapy consists of an individualised treatment program comprising typically daily physiotherapy targeting participant impairments and activity limitations using a combination of motor relearning and Bobath approaches.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>(1) have sustained an acquired brain injury, 
(2) be able to walk at least 10m with supervision (with or without an aid), 
(3) have the ability to understand and follow simple instructions and

    <concealment>Participants will be approached by treating physiotherapist. The study will be explained to them, opportunity will be provided to have questions answered, information sheet will be provided. If screened as suitable to participate and willing to volunteer, participants will sign the consent
form. After initial baseline measures participants will be 
allocated to either experimental or control intervention first using block allocation. Block allocation sequence will be determined by investigator not involved in recruitment and is reliant on availability of research assistant to deliver the intervention.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once first participant was recruited, block allocation sequence commenced. Research assistant availability determined the first 5-week block of eligible participants recruited to recieve the control treatment first and the second to receive the intervention treatment first. Subsequent block allocations will be determined by further research assistant availability and clinical caseload and timeframes as identified by the treating physiotherapist.</sequence>
