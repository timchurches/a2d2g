  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project has been completed and consisted of a randomised trial of six tailored decision
      aids giving patients evidence-based information about faecal occult blood test screening for
      bowel cancer. 314 Australians aged between 50-74 years were recruited from five general
      practices and randomised to received either the tailored decision aid with age-gender and
      family history specific information and values clarification exercise or a standard
      government information sheet.

      The decision aid significantly increased the proportion of people who were informed
      participants in the screening program.</summary>
