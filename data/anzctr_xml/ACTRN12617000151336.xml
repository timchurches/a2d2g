  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves the use of cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion as prophylactic treatment for Graft versus Host disease. Cyclophosphamide will be used in one of 2 available conditioning treatments;  Non-myeloabative and Myeloablative conditioning treatment.

The conditioning treatment selected is determined by the transplant specialist.

Arm 1.Patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation using  intravenous Fludarabine 40mg/m2  daily for 5 day from day -6 to day -2. Busulphan will be administered intravenously at a dose of 3.2mg/kg/day for 4 days from days -5 to  day -2.  Graft Versus Host Disease prophylaxis consisting of post-transplant intravenous  cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg  will be given for 2 days on Day +3 to day +4 with cyclosporin and mycophenolate commencing on D+5.. Cyclosporine at 1.5mg/kg given   twice a day intravenously from Day +5 onwards until the patients has engrafted and is able to tolerate oral cyclosporine. The dose of oral cyclosporine will be re-assessed by their treating physician  at Day +60. Mycophenolate mofetil at  15 mg/kg given three times per day taken oral tablet will be started on day +5. Cyclosporin and Mycophenolate will be stopped as  directed per treating physician

Arm 2. Patients undergoing non-myeloablative transplantation will receive  intravenous Fludarabine 30 mg/m2  daily  for 5 day from days -6 to  day -2 with Intravenous  cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg, given daily for 2 days on day -6 to day -5 in combination with Total body irradiation 200cGy  given once on day -1. Graft Versus Host Disease prophylaxis consisting of post- transplant  intravenous cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg  gien daily  for 2 days on on Day +3 and Day +4,  Tacrolimus tablets   will be given  orally  in 2 divided  doses daily to target blood levels of 5-15 ng/ml from day +5 and re-assessed at Day +60.  Dose is determined by treating physician.  Mycophenolate mofetil 15 mg/kg given three times per day taken oral tablet will be started on day +5. Tacrolimus  and Mycophenolate will be stopped as  directed per treating physician. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will assess the use of cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion as preventative treatment for Graft versus Host disease in patients requiring a haplo-identical stem cell transplant. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are 16  70 years of age and have haematological malignancies requiring allogeneic transplantation, but have no readily available fully HLA-matched related or unrelated donors. Study details All patients will receive peripheral blood stem cell transplant from haploidentical relatives. Patients will either undergo myeloablative  or non- myeloablative conditioning treatments prior to receiving stem cell transplants. The conditioning treatment selected is determined by the transplant specialist. Two groups will then receive a treatment aimed at prevention of Graft versus Host disease after stem cell transplant. If you receive myeloablative conditioning treatment, your post-transplant treatment will include cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg administered on day 3 and day 4 after transplant with cyclosporine [dose calculated on body weight] and mycophenolate [dose calculated on body weight ] commencing on day 5 after transplant.  If you receive non- myeloablative conditioning treatment, your post-transplant treatment will include cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg administered on day 3 and day 4 after transplant with tacrolimus [dose calculated on body weight] and mycophenolate [dose calculated on body weight] commencing on day 5 after transplant. Total duration of treatment will depend if graft versus host diseas develops and how severe. It is anticiapted adding cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion will prevent  Graft versus Host disease  or affect the rate of acute and chronic Graft versus Host disease  </summary>
