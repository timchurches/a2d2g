    <inclusivecriteria>-Be able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by signing a record of informed consent;
-Be at least 18 years old;
-Be of East Asian ethnicity (either Japanese, Chinese, Taiwanese or Korean);
-Be willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by the investigator;
-Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses; 
-Have vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses;
-Be experienced or may be inexperienced at wearing contact lenses.
-Have a current spectacle correction.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses;
-Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
-Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications or participation in any clinical trial which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or risk providing a false positive. 
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial;  
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Contact lens wear within 1 calendar day of initial lens fitting (washout period to be performed post enrolment if necessary) 
-Allergy or intolerance to topical anaesthetics</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Subjects will be randomly allocated (allocation concealment performed by central randomisation by computer) to wear  each lens type (Focus 1-2 week, Focus Monthly and Freshlook Handling tint) for 1 month each over a 3 month period. The person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware as to which group the subject would be allocated.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation list (which will be generated by computer) will be generated based on a crossover design where each subject receives all the study products.</sequence>
