  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as PR-104, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects
      of chemotherapy. Giving PR-104 together with G-CSF may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PR-104 when given
      together with G-CSF in treating patients with solid tumors.</summary>
