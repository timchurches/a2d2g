  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be assigned a standard full-face mask and an under-chin full-face mask (two interventions).

Mask interfaces for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) can cover the patient's nose, mouth or both.  A standard full-face mask forms a seal from the bridge of the nose to just underneath the lower lip.  An under-chin full-face mask is larger, and forms a seal from the bridge of the nose to underneath the lower jaw.

Each mask will be worn for two consecutive nights, for as long as the patient is asleep (at least four hours per night).  

There will be no washout between the three arms.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients will be assigned a standard nasal cushion mask as control.

A standard nasal cushion mask forms a seal from the bridge of the nose to the upper lip (i.e. covers the nose only).  For most patients, this type of mask is the first one tried, and a switch to an alternative (full-face) mask will only occur if this mask type does not fit standard criteria for an air-tight, comfortable seal.

This mask will be worn for two consecutive nights, for as long as the patient is asleep (at least four hours per night).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When patients are established on CPAP treatment, they must first undergo a titration study of some description which determines the pressure required to hold the upper airway open.  Most patients are assigned a nasal mask in the first instance, and will be swapped to a full-face mask if the nasal mask is not tolerated or does not form an adequate airtight seal.  We have noted in our laboratory that standard full-face masks require higher therapeutic pressures than nasal masks, and think this may because a standard full-face mask places pressure on the lower jaw, pushing it back and narrowing the upper airway.  We therefore aim to test the hypothesis that masks which seal over the nose only, or full-face masks that seal underneath the chin, require a similar therapeutic pressure which is significantly lower than that required with a standard full-face mask.</summary>
