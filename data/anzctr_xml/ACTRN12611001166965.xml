Arm 2 
The ankle block dexamethasone group will receive 8 mg (2 ml) dexamethasone added into the ropivacaine ankle block and 2 ml saline intravenously.</interventions>

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be provided with a patient information sheet at their preoperative visit. At the subsequent preoperative consultation, the surgeon will obtain verbal and written consent.

Subjects will be randomly allocated to a group using sealed opaque envelopes. A nurse who is not involved in the care of the enrolled subject will open the envelope and follow the instructions to draw up two syringes, one for the block and one for intravenous administration.

These syringes will be marked 'block' and 'intravenous' and given to the anaesthetist by another nurse.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Post operative pain following ankle and foot surgery is troublesome. It is common practice for regional anaesthetic blockade to be used to prolong post operative pain relief for about 14 hours. Dexamethasone has been shown to prolong regional blockade in the upper limb, but this has not been investigated in the lower limb. The optimal route of administration for dexamethasone has not been investigated and it is unknown whether there is advantage to administering dexamethasone intravenously, or mixed with the block. We aim to investigate whether dexamethasone can prolong regional anaesthesia in the lower limb and determine if there are differences in effect when administered intravenously compared with when it is added to the block.</summary>
