    <studytitle>Standard versus mIninal Monitoring : Pragmatic triaL in hepatItis C Treatment </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In adults planned to begin treatment with 12 weeks of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir for Genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection, or Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir for genotype 3 hepatitis C, does minimal monitoring lead to a similar chance of cure with reduced staff time and good patient acceptability compared to a current standard monitoring regimen?  </scientifictitle>

Patients are treated exactly the same as if they were not in a trial apart from the degree of monitoring (which will be LESS than in the standard arm. 
Treatment is with either 12 weeks of Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir for Genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection, or Sofosbuvir/Daclatasvir for genotype 3 hepatitis C.
Face to face clinic appointment at base line and prescription dispensing, week 4 phonecall and week 12 phonecall to make sure they are taking their medications and they are ok. week 24 FBC, EUC, LFTs, HCV qualitative viral load,

    <statisticalmethods> Note that this is a pilot study, and thus the sample size is largely based on feasibility (the number of patients we can reasonably expect to enrol within the timeframe). As pointed out in a recent JAMA editorial (JAMA. 2015; 314(15):1561-1562), such studies not only do not need to be based on sample size analyses, but should actively avoid formal hypothesis testing. Their key aim should be road testing measurement tools and refining assumptions in order to inform the design of a subsequent definitive trial. 
It will include unplanned interactions  e.g. following up on abnormal blood test results, or dealing with concerns/enquiries/adverse events reported by participants. 

The total number of minutes will be summarised for each group, as a mean if it is normally distributed and as a median if not, and the total in the 2 groups will be compared using a Students t test or Mann Whitney U test as appropriate. 

3) Patient satisfaction. This is an unknown quantity and part of the rationale for doing a pilot study. The key element of the survey used as the co-primary endpoint will be the overall satisfaction score at both 12 weeks. For each individual patient, these 2 scores (out of 10) will be averaged. This average score for each patient will then be summarised for the whole group as for the staff hours above. 
Analysis will be by intention to treat  all participants will be counted in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of the actual amount of monitoring received. 

Due to the small sample size, there will only be 2 subgroup analyses:

a.	Genotype (1 or 3)
b.	Site (JHH, RBWH or RDH)

For the subsequent definitive RCT, the primary endpoint will be a simple non-inferiority design with a tight margin and SVR as the primary outcome. If there is truly no difference between the standard and experimental arms, then 894 patients are required to have 90% power to show that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) will exclude a difference in favour of the standard group of more than 5%. Accounting for loss to follow up, this would require approximately 1000 patients. This would be achievable by including multiple sites (e.g. 10-15) over 12 months, but would require dedicated funding.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In March 2016, several new, all oral treatments became available in Australia for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, bringing the interferon era to a close. These new treatments are much easier to take and more effective than the previous standard treatment, which was based on an injected medicine called interferon. 

Although we know these new treatments are very safe with side effect rates in clinical trials similar to placebo (sugar pills), we dont know exactly how much monitoring is needed during a course of treatment. A standard monitoring plan has recently been developed by Australian experts, but this is based on what we know of the new treatments, and it has never been directly compared with less intensive monitoring. 
For the old interferon-based treatments, patients had some blood tests and a clinic appointment every 2 to 4 weeks for at least 24 weeks. For the new all-oral treatments, we know that much less intense monitoring is needed, but different monitoring strategies have not been tested in clinical trials. 

The purpose of SIMPLICITY is to compare standard monitoring with minimal monitoring, to determine if minimal monitoring results in similar cure rates but with lower cost and better patient satisfaction. The SIMPLICITY trial is being co-ordinated by Associate Professor Joshua Davis, who is based at John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle, and at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. It aims to enrol a total of 100 participants at two sites in Australia (Darwin and Newcastle).
There are no medications being given specifically as part of this study. You will receive the same medications whether or not you choose to take part in this study. The only difference between the two study arms is the number of blood tests and clinic visits during your course of treatment.
