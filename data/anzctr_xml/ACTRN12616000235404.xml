  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a retrospective evaluation of a lifestyle intervention program that has been running at a health service for 2 years. 
Intervention group participants would have participated in an 8 week multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program. The program comprised of 8 once-weekly 2.5 hour group education and exercise sessions with or without an additional 1 hour exercise session per week. The education sessions were based on adult learning principals and were conducted in the health service. Topics changed over time (dependent on staffing), and may have included healthy eating, mental health, making changes, medication management, exercise and GP involvement in the management of health conditions and where to get support in the community. Exercise sessions were conducted in the health service or in the community and included walking, water exercise and local gym exercise. </interventions>
    <comparator>This retrospective study will match participants with metabolic syndrome who attended the lifestyle intervention program to control participants with metabolic syndrome who were referred to the program but did not attend. Participants will be matched according to age (+/- 5 years) and sex. 
Both intervention and control group participants would have received usual care from the health service (e.g. outpatient appointments, medical, nursing and allied health as required) and in the community (e.g. GP care).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of potentially avoidable hospital presentations to the health service per group will be identified by screening central hospital medical records (which cover the 5 hospital sites affiliated with the health service).   
Potentially avoidable hospitalisations are admissions to hospital that could have potentially been prevented through the provision of appropriate non-hospital health services. Potentially avoidable presentations to an emergency department are those where the patient: 1) is triaged as a category 4 or 5; 2) did not arrive by ambulance, police or correctional vehicle; and 3) was not admitted to hospital not referred to another hospital or did not die.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Hospital records will be screened from the date that a participant was referred to the lifestyle intervention program up until March 1, 2016.  </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence or absence of metabolic syndrome and metabolic syndrome risk factors as defined by the International Diabetes Federation; National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; American Heart Association; World Heart Federation; International Atherosclerosis Society; and the International Association for the Study of Obesity joint statement will be assessed by screening medical records.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence of impaired glucose tolerance (elevated fasting glucose 100mg/dL or more, or on drug therapy for elevated glucose or with a diagnosis of pre-diabetes or diabetes) will be assessed by screening medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence of overweight and obesity (elevated waist circumference using population specific definitions or Body Mass Index using World Health Organization definitions) will be assessed by screening hospital medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence of dislipidemia (elevated triglycerides 1.7mmol/L or more, or on drug therapy for elevated triglycerides, or reduced HDL cholesterol &lt;1.0mmol/L for males or &lt;1.3mmol/L for females or on drug therapy for reduced HDL cholesterol) will be assessed by screening medical records.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence of cardiovascular disease will be assessed by screening medical records for documented diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>At the health service, exercise endurance is assessed as part of routine practice, using the 6 minute walk test, before and after the lifestyle intervention program. Therefore, only intervention group participants will have this data available for extraction from their medical records for the retrospective evaluation.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>Exercise endurance measured on a participants' completion of the lifestyle program (week 8) will be the primary endpoint in this retrospective evaluation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist circumference (cm) is assessed as part of routine practice at the health service at baseline (week 0) and on completion of the program (week 8) for the participants who complete the lifestyle intervention program. This data will be extracted from medical records for the retrospective evaluation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Waist circumference measured on a participants' completion of the lifestyle program (week 8) will be the primary endpoint in this retrospective evaluation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Weight (kg) is assessed as part of routine practice at the health service at baseline (week 0) and on completion of the program (week 8) for the participants who complete the lifestyle intervention program. This data will be extracted from medical records for the retrospective evaluation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Weight measured on a participants' completion of the lifestyle program (week 8) will be the primary endpoint in this retrospective evaluation. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of hypertension (systolic 130mmHg or more and/or diastolic 85mmHg or more, or on antihypertensive drug therapy in a person with a history of hypertension) will be assessed by screening medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be screened for information from the date that the participant was referred to the intervention program until March 1, 2016. The most recent medical record data available will be used as the primary endpoint. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One quarter of the worlds adults have metabolic syndrome. Lifestyle modification appears to be the key to reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes in this population but there are no established, replicable program guidelines that can be used by health services to promote healthy lifestyle habits for people with metabolic syndrome. There is also no research to support the effect of such lifestyle programs for people with metabolic syndrome in terms of avoidable hospital presentations. 
This retrospective study aims to evaluate the effects of a novel multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention program, embedded in a health service, which aims to empower adults with metabolic syndrome to make behavior changes to reduce metabolic risk factors to prevent progression to chronic disease and reduce associated potentially avoidable hospital presentations. This program has been running at the health service for 2 years. This retrospective study will analyze routinely collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the program. </summary>
