    <interventions>Weight loss using very low energy diet in addition to usual rehabilitation care. 
The very low energy diet will consist of replacement of breakfast and lunch with a VLED preparation (Optifast R-260kCal per replacment, nutritionally complete). 
Dinner will either be a third VLED preparation, or a low carbohydrate meal, based on participant preference or rate of weight loss (if weight loss slow, recommend replacement of all meals). 
Participants with a body mass index (BMI) of 50-60 will have an extra VLED (260kCal) preparation per day, due to increased metabolic rate of this group compared with the 40-50 BMI group. This will be taken at any time during the day, or divided, as desired.
This will continue for 12 weeks.
Regarding adherence, participants will be encouraged to fill out a food diary. </interventions>
    <comparator>General Healthy eating advice according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating in addition to usual rehabilitation care. The dietitian will review each participant, face to face, for approximately 30 minutes, and give the participant a pamphlet on the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, at randomisation and on discharge from the ward.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is common in older persons and predisposes to physical disability and loss of independence. After a hospitalisation for an illness or surgery, older people may have to go to a rehabilitation ward to get back to their previous abilities in their home and environment (ie their physical function), to be able to do everything they could do previously. 
Older people who carry a lot of extra weight may be at increased risk than others in the same age group of not being able to get back to their previous abilities after going to hospital, or it may take longer for them to get back to their previous state.
Recent research has found that rapid, significant weight loss achieved with Very Low Energy Diets (VLEDs) were safe and effective in improving physical function. This treatment may be useful for improving the function of older, obese people who are on the rehabilitation ward, but we have not tested weight loss with a VLED in this situation.
We would like to see whether it is possible to get people to start a weight loss program while a rehabilitation inpatient, and continue it for 12 weeks, even if they go home during that period. We would like to see which approach leads to better and/or faster improvements in physical function; usual rehabilitation care plus general healthy eating advice (ie the care people receive now) or usual rehabilitation care plus weight loss with a VLED.
We will offer certain patients aged between 50 and 80 years of age who have a BMI between 40 and 60 the opportunity to join this study, the doctor on the ward will assess whether the study is suitable for the particular patient. Patients who meet the criteria (the inclusion criteria) and agree to be in the study will be randomly allocated to either the VLED group or the healthy eating group in addition to usual rehabilitation care  for every 2 patients allocated to the VLED group, one will be allocated to the healthy eating group.
