  <interventions>
    <interventions>A group of overweight adults with pre-diabetes or diet-controlled diabetes will be randomised to receive a faecal microbial transplant (FMT) from either a lean healthy donor or their own gut microbiota. The donated faeces will be homogenised with 500 mL of normal saline in a blender and all of the 500 mL will be infused via colonoscopy into the colon of the recipient. The colonoscopy will take approximately 20 minutes and will be performed by a gastroenterologist. Measurements of weight, HbA1c, fasting glucose and insulin, and oral glucose tolerance test will be performed at regular intervals post-FMT to determine effect of gut microbiota transfer on weight and glucose metabolism. No specific strategies to monitor adherence are required.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>As this is a pilot study, the sample size is small and partly determined by what is felt to be an achievable number to recruit over the study period. Feasibility of recruitment will be assessed during the study. 
We will analyse the results using a mixed models approach, which takes into account repeated measurements in individuals and allows comparison at different time points using Tukey post-hoc tests.  Statistical analyses will be performed using the most recent version of SPSS software. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is growing evidence that gut microbiota is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. In humans, there is very little data on the effect of gut microbiota transfer on glucose metabolism. The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of performing colonic faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in overweight pre-diabetic/diabetic adults and any potential metabolic effects of altering human colonic microbiota on insulin sensitivity. </summary>
