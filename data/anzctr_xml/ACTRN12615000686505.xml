  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two versions of three hour practical sessions incorporating standardised patient scenarios, (a) with and (b) without student review of video feedback, in assessment and mobilisation of patients in a 2nd year physiotherapy subject (PS200). 
The three hour practical sessions are administered in small groups (35-40) of students, working in groups of four. Each group of four students is facilitated by a physiotherapy clinical educator.
The standardised patient scenario activity involves two 30 minute patient interactions, with students working in pairs.    One pair of students work in the roles of lead therapist / assistant and the other pair of students in the roles of observers.  After 15 minutes, the student pairs switch roles. The students acting a lead therapist / assistant are required to plan and prepare the physical environment, assess the patients capacity to for safe transfer, explain the planned mobility task to the patient and assistant, reassure the patient  and complete a safe and effective assited patient mobility task (sitting on edge of bed, standing / walking,  sitting out  of bed).   The students acting in the role of observers are required to complete a peer feedback checklist.  

Prior to the first standardised patient scenario activity, all student are provided with a 30 minutes of preparatory time facilitated by physiotherapy clinical educator, where they are provided with a description of the patient (patient vignette) a picture of the attachments that the patient will have, and instructions regarding their task for the session and their roles as either lead therapist / assistant or observer. The task the students are given is to mobilise the patient and guidance regarding how to proceed is provided-  eg a brief assessment of the patient to ensure that the patient has the capacity to mobilise and then to mobilise the patient to sit out of bed and the timetable for the session. 
At the completion of each standardised patient scenario activity, students move into a separate room to debrief about their session. The debrief sessions, facilitated by physiotherapy clinical educator focus on self-reflection of their performance and the opportunity for peer feedback and review of video feedback is provided. 

For the video feedback, the interaction of the lead therapist / assistant and the patient is recorded on an ipad by a student in the observer role. The video feedback, comprises a replay of each of the patient scenarios and is administered in the debrief session which follows immediately from the patient interaction.  At the completion of the debrief session, all video footage is deleted.  

Over the course of the 3 hour practical session, each group has two 30 minute patient interactions, and two, 30 minute debrief sessions immediately following their patient interactions.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The three hour practical sessions are administered in small groups (35-40) of students, working in groups of four overseen by a total of three physiotherapy clinical educators. Each group of students are provided with a brief, detailed patient scenario and a mobility task for the scenario (e.g. to sit patient out of bed). Over the three hour practical session, the students work through 3-4 different patient scenarios, rotating through the roles of patient, lead therapist, assistant and observer. At the completion of each patient scenario, a group debrief is conducted incorporating peer and facilitator feedback and the opportunity for reflection by the students. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The main outcome measures were participant recruitment, retention and survey response rates, whether the training and workshops were delivered as scheduled and costs for SPs and staff training and workshop attendance. Before and after the practical session participants will complete a 10-item survey with statements that cover communication, confidence, preparedness for placement and self-perception of their ability to conduct communicative, practical and reasoning skills. Participants respond to each statement on the survey by marking a visual analogue scale between zero (strongly disagree) and 10 (strongly agree). This survey has previously been used in evaluating simulated learning experiences by students. Student perceived preparedness for placement will be compared for each intervention arm using paired t tests. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe and explore the feasibility measures, participants characteristics, survey responses and OSCE scores. Pre-post workshop changes in perceived confidence, perceived preparedness for clinical placement and satisfaction with the use of the SP scenarios were examined within the intervention groups for each of the ten items of the survey using paired t-tests. Averages of OSCE scores and number of fails observed for students in each of the study groups will be reported but due to non-random allocation will not be statistically compared. The software package SPSS v17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all analyses.
Written comments provided to open ended questions by participants will be de identified, extracted verbatim and collated. Comments will be reviewed and those with common content grouped into major and minor categories. Organisation of extracts into categories will be discussed with a second researcher until consensus is reached and a descriptive summary generated including examples of data excerpts to illustrate the categories.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Using simulated learning environments with standardised patients (SPs) provides a way to scaffold the development of skills for patient safety in a low risk environment. There are no data regarding whether adding SP interactions in early years of physiotherapy training improves safe performance on clinical placement. We aimed to assess the feasibility of recruiting and collecting data from junior physiotherapy students during an SP workshop with a pilot non-randomised trial, also assessing time, cost and scheduling information.

Second year physiotherapy students were invited to participate and allocated to either the SP workshop in a simulated hospital environment (with and without video feedback) or usual teaching comprising peer role play. The main outcome measures were participant recruitment, retention and survey response rates, whether the training and workshops were delivered as scheduled and costs for SPs and staff training and workshop attendance. Students self-reported confidence, communication, preparedness for clinic and satisfaction was measured using pre-post surveys.
