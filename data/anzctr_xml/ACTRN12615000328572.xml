  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a web-based parenting program ('Parenting Strategies: preventing depression and anxiety') which is part of a larger research translation program (Parenting Strategies; www.parentingstrategies.net).
Parents will first complete an online Parent Survey (developed specifically for use in this study) that assesses their current parenting practices against the recommendations in the Guidelines 'How to Prevent Depression and Clinical Anxiety in Your Teenager: Strategies for Parents' (Parenting Strategies Program, 2013; henceforth the Guidelines). Based on their responses to this survey, parents in the intervention group will then (1) receive an individually-tailored feedback report that highlights areas where they are doing well (i.e., concordant with the Guidelines) and areas where they can improve (i.e., not concordant with the Guidelines), and (2) be given access to the web-based parenting intervention (up to 9 modules) to support them in making changes to identified areas of weakness in their parenting. Specific modules are recommended to parents based on their responses to the baseline Parent Survey.

Feedback messages are brief, with practical strategies provided in dot point form, and are designed to motivate behaviour change. Parents in the intervention group will view their feedback report online immediately after submitting their online baseline assessment and being randomly allocated to the intervention group. They will also be emailed a copy of their feedback report, the Parenting Guidelines, and instructions on accessing the interactive web-based parenting program with their recommended modules. Upon logging in to their parenting program, parents will see their recommended modules as well as other available modules. They can further tailor their parenting program at this stage by deselecting recommended modules and/or selecting additional modules. They then confirm their selection and can commence their personalised program. The 9 modules comprising the intervention are derived from topics covered in the Parenting Guidelines. Modules include illustrations, audio clips, vignettes, interactive activities, goal-setting exercises, and an end-of-module quiz with immediate feedback to consolidate learning. The module topics include: parent-child relationship, parental involvement and autonomy granting, encouraging supportive relationships, establishing family rules, minimising conflict in the home, encouraging good health habits, problem solving, managing anxiety, and help seeking. Each module is designed to help parents make changes to their parenting so as to be more in concordance with the Guidelines. Each module takes about 15-25 minutes to complete. Parents are invited to complete their first module immediately after they have completed their baseline survey and received their feedback report. Thereafter they are encouraged to complete one module a week (in a set order) until they have completed their whole program. Their access to their parenting program will remain open indefinitely.
All parent participants, regardless of group, will receive a weekly phone call from a researcher, starting 7 days after completing their baseline survey, and every week thereafter for at least 5 weeks The total number of weekly calls will match the number of modules in each parent's tailored parenting program; but if they have less than 5 modules, they will still receive 5 calls. Research staff will be trained to make these calls following a standard script (i.e. a standard list of questions and prompts), and will not provide individual advice or therapy. The aims of these calls are to address any study-related questions that arise, ascertain that parents progress through their allocated intervention each week till completion, and enhance retention.</interventions>
    <comparator>Parents in the control group are provided with a standardized package of educational materials about adolescent development and mental health via the trial website. Parent participants receive an email a week which provides a link to the corresponding webpage with their information factsheet for that week, for 5 weeks (to match the expected mean number of modules received by the intervention group). This package provides general information to parents as opposed to tailored, actionable strategies, and is designed to represent a selection of resources that are available to parents as part of the current health promotion approach for adolescent wellbeing. The materials will be adapted from credible existing resources provided on the Raising Children Network website http://raisingchildren.net.au.

Parents and adolescents will not be excluded if the adolescent scores in the clinically elevated range (as determined by published clinical cut-off scores) on either the SMFQ or SCAS (either parent- or child-report form) at baseline. However, by assessing baseline symptoms, we will be able to conduct post-hoc analyses in which we exclude adolescents who scored above the clinical cut-off scores at baseline.
The cut-off scores used are as follows:
SMFQ (parent- or child-report versions): 8 or more
SCAS (Child-report):
For male children: Scores of 48 or more.
For female children: Scores of 51 or more.
SCAS (Parent-report):
For male children: Scores of 24 or more.
For female children: Scores of 26 or more.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>When parents submit their baseline assessment on the trial website, the website will generate an automated random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group. Parents find out their assignment immediately thereafter: the intervention group receives their tailored feedback, the Parenting Guidelines, and the online parenting program comprising up to 9 modules which are recommended based on their survey responses; whereas the control group receive the first of their five weekly factsheets. As such, allocation is concealed from both participants and researchers prior to assignment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The trial website is programmed to run a random allocation sequence to allocate parent-adolescent dyads to either the control or intervention group, immediately after parents submit their baseline assessment online.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>"The people administering the treatment/s" are "masked" because the intervention is delivered online by a fully automated trial website.

Child informants ("people assessing the outcomes") are assumed to be blinded because they are not direct recipients of the web-based parenting intervention.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Required sample size:
Based on a power analysis, for a repeated-measures design with a power of 0.80, small effect size (Cohen's d=0.2), and alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 294 parent-adolescent dyads (147 dyads per group) is required.
Based on an expected attrition rate of approximately 10-15%, we aim to recruit 338 parent-adolescent dyads (169 dyads per group).

Data analysis:
The main analyses will be intent-to-treat. To assess group differences in changes in parental concordance with the Guidelines (primary outcome 1) and adolescent depression and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes) across timepoints (baseline, 3 month and 12 month follow-up), a series of mixed effects analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) will be conducted. Adolescent age and gender will be used as covariates.
Little's MCAR (missing completely at random) test will be used to analyse the extent and pattern of missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of an individually-tailored web-based parenting program on parenting behaviours associated with adolescent depression and anxiety disorders. The program is designed to provide parents with (1) personalised feedback about their current parenting, including what they are doing well and areas that they can improve in order to reduce their teenagers risk of depression and anxiety, and (2) specific modules of the web-based parenting intervention recommended based on their survey responses to support them in making changes to identified areas for improvement in their parenting. We aim to find out whether this program can help improve parenting behaviours associated with adolescent depression and anxiety, and in turn reduce risk of depression and anxiety in teenagers.</summary>
