  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.
The investigator assessed the relationship of each AE to the use of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) and to ribavirin, and rated the severity of each event as either:
Mild: The AE was transient and easily tolerated by the participant; Moderate: The AE caused the participant discomfort and interrupted usual activities; Severe: The AE caused considerable interference with the participant's usual activities and could have been incapacitating or life-threatening.
A serious adverse event was any event that resulted in death, was life-threatening, resulted in or prolonged hospitalization, resulted in a congenital anomaly or persistent or significant disability or was any other important medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration (up to 28 weeks).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks Post-dose for 8 Weeks Versus 12 Weeks of Treatment With 3 DAAs and Ribavirin - The percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug (SVR24), defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), without any confirmed quantifiable (= LLOQ) post-treatment value before that time point. HCV RNA levels were measured from plasma by a central laboratory. The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison between treatment-naïve participants following 8 weeks of treatment with 3 DAAs and ribavirin and those with 12 weeks of treatment with 3 DAAs and ribavirin (Group A versus Group G).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post Treatment Week 24</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks Post-dose Following Treatment of Different Durations With 3 Direct-acting Antiviral Agents (DAAs) and Ribavirin - This outcome measure compares the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at post-treatment Week 24) following treatment with 3 DAAs (ABT-450/ritonavir, ABT-267, and ABT-333) and ribavirin in both treatment naïve and null-responder participants for 8 weeks (Group A) versus 12 weeks (Groups F + G + K + L) versus 24 weeks (Groups H + I + M + N).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks Post-dose Following Treatment for 12 Weeks With 2 DAAs and Ribavirin Versus 3 DAAs and Ribavirin - This outcome measure compares the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks post-dose (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at post-treatment Week 24) following treatment with 2 DAAs (ABT-450/ritonavir plus ABT-333 [Group B] or ABT-450/ritonavir plus ABT-267 [Groups C + D + J]) and ribavirin versus 3 DAAs (ABT-450/ritonavir plus ABT-333 and ABT-267) and ribavirin (Groups F + G + K + L).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks Post-dose Following Treatment for 12 Weeks With 3 DAAs With Versus Without Ribavirin - This outcome measure compares the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks post-dose (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at post-treatment Week 24) following treatment with 3 DAAs with or without ribavirin (Group E versus Groups F + G + K + L).</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response 24 Weeks Post-dose in Treatment-naïve Versus Null-responders - This outcome measure compares the percentage of participants achieving sustained virologic response 24 weeks post-dose (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at post-treatment Week 24) following treatment with 3 DAAs and ribavirin in participants who were treatment-naïve versus those who were null-responders to previous HCV therapy (Groups F + G + H + I versus Groups K + L + M + N).</outcome>
