  <interventions>
    <interventions>thalidomide - 100mg/day; 6 months, tablets orally
pentoxifylline - 400mg, three times/day; 6 months, tablets orally
colchicine - 0.5mg/day for 7 days; 1.0mg/day for 7 days; 1.5mg/day as maintenance dose; 6 months, tablets orally
dapsone - 25mg/day for 3 days; 50mg/day for 3 days; 75mg/day for 3 days; 100mg/day as maintenance dose; 6 months, tablets orally.
Subjects will receive any of the drugs listed above,  switching from one drug to another according to their response to treatment and severity of adverse effects.
Subjects will be followed fortnightly for a 6-month period during medication use, and monthly for another 6 months of follow-up period.
As an open trial designs it will be considered the thalidomide group as a comparator (active control) due to the good results registered in previous trials, nevertheless the study will show some characteristics of a crossover study since if a patient do not get any improvement or exhibit severe adverse effects to the first given drug, that subject will be allocated to another testing drug.</interventions>
    <comparator>to compare the power of preventing RAS bouts among the four drugs tested.
There is no standard treatment for severe RAS bouts, nevertheless thalidomide treatment should be considered as the best comparator due to good results obtained by previous trials. 
Thalidomide, 100mg tablets, one per day, up to 6 months, avoiding its prescription to fertile women.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>% of reduction of RAS bouts in patients with severe RAS manifestations.
Patients will be examined every two weeks during the period of medication use, for a 6-month period, when it will be recorded the history and clinical characteristics of RAS manifestations: number and frequency of relapses, number of lesions per bout and symptoms level (assessed by a five level scale - worsened, no improvement, mild improvement, moderate improvement and excellent improvement).
Subjects will be followed up monthly for another 6 months after medication withdrawal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at every two weeks, during 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse effects associated to each drug tested.
Patients on dapsone use will have their G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) level checked before starting the drug and once a month during its use. Thalidomide will not be prescribed to fertile women.
Side effects will be categorized into three types: mild- minor gastrointestinal pain and transitory nausea; moderate- dizziness, fatigue, diarrhea, lethargy and headache; severe- hemolysis, jaundice and decreased hemoglobin level. 
Adverse effects will be clinically assessed at patient's examination every two weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at every two weeks, during the time of drug administration, i.e., 6 months.</timepoint>
