  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 8 weeks will examine the effect of aged garlic extract on aerobic capacity during moderate intensity exercise, measured by predicted VO2max, and arterial stiffness, indicated by pulse wave velocity and augmentation pressure, in a group of sedentary adults, compared with placebo. The active treatment group will be allocated to two daily capsules of aged garlic extract (1.2 g Kyolic Reserve, 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine (SAC)). 

Compliance will be assessed by return of trial capsules, as well as diary entries. Patients will be instructed to mark each day in provided calendars when they have taken the trial and prescription medications, and bring the calendar and the remaining trial medication to their next appointment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be allocated to two daily capsules of placebo capsules matched in appearance and size to the active treatment capsules. Capsules will be packaged in identical opaque containers including a sachet of activated carbon to eliminate any odour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Aerobic capacity will be measured by VO2max (mL/kg/min) using the YMCA Submaximal Cycle Ergometer Test. The test is a non-invasive, submaximal exercise protocol in which heart rate-workload points are obtained and extrapolated to age-predicted maximal heart rate of the participant  calculated by subtracting the participants age from 220.  VO2max is then predicted from the determined maximal workload (the maximal amount of work produced).
The test consists of 3x3-minute stages.  The ergometers resistance is increased incrementally  each stage selected with respect to the participants heart rate in the third minute of each stage.
The first stage will be set at 25 Watts, Stages 2 and 3  are set according to the participant's heart rate in the 3rd or 4th minute of the preceding stage, following the YMCA submaximal cycle test protocol by Nieman D (2010 in Book: Exercise Testing and Prescription. McGraw-Hill Education)</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks compared with baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation pressure will be measured before and after each exercise testing session using a Mobil-O-Graph  an electronic blood pressure monitoring system, comprised of an arm cuff and software tool for Pulse Wave Analysis. The device has been shown to be reliable in estimating PWV (Salvade et al., 2015). This is a composite primary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Testing is performed before and after the exercise at 8 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of exertion by Borgs Rated Perceived Exertion (RPE) 10-point scale (Borg, 1998) </outcome>
      <timepoint>Testing is performed at the end of the third within the fourth minute of each of the 3x3 min stages immediately prior to increasing the workload to the next stage of the exercise test at 8 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Lactate (hLa) to RPE ratio
Blood samples will be obtained from the right index finger, using an Accu-Chek Safe-T-Pro Plus single use lancing device (www.accu-chek.com.au) and analysed using the Lactate Pro 2 analyser (www.lactatepro.com.au) (Coutts 2007; Miller 2012). hLa:RPE will then be calculated by dividing the blood lactate concentration by the corresponding RPE score, and multiplying it by 100 (Garcin 2002).  This ratio will be determined for each of the 3x3 min stages of the exercise test, to ascertain whether supplementation with aged garlic extract has an effect on perceived exertion at a relative intensity, compared with placebo.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
A sample size of 80 participants (40 in active / 40 in placebo group) was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
a)	A significant difference in the change of pulse wave velocity (PWV) of 0.5 m/s with the power of 80% and 95% confidence was found in (Ried 2015), assuming a population mean (SD) of 9. 5 (1.5) m/s.
b) To account for 10% drop-out or non-attendance at all appointments

Statistical significance will be set at p &lt; 0.05. Continuous variables (e.g. age, VO2max) will be compared between groups using Students t-test, and categorical variables (e.g. gender, BMI category) by chi-square test.
The difference in means between groups will be compared using Students t­-test for normally distributed data (Mann­-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data) as well as ANCOVA. 
Paired t­-test will be used to compare the pre­ and post-­intervention data within groups for normally distributed data (Wilcoxon signed­-rank test for non-­normally distributed data).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent research has shown Kyolic aged garlic extract to improve cardiovascular function, including peripheral and central blood pressure and arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is inversely correlated to aerobic capacity. Additionally, animal and clinical data have linked aged garlic extract to ameliorate physical fatigue, increase exercise tolerance and increased oxygen uptake. 

This study aims to investigate the effect of 2-month supplementation of aged garlic extract compared to placebo on arterial stiffness and aerobic fitness measured by oxygen uptake, lactate levels and muscle fatigue (as 'lactate to rated perceived exertion (RPE) ratio),  in a group of sedentary adults during moderate intensity exercise.</summary>
