  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial of the effectiveness of four active treatments and placebo in the management of episodes of breakthrough bleeding in women using the progestogen-only, sub dermal implant contraceptive, Implanon. Implanon provides the near-zero-order release of the progestogen, etonogestrel, over a three year period. Treatment will be randomised to one of five arms. Each treatment will be given twice daily for 5 days in a complex arrangement which allows the following measurements:

1 Mifepristone 25mgs taken twice on day 1 followed by 4 days of ethinyl oestradiol, 20 micrograms each morning and placebo each evening.
2 Doxycycline 100mgs taken twice daily for 5 days.
3 Doxycycline 100mg plus ethinyl oestradiol 20 micrograms in the morning, and doxycycline 100 mg in the evening, for 5 days.
4 Doxycycline 100mg plus mifepristone 25mg twice on the first day and then doxycycline 100 mg taken twice daily for 4 days.
Each of these blinded treatments will be taken once a month for 3 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>There are 6 secondary end points which study the number of days of bleeding and spotting immediately following the initiation of the 5 day course of therapy, compared with the other 3 active therapies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparisons will also be made with the total number of days, episodes and duration of bleeding within the successive 90 day "reference period" following the initiation of treatment.  Comparisons will be made with placebo and with the other 3 active therapies.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Identical opaque gelatin capsules will be assigned and presented in identical foil blister packs in sealed numbered envelopes. Sealed master envelopes have been prepared by the blister pack manufacturer and sent directly to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board and to the Chief Executive Officer of FPA Health. The treatment codes will only be broken following completion of the analysis of the primary end point.  Therefore, allocation concealment will be maintained until the end of the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer generation of a random number table for each centre, in blocks with equal numbers in the 5 treatment groups (generated by an independent statistician) and placed in sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes.</sequence>
