      <outcome>Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Scores at Baseline - The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities over past week. Each question is evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale. Total score for HAQ-DI is the average of all questions and ranges from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do.</outcome>

      <outcome>Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joint Count (DAS28) Score by Visit - The DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores representing higher disease activity, and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x vTJC28 + 0.28 x vSJC28 + 0.70 x natural logarithm (ln) (CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly. A score of less than 2.6 represents clinical remission, a score of greater than or equal to 2.6 and less than or equal to 3.2 represents low disease activity, a score of greater than 3.2 and less than or equal to 5.1 represents moderate disease activity, and a score of greater than 5.1 represents high (or severe) disease.</outcome>

The DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores represent higher disease activity, and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x vTJC28 + 0.28 x vSJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly.

Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. CDAI score of less than or equal to 2.8 represents clinical remission, score of less than or equal to 10.0 represents low disease activity, score of less than or equal to 22.0 represents moderate disease activity, and score of greater than 22.0 represents high (or severe) disease.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in TJC and SJC at Month 3 and Month 6 - TJC was determined by examining 28 and 68 joints and identified the joints that were painful under pressure or to passive motion. The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at baseline, no tenderness = 0, tenderness = 1. SJC was determined by examination of 28 and 66 joints and identifying when swelling was present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at baseline, no swelling = 0, swelling =1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score by Visit - The SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in centimeters) + PhGH (in centimeters) + CRP (in mg/dL), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly, PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = no arthritis activity and 100 = extremely active arthritis, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein; with a total SDAI score ranged from 0-86. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. SDAI scores of less than or equal to 3.3 represents clinical remission, less than or equal to 11.0 represents low disease activity, less than or equal to 26.0 represents moderate disease activity, and greater than 26.0 represents high (or severe) disease.</outcome>
