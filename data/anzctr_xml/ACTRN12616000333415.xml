    <interventions>Study Procedures
1.	Patient suitability will need to be confirmed on the day of data collection with the registered nurse (RN) assigned to the patient, Clinical Nurse Consultant (CNC), the team leader (usually the CNC), Clinical Co-ordinator (CC) and medical staff member allocated to the patient. A suitable time for data collection will be co-ordinated with relevant staff members of the ICU department
2.	When the patient is scheduled for repositioning the bedside nurse will collect an arterial blood gas sample and the research nurse will set up the laser Doppler perfusion monitor (LDPM) equipment at the patient bedside. For data collection the patient will be positioned either on their back (supine semi-recumbent position) or side (lateral quarter turn position), as per the routine ICU repositioning schedule. If the patient has been lying on their back, the research nurse and ICU team will position the patient on their side and data collect on the greater trochanter first or vice versa. The research nurse will talk to the patient and ICU team through the data collection process. 
3.	The research nurse will tape the LDPM to the surface of the sacrum (when positioned on the back) or greater trochanter (when positioned on the side). 
4.	Once the LDPM is in place a baseline recording will be taken to record the patients normal tissue perfusion (before loading with pressure).
5.	After a stable baseline is recorded, the ICU team will complete the repositioning by turning the patient on their back or side.
6.	Once the patient is lying in position and the LDPM recording has started, the research nurse will monitor the LDPM recording and the bedside nurse will continue with the patient cares as normal. The patient will remain in the position for 2.5-hours. 
7.	After 2.5-hours, the patient will be due for repositioning. The research nurse and ICU team will reposition the patient to offload the LDPM and the tissue reperfusion measurements will be recorded. The reperfusion time will be recorded for approximately 10-15 minutes. The patients body weight will be supported with pillows for comfort for the duration of this time. 
8.	Once data collection has been completed for the first position the above process will be repeated for the second position. The second position will be recorded for a total of 4-hours. 
9.	After data collection, the patients routine repositioning will continue for the duration of their stay in ICU however, the study will only record tissue reperfusion with the LDPM on one occasion.
10.	The research nurse will follow up with skin assessments 3-4 times per week to check for PI development until the time of hospital discharge.


As the data collection is expected to take 7-8 hours and the study only has one LDPM device the study will only be data collecting a maximum of one patient per day. The screened patient for the data collection will be the most suitable patient in the ICU that meets study criteria. All patient routine cares will be conducted as normal during this time. If the patients health situation changes or they need to be moved from the position during data collection, the data collection will then be ceased as the patients care needs come first. Data collection is only conducted if deemed appropriate by the bedside nurse, Clinical Nurse Consultant and ICU medical team.

The data collection form will be used to document the data and prompt the nurse to check pillow placement and bed angles are set to the guidelines in the study procedures.

    <comparator>control group: the 2.5hour time interval before turning (for both the supine and lateral position)

We have selected the 2.5 hour time interval to be the control as it is the minimum standard turn time interval for the ICU as per their turning guidelines (for both the supine and lateral positions). It is standard that patients are turned from their back (supine) to side (lateral) to back to other side unless their medical condition prevents them from turning.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be time to tissue reperfusion. 
A laser doppler perfusion monitor (LDPM) will measure the tissue perfusion from the baseline readings through to the tissue reperfusion time.

Of the 18 participants in each group:
- 9 participants will have 2.5hour side (lateral 1/4 turn position) pressure loading and 4 hour back (supine semi recumbent position) pressure loading.
- 9 participants will  4 hour side (lateral 1/4 turn position) pressure loading and 2.5 hour back (supine semi recumbent position) pressure loading.

Comparision of tissue reperfusion values given by the LDPM for all 108 participants will be completed post data analysis.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The participants baseline is recorded for 2 minutes, the participant is positioned to load the area of peak pressure and remains in the position for either 2.5 hours or 4 hours depending on which time period has been allocated to the body position, the participant is rolled to offload the area of peak pressure and the tissue reperfusion is recorded for 10-15 minutes.

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome measure will be PI development.

A specifically designed skin assessment data collection tool will document:
- Date of skin assessment (on data collection and 3-4 days per week until hospital discharge)	
- Skin Assessment number (1,2, 3, 4..)	
- Is the patient dependant on a repositioning schedule? (yes/no)	
- Is there any injury seen on skin assessment? (yes/no)	
- Type of injury (PI, skin tear, MASD -IAD, MASD-other)	
- Location on body	
- Stage or category	
- Has the injury been noted prior to this assessment? (yes/no)	
- Further comments (known cause, new, healing)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>a specifically designed skin assessment data collection tool designed for the study will be completed at the time of data collection, repeated 3-4 times per week until the patient is discharged from the hospital

The data will be compared during data analysis.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research project aims to better understand how pressure injuries occur and to explore blood flow in seriously ill patients in two lying positions used in the intensive care unit (ICU): on the back and on the side, at 2.5-hour and 4-hour time intervals. The bodys ability to carry oxygenated blood to the tissue is tested using non-invasive, pain-free Doppler technology which measures the time taken for the blood flow to return to the small blood vessels in the tissue, near the surface of the skin. The research project will look into the effect patient body mass index (BMI), level of sickness, patient lying position and the effect that length of time in one lying position has on blood flow to the skin for the ICU patients. The patients will be assessed in the first 72-hours of admission, when they are the most ill and skin checks for pressure injuries will be completed 3-4 times per week until the patients leave hospital.</summary>
