  <interventions>
    <interventions>At each visit, IPL is performed using a non-coherent, filtered broadband pulsed flash lamp (E&gt;Eye, France Medical, Brisbane, Australia), at 9 - 13 J/cm^2 (according to skin type), in four pulses per eye (manufacturer's proprietary pulse profile), below the lower eyelid from the outer to inner canthus, while metal light-blocking goggles are worn to protect globe.  Treatments are performed on Day 1, Day 15 and Day 45, with treatment duration of approximately 20 seconds.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tear film quality:  Lipid layer thickness grading and noninvasive tear film stability measurements by interferometry with the Keeler Tearscope Plus (Trademark)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments occur on Days 1, Day 15 and Day 45 before and approximately 10 minutes after treatment administration</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ocular surface quality: grading of the extent and confluence of sodium fluorescein staining of the cornea and conjunctiva on the Oxford scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments occur on Days 1, Day 15 and Day 45 before and approximately 10 minutes after treatment administration</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjective comfort evaluated by requesting participants mark their level of comfort (of each eye independently) on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with verbal anchors of extremely comfortable and extremely uncomfortable, at either end.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessments occur on Days 1, Day 15 and Day 45 before and approximately 10 minutes after treatment administration</timepoint>

    <designfeatures>Paired eye comparison, i.e. participant's non-treated eye serves as control.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>To detect a 10% difference in outcome measures between the treated and untreated eyes, for 80% power at a confidence level of 95%, the sample size was calculated as 23 participants.  Up to 30 participants will be recruited to compensate for any drop-out.
Paired comparison (t-test/ANOVA and Wilcoxan/ Kruskal-Wallis) will be performed to detect device effect, while repeated measures AVOVA/Friedmann will allow determination of time effect for normally and non-normally distributed data, respectively.</statisticalmethods>
