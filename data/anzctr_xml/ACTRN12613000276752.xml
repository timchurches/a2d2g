  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are aiming to collect details of the side effects that you experience during each phase of your treatment, how often and the reason that you see your GP or specialist during your breast cancer treatment for unexpected medical problems; and what treatment is given to you for these medical problems.
The information will be collected in a patient self-reported diary and sourced in routine medical practice medical file notes. Paticipants will be observed until completion of their designated treatments - this will range from 2 to 6 months depending on which treatments the participant undergoes.</interventions>

      <outcome>The nature and frequency of adverse events related to surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy in patients with early breast cancer.
Typical adverse events would include seroma, wound infection, moist desquamation, neutropenic sepsis. This will be assessed by the patient self report diary.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Survival from breast cancer has improved significantly over the past 30 years. This has been due to the coordinated approach of surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with each member of your treating specialist team contributing to your treatment recommendation. For each of these three disciplines of treatment, the conduct of clinical research has led to more effective ways of performing surgery and delivery of the best drug combinations and radiation therapy. In addition, research has also aimed to reduce side effects and therefore make each of these treatment approaches, safer and less intrusive to the quality of your life.

However, it is still likely that patients will experience side effects of some kind as a result of their surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Currently, it is not known how often the specialist treating team or the patients general practitioner is managing these side effects; and how successful the treatment recommended is. Understanding the frequency of side effects that lead to an unplanned visit with a member of your specialist treating team or GP and how these side effects are managed, will allow us to plan more effective ways of coordinating the care, to ultimately improve the well-being of breast cancer patients as they undergo the various stages of their breast cancer treatment.
