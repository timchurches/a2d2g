  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The general aim of this project is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      clinical trial of azithromycin to determine whether treatment from infancy is safe and will
      prevent the onset of bronchiectasis. One hundred and thirty infants will be recruited from CF
      clinics in Australia and New Zealand and treated from 3 months to three years of age. The
      primary outcome will be the proportion with radiologically-defined bronchiectasis at 3 years
      of age. Safety and mechanistic evaluations will also be undertaken.</summary>
