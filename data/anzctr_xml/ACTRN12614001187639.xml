  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multimorbidity (generic) rehabilitation
Will be administered in small group sessions supervised by a physiotherapist and a nurse, twice-weekly for 8 weeks, including aerobic exercise (walking and cycling for 15 minutes each) and resistance exercise (upper and lower limbs). Session duration will be 75 minutes twice weekly, with an education session duration of one hour once weekly. Education sessions will be delivered by health professionals including a physiotherapist, nursing, dietician to the class group of patients. Education topics will include general information on chronic disease and multimorbidity, risk factor management, exercise, dietary management, diabetes education, pharmacological and psychological support.

Initial aerobic exercise prescription will be calculated at 80% of peak walking speed or distance (ALF &amp; APA, 2009 and National Heart Foundation of Australia, 2011) and stationary cycling intensity will be calculated at 60-80% of maximum work rate estimated from the 6-minute walk test (Hill et al 2008). Exercise prescription will be progressed using a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) Borg scale (6-20) and dyspnoea modified Borg scale, aiming for a RPE score of 12-14 and a dyspnoea score of 3-4. The aerobic component will include intermittent, incline, treadmill training in patients with peripheral vascular disease as their primary presenting complaint or who have a significant contribution from this as part of their presentation (Gardner et al, 1995).

Initial resistance exercise load will correspond to 10-12 RM (repetition maximum).  A weight that can be lifted correctly and comfortably at least 10 times, but not more than 12 times (Kraemer et al 2004).
Resistance exercise will be progressed using a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) Borg scale (6-20) aiming for a RPE score of 12-14.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual medical care defined as medications, GP and specialist attendance, adherence to recommended activities by medical treating teams, excluding structured exercise rehabilitation. Details of usual medical care will be recorded.

Patients will be telephoned twice a week to offer general support about their condition (excluding discussion of exercise or activity), to control for the effects of attention.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with chronic disease only have access to structured exercise rehabilitation programs in tertiary health
services if they have a diagnosis of chronic respiratory disease, chronic heart failure or have suffered a heart
attack/undergone heart surgery. 

Current exercise rehabilitation programs address these conditions in a single disease assessment and management strategy, although the frequency of people with multiple chronic conditions (or multimorbidity) in Australia is increasing. Research suggests that other people with chronic diseases (such as cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney disease) also benefit from exercise training however these people are unable to access structured exercise rehabilitation currently as funding to run these services is lacking.

The aim of this project is to pilot the implementation of a generic rehabilitation program for people with chronic disease in a parallel randomised controlled trial. This trial will randomise people with multimorbidity to receiving a generic chronic disease rehabilitation program or usual care.

The aim of this pilot trial (one of a pair) is to test the feasibility of implementing a generic chronic disease rehabilitation program (multimorbidity rehabilitation) and to measure effect sizes that will be used to power subsequent large randomised controlled trials to answer the questions of efficacy and cost-effectiveness.</summary>
