  <interventions>
    <interventions>ABI by general practice nurses using oscillometric blood pressure device. This involves a blood pressure cuff being placed around each arm and leg in turn and being inflated and deflated automatically. This will take 5 minutes. This will only be done on this one occassion.</interventions>
    <comparator>ABI by research nurses using mercury blood pressure and Doppler ultrasound devices. This involves a blood pressure cuff being placed around each arm and leg in turn and being inflated and deflated manually while listening with an ultrasound machine. This will be repeated and will take 10 minutes.This will only be done on this one occassion.</comparator>
