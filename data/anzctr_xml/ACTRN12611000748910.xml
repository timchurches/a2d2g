  <interventions>
    <interventions>The cortisone injection plus an additional hydrodilatation is the intervention treatment. A radiologically assisted intra-articular (gleno-humeral joint)  injection of 4mls of local anaesthetic (marcaine), 4 mls of celestone chondrose (betamethasone 5.7mgs per 2 mls) and normal saline to expand the joint capsule to capsular rupture, is  administered once only. Following the injection the patients will be clinically assessed at 8 weeks and 12 weeks post procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Cortisone injection with no additional hydrodilatation. A radiologically assisted intra-articular (gleno-humeral joint) injection of 2mls of local anaesthetic (marcaine),  4 mls of celestone Chondrose(betamethasone 5.7mgs per 2 mls) is administered once only.  Followup clinical assessment is at 8 weeks and 12 weeks</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A comparison of two currently used treatments for a stiff painful shoulder (adhesive capsulitis, frozen shoulder). Under x-ray control a radiologist (X-Ray doctor) injects cortisone and local anaesthetic into the patient's shoulder joint. There are two groups of patients. One group then receives an additional injection of normal saline (up to around 50 mls of sterile salty water)  to try to stretch the shoulder ligaments (capsule) . The patients are then assessed clinically and by questionnaire at 8 and 12 weeks  post procedure to assess increased shoulder movement.  Both techniques are curently used. if one is demonstrably better than the other then it may change clinical practice.</summary>
