  <interventions>
    <interventions>Individually and via tablet or computer, participants will receive:
- a short video (less than 5 minutes) normalising anxiety and providing information about acceptance of anxiety as an alternative to control
- a section of text (2 paragraphs) linking acceptance and mindfulness to golf performance
- a brief audio recording (less than 5 minutes) containing instructions for a mindfulness exercise: a Body Scan exercise from Gardner and Moore (2007)

Materials will be developed by a Sport Psychologist with more than 5 years experience in mindfulness and acceptance in sport, and reviewed by two senior researchers in the area. 

Participants will be exposed to the intervention in a controlled environment while wearing headphones, and be asked to practice mindfulness while the audio recording is playing. They will then be asked to complete the next round of putts while using the skill: "if you become aware of anxiety or doubt coming up, just notice that and focus on the next thing that needs to be done."

The timeline and exposure are as follows:
-Initial questionnaires part 1 (~5 minutes)
-Putting measurement at Time 1 (practice putts; ~5 minutes)
-Initial questionnaires part 2 (~5 minutes)
-Putting measurement at Time 2 (baseline; ~5 minutes)
-Randomise to either Mindfulness first or Control first (~15 minutes)
-Induce pressure ('the following 2 rounds part of competition to earn up to $50')
-Putting measurement at Time 3 (~5 minutes)
-Crossover to either Mindfulness or Control (~15 minutes)**
-Putting measurement at Time 4 (~5 minutes)

**While it is not expected that mindfulness will wash out during this time, it is expected that T3 performance differences be eliminated at T4 once the other group receives mindfulness

Adherence will be assessed by testing state mindfulness directly after the intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>No Treatment Control
Individually and via tablet or computer, participants will receive:
- a short video (same duration as intervention +/- 10 seconds) from a documentary about a golfer
- a section of text (same length as intervention +/- 50 words) from the transcript of the same documentary
- a brief audio recording (same duration as intervention +/- 10 seconds) from the same documentary
Participants will be exposed to the intervention once in a controlled environment, while wearing headphones, between rounds of putting analysis.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Using conservative assumptions (pre-post correlation = 0; mixed anova design, effect sizes estimated partial eta squared =.22 from simple interventions using similar designs; Beilock et al., 2002; Beilock et al., 2006; Beilock et al., 2004) it was estimated approximately 40 experienced golfers (handicap less than or equal to 10) would be required for primary analyses. To allow for mediation and moderation analyses, and to complement another study using the same participants, 128 golfers will be recruited.

To analyse outcomes, primary outcomes will be explored using a linear mixed model: putting attempts will be nested within people over time, comparing baseline with post-intervention and following-crossover. As mentioned earlier, baseline mindfulness practice, dispositional mindfulness and handicap will be entered as moderators, and change in state mindfulness and anxiety will be entered as moderators.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mindfulness is the process of bringing deliberate attention to the present moment in a non-judgmental way (Kabat-Zinn, 1994), and has been argued by many to be a potential tool for improving sporting performance (Birrer, Rothlin, &amp; Morgan, 2012; Gardner &amp; Moore, 2012; John, Kumar, &amp; Lal, 2012). A significant proportion of the research on mindfulness in sport has not looked at performance, but instead explored the influence of these approaches on presumed mediators of performance such as flow (Aherne, Moran, &amp; Lonsdale, 2011) or self-confidence (Muangnapoe, 1998). Those that did look at performance tended to use case studies (e.g., Schwanhausser, 2009) or non-randomised designs (e.g., Hasker, 2011). These designs make it difficult to establish the efficacy of the intervention due to the number of confounding variable such at experimenter attention, the placebo effect, or different coaching staff. For the mindfulness component of this study, the primary objective is to explore the effectiveness of brief mindfulness program as a method of improving performance using a more internally valid, randomized and controlled design.</summary>

    <publicnotes>While not excluded, results will be moderated by mindfulness experience, with the expectation of smaller gains for those already trained in mindfulness. Similarly, the primary sample of interest are golfers with handicaps less than or equal to 10, however any golfers will be included and handicap will be a moderator of outcomes.</publicnotes>
