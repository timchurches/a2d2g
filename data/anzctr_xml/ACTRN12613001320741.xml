  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 20 minutes of active transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) immediately prior to exercise therapy 2 x per week for 8 weeks. The intervention will be delivered by a qualified physiotherapist trained in the use of tDCS. Participants  will also complete home exercises 2 x per week to mimic typical clinical practice. Adherence to the home exercise program will be monitored using a log book. 

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): will be delivered using a direct current stimulator via two 35 cm2 surface sponge electrodes. The active electrode (anode) will be placed over the primary motor cortex and the reference electrode (cathode) over the contralateral supraorbital region. Current intensity will be ramped up (0 mA to 1 mA) and down (1 mA to 0 mA) over 10 s at the beginning and end of the stimulation period. For the remainder of the 20 minute treatment, current intensity will be consistent at 1mA. 

Exercise: Quadriceps strengthening exercises will be
performed with ankle cuff weights or elastic bands for resistance where necessary. Exercise intensity will be progressed by the physiotherapist as appropriate for each participant. Each session will last 30 minutes. A home exercise plan will be developed, monitored and progressed by the physiotherapist for each participant.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive 20 minutes of sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) immediately prior to exercise therapy 2 x per week for 8 weeks. The intervention will be delivered by a qualified physiotherapist trained in the use of sham tDCS. Participants  will also complete home exercises 2 x per week to mimic typical clinical practice. Adherence to the home exercise program will be monitored using a log book. 

Sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): will be delivered with electrodes placed in an identical position to that used for active tDCS. The current will be ramped up over 10 seconds (0 mA to 1 mA) and then ramped down (1mA to 0mA) over a further 10 seconds before being switched off. This is a standard sham approach in tDCS studies which ensures that participants feel the initial tingling
sensation associated with tDCS. The tDCS unit will be placed out of sight for both the active and sham interventions.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee pain  will be measured using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with pain on walking over the past week self-assessed with terminal descriptors of no pain (score 0 mm) and extreme pain (score 100 mm).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee function will be assessed using the function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index (Likert version 3.1).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility will be measured as i) the number of sessions attended by each participant, ii) number of drop-outs in each group, iii) proportion of participants recruited from the total number screened, iv) willingness of each participant to undergo therapy on an 11-point numerical rating scale with not at all willing at 0 and very willing at 10 and v) recording of the type, severity and duration of any side-effects/adverse events (e.g. headache, fatigue, increased pain, dizziness, nausea).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Central pain modulation (CPM): CPM is tested as a change in the pain perceived in one body region [electrical stimulation, 4 ms pulse duration, applied to the left upper arm] as a result of pain induced in another [heat pain, 30 pulses/minute to 1 degree celsius above pain threshold via a thermode, applied to the right forearm]. Twenty heat pain stimuli will be delivered to the left arm alone followed by 20 combined with electrical pain stimuli to the right arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure (PPT) and cold pain thresholds (CPT): PPT will be measured using a pressure algometer [probe size 1 cm2, rate 40 kPa/s]. CPT will be measured using the Thermotest system [preset to 30 degrees celsius, temperature change rate of 1.8 degrees celsius/s]. Participants will push a button when pressure or cold sensations first become painful. The average of three  recordings will be analysed from the peripatellar region, tibialis anterior muscle (lower leg) and extensor carpi radialis longus muscle (wrist extensor).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nociceptive flexor withdrawal reflex (NFR): Surface stimulating electrodes will be positioned at a retromalleolar location along the right sural nerve. Recording electrodes will be positioned over the belly of the biceps femoris muscle. Stimulation will consist of pulse trains of 20 ms duration at an interval frequency of 300 Hz. The intensity needed to evoke a response of biceps femoris indicating activation of the NFR, and the subjective pain threshold will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Global Perceived Effect Scale where each participants perceived response to therapy is assessed using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from completely recovered to vastly worsened.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed immediately before and immediately after the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment expectation will be assessed using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'No effect at all' to 'Completely recovered'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Treatment expectation will be assessed at baseline, immediately before the 8-week intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Osteoarthritis (OA) affects more than 20% of Australians aged over 55. The knee joint is commonly affected, resulting in knee pain and difficulty with everyday tasks such as walking or climbing stairs. Current treatments (e.g. medication, surgery, exercise) are only partially effective. Novel therapies that optimize the effects of current treatments are needed to reduce the social and economic burden on sufferers, caregivers and the wider community. Here we aim to conduct a proof of concept study to investigate the use of an innovative non-invasive brain stimulation treatment to bolster the effects of exercise therapy in knee OA. We anticipate that the combination of non-invasive brain stimulation and exercise will have a greater effect on the biological mechanisms that contribute to pain, and thus provide greater benefits for pain and disability, than exercise alone.</summary>
