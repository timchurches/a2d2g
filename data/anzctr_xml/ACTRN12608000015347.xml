  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in group one will watch a DVD and read a booklet which will educate patients on how to minimise falls risk in hospital. In addition, this group will receive their usual care. Patients in group two will also receive this intervention and in addition, will also receive further face to face personal education from a health professional. The health professionals will have discretion over the duration of each patient session - session lengths will range between 15 and 35 minutes. The total number of sessions provided through the content of the program is intended to be covered in 4 sessions and will vary between patients. The variability will range from 1 to 4 sessions. This is reflective of differences between and within individual patients' conditions such that on one day they may not feel well enough to have a session, or only be able to manage a short duration of discussion, but on other days may tolerate longer sessions. Up to three follow-up sessions will be provided in a week. Education sessions will occur during admission at a varied time according to a patients medical condition. Therefore patients will receive up to 4 sessions over their whole admission, but times of delivery and frequency of delivery will vary from patient to patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the control group will receive their usual care. On the Orthopaedic Unit at Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) and on the Medical Ward at Swan Districts Hospital (SDH) this consists of 24 hour availability of nursing and medical care, daily physiotherapy, and referrals to other allied health professionals as required. On the Geriatric Assessment and Rehabilitation Unit (GARU) and Swan Districts Hospital Restorative Unit (SDH RU) there are also daily occupational therapy sessions, and social work assessment and management provided. At the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) a local falls risk assessment tool that has not been validated is used and orange arm bands are provided to patients assessed as being at high risk for falls. A local falls risk screening tool is used by the nursing staff at Swan Districts Hospital (SDH) on patients' admissions and nursing staff are alerted to patients assessed as being at high risk for falls.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accidental falls (event rate of falls  measured in events per time units) as measured during the participants period of inpatient hospital care (the start of this observation period will be taken from the point of randomisation rather than the date of admission as it may take approximately 2 days to gain consent for participation, particularly where family members have to be approached).</outcome>
      <timepoint>From time of enrolment to discharge from hospital, In-hospital falls incidence will be gained from patient history review of notes by the Research Assistant (RA) on a weekly basis. This will include review of computerized hospital incident reports, and weekly follow-up questioning by the Research Assistant (RA). Where a patient has a Length of stay of less than one week questioning will occur before discharge.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of patients incurring one or more in-hospital falls (fallers incidence  measured in person units). Rate of fall-related injury during the participants in-hospital rate of falls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From time of enrolment to discharge from hospital In-hospital falls incidence will be gained from patient history review of notes by the RA on a weekly basis, computerized hospital incident reports, and from weekly follow-up questioning by RA.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of providing individual patient education with trained health professional follow up in addition to usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing inpatient falls among older hospital patients. The results showed that multimedia education with trained health professional follow up reduces falls in a sub group of older patients with intact cognition.</summary>
