  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an open trial where participants are allocated to recieve 8 week internet-based treatment. All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression, and/or social phobia and/or panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) and/or generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). All participants will complete 5 lessons of Internet based treatment about management of symptoms of depression and anxiety. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with anxiety, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive automatic email and weekly reminder phone calls by a clinical psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails/phone calls and contribution to the forum is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks, but participants will be contacted 3 months post program and asked to complete follow-up questionnaires. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-education, post-education, and at 3-months post-education. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on the Anxiety and Sadness Programs, which apply cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is part of a research program funded by the NHMRC (No. 630560) to develop and evaluate Internet based transdiagnostic treatment programs for people with anxiety and depression. This preliminary project examines the efficacy of a treatment program for people with depression, social phobia and/or panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) and/or GAD. The purpose of this study is to see if a brief internet-based intervention is effective at reducing levels fo anxiety and depression.</summary>
