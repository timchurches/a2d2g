  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.	To investigate the association between post translational forms of circulating plasma lipoproteins, beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL and ApoB100, and atherosclerotic coronary disease.

2.	To investigate the association between post translational forms of circulating plasma lipoproteins, beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL and ApoB100, and clinical presentation with atherothrombotic acute coronary disease.

3.	To investigate the association between post translational forms of circulating plasma lipoproteins, beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL and ApoB100, and complications after percutaneous coronary intervention and late graft failure after CABG.

The patients having angiography or CT angiography, a 15 ml blood sample shall be collected at the time of procedure. Out of this group, the patients who did not have ACS and have stent implantation shall have second blood sample 3 hours post procedure.
The patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction will have collection of only one blood sample 24 hours after the stent implantation. 

Clinical follow up shall be performed by phone interview at 30 days 12 months and at 2 years.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL and APOB100 on serum ELISA with the extent of coronary artery disease.
This shall be assessed both as multiple separate outcomes and composite outcomes.
The extent of coronary artery disease shall be measured with SYNTAX Score.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL and APOB100 on serum ELISA with clinical presentation.
Again, this shall be assessed both as multiple separate outcomes and composite outcomes.
Clinical presentation is assessed by history taking, examination, ECG and troponin elevation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cross-sectional at the time of angiography.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 month, 12 months and 2 years follow-up. MACE is defined as death, stroke, myocardial infarction, admission with heart failure and requirement for coronary revascularization.
Patients shall be contacted for a phone interview. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month, 12 months and 2 years post CT coronary angiography or invasive coronary angiography.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL, APOB100 on serum ELISA and late graft failure after CABG.
This shall be assessed both as multiple separate outcomes and composite outcomes.
Graft failure shall be assessed by coronary angiography and  the review of medical records.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cross-sectional at the time of angiography.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of beta-2-glycoprotein I, HDL, APOB100 on serum ELISA and complication post percutaneous coronary intervention.
Complications shall be assessed from the cardiac cathlab database and the review of medical records.
Complications shall be assessed by the review of the medical records, ECGs and blood tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cross-sectional at the time of angiography with repeat blood test 3 hours after stent implantation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Logistic regression analysis will be performed with a number of confounding variables including cardiovascular risk factors and medical therapy. 
Sample size is based upon a pilot study assessing total B2GPI levels. Assuming a 5.9% reduction in B2GPI level with coronary disease, 11% reduction with ACS, alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.8, the total sample size required is 925.</statisticalmethods>
