  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be offered to have up to 75% of their clinic appointments by telemedicine.
The study intervention will be the use of intermittent telemedicine consultations to the patient in their own home (using the QLD Health approved Cisco Jabber Program) or at a nearby health facility (Gympie, Caloundra, Maleny), combined with some face to face consultations (at Nambour Hospital).  The frequency of telemedicine consultations will be as deemed suitable by the medical staff but will not exceed 75% of consultations.  The Duration of intervention will be 24 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard face to face consultations with Nephrologist in Outpatient Department.
The matched control group will be asked to consent to compare with the telemedicine group.  This group will not have been offered telemedicine (usually due to living near Nambour Hospital) but would be considered suitable by medical staff if they live further away.  This group will be matched with the telemedicine group for transplant / CKD status, age, gender, and diabetic status.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Patients who are offered telemedicine, but decline to participate in telemedicine, will be asked to consent to complete a questionnaire about their demographics and reasons for declining telemedicine.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>To ascertain differences between the two groups at baseline, demographic, comorbidity, and physiological data will be analysed using mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) where appropriate.  Differences in satisfaction will be examined in the same way.
Serial data including pathological and physiological, will be analysed using a linear and correlated regression model.
Time to event data (eg hospitalisation) will be analysed using a Cox type regression model.
For all analyses, the level of significance will be set at P &lt; 0.05.
Data will be analysed using STATATM version 12.0.
There is no sample size calculation as this is a feasibility study and no data to base a power calculation on. 
The number selected is based on current patient numbers and location of residence such that we believe there will be enough available to recruit.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To compare the current model of care for Transplant recipients and Chronic Kidney disease patients, which is face to face consultation with specialist Kidney Doctor with a new model of care which will consist of up to 75 % of these visits done from patients home or nearby telehealth facility. 
We are expecting that conducting some medical consultations by telemedicine will be feasible and non-inferior to standard model of care and the patients will be happy with this new model of care
