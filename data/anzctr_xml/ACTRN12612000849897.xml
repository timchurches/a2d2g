  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cycloplegic refractive error will be measured both objectively (using Nidek Tonoref 2) and subjectively(using phoropter, subjective measure will be based on the participant's input and clinician's judgement); ocular axial length will be measured using a Zeiss IOL master (3 readings per eye will be taken, the average of these reading will be recorded, the entire procedure will take less than 5 minutes). Cycloplegia will be achieved using diagnostic eye drops (1% tropicamide and 0.4% oxybuprocaine). All participants in this study need to have completed the IERP2007-009 study 'Myopia Progression in Children: Multifocal Soft Contact Lenses Versus Single Vision Soft Contact Lenses' (http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=347659) and IER2008-001 study 'Assessment of effect of multifocal contact lenses on myopia progression rates in children and adolescents' (http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=347655)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Brien Holden Vision Institute (previously known as the Institute for Eye Research) conducted a clinical trial to test commercially-available multifocal contact lenses for their potential to control the progression of myopia in children(IERP2007-009, ACTRN12611001148965; http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=347659 ). The trial was completed in 2008. Approximately half of the 40 children who participated in trial IERP2007-009 were enrolled in a subsequent myopia control trial at the Brien Holden Vision Institute (IER2008-001, ACTRN12611001141932; http://www.anzctr.org.au/trial_view.aspx?ID=347655 ) in which all participants wore the test product of trial IERP2007-009. Both IERP 2007-009 and IER2008-001 have provided valuable information on the efficacy of the multifocal contact lenses in controlling the rate of progression of myopia. This research is based on the hypothesis that the peripheral retina plays a role in controlling the refractive development of the eye as shown in animal experiments (Smith et al. 2007). In this study, the participants will continue to wear the commercially available multifocal contact lenses used in the previous two trials (IERP2007-009 and IER2008-001) to see whether the efficacy of controlling myopia with this lenses will still remain true for a longer period of time.</summary>
