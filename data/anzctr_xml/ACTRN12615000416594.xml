  <interventions>
    <interventions>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive procedure which has been approved by the TGA to treat depression in adults who have failed to respond to at least 2 adequate trials of an antidepressant medication. Our rTMS protocol involves 20 sessions of 20 minutes over 4 weeks. rTMS sessions will be administered for 5 days in a row with a 2 days break in between (i.e. rTMS from Monday through to Friday and no rTMS on Saturday and Sunday) and can commence on either weekday or weekend depending on nursing staff timetabling.  rTMS will be administered using a MagPro R30 (MagVenture). A single pulse to the motor cortex will measure motor threshold (MT) before commencement of treatment. High-frequency (20 Hz) stimulation at 120% of MT will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex left for 45 trains of 4 seconds with 26 seconds between trains (i.e. 1800 pulses per day). Site of stimulation will be determined using the Acsension MINIBIRD tracker in combination with MRIcro/MRIreg software packages and a 3D structural T1-weighted MRI scan, according to a standard technique.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep-wake cycle is the primary outcome and will be measured by actigraphy, an effective method for objectively determining sleep-wake pattern. This involves wearing an actigraph, that is, a wrist watch which measures and records the movements of a person. The participant will be required to wear the actigraph during day and night (except when the participant will be in contact with water or a magnetic field) in order for their sleep-wake cycle (i.e. activity-rest pattern) can be assessed. After at least 10 days, a study investigator will collect the actigraph and download the data onto a designated computer. Actigraphy data will be stored on select designated computers in password protected electronic files which will only be accessible to study investigators.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive functions will be assessed as a secondary outcome. A standardised battery of neuropsychological tests (traditional and computer based) currently used in a larger research program at our institute will be administered. The traditional neuropsychological tests to be used are: Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Logical Memory (WMS-III), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test and Rey Complex Figure Test. Computer based tests are Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and Movie Stills (both to assess social cognition) and a Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) with the tests Motor Screening, Spatial Span, Reaction Time, Rapid Visual Information Processing, Intra/Extradimensional Shift, Paired Associates Learning and Affective Go/NoGo. </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In vivo gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the posterior brain will be measured as a secondary outcome using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy conducted on a 3Tesla GE Discovery MR750 Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner and in vivo GABA will be resolved using MEGAPRESS.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using multiple regression analyses to examine whether changes in neurobiological measures will be predictive of improvements in depression. Having accounted for a 20% attrition rate, a priori power analysis showed that a sample of 125 would be sufficient for a regression with three predictor variables to detect a relationship between the predictors (phase delay, in vivo GABA concentration and a cognitive measure) and the dependent variable (reduction in depressive symptoms) with a small to medium effect size (f2 =0.09) with 89% power at an alpha of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has been shown to be efficacious for treating depression and has been approved by the TGA for the treatment of depression in adults who have not responded to at least 2 trials of antidepressant medications. However, some people do not respond to the treatment. Sleep-wake cycle disruption, reduced cognitive functioning and changes in brain chemistry are prominent features of depression. It is unclear how rTMS affects these features and whether they are associated with response to rTMS treatment. We seek to investigate whether these features of patients are associated with rTMS treatment response.</summary>
