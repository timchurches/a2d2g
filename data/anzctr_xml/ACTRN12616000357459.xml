  <interventions>
    <interventions>The 12-week intervention involves participants receiving: 
A motivational interview of around 20 minutes duration, including discussion of physical activity barriers and goal setting, conducted at intervention commencement by a member of the research team, a PhD student, trained and supervised by the Primary Sponsor/Co-lead investigator who has Bachelor and PhD qualifications in psychology;
Weekly text messages, personalised by name and individually tailored on some content, and phone calls of approximately 10 minutes duration at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12, from the same research team member, based on principles of Control Theory, to encourage participants to meet their goals and to offer personally tailored support;
A FitBit Charge device to self-monitor their physical activity. While respondents will be encouraged to wear the FitBit daily, this is purely for motivational and self-monitoring purposes, and no FitBit data will be collected for this study.

    <statisticalmethods>Prior data from our preliminary study showed the mean duration of participation in moderate-vigorous physical activity in 187 Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy patients was 71 mins per week (SD = 126). Based on an increase to the recommended minimum of 150 mins per week, we will need at least 22 participants to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the response difference is zero with power of 80% and type 1 error probability of 0.05. We will analyse intervention effects by comparing 12-week follow-up with baseline scores using paired t-tests or equivalent non-parametric tests should assumptions for parametric tests not be met.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of a program to increase physical activity in individuals with the most common inherited heart disease, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). A sample of 22 patients will be recruited from the HCM and Genetic Heart Disease clinics at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. They will undertake a survey to establish baseline measurements of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, measured by IPAQ-Long), mental and physical health (SF-36v2), and self-efficacy and barriers to physical activity; and wear an accelerometer for 7 days. A motivational interview, including discussion of barriers and goal setting, will be conducted with a member of the research team. Participants will also be provided with a FitBit Charge device to self-monitor their physical activity. 
Over the following study period of 12 weeks, participants will receive phone calls (weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12) and weekly text messages from the research team to encourage them to meet their goals and to offer support that is personalised and consistent with Control Theory principles.
At the completion of the intervention, participants will undergo the same evaluation as at baseline, and also provide process evaluation feedback regarding the intervention. </summary>
