  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participants who meet the eligibility criteria and who consent to participation or whose
      parents/legal guardian consent to their participation, will be enrolled in the study for a
      period of up to 14 days. Enrolment visit (Day 1) assessments for all participants will
      include the collection of throat swabs, testing by staff at the site using the ellume·lab
      Group A Strep Test and testing for Group A Streptococcus by a central laboratory using
      bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All participants will be followed up
      with a phone assessment of adverse events between Days 2-14.</summary>
