  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a 12-week  combined aerobic and resistance exercise program. This will require participants to attend the Health and Fitness Exercise Clinic at the School of Health Sciences at the University of South Australia twice weekly to perform a combination of aerobic and resistance activities at a moderate intensity. All programs will be individually designed and monitored, and supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist. Each session will be 1 hour in duration. During each session participants will be required to perform 20minutes of moderate intensity low weight bearing exercise such as stationary cycling and rowing. Participants will also be required to perform a progressive resistance training program ranging from 50-85% 1RM (repetition maximum). A combination of 8 exercises will be performed for 8-10 repetitions over 2 sets. The exercises will include a bench press, leg extension, leg curl, calf raise, biceps curl, triceps extension, lateral pull-down and a shoulder press.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to investigate the effects of a combined aerobic and resistance exercise program on measures of strength, function and sensation in those with Type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. It will also aim to explore the safe prescription of exercise for these individuals, its effects on levels of quality of life, and to identify the potential barriers and enablers to a sustained exercise program.</summary>
