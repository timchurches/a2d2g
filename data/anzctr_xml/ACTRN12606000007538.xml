  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is a multi-centre phase I/II dose-escalation study that aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a single implantation of SIR-Spheres when used in combination with systemic chemotherapy with FOLFOX4.  Toxicity will be assessed after 3 cycles of treatment, at which stage the oxaliplatin will be escalated to full dose and the patients will go on receive a maximum of 12 cycles of chemotherapy.  (The duration of the treatment cycles varies as it is based on the doctor's discretion.  Ideally the treatment cycles would be 1 week of treatment and then 1 week of rest.)</interventions>
