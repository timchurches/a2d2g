  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 groups are included in which a total volume of 50 ml . Isotonic saline (0.9%) are given  slow intravenous (I.v) infusion over 15 minutes before induction of general anesthesia
Group 1: received 1.5 ug/kg of clonidine in the infusion regimen
Group 2: received 30 mg/kg of Magnesium sulfate in the infusion 
Group 3: received saline only(placebo group) infusion of 50 ml. saline</interventions>
    <comparator>Clonidine group is being compared to magnesium sulfate group and placebo group in LC.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hemodynamic stability(heart rate and mean arterial pressure) using ECG and sphygmomanometer respectively .</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline(before induction of general anesthesia), 3 minutes after endotracheal intubation, before pneumperitoneum, 15 minutes after pneumperitoneum, 30 minutes after pneumoperitoneum, 5 minutes after ex sufflation , 5 minutes after extubation and 2 hours postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Level of cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone(ACTH). 
(This is a composite primary outcome) using serum assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline( 30 minutes before transferring the patient to operative room), 3 minutes after endotracheal intubation,15 minutes after pneumoperitoneum, 5 minutes after exsuflation,2 hours after extubation and first postoperative day.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative analgesia</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain is assessed using visual analogue score(VAS) at 2,4,6 ,8,10 and 12 hours postoperatively which is recorded on patient clinical charts by attending  nurse.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient sedation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Using Ramsay sedation score at pre-induction and 15 minutes after reaching PACU.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous data will be reported by mean +/- S.D. While categorical data by frequency and percentage. Continuous data will be compared between the three  groups via analysis of variance(ANOVA) or kruskal-wallis test, depending on the normal distribution of data, determined by kolmgorov-Smirnov test. Categorical data will be compared between the three groups using chi- square test or fisher's exact test..Repeated measure ANOVA will be used to investigate the changes of the studied variables. P.value&lt; 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant. Based on a pilot study on 10 patients subjected for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, it was calculated that 27 and 5 patients per group were required to detect a significant  20% inter group differences in mean arterial pressure and plasma cortisol level respectively. To compensate for possible droupouts , 35 patients per group were included.
