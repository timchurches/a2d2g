Treatment: drugs - FOLFIRI
Other interventions - pembrolizumab
Other interventions - bevacizumab
Other interventions - cetuximab

Experimental: Pembrolizumab - Participants receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle (Q3W) for up to 35 treatments (approximately 2 years)

Active Comparator: Standard of Care - Per Investigator choice, participants receive 1 of 6 possible standard chemotherapy regimens: mFOLFOX6, or mFOLFOX6 + bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle, or mFOLFOX6 + cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours then 250 mg/m^2 over 1 hour weekly in each 2-week cycle, or FOLFIRI, or FOLFIRI + bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV on Day 1 of each 2-week cycle, or FOLFIRI + cetuximab 400 mg/m^2 IV over 2 hours then 250 mg/m^2 over 1 hour weekly in each 2-week cycle


Treatment: drugs: mFOLFOX6
Regimen consists of oxaliplatin 85 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m^2 IV bolus on Day 1 and then 1200 mg/m^2/day IV over 2 days for total dose of 2400 mg/m^2 in each 2-week cycle

Treatment: drugs: FOLFIRI
Regimen consists of irinotecan 180 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1, 5-FU 400 mg/m^2 IV bolus on Day 1 and then 1200 mg/m^2/day IV over 2 days for total dose of 2400 mg/m^2 in each 2-week cycle

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, participants with MSI-H or dMMR advanced colorectal carcinoma will be randomly
      assigned to receive either pembrolizumab or the Investigator's choice of 1 of 6 standard of
      care (SOC) chemotherapy regimens for the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinoma. The
      primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will prolong progression-free survival (PFS)
      compared to current SOC chemotherapy.</summary>
