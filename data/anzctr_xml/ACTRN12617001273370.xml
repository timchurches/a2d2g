    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis will report the mean difference and 95% confidence interval in change in haemoglobin level between the 2 groups (as allocated, irrespective of actual treatment received).  Differences in haemoglobin level (a normally distributed continuous outcome) will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with adjustment for baseline Haemoglobin level. 

Secondary outcomes: The difference between the groups will be assessed using Fishers Exact test for binary outcomes (clinical failure, serious adverse events), Kaplan-Meier curves with log rank statistic for time to event (time to clinical treatment failure).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Rapid Iron Infusion Study (RIIS) is a randomised controlled trial for Aboriginal children with severe iron deficiency anaemia, The aim is to assess whether a single intravenous infusion of ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject) given over 15 minutes in children prior to their discharge from hospital compared to the standard treatment with intramuscular iron injections as per CARPA Manual, will improve haemoglobin levels and reduce the risk of further anaemia. 

The potential benefits of rapid iron infusions include higher haemoglobin levels, fewer painful intramuscular injections, better adherence to recommended treatment, and less use of primary health care resources.
