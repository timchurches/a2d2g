  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) a group who receive the Pain Course via the internet, and (2) a group who receive the Pain Course via a hardcopy workbook. All participants will meet diagnostic criteria for chronic pain (i.e. pain lasting longer than 6 months). All participants will complete 5 lessons of the Pain Course, which provide information about the management of symptoms of chronic pain and anxiety, depression and disability associated with pain. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with chronic pain, taking a further 20 minutes per summary.

Participants in both groups will have the option of weekly telephone calls or emails from a trained and supervised Psychologist at the eCentreClinic to provide support, encouragement and to answer questions about the content of the Course. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3 and 12 month follow-up. Some questionnaires will be administered weekly during the Course. The major sets of questionnaires will take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on previous internet-based programs, which apply cognitive behavioural techniques.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be carried out using conservative intention-to-treat principles and using mixed-linear models analyses to handle missing data. Mixed-models are a robust statistical approach for analysing clinical trial data and these analyses will employ an appropriate covariance structure and maximum likelihood estimation, which provides unbiased estimates in the case of missing data; under the assumption that data is missing at random.

Sample size: With alpha set at 0.05, power set at 0.80 and a sample size of 160, the study is powered to enable the detection of small-to-large between group effect size (i.e., &gt; 0.40) differences in symptoms of anxiety, depression and disability. Thus, the project is powered to detect differences between the groups in symptoms likely to be clinically meaningful.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current research project aims to investigate the efficacy and acceptability of the Pain Course when delivered via a hardcopy workbook (wCBT) versus in a softcopy format via the internet (iCBT). Importantly, given that many Australians still do not have reliable access to the internet, if efficacious and acceptable, workbook delivery represents another simple, low cost, approach for increasing access to evidence-based treatment for people with chronic pain.</summary>
