      <outcome>The main aim of this study is to determine whether the hormones atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) can improve our ability to predict successful cardioversion in atrial fibrillation.</outcome>

      <outcome>The main aim of this study is to determine whether the hormones brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can improve our ability to predict successful cardioversion in atrial fibrillation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured prior to cardioversion and again at 6 weeks and 12 months afterwards.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>In this study we will try to develop a tool that could help in predicting the short and long term outcome post DC cardioversion for the patients with atrial fibrillation. The tool will incorporate the data collected from the different blood tests and imaging results. It will, also, take in consideration the medical background and pharmacological agents commonly used in this condition.
Compare between 2 different types of defibrillators used to perform DC cardioversion (Monophasic &amp; Biphasic). The aim will be to identify which type of defibrillator has better outcome and less complications.
Record the possible complications associated with atrial fibrillation and its treatment over the follow up period.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>All patients on the waiting list for elective DC cardiovesion will be offered the chance to participate In this study. If they agree, we will record the results of the different laboratory and imaging tests that they had prior to presenting to the preadmission clinic, as well as each individual medical background.
Each patient will have 4 extra blood tests to measure the hormones produced by the heart and other parts of the body in response to their heart condition. The first 2 tests will be on the day they present for the electric shock treatment (DC cardiovesion). The 3rd when having the 6 weeks routine follow up, and the last one will be when having the 6 months follow up. Each patient will, also, have an additional ultrasound examination of the heart 4-8 months following having the DC cardioversion.
Each patient will be followed for a minimum of 1 year (the 2 other follow ups at 6&amp;12 months post DC cardioversion). During this time we will monitor the heart rhythm, the rate of possible complications with this condition and analyse the data trying to identify the patients who may benefit from this treatment.</summary>
