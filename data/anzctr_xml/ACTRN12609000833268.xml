  <interventions>
    <interventions>With an empty bladder, a vaginal examination is performed.  If intact, the obstetric membranes are ruptured.  The patient is asked to bear down.  For the left occipito-posterior (OP) position, the right index finger is applied to the right lambdoid suture, exerting constant pressure with the aim of rotating the fetus in an anti-clockwise direction.  For the right OP position, the left index finger is used and the fetus rotated in a clockwise direction (28).  On the basis of our clinical experience we would aim to rotate the fetus into the occipito-anterior (OA) position over 2 to 3 contractions, then hold the presenting part in this position over another 2 contractions while the woman bears down, to reduce the chances of reversion back to the OP position.
The overall expected duration of study is 3 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>In patients in active labour, persistent OP position of the fetal head has long been recognised as an important problem.The reported operative delivery rate varies from 54% to 82% when OP position is present at delivery, compared with 6 to 22% among OA controls, a difference which was invariably statistically significant in cohort studies.Persistent OP position is also reportedly associated with many abnormalities of labor and delivery including more frequent induction of labour, greater use of oxytocin augmentation, prolonged labour, abnormal second stage cardiotocograph (CTG), a longer second stage of labor, chorioamnionitis, third or fourth degree perineal lacerations, and post-partum haemorrhage.OP position is also associated with post-partum and neonatal adverse outcomes, including, postpartum wound infection, endometritis, lower 5-minute Apgar scores, meconium stained liquor, acidaemic cord blood gases, birth trauma, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be provided with an information sheet on the study at 36-37 weeks through the antenatal clinics of the hospital. Women then will be consented antenatally or in early labour and randomised after vaginal examination confirming full dilatation and an ultrasound confirming baby was in the posterior position. Randomisation will be performed by computer generated random number sequences in random sized blocks of four to eight determined by an independent person.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be performed by computer generated random number sequences in random sized blocks of four to eight determined by an independent person (a neonatologist). This will ensure numerical balance between treatment groups’ participants and prevent staff guessing sequences associated with constant sized blocks. Stratification for parity will be undertaken and randomisation will be blinded. Once consented women will be randomly allocated to intervention or control (routine care) group.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In most labours, the baby is delivered head first, face downwards.  When the baby is facing upwards, the labour may be more difficult, and assisted deliveries including suction cup, forceps, and caesarean section are more likely.  When the mother is fully dilated, it is possible to perform an internal examination and to physically rotate the baby to the downwards (anterior) position, but it is unknown if this procedure reduces the chances of an assisted delivery.  We plan to run a study looking at whether performing a procedure to turn the baby will reduce the risk of assisted delivery</summary>
