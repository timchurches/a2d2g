  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant performed 4 endurance treadmill tests within one day. One test was performed unassisted, one with continous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 4cmH2O, one with low level pressure support (PS) of 10cmH2O and one with high level PS of 20cmH2O. Tests were performed in random order. Prior to performing each exercise test, participants rested in the sitting position for 10 minutes. Of the 10 minute rest period, participants breathed unassisted for the first 5 minues. For the second 5 minutes of rest, participants breathed on CPAP prior to the CPAP walk test, PS 10 prior to the PS 10 walk test, PS 20 prior to the PS 20 walk test, and a further 5 minute period of breathing unassisted prior to the unassisted walking test. Participants rested for at least 30 minutes while breathing unassisted between each exercise test (and until heart rate, blood pressure, breathlessness, oxygen saturation and exertion had returned to baseline). Participants only received CPAP, PS 10 and PS 20 for the duration of the endurance walk test and 5 minute rest period immediately prior to the walk test as described above.</interventions>
    <comparator>High level pressure support (20cmH2O) versus low level pressure support (10cmH2O) versus continuous positive airway pressure (4cmH2O) versus Unassisted Exercise (control). The duration of the control was equivalent to the duration of the unassisted endurance walk test (this was the longest time that participants could walk for, ie. not a pre-determined period of time).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with severe curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) have a reduced exercise capacity and are often limited by their respiratory system.  The aim of this study was to determine the effect of low level and high level breathing support (provided via a mask) during treadmill walking in people with severe curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis) compared to sham breathing support and walking unassisted. We hypothesised that only high level breathing support would increase exercise endurance time in people with severe kyphoscoliosis.</summary>
