    <interventions>Participants randomised to have supplemental intranasal ambulatory oxygen via Inogen One G2 portable concentrator as the ambulatory oxygen therapy. They will be provided the device for use at home and in the community during exertion for 3 months. There is no specific prescription for the frequency or duration of use. Participants can use the device as much or as little as they choose, with the intention that they use it during periods of exertion. The portable oxygen concentrator will be administering at level 6 for all participants.
Therapy usage will be monitored using a 7-day usage diary prior to each visit and the number of operated hours of portable concentrators.

    <statisticalmethods>To detect a difference in 6MWD of 34 metres, which we have shown is the minimal important difference for 6MWD in our population of patients with ILD, 62 patients will be required. This is based on a standard deviation of the change of 47 metres with 80% power. For an assumed dropout rate of 15%, a total of 73 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to supplemental ambulatory oxygen or air delivered via portable concentrator. 

Data analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Level of statistical significance will be set at p = 0.05. Demographic data will be compared using chi2 or t tests. Other outcome measures will be analysed using linear mixed models or repeated measures analysis of variance as appropriate. Variables selected a priori to identify subgroups which might benefit differentially from ambulatory oxygen will be the severity of ventilatory impairment based on lung function results, gender, and patients with IPF.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of chronic lung diseases of different causes which lead to symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance and poor quality of life. There are limited medical treatments available to date for the majority of patients with ILD. Although ambulatory oxygen is commonly prescribed for patients with ILD suffering significant breathlessness or low oxygen levels during exercise, its clinical benefits are uncertain. Potential adverse effects include increased systemic oxidative stress and the negative impact on patients mental well-being from such a burdensome treatment. In addition, the use of oxygen therapy has significant costs for both patients and the health care system.

Ambulatory oxygen is usually delivered using oxygen cylinders. Portability and comfort of oxygen cylinders are important factors which prevent patients from using ambulatory oxygen as prescribed. The new lightweight portable oxygen concentrator (POC) may be an attractive alternative to oxygen cylinders. This study aims to compare the effects of ambulatory oxygen with room air delivered via portable concentrator on health outcomes, including exercise capacity, symptoms, activity levels, systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, in patients with chronic ILD and low oxygen levels during exercise. </summary>
