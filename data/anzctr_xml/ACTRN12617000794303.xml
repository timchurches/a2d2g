  <interventions>
    <interventions>Percutaneous Electrial Stimulation (PES group). Dancers in this group received the PES by a physiotherapist with 8 years of experience. Specifically, this intervention consisted in the application of an asymmetric biphasic rectangular current of 150 microseconds and 10 Hz using a specifically developed medically certified device (Physio Invasive, Enraf Nonius, Prim, SPAIN). The subject lay prone with her feet outside the table. The FHL muscle was located at 50% of the distance between the fibular head and inferior border of the lateral malleolus on the posterior aspect of the fibular by ultrasound machine (cross-section) (Logiq, GE Healthcare, USA) and then, a needle (0.30mm x 0.40mm) was inserted, perpendicular to the surface of the skin, until the muscle belly. Prior to inserting a neddle, the underlying skin was cleaned with isopropyl alcohol. The intensity of the current was necessary to cause an exacerbated muscle contraction, during 1.5 min acording to the Valera and Minaya protocol´s.
This intervention was performed once in each participant, on one leg only (stance limb), It's only once, it was not a treatment</interventions>
    <comparator>Static Stretching Group. Dancers in this group performed static stretching exercise of the FHL muscle. The dancer placed the foot on a step with the maximum possible extension of the MTP joints. Subsequently, she performed maximum dorsiflexion with knee and hip flexion. The position was maintained for 20 seconds and repeated 4 more times. During the 20-second stretching, the therapist supervised the dancers to make sure they did not make any compensation that would alter the stretching position.
Eccentric Group. Dancers in this group performed eccentric exercise of the FHL muscle. The dancer placed the foot the same way as the Stretching Group. The dancer performed 4 sets of flexion-extension 20 repetitions of hip, knee, ankle and first toe.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction. Tendinopathy of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), colloquially referred to as "dancer's tendinitis," is a common condition in dancers and attributed to high demand on this muscle in positions of extreme ankle plantarflexion and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) flexion and extension. Tradicional conservative treatment includes rest from pain-inducing activities including pointe work and jumping, physical therapy a focusing on movilization of the joints of the first ray and subtalar joint, and antiinflamatory medications. Unfortunately, dancer frecuently do not follow recommendations to rest due to the competitive nature of the field. Those who do not respond to conservative treatment undergo more serious interventions including steroid injections or surgery, each with additional risks and recovery time. To develop experimental protocols aimed at prevention and nonsurgical interventions are needed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the immediate effects of a Stretching exercise, Eccentric exercise and Percutaneous Elecrtrical Stimulation (PES) technique in flexibility and function FHL muscle in young dancers
Method. 45 dancers were recruited for the study, divided randomly into three groups, each comprising 15 dancers: Stretching group, Eccentric group and PES Group. All subjects performed three ballet test, before and after interventions: functional MTP joint extension (range of motion); balanced in unilateral stance heel raised (demi-pointe) and eyes open, until fatigue (balance test); and an unilateral heel raise fatigue test (endurence test). Measurements were taken on each participant´s stance limb.</summary>
