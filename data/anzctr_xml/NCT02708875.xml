Experimental: Mixed Meal Challenge - Participants will consume a liquid mixed meal (300 calories - fat, carbohydrate, and protein) for monitoring changes in glucose metabolism, plasma insulin and microvascular responses in skeletal muscle over 2 hours.

Active Comparator: Glucose Challenge - Participants will consume a glucose challenge (50g glucose) for monitoring changes in glucose metabolism, plasma insulin and microvascular responses in skeletal muscle over 2 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insulin resistance (or pre-diabetes) is diagnosed using the oral glucose tolerance test.
      However, high blood glucose levels during this test may adversely impact on microvascular
      function. Investigators will determine whether a liquid mixed meal challenge (from
      carbohydrate, protein and fat) is a more appropriate test for assessing microvascular-derived
      insulin resistance.</summary>
