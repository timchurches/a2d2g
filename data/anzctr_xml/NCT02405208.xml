             investigation.

          3. Subject agrees to comply with this protocol, including participating in required
             follow-up visits at the investigations site and completing study questionnaires.

          4. Subject is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature at the time of surgery.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Have destruction of the proximal humerus to preclude rigid fixation of the humeral
             component.

          2. Insufficient bone quality as determined by intra-operative evaluation.

          3. Have arthritis with defective rotator cuff.

          4. Have had a failed rotator cuff surgery.

          5. Have loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in the
             affected limb rendering the procedure unjustified.

          6. Have evidence of active infection.

          7. Present with a condition of neuromuscular compromise of the shoulder (e.g.,
             neuropathic joints or brachioplexis injury with a flail shoulder joint).

          8. Are unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program or would fail to
             return for the postoperative follow-up visits prescribed by the protocol.

         10. Have a known allergic reaction to pyrocarbon.

         11. Have other conditions such as central nervous system disturbances, alcohol or drug
             addiction, etc. that may make effective evaluation of the joint replacement difficult
             or impossible.

         13. Have known, active metastatic or neoplastic disease.
