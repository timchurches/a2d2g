  <interventions>
    <interventions>One tooth with root caries will be restored with 5% chlorhexidine-modified glass-ionomer cement (GIC) restorative material applied using the Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART). ART only uses hand instruments to clean the cavity and place the restoration. No drilling or local anaesthetic is required. The procedure is expected to take 30-45 min. A clinician with 9 years of experience will be placing the restorations. Intervention will take place at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Otago. </interventions>
    <comparator>A tooth on the opposite side of the mouth will be restored with conventional GIC restorative material for comparison, also using the Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART). </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations from previous studies (Percival et al., 1991; Marsh et al., 1992; Percival et al., 1994) have demonstrated that the inclusion of 30 participants is sufficient to detect trends or statistically significant changes with 80% power and a Type 1 error rate of 5%.  In this study, 4 more participants will be recruited to allow for dropouts or loss to follow up during the trial period. As these are repeated measurements, this pilot study will generate estimates of Intra Class Correlation (ICC) which will then be used to determine the sample size for future clinical trials.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increasingly, elderly people are retaining natural teeth but their oral hygiene and dental care needs are often neglected. A major problem the elderly face is the high frequency of root caries. Strategies to render root surfaces less susceptible to microbial colonization and decay have not had long-lasting effects and a simple treatment appropriate to those with reduced function to arrest root caries in the long term is not available. Glass-ionomer cements (GIC) are effective against cariogenic bacteria in children and on root surfaces in vitro. We have modified GIC with chlorhexidine (GIC-CHX) to deliver greater and longer lasting antiplaque activity. In this pilot study, we propose to investigate the effectiveness of modified GIC to elderly patients with root surface caries when applied using a relatively non-invasive approach (Atraumatic Restorative Treatment, ART), facilitating subsequent investigations of applying ART on a domiciliary basis to elderly people in care homes or housebound.</summary>
