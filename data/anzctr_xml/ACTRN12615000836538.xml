  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will consist on two weekly 1-hour sessions for 8 weeks. It will be based on a Motion-Controlled Video Game on Microsoft Xbox Kinect ,and it will be carried out indoor, in a room of the local fibromyalgia association´s building.

The Virtual Reality program comprises different activities: 
1) Warm-up tasks based on joint movement.
2) Aerobic dance tasks at adjustable intensity.
3) Gait tasks. Participants have to walk on a footprints circuit.
4) Postural tasks focused on static and dynamic balance control.

Sessions will be performed in groups of three women. A technician will conduct and supervise all sessions. This technician will register the attendance.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite primary outcome: Health-related quality of life and impact of fibromyalgia. Three well-known generic Health-related quality of life questionnaires will be utilized: EQ-5D-5L, AQoL, and 15D. Impact of fibromyalgia (sometimes known as specific health-related quality of life) will be assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and its revised version, the FIQ-R.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and after 8-week treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>bodily pain. It will be assessed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and with an algometer on the fibromyalgia-specific tender points.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and after 8-week treatment.
Before and after each session.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite primary outcome: Activities of daily living and physical fitness. The following fitness outcomes will be measured:
a) Dynamic balance using Timed-up and go
b) Lower limb strength using 30s chair stand test and the 10-step stair climbing test with and without carrying a load.
c) Hand-grip strength using a grip-strength dynamometer (TKK 5401 Model).
d) Aerobic endurance using the Six Minutes Walk Test.
e) Upper body strength using the Arm Curl Test. 
f) Velocity: The time needed to walk 20m will be recorded.
g) Balance using Biodex Balance System. This device measures, in degrees, the tilt about each axis during static and dynamic conditions and calculates a mediolateral stability index, an anteroposterior stability index, and an overall stability index.

All tests will be performed with a wireless motion capture device "Functional Assessment of Biomechanics (FAB)" in order to assess the motor pattern of the activities of daily living.</outcome>

    <concealment>Allocation is not concealed. All participants will be recruited from a local fibromyalgia association. One of the researchers will determine if a subject is elegible for inclusion and will randomly allocate the participants to one of the two groups. This researcher will be aware of the decission but will not take part in the acquisition or statistical analysis of data. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization and allocation processes will be performed by one of the researchers using random code numbers. Each participant will be assigned a number in the order of their arrival. After that, 31 random numbers from 0 to 62 will be generated using the website: http://randomnumbergenerator.intemodino.com/es/generador-de-numeros-aleatorios.html. The 31 participants with the generated numbers will be assigned to the intervention group, and the other 31 will be assigned to the control group. In order to preserve the double blind factor, this researcher will not take part in the acquisition or statistical analysis of data. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated for the FIQ score. A Minimal clinically important difference in the FIQ is a reduction of 14% in the total FIQ score. Assuming an unilateral alternative, we can detect differences of at least 14% with a power of 85% and a of 0.05 with two groups of 26 participants, with a mean in the FIQ of 70.5 and a standard deviation of 11.8 points. Assuming a maximum loss of follow-up of 20%, we will recruit 31 participants with fibromyalgia for each group. 

The statistical analysis will be developed for two types of groups: a) intention to treat, with all patients randomised; and b) protocol evaluation, with patients who follow all the instructions and complete the treatment.

Both groups will be compared at baseline. Continuous variables will be analysed with one-way analysis of variance or the non-parametric method of Kruskall-Wallis, and Chi-square tests. 

Training effects on the outcome variables will be assessed using the ANOVA of repeated measures. 

For each outcome variable, the effect size and the level of significance corresponding to the main group (among-subjects), time (within-subjects) and interaction (group × time) effects will be reported.

Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses will be performed, taking into account the socio-demographic variables cited above. Cost-effectiveness will be compared between the intervention and the control group. Direct medical costs, visits to the health care center, and work absence costs will be estimated based on Spanish data. Cost-utility analyses will be performed through the single utility score of generic HRQoL questionnaires like 15D or EQ-5D-5L

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Fibromyalgia is a chronic disease characterized by widespread pain and several associated symptoms, which lead a reduction in health-related quality of life and activities of daily living. Virtual reality is a novel training alternative that has shown to be useful as a complementary treatment of different conditions.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial will be carried out. A number of 62 women with fibromyalgia will participate in the study. The virtual reality training program will consist on 2 weekly 1-hour sessions for 8 weeks. It will be based on Motion-Controlled Video Games and focused on the development of postural control, balance, endurance and strength. Effects on health-related quality of life, pain, physical fitness, activities of daily living, wellbeing, and depression will be assessed. Results will be compared with a control group that will continue with their daily life.

Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims to evaluate the effects of a virtual reality-based physical exercise program in women suffering from fibromyalgia.</summary>
