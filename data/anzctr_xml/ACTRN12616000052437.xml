  <interventions>
    <interventions>Open label pharmacokinetic study of meropenem and tazocin in septic patients requiring slow low efficiency dialysis (SLED) with haemodiafiltration (HDF).
Both the dialysis therapy and antibiotic therapy will be administered regardless of enrolment. 
The pharmacokinetic study relates to a single SLED-HDF session, where the antibiotic (meropenem or tazocin) has been administered intravenously prior to the start of the dialysis session. Samples are then taken to measure antibiotic concentrations over time during the dialysis session.  Where possble the pharmacokinetic study will be repeated during the next dialysis session which may be 24 or 48 hours later, depending upon the patient's clinicall status.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of pharmacokinetics of meropenem or tazocin for septic patients requiring SLED-HDF for the treatment of their acute kidney injury.
The pharmacokinetics of these drugs on SLED-HDF will be estimated using a population pharmacokinetic approach with the standard software NONMEM (ver 7.2.0).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timed sampling across a dialysis session. 
Baseline pre-antibiotic dose, then at 15min, 30min, 60 min, 2hours post antibiotic but pre-SLED-HDF.
 Commencement SLED-HDF. Blood samples at 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, 60 min, 2hours, 4hours and 6 hours and then immediately prior to next dose.
Blood samples wil be taken before and after dialysis membrane.
Dialysate samples: baseline, 30 mins, 60 mins, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours.
Urine samples (if not anuric). Baseline, 0-2hours (predialysis). 0-2 hours on dialysis, 2 - 6 hours on dialysis (before next dose of antibiotic).
Each participant will undergo 2 pharmacokinetic clearance studies on SLED-HDF. These will be separated by at least 24  48 hours as SLED-HDF is usually scheduled on alternate days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate how quickly two potent anitbiotics used to treat septic patients in the ICU are removed by dialysis. Septic patients often have acute kidney injury and require dialysis support to maintain kidney function. We do not know how well antibiotics are removed by dialysis and therefore do not have appropriate dosing guidelines to ensure adequate therapeutic concentrations of the antibiotic is maintained. This study will measure the changes in antibiotic concentrations over a dialysis session. The results will enable us to more accurately recommend the correct dose and timing for the dose for septic patients with acute kidney injury.</summary>
