  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in the TEAS group were performed TEAS for 30 min before the induction of anesthesia in the holding area. TEAS was applied to two pairs of acupoints: bilateral Hegu (LI4) and Neiguan (PC6).The acupoints were stimulated with a dense-disperse frequency of 2/10 Hz and an intensity of 69 mA for 30 min, using the Hans electronic acupuncture apparatus (HANS-100A, Nanjing Jisheng Medical Technology Company, Nanjing, China).</interventions>
    <comparator> In the sham group, the patients had the electrodes applied, but received no stimulation.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome was mechanical pain threshold.

      <timepoint>Mechanical pain threshold  was assessed before surgery and postoperatively 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 24 h. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postoperative pain intensity was rated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Postoperative pain intensity was rated at postoperative hours 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 24.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)</outcome>
      <timepoint>A patient will be considered to suffer from PONV if nausea or vomiting is documented in 24 h after surgery.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> The incidence of dizziness</outcome>
      <timepoint>The incidence of dizziness was evaluated in 24 h postoperatively.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Our sample size calculation for the two-tailed testing of the TEAS superiority hypothesis was based on the peri-incisional mechanical pain thresholds. A 30% difference represents a clinically relevant significance based on a previous study. The estimated sample size was 28 patients per group with a power of 80% at a a level of 0.05. Thus, the sample size was set at 30 patients per group allowing for incomplete follow-up or dropout. 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Parametric data were reported as mean (standard deviation) and analyzed with the independent t-test, and nonparametric data were reported as median (interquartile range) and analyzed using the MannWhitney U-test. Categorical variables were reported as the number of patients (%) and evaluated using the x2 or Fishers exact test when appropriate. A P-value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS), a non-invasive technique, can be applied by personnel with minimal training. Several clinical trials have demonstrated that TEAS has the potential to reduce postoperative pain and perioperative analgesic consumption. However, the effects of TEAS on remifentanil induced hyperalgesia remains unknown. Therefore, we designed this prospective, randomized, double-blind study to verify the hypothesis TEAS can alleviate remifentanil induced hyperalgesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.</summary>
