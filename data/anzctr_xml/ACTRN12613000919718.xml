  <interventions>
    <interventions>BTD-001 will be supplied as the active drug substance in powder form, for the Pharmacist to re-constitute as a concentrated stock solution.

To improve palatability and to preserve the double blind nature of the proposed trial, Balance has established that grape Kool-AID and orange TANG (provided by Balance) mask the bitterness of the drug substance.  Subjects will be allowed to choose either Kool-AID or TANG and maintain that choice throughout the study.  BTD-001 stock solution is diluted with 200mL of the fruit flavored drink by the pharmacist and administered at 4 dose levels: 

25 mg
50 mg
100 mg
200 mg

Placebo will be Sterile, non pyrogenic Water for Irrigation, BP. One milliliter (1 mL) of placebo will be diluted in 200 mL of a fruit flavored drink (e.g., orange TANG or grape Kool AID) and consumed orally by the subject.  The subject will remain on the same dose throughout the intervention period.

The pharmacist will prepare the BTD-001 stock solutions daily for the final drug product and placebo.  The dosing period is a total of 7 consecutive days.  On day 1 subjects receive a single dose of study medication in the AM.  On Days 2-5, the pharmacist will dispense two doses for each subject, one to be consumed in the AM at the unit, and one to be consumed at home in the evening.  Morning dose on Days 1, 2 and 7 is consumed at least 1 hour prior to breakfast; on Days 3-6 may be at least 1 hour prior to, or at least 2 hours after breakfast. The PM dose for days 2-6 is to be taken at least 2 hours after the evening meal.  On day 6 the subject will receive both the AM and PM dose in the unit.  On day 7 a single AM dose is administered in the unit.  

Compliance for AM doses will be monitored and documented by site staff.  compliance for PM doses not consumed in the unit will be determined by examining returned dosing containers and questioning the volunteer.  Compliance will be documented in a binary form only - volunteer compliant yes or no.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be evaluated by:

-Collection of adverse events
-Physical and neurologic examination
-Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate)
-Weight
-Laboratory studies:
   -Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets
   -Serum chemistry (including TSH)
   -Urinalysis
   -Pregnancy tests (females only)
-Electrocardiograms (ECG)
-State Trait Anxiety Inventory (State component only)
-Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (Already Enrolled Subjects component only)

Twelve lead ECG will be performed following recommendations in ICH E14 regarding evaluation of QTc prolongation in patients in early stage clinical trials.   ECGs will be performed in triplicate on Days 1, 2 and 7.  

Known/possible adverse events include:
-Risk of seizure: individuals with a history of seizure (except for early single, uncomplicated early childhood febrile seizure) or neurologic disorders which might increase risk of seizure are excluded.

-Risk of psychiatric side effects: Individuals with a history of clinically significant (ie requiring medication or psychotherapy) depression or other psychiatric disorders within 2 years prior to the study are excluded. Subjects who report an adverse event of sadness or depression will be administered an unscheduled C-SSRS using the Already Enrolled Subjects version.

-Risk of cardiac events, individuals with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, a family history of prolonged QTc, or screening ECG abnormalities are excluded. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PK sampling of plasma  will be conducted in all subjects at various time-points throughout the study.

The concentration of BTD-001 and two metabolites will be determined using a high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) method. 

Plasma samples may be retained, at Sponsors discretion, for possible analyses of additional BTD-001 metabolites at some future time.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, parallel arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects will be randomized to one of 5 arms, 4 dose levels of BTD-001 (25mg, 50mg, 100mg or 200mg) or placebo.  Each arm consists of 6 subjects for a total of 30 subjects. 

Subjects will complete a Screening period of up to 28 days, and will be admitted to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1. First dose will be administered on the morning of Day 1. Plasma samples for PK analyses, vital signs and ECGs will be collected at multiple time points on Days 1 and 2. To allow full PK characterization of the first dose, no evening dose will be administered on Day 1, though dosing will be BID subsequently. 

Subjects will be discharged on Day 2 with their evening dose of medication and a diary card.  
Subjects will report to clinic each morning on Days 3-6 for the AM dose of medication.  On Days 3, 4 and 5, they will be issued with the evening dose and a diary card.

Subjects will be readmitted to the research unit of Day 6 and will receive the evening dose of study drug in the unit, approximately 12 +/- 1 hours prior to the scheduled AM dose for Day 7.  Following the AM dose on Day 7, subjects will remain in the CRU for at least 8 hours, during which PK and safety measures will be collected. Subjects will then be discharged home. 

A final Safety Follow Up visit will take place on Day 14, one week after the last dose of study drug.
