  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be allocated an age-appropriate high fruit and vegetable diet (that is, according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines for their age group; for 2-3 years: 3.5 combined serves per day; for 4-8 years: 6 combined serves per day; and for 9-11 years: 7 combined serves per day) and provided with weekly food hampers containing a variety of fruit and vegetable products for 6 months. Participants will be asked to limit juice intake to no more than 1/2 cup per day. No other changes will be made to the diet. Participants and their carer will have a 1 hour face-to-face consult with a dietitian at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months, where they will be counselled on their assigned dietary intervention, including the provision of recipes and ideas to help the child adhere to the dietary recommendations. Between weeks 4 and 26, the participant's carer will receive fortnightly calls from a dietitian to address any issues relating to dietary adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will continue with their usual consumption of fruits and vegetables, and will receive a hamper containing foods consistent with their usual intake. To ensure they are adhering to their usual diet, participants and their carer will have a face-to-face consult with a dietitian at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and will receive fortnightly calls from a dietitian between weeks 4 and 26. The child and their family will be provided with an information brochure on general healthy eating for their age and a personalised consultation with a dietitian at the end of the trial.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease, affecting one in seven children. Many children have asthma flare-ups, which often results in several sick days requiring increased use of medications, such as ventolin, and may lead to an emergency room visit or even a hospital admission. We have conducted studies in adults, which indicate that certain dietary changes can reduce the risk of an asthma flare-up. However, we do not know whether this is true in children. This study will examine whether the frequency of asthma flare-ups in children can be reduced, by making specific changes to the diet. We hope to gain insight into how diet may be useful for managing children with asthma.</summary>
