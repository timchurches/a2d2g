  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - tamoxifen citrate
Treatment: surgery - conventional surgery
Treatment: other - radiation therapy
Treatment: surgery - Axillary clearance

Experimental: Surgery w/ axillary clearance, tamox - Either a total mastectomy with axillary clearance, or a lesser procedure (quadrantectomy or lumpectomy with radiotherapy to the conserved breast) with axillary lymph node dissection, and tamoxifen (20 mg) given after surgery for the duration of 5 years or until relapse.

Experimental: Surgery w/o axillary clearance, tamox - Either a total mastectomy without axillary clearance, or a lesser procedure (quadrantectomy or lumpectomy with radiotherapy to the conserved breast) without axillary lymph node dissection, and tamoxifen (20 mg) given after surgery for the duration of 5 years or until relapse.


Treatment: drugs: tamoxifen citrate
20 mg daily beginning within 6 weeks of surgery for 5 years or until relapse, whichever occurs first.

Treatment: surgery: conventional surgery
Either total mastectomy or, optionally if the tumor was smaller than 5 cm, a breast conserving procedure (lumpectomy or quadrantectomy).

Treatment: other: radiation therapy
No radiotherapy is to be given after mastectomy. Radiotherapy is optional after breast conserving surgery according to prospectively determined guidelines within each institution. It should be given to the breast only and not to the draining node areas.

Treatment: surgery: Axillary clearance
Axillary node dissection.

    <summary>RATIONALE: Removing axillary lymph nodes may be effective in stopping the spread of breast
      cancer cells. It is not yet known if surgery to remove breast cancer is more effective with
      or without lymph node removal.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of breast surgery with or
      without removal of axillary lymph nodes in treating women who have stage I or stage IIA
      breast cancer.</summary>
