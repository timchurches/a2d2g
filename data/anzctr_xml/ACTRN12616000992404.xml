  <interventions>
    <interventions>The lifestyle intervention was conducted at Westmead Hospital, Australia from 2004 to 2007 in patients diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Subjects were randomised at baseline to one of 3 intervention arms (Group A, B or C) or a control group. 
Group A was a low-intensity intervention consisting of 3 consultations over four weeks (Baseline, 2 and 4 weeks). 
Group B was a moderate-intensity 10 week consisting of 6 fortnightly consultations (baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10). 
Group C had an identical intervention as Group B in the first 3 months and then received a telephone-based maintenance program through to 12 months to assess whether such a program would result in an improved level of sustained change. Telephone calls were made to participants in Group C at 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 months from baseline.
 
The intervention developed for this study was based on behavioural theory and consisted of strategies aimed at affecting mediators and addressing specific determinants of behaviours was based on elements derived from Social Cognitive Theory, the Transtheoretical Model, the Theory of Self-Determination and Motivational Interviewing. The intervention consisted of individual face to face counselling sessions delivered by dietitians/exercise physiologists. The initial session was 1 hour and the review sessions were 45 -60 minutes. The counselling aimed to assist participants in making positive changes to physical activity and dietary behaviours.
Participants were encouraged to increase both planned and incidental moderate-intensity physical activity to achieve at least 150 minutes per week for general health and 200 minutes or more per week for weight loss. They were encouraged to aim for a diet low in saturated fats and processed food and a reduction in daily energy intake for weight loss.
The counselling sessions included discussion of the participants and the Intervention Goals, reflection on current diet and physical activity habits, Goal Setting, review of participants, self-efficacy and motivation for change, discussion of barriers to change, information and education to support dietary and physical activity changes along with review and discussion of progress. Databases were developed to collect data on participant attendance and record implementation of telephone consultations.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group received an initial consultation at baseline in which their biochemical, anthropometric, physical activity and dietary assessment results were provided along with an interpretation of the results. This included a written report containing the participants results and the reference or ideal range for each result. The nutrition and physical activity intervention goals of the intervention were explained to the controls at this consultation. However, they were not provided with support, advice or assistance in making changes and were similarly not advised to not make changes if they wanted to do so.
This 1 hour face-to-face individual consultation was provided by an exercise physiologist/dietitian. The control phase was limited to 3 months as it was not considered ethical to withhold the intervention from patients for a longer period of time. At the end of the 3 month control phase, participants initially randomized as controls were invited to participate in the intervention phase. Those who accepted this offer underwent randomisation to one of the three intervention groups.

Waist measurement was taken at two points: i) the mid-point between the lower costal border and the iliac crest and ii) the umbilicus. For each of these points, 3 measures were taken using a steel tape measure and the average calculated to provide the waist measurement at each assessment timepoint.</outcome>

    <concealment> Once eligibility was established, a sealed envelope was opened, revealing the group to which the participant had been allocated. Opening of randomisation envelopes and allocation to intervention group was done with more than one staff member present. The group to which each eligible participant was randomised was documented at the time the envelope was opened along with the names of the staff members present at the time of randomisation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants had a 25% chance of being allocated to each of the four study groups. A statistician used a computer program to generate the randomisation lists.. A staff member not involved in delivering the intervention wrote the group allocation according to randomisation number on a piece of paper and placed each in a sealed envelope.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a  lifestyle intervention based on behaviour change theories on  liver enzymes and metabolic abnormalities in patients diagnosed with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or Hepatitis C and not receiving anti-viral therapy.
We hypothesised that if successful; such an intervention would reduce the metabolic risk profile of patients and thereby lead to a reduction in the drivers of hepatic steatosis and inflammation.</summary>
