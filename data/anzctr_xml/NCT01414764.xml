  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Autologous conditioned plasma (ACP)
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Active Comparator: Autologous conditioned plasma (ACP) - 10ml of patient's own venous blood is aspirated. The syringe is centrifuged in a proprietary closed unit (Arthrex Medical Company) for 5 minutes. The red blood cells will be discarded, and the supernatant containing ACP (with additional CaCl to activate the ACP and local anaesthetic) is injected into the tendon bone junction and adjacent area under ultrasound guidance. No adverse consequences are anticipated by using the Arthrex ACP injection.
First injection at approximately 10 days post-operatively
Second Injection at approximately 21 days post-operatively
Other Names:
Platelet rich plasma (PRP)

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 10ml of patient's own venous blood is aspirated. The syringe is centrifuged in a proprietary closed unit (Arthrex Medical Company) for 5 minutes. The venous blood sample will be discarded and a placebo (saline + local anaesthetic) is injected to the surrounding tissue, but not into the tendon, under guided ultrasound.
First injection at approximately 10 days post-operatively
Second Injection at approximately 21 days post-operatively


Other interventions: Autologous conditioned plasma (ACP)
10ml of patient's own venous blood is aspirated. ACP (1ml) (extracted from centrifuged venous sample), with additional calcium chloride is then injected into the tendon-bone junction and adjacent area under guided ultrasound.
First injection at approximately 10 days post-operatively
Second Injection at approximately 21 days post-operatively

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
10ml of patient's own venous blood is aspirated. The syringe is centrifuged in a proprietary closed unit (Arthrex Medical Company) for 5 minutes. The venous blood sample will be discarded and a placebo (1ml saline + local anaesthetic) is injected to the surrounding tissue, but not into the tendon, under guided ultrasound.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to establish if the application of autologous conditioned plasma
      (ACP), also described as platelet rich plasma (PRP), to the site of supraspinatus tendon
      repair beginning within two weeks of surgery, can improve patient outcomes over the course of
      12 months. These outcomes will be measured by post-surgical pain and function scores,
      shoulder strength and range of motion (ROM), and radiological parameters of tendon healing.
      Outcome measures will be compared to a control group of patients receiving placebo injections
      following surgery (saline plus local anaesthetic).

      This study is significant for being the first double blind randomised control trial, using
      two PRP injections to examine the efficacy of a PRP preparation following surgical repair of
      supraspinatus tendon. The objective is to prolong and enhance the tendon healing response
      initiated by surgery.

      The research hypothesis is that enhanced tendon healing following the PRP injections will
      lead to more rapid rehabilitation and lower rates of re-rupture of the repaired tendon
      compared to the control group.</summary>
