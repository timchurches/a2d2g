  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two seperate invervention groups and a comparator group ie three groups in total. Both intervention groups will undertake three walking based exercise prescriptions per week for twelve weeks consisting of either i) maximal volitional activity (Maximal Volitional Intensity Training group or MVIT)or ii) high intensity activity (High Intensity Intermittent Training group or HIIT). There will be an incremental increase in the MVIT exercise prescriptions over the twelve week study but estimated duration of the intervention per session (including warm up and cool down periods) for both intervention groups is about 30 minutes.

The exercise classes will be led by applied science students under the supervision of exercise physiologists. The applied science students will have received prior training in the administration of exercise prescriptions, from the relevant exercise physiologists. 

The MVIT participants will undergo a minimum of three maximal volitional intensity (ie 'all out') exercises of 30 seconds duration, building up to up to six repetitions of 45 seconds. The HITT participants will undertake four 4 minute exercises at an intensity of 85-95% peak heart rate, interspersed with three recovery periods of three minutes at 65-75% peak heart rate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three walking based low intensity endurance exercise prescriptions per week for twelve weeks, of approximately 45 minutes duration per session (includiing warm up and cool down periods). Participants will be asked to walk at an intensity that achieves a heart rate (HR) that is 65-75% of their predicted peak HR.

The exercise classes will be led by applied science students under the supervision of exercise physiologists. The applied science students will have received prior training in the administration of exercise prescriptions, from the relevant exercise physiologists.</comparator>

Fasting venous blood samples will be collected before and after the exercise intervention. Plamsa samples will be prepared then stored at minus 20 degrees celcius. Batched measurement of lipids ie total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides will be undertaken at completion of the study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the barriers identified by individuals to achieving exercise goals is lack of time.  Can short bursts of exercising at increased intensity (for example maximal volitional activity) achieve the same level of fitness as traditional walking based fitness programme, over a shorter time period per exercise session?</summary>
