  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will provide nursing staff and personal care assistants in aged care residential facilities with a mobile and web-based system (Nurses Behavioural Assistant; NBA) to help address the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia in real time. This will be provided for a period of 4 weeks. 
Nursing staff and personal care assistants will be provided with a 1 hour training session on how to use the NBA prior to the commencement of the research. The NBA is an online system that presents nurses with a number of common behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia which can be selected. Once selected, a series of behavioural intervention strategies will be presented. Recommendations will be provided until nursing staff find a resolution to the problem. Interventions include areas such as wandering, aggression and sleep disturbances.  Nursing staff will be asked to provide information on the presenting problem, intervention used, and its effectiveness via the NBA.  This information will be recorded in the NBA and be assessable to nursing staff and researchers throughout the research period. 
Nursing staff and personal care assistants will also have access to an online web dashboard. This will graph and track the residents behaviour and interventions as imputed by the nursing staff. The web dashboard will also provide additional resources such as assessment tools and fact sheets.

    <comparator>Baseline assessments of nursing staff knowledge of dementia will be conducted.  

Baseline assessments of residents anxiety, depression, confusion, agitation and the number of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia experienced will be conducted.  Data on  age, gender, date of admission, any current diagnosis (medical and psychiatric), any  assessments done in the last 12 months, behaviour incident reports and current medications (including vitamins)  will be collected from participants facility files.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study aims to provide nursing staff in aged care residential facilities with a psychologically-based mobile application in conjunction with a web-based system. The Nurses Behavioural Assistant (NBA) will provide evidence based interventions to assist nursing staff to implement effective non pharmacological behavioural intervention strategies in response to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in real time. Through educating nursing staff via the NBA it is anticipated that they will have more management strategies to draw from and feel more competent when responding. As a consequence, the residents may experience an improved quality of life and may show a decrease in the number behavioural and psychological symptoms experienced. 

The current research will be conducted at an aged care residential facility which houses 30 residents, with approximately 30 personal care attendants and nursing staff. Nursing staff and personal care attendants will be provided with an initial NBA training session, and then asked to use the NBA application over a 4 week period. Data on the BPSD each resident experiences and the interventions used will be inputted via the NBA mobile application and then automatically transferred to a secure server. Data will also be viewable to nurses via the web-dashboard. This data will be used to measure the NBA uptake, as well as the effectiveness of the behavioural management strategies recommended. Residents will be assessed on their level of dementia, anxiety, depression, confusion and agitation. Nursing staff will be assessed on their level of knowledge regarding BPSD, before and after the intervention. Nursing staff will also be interviewed to provide feedback regarding the implementation of the NBA at the end of the research. The results will provide a theoretical and applied basis for future expansion of the NBA system to other aged care facilities
