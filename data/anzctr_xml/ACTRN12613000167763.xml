  <interventions>
    <interventions>The PROCEPT Aquablation(TM) System (PAS) is intended to remove prostate tissue as a treatment for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). 
The transurethral procedure involves the delivery of a high pressure water jet that cuts through tissue without thermal injury.
A dedicated surgical laser (the AquabeamTM), delivered through a column of water coagulates bleeding tissues.
The approximate duration of this procedure is 60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Not applicable.  This is a single arm study with no comparator or control.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the performance of the PAS device for the treatment of BPH.  This outcome is assessed with a 5 point Likert Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Completion of the intended surgical procedure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence and Severity of Adverse Events.  Anticipated adverse events might include prolonged catheterisation and haematuria.  Based on ICH GCP Guidelines, AES are graded based on severity (mild, moderate, severe), relatedness to the device (definitely, likely, unlikely, definitely not) , relatedness to the procedure (as for device), and outcome (recovered, recovering, recovered with sequelae, ongoing).  All Adverse events are  documented,  assessed by the investigator for severity, duration and frequency and reviewed by an Independent Assessor.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Procedure up until 3 years. A protocol amendment will now require follow up for 36 months with assessments at treatment, post procedure, 1 week, 1 month, 3 month 6 month and annual visits at 12, 24 and 36 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in IPSS (International Prostate Symptom Score) and IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post procedure, one week, One, Three, Six, twelve, twenty four and forty eight months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in peak urinary flow rate, post-void residual volume and PDet/Qmax (Schaffer grade).  These outcome measures are assessed using Uroflowmetry, Urodynamics and Ultrasound procedures.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post procedure, one week, One, Three, Six, twelve, twenty four and forty eight months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in prostate volume as determined via trans rectal ultrasound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The hypothesis is that the use of Aquablation will provide a clinically effective cutting and coagulation action on prostatic tissue without the need for thermal energy thereby reducing perioperative complications such as bleeding, catheterisation, shorter recovery time and dysuria.  It is hypothesised that the more effective operative technique will provide an earlier improvement in patients' quality of life as evidenced by a reduction in symptoms, no deterioration of erectile dysfunction and improvements in peak urinary flow rate and post void residual volume.</summary>
