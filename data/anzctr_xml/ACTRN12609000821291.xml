  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to improve the outcomes for frail elderly people follwoing a hospital admission.  Subjects will be telephoned once per month and asked about their self-rated health.  If they report their health is deteriorating following discharge they will be discussed at a multi-disciplinary team meeting and one or more relevant members of the team will visit them at home.  This is a pilot feasibility/ acceptability study so participants, carers and health professionals involved will also be interviewad about their views of the study.  Outcomes of residential care admission and subsequent hospital admissions will be compared with historical controls.  The results will be used for a power calculation for a subsequent randomised controlled trial (RCT).</summary>
