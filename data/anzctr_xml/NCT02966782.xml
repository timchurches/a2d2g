  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - venetoclax
Treatment: drugs - azacitidine

Experimental: Cohort 1 venetoclax monotherapy - Cohort 1 has two portions.
1 cycle = 28 days
Arm A: venetoclax 400 mg once daily (qd), n=12 Arm B: venetoclax 800mg once daily (qd), n=12
Both arms will be followed with a safety review.

Experimental: Cohort 2 venetoclax + azacitidine - Cohort 2 is dose escalation. 1 cycle = 28 days
3 dose level cohorts:
Dose level 1: Venetoclax 100 mg (Days 1-14) + azacitidine 75 mg/m2 (Days 1-7). n=3
Dose Level 2: Venetoclax 200 mg (Days 1-14) + azacitidine 75 mg/m2 (Days 1 -7). n=3
Dose Level 3: Venetoclax 400 mg (Days 1-14) + azacitidine 75 mg/m2 (Days 1-7). n=3

Experimental: Cohort 3 (Safety Expansion) - After completion of Cohorts 1 and 2, an aggregate safety and efficacy review of Cohorts 1 and 2 will be conducted to determine the treatment regimen (venetoclax monotherapy or venetoclax in combination with azacitidine) and preliminary RPTD for the chosen treatment regimen to be evaluated in the safety expansion cohort (Cohort 3).
