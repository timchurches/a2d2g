    <interventions>General practitioners will be provided with a multifaceted intervention to support increased chlamydia testing in general practice. The intervention includes computer alerts, incentive payments, educational package, register to recall patients for follow up tests and quarterly feedback on chlamydia testing performance.  The trial will be of up to 4 years duration.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chlamydia prevalence. A consecutive sample of men and women aged 16 to 29 years will be recruited prior to randomisation in each clinic and again at the conclusion of the trial. Men will be asked to provide a urine specimen and women a urine or self collected vaginal swab for chlamydia testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline and 4 years later at the conclusion of trial.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Diagnoses of PID will be extracted from each clinic's medical records software to determine the annual PID incidence and the cumulative incidence of PID at the conclusion of the trial 4 years later.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured throughout intervention period - annual PID incidence will be measured and a cumulative incidence measured at the conclusion of the trial after 4 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Chlamydia testing rates.

Chlamydia testing data will be extracted from the clinic medical records software and from the clinic pathology provider. Annual chlamydia testing rates will be calculated using the number of tests as the numerator and total number of patients seen at each clinic during the time frame as the denominator.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Calculated annually for 4 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An annual chlamydia retesting rate will be calculated for each clinic will be calculated for the 12 month period prior to commencement of the trial and then for each year of the trial till the end of the trial at 4 years.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Postcodes with a population of between 5000 to 30,000 16 to 29 year old adults will be selected on the basis of convenience. All GP clinics within each postcode will be invited to participate. GPs and practice managers will be sent a postcode informing them to expect further information about the study, this will be follow up by a newsletter about the study and then a phone call to arrange a face to face meeting about the study.  Once enrolled and the baseline chlamydia prevalence survey is complete, all postcodes will be randomised to either intervention or control group. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be “off-site” or at central administration siteClinics will be informed via phone call and then via mail of their group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Postcodes (clusters) will be randomised to the trial intervention or control strategies using a minimisation approach. This will maximise the balance across several baseline variables. These variables will include:
*	Estimated baseline chlamydia prevalence in each postcode;
*	Estimated overall baseline testing rate in each postcode;
*	Rural town, suburban and metropolitan geographical areas;
*	Estimated percentage of population aged &lt;30 years.

Geographical areas will be randomised at UNiversity of New South Wales as soon as data on all these variables, and specifically the estimated baseline chlamydia prevalence and testing rates, are available. This means that all areas do not have to be randomised at the same time, and the study does not need to wait until baseline chlamydia prevalence and testing rates are available for all areas. The randomised intervention can then commence in areas immediately, while other areas are performing baseline chlamydia surveys.
The randomisation sequence will be held by the statistician at UNiversity of New South Wales.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall design of ACCEPT for the purposes of the Department of Health and Ageing (DoHA) contract has been finalised and approved by ethics committees. The trial uses a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. Cluster randomisation is required because chlamydia is an infectious disease; randomising a group of people in the same geographic area (postcode) will allow the intervention to be delivered to people within the same social/sexual networks. The intervention aims to maximise the rate of regular chlamydia testing in people in the target age group who attend primary care services. The intervention will be randomised at the postcode level and all GP clinics and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) in each postcode (estimated at 2-3 clinics on average) will be invited to participate. Overall, about 80% of postcodes will be selected from rural/regional areas based on the Rural, Remote and Metropolitan Areas classification (RRMA 3-7) so that the intervention can be applied to whole communities of people more likely to be in the same social/sexual network. Further, because young people often attend multiple clinics, randomising postcodes in rural areas and recruiting all clinics in the postcode, will allow the intervention to be applied to whole communities and facilitate data collection. The fundamental premise of this trial is that increased levels of testing can be achieved by providing a supportive intervention and that once levels of testing are increased high enough (more than 30%), the prevalence of chlamydia will fall.</summary>
