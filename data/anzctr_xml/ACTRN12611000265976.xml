  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two sessions of cognitive-behavioural therapy delivered  face-to-face. Sessions will last one hour duration and will be one on one with a provisionally registered or fully registered psychologist. Sessions will be approximately three weeks apart (the first will be delivered approximately one week before discharge from hospital, the second will be delivered two weeks following discharge).

Participants will learn skills for relaxation, challenging unhelpful thoughts, how to manage uncertainty.</interventions>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Just prior to a patient being transferred from the ICU ward, nursing staff from the ward will let the patient know of some research being done through Griffith university for people who have had an injury and ask if they would like for the researcher to contact them to explain the study. If the patient agrees, the researcher will be given their name and ward and will make contact and go through information and consent form. If the patient says no, the patient will have no contact from the researcher. 

The patient will be allocated to either a treatment or control group on the basis of their scores on the illness perception questionnaire (this technique was advised after the study underwent statistical and methodological review at Griffith University to ensure for robust findings).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Specific aims of this research project include: 
1.Examining whether previous findings about associations between illness representations and health related quality of life in people who have had a traumatic injury are replicated.
2.The development and evaluation of a brief CBT intervention designed to enhance self-regulation in trauma injured patients and assist them to develop realistic and helpful cognitive representations which would in turn facilitate their coping and recovery processes. 

It is hypothesized that: 
1.Illness perceptions will be associated with health-related quality of life. 
2.Following the intervention, the intervention group will show more adaptive illness perceptions than the control group. 
3.Following the intervention, the intervention group will report better health-related quality of life than the control group.</summary>
