    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus With Diet and Exercise Intervention

Experimental: Tacrolimus With Diet and Exercise Intervention - Participants on tacrolimus for immunosuppression (drug which suppresses the body's immune response, used in transplantation and diseases caused by disordered immunity) will be provided with intensive dietary advice and supervised progressive resistance training (PRT) for a period of 6 months. Dosage and administration of tacrolimus will be as per Investigator's discretion.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Insulin Resistance - Percentage of participants with insulin resistance as defined by a Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) greater than 1. HOMA uses fasting glucose and insulin (or C-peptide) to assess beta-cell function and IR. HOMA-IR is used to estimate insulin resistance. HOMA-IR is calculated by equation: HOMA-IR=fasting plasma insulin (milliunit [mU] per liter [L]) * fasting plasma glucose (millimole per liter [mmol per L]) divided by 22.5.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Impaired Fasting Glycaemia (IFG) - IFG is defined as a fasting venous plasma glucose concentration greater than or equal to 6.1 mmol per L but less than 7.0 mmol per L, together with a 2-hour plasma glucose concentration of less than 7.8 mmol per L.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) - IGT is defined as fasting venous plasma glucose of less than 7.0 mmol per L, together with a 2-hour plasma glucose of greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol per L but less than 11.1 mmol per L.</outcome>

      <outcome>Beta Cell Function - HOMA-Beta is used to assess beta-cell function. HOMA-Beta is a measure of Beta-cell function (higher values present increased insulin secretion for a given glucose level). HOMA-Beta is calculated by the equation: HOMA-Beta=(20*FPI) divided by (FPG-3.5), where, FPI is fasting plasma insulin concentration (mU per L) and FPG is fasting plasma glucose concentration (mmol per L).</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Acute Rejection, Graft Loss and Death - Acute rejection episodes are classified into: Spontaneously resolving - a rejection episode which is not treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication, antibodies or any other medication. Corticosteroid sensitive - a rejection episode, which is treated with new or increased corticosteroid medication only. Corticosteroid resistant - a rejection episode, which is not resolve following treatment with corticosteroids. Graft loss is defined as re-transplantation, nephrectomy, death or as dialysis ongoing at study end (or at withdrawal of the participants from the study).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body Mass Index (BMI) - BMI is a statistical measurement which compares a person's weight and height.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist to Hip Ratio (WHR) - WHR is performed using a standard medical measuring tape, with recordings documented in centimeters. Measurements will be compared against data from participating sites (where available) and against baseline. Measurement of hip circumference will be performed at the widest part of the buttocks. Measurement of the waist will be performed at the smaller circumference of the natural waist (usually just superior to the umbilicus). WHR is calculated by dividing the waist measurement by the hip measurement, and recorded to 2 decimal places.</outcome>
