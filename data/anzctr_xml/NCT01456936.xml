      <outcome>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I), "No Change" Rating by Visit - The CGI-I is a clinician rated instrument that measures change in participant's psychiatric condition (or lack thereof in the stratum without psychiatric disorders) on a 7 point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse), with 4 = no change. The ratings were applicable even to those without psychiatric diagnoses (eg, those with no psychiatric symptoms would be rated as "normal, not at all ill" on the CGI-S at baseline and assuming no psychiatric symptoms emerge during the trial, would be rated as "no change" on the CGI-I at follow-up visits). For those participants with a psychiatric diagnosis, the clinician should rate the severity of the mental illness with respect to the clinician's experience with the psychiatric population to which the participant belongs.</outcome>
