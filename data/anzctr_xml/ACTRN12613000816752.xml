    <interventions>The 12-week hatha yoga program:
This program will consist of 12 weekly classes of one hour duration. All classes will be taught by the same instructor, who has three years of hatha yoga instructing experience. Sixty yogic poses and breathing commonly taught in fitness centres and private yoga studios will be instructed and practiced throughout the program. Modification of some poses will be suggested if subjects have limitations in their flexibility. Props such as mats and blocks will be used.

Adherence will be documented via attendance records recorded by the yoga teacher at each yoga intervention session. Each participant will be required to fill in Yoga Self-Practice Weekly Record Sheet which recorded the duration of self-practice. The completed sheets will be collected in the lesson of the following week, except the sheet recorded the twelfth week will be collected in post intervention assessment session. Apart from the yoga program, the yoga participants will be advised to maintain their routine activities and not to begin other exercise or mind-body program during the course of the study.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>C3. Flexibility
Outcome 11. Left leg flexibility:
The modified back-saver sit-and-reach test (MBS test) will be used to test of trunk flexion. The MBS test is a comparative better test to measure the low back and hamstring flexibility than other protocols as its similarity of criterion-related validity in women but it has better criterion-related validity in men, more practical as it requires minimal preparation time and equipment. It also eliminates excessive posterior compression of the vertebral disk when performing a single leg reach (Hui &amp; Yuen, 2000).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and post-intervention (12 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome 12. Right leg flexibility:
The modified back-saver sit-and-reach test (MBS test) will be used to test of trunk flexion. The MBS test is a comparative better test to measure the low back and hamstring flexibility than other protocols as its similarity of criterion-related validity in women but it has better criterion-related validity in men, more practical as it requires minimal preparation time and equipment. It also eliminates excessive posterior compression of the vertebral disk when performing a single leg reach (Hui &amp; Yuen, 2000).  </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>D. Physical activity level
Outcome 15. IPAQ
The short (7 day) form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Craig et al., 2003) will be applied to investigate the subjects physical activity level. A study was carried out to examine the reliability and validity of IPAQ in 12 countries (Craig et al., 2003). The result showed that IPAQ had reasonable measurement properties for monitoring population levels of physical activity among 18 to 65 years old adults in the diverse sample settings. Spearmans Rho clustered around 0.8 indicating reliable responses between repeat administrations for all versions of the IPAQ. The short IPAQ has been translated to Chinese and has demonstrated adequate reliability and validity for the measurement of total physical activity in a Chinese population (Macfarlane, Lee, Ho, Chan, &amp; Chan, 2007).</outcome>

      <outcome>E. Mental health: 
Outcome 16. Health related quality of life (HRQOL)
The MOS 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) (Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Gandek, 2000) includes one multi-item assessing each of eight health concepts: 1) physical functioning; 2) role limitations due to physical problems, 3) social functioning, 4) bodily pain, 5) general mental health, 6) role limitations due to emotional problems, 7) vitality, 8) general health perceptions. The internal consistency of the SF-36 ranged from .63 to .96 and the testretest reliability ranged from .60 to .81 (Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Gandek, 2000).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome 17. Perceived stress:
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) assesses the degree to which an individual appraises situations in his or her life as stressful (Cohen, &amp; Williamson, 1988). It consists of 10 Likert-type items designed to assess how unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overloaded respondents perceived their lives to be. A lower score is indicative of lower perceived stress and score can range from 0 to 56. The PSS has been shown to be valid, with internal reliability as determined by Cronbachs a of 0.902 (Smith et al., 2008).

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome 18. Depression: 
The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) is a 20-item self-report scale to measure depressive symtomatology in the general population. The scale has high internal consistency with Cronbachs a of 0.85 (Radloff, 1977). It yielded Cronbachs a of 0.92 in the study of Mitchell et al. (2007).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome 19. Anxiety (STAI):
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a 40-item self-report scale to evaluate state and trait anxiety (Spielberger, 1983). Cronbachs a for the state and trait subscales were 0.92 and 0.96, respectively, in the study of Mitchell, Mazzeo, Rausch, and Cooke (2007).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and post-intervention (12 weeks)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Outcome 20. Self-esteem
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) (Rosenberg, 1965) consists of 10-items, which examines the global self-esteem of individuals. The original scale is typically replaced with a Likert-type response format using a four-point scale anchored by 1 (Always Disagree) and 4 (Always Agree) (Sheasby, Barlow, Cullen, &amp; Wright, 2000). The reproducibility of the scale is 93%, scalability of items is 73%, and scalability of individuals is 72 % (Rosenberg, 1965). Internal consistencies in the study of Elavsky and McAuley (2007) were good (a ranged from .89 to .92 for baseline and post-intervention assessments, respectively).

2) Triglyceride (TG): greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL or on drug treatment for elevated TG
3) High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C): less than 40 mg/dL in men, less than 50 mg/dL in women or on drug treatment for reduced HDL-C
4) Systolic blood pressure (SBP): greater than or equal to 130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than or equal to 85 mmHg or on antihypertensive drug treatment in a patient with a history of hypertension
5) Fasting blood glucose (FBG): greater than 110 mg/dL or on drug treatment for elevated glucose

For those who do not meet at least 3 of the above criteria, they will be categorized in a non-metabolic syndrome group.</inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis:
The statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Sample description will be described; baseline characteristics, retention and program adherence, and all other outcome measures will be analyzed and reported. Paired t test and independent t test will be used to analyze continuous variables. Mann-Whitney test will be used to analyze continuous variables which did not have normal distribution. Chi square test will be employed to compare categorical variables. Statistical significance will be inferred by a two-tailed p value of .05 or less.

Sample size estimation:
Due to lacking of local research experience in running Hatha yoga intervention within the community (Hong Kong), the researcher estimated the attrition rate by referring to three overseas studies with similar study setting which illustrated a 22.0% attrition for a 12-week Hatha yoga program (Moadel et al., 2007), a 15.3% attrition for a 10-week Hatha yoga program (Smith et al., 2007), and a 8.33% attrition for another 10-week program (Booth-LaForce et al., 2007). Because the study intervention duration will last for 12 weeks, a 22.0% attrition rate will be estimated. Based on an earlier study (West et al., 2004), a sample size of 36 participants per group will be required to obtain an 80% power for detection of a difference of 0.08 g/dl in salivary cortisol level between the yoga group (intervention group) and the control group when performing a two-tailed test at a = 0.05. With consideration of 22% attrition rate, the target sample size of the study will be determined to be 46 participants for each group.
Estimation of total sample size = 46 X 4 groups (yoga group with metabolic syndrome + control group with metabolic syndrome + yoga group without metabolic syndrome + control group without metabolic syndrome) = 184 persons</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical inactivity is one of the main causes of major noncommunicable diseases and contributes substantially to the global burden of disease, death and disability. To reverse the trend towards inactivity, it is important to promote physical activities with low participation barrier and numerous benefits to encourage sedentary individuals to become physically active. Yoga has been increasingly popular and practiced as a low-to-moderate intensity physical activity in recent years. Yoga originated in India more than 5000 years ago and its principle is to achieve the integration of body, mind, and spirit. Growing evidence suggests the beneficial effects of Hatha yoga on various ailments, yet potential long-term effects of yoga on health are under-researched. Interpretation of and comparisons across many existing studies are limited by methodological problems. The current study aims to investigate the effects of yoga on physical and mental health in individuals with and without metabolic syndrome.</summary>
