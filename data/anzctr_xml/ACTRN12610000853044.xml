  <interventions>
    <interventions>The E2 stem is a cemented femoral device made of chrome-cobalt alloy. The stem has a double tapered geometry to aid the taper- slip theory of cement fixation.

The P2-cup is an all-polyethylene acetabular component intended for cemented fixation. The polyethylene cup is manufactured from highly cross-linked polyethylene that is manufactured by a 7.5Mrad irradiation cycle, melt annealing and subsequent ethylene oxide sterilisation. It is manufactured in sizes to accept 32mm and 36mm diameter femoral heads.

Surgical procedure is unilateral. Approximate duration of the surgical procedure time is 70 minutes. Theatre time is 2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the migration of the E2 Cemented femoral stem and the P2 all-poly cup, in primary cemented total hip replacement using an RSA technique to predict long-term safety and effectiveness of each hip system component from early post operative outcomes in a small cohort of patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at the 6 month, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years interval post surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the in-vivo wear of the P2 cup, in primary cemented total hip replacement using an RSA technique to determine polyethylene wear rates per annum in 3 directions.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To estimate the clinical complication rates for the Cemented E2 Total Hip System using clinical evaluations for disease specific scores (Oxford Hip Score) and non-disease specific scores Hip Dysfunction and Oestoarthritis Outcome Score(HOOS) in addition to collation of any adverse events including clinical and radiological underperformance.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this clinical study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the cemented Total Hip System (E2 stem/P2 cup). This will be done by collecting information and data on measured outcomes on the Total Hip System, using RSA method to provide early results on the implant. The intended use of this implant is for patients with degenerative joint disease who require a primary total hip replacement.</summary>
