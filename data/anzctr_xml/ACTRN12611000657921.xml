  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to establish the magnitude of variation in serial measurements of a cardiac hormone (NT-proBNP) that can be attributed to homeostatic fluctuations around a set-point (biological variation). Such information will be used to inform monitoring guidelines as to the magnitude of fluctuations that are not associated with adverse outcomes at the individual level and that can be safely ignored.

The study also intends to establish the analytic performance of the most commonly used NT-proBNP assay (Roche Elecsys 2010) in the dialysis population.</summary>
