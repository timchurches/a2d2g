  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants perform a treadmill test to exhaustion 2 weeks prior to their marathon.  The protocol included a five minute warm up at 4% incline and 4km/ h.  After five minutes the treadmill speed was increased to 6km/hr. for three minutes.  The following stages increased speed by 1km/h every 3 mins until a speed of 13km/hr. was obtained.  From here on the speed was kept constant at 13km/hr. The treadmill gradient was then increased by 2% every three minutes until a maximum gradient of 12% was reached  Participants continue exercising to exhaustion and then stop.  The time of the treadmill test is correlated to marathon time in 42.2km race.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between graded treadmill test to exhaustion and marathon time two weeks later.  The aim was to see if a treadmill test could predict upcoming marathon time to help the athlete with pacing and preparation for their marathon.</summary>
