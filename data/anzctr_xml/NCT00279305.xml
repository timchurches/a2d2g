  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Area Under the Stimulated C-peptide Curve Over the First 2 Hours of a 4-hour Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) Administered at 1 Year - The primary outcome is the area under the stimulated C-peptide curve (AUC) based on data collected at time 0 to 2 hours of a 4-hour mixed meal glucose tolerance test (MMTT) conducted at the primary endpoint visit. The timed measurements are done at: 0, 15, 30 60, 90, and 120 minutes.
The calculation for the concentration of c-peptide is a weighted average of the 6 timed measurements of c-peptide in nano-moles/Liter. We try to distinguish this calculation from the AUC by referring to it as the "AUC mean" and may be expressed algebraically as the AUC/(120 min.); thus, the units are the same as the y-axis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the
      insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without these beta cells, the body cannot
      maintain proper blood glucose levels in response to daily activities such as eating or
      exercise. With fewer insulin producing cells blood glucose increases, causing hunger, thirst,
      and unexplained weight loss. By the time these symptoms develop, 80-90% of a person's beta
      cells have already been destroyed. However, this also means that between 10-20% of these
      cells remain that continue to produce insulin.

      Scientists have learned that two types of immune cells, B cells and T cells, are involved in
      causing type 1 diabetes. T cells are responsible for attacking and destroying the beta cells
      that make insulin. Although they don't attack insulin producing cells, B cells may be what
      trigger the T cells to attack.

      This study will investigate the use of rituximab to see if it can help lower the number of
      immune B cells thereby preventing the destruction of any remaining insulin producing beta
      cells that remain at diagnosis. Rituximab is approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of a condition called B-lymphocyte lymphoma. Its effects on the
      immune system are well understood through its use in organ transplantation. Research has
      shown that rituximab might be helpful in treating other conditions caused by T cells and B
      cells, including type 1 diabetes. The goal of this study is to find out if rituximab can
      preserve residual insulin secretion and prevent further beta cell destruction in type 1
      diabetes.</summary>
