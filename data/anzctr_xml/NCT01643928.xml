For participants assigned to PF-05280586 in Study B3281001, blood samples were screened for ADA using the assay specific to PF-05280586; if the blood samples were confirmed to be positive (+ve) for ADA against PF-05280586, the samples were also analyzed using the assay specific for the licensed drug products to assess cross-reactivity of the ADA.

      <outcome>Percent Change From Initial Study Baseline in Individual Components of the ACR Response: Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) - by the End of Course 1 - HAQ-DI assessed the degree of difficulty participants experienced in 8 daily living activity domains during a week: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other activities. Each activity category consisted of 2-3 items. Each question's difficulty was scored from 0-3 (0=no difficulty, 1=some difficulty, 2=much difficulty, 3=unable to do). Activities requiring assistance (from people or assistive devices) were adjusted to =2 to denote more limited functional status. The questionnaire was to be completed by the participant prior to any procedures during the visit, if possible.
Overall HAQ-DI score was computed as the sum of domain scores divided by the number of domains answered, providing a score from 0-3. Low scores denoted improvement of disability/lower degree of domain difficulty.
Primary outcomes reported post baseline mean percent (%) changes in HAQ-DI score. Post baseline values are reported on the % change from initial study Baseline scale.</outcome>

      rituximab-Pfizer, as well as the safety and immunogenicity after transitioning from
