  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete a 1 hour exercise bout designed to induce delay-onset muscle soreness where paricipants walk backwards on a 13 degree incline at a speed of 2.2km/h whilst wearing a 10kg weight belt. This will be supervised by an exercise scientist. Immediately following this exercise bout, participants will complete either 10 x 1 minute bouts of whole-body vibration, standing on a Galileo vibration plate set at 26Hz and 4.5mm amplitude, with a 30 second rest between bouts or 15 minutes of static strethcing. This is a randomised crossover study and following a seven day washout, participants will complete the 1 hour of backwards walking followed by the other preventative intervention.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will investigate the effects of two different exercise modalities to recover from delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMs) generated by eccentric exercise of the leg musculature. The two recovery modalities are a traditional recovery technique (static stretching) and whole body vibration exercise (WBV) where a person stands on a vibration plate. The traditional technique is commonly used to recover from DOMS but is not associated with increased blood flow in the legs. Increased blood flow in the legs, however, is thought to be a significant factor in the recovery from DOMS. WBV has been shown to significantly increase blood flow in the legs, therefore, it is hypothesised that it will reduce the intensity of DOMS generated by eccentric exercise of the leg musculature (backward slow walking on a treadmill).

The level of DOMs will be assessed by a measurement of shank swelling (lower leg) and a muscle soreness rating. It is known that DOMs reduces strength and power output, and joint range of motion (ROM) in the hip, knee and ankle. These parameters will be measured by a vertical jump for maximum height, muscle activation through electromyography and joint ROM (ankle, knee and hip) with a goniometer. DOMs recovery will also be assessed by recording walking and running patterns since these are significantly affected by DOMS.</summary>
