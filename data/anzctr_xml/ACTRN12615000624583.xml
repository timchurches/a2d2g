  <interventions>
    <interventions>Health professional intervention: minimal psycho-educational written information provision (self-help booklet) about fertility and cancer accompanied by a single session of counselling.
The health professional consultation consisted of the self-help booklet followed up two weeks later by a one-hour telephone or Skype consultation between the participant and a counsellor trained in discussing fertility. Concerns or questions raised as a result of reading the booklet were discussed during the consultation, and suggestions for ameliorating fertility problems, based on the specific needs of participants, were offered.
The self-help information booklet is based on accounts of fertility concerns experienced by people with cancer and their partners, consultation with health professionals, and examination of existing written resources on cancer and fertility.  It consisted of 84 pages, which provided information about:reproduction and fertility, key questions, talking about fertility, Women's fertility and cancer treatment, women's options before cancer treatment, women's options after cancer treatment, men's fertility and cancer treatment, Men's options before cancer treatment, men's options after cancer treatment, assessing your fertility, preserving fertility in childern and adolescents, other paths to parenthood, being child free, the emotional impact, relatioships and sexuality, making will informed decisions, questions for reflection, and support services available.  </interventions>

    <concealment>In response to a study invitation, participants indicated whether they would like to be considered to take part in the evaluation of anintervention providing information about cancer related sexual changes. Those who agreed to take part were then randomly allocated to one of two conditions: self-help information only (SH), or information plus health
professional consultation (HP). Randomization was stratified according to gender and cancer classification.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Using stratified random sampling of participants in Stage one (survey) of the of the ARC project who agree to take part in stage three (intervention), 160 participants, respectively (proportionally allocated per cancer type stratum) were allocated to each condition. Based upon 0.8 power calculations using a significance level of 0.01 to adjust for multiple comparisons, a sample size of 80 per condition is sufficient to allow forthe detection of moderate clinical differences. Strata differentiated by cancer type, including both reporductive and non-reproductive cancers.
Univariate analyses were conducted to compare participants in the two intervention conditions for each of the socio-demographic variables of interest. For continuous variables, one-way ANOVA were conducted with intervention, gender used as the grouping variable, and the chi square test for independence used for frequency data. Descriptive frequency analyses were used to examine baseline/follow-up retention rates across intervention conditions. Descriptive analyses examined program evaluation measures. To allow for dichotomous analysis and facilitate interpretation,
ratings of program usefulness were recoded into not useful and useful(a little &gt; extremely), reflecting the direction and meaning of the original Likert scales. The Fishers Exact Test (FET) was performed upon the categorical data associated with the perceived usefulness of the booklet in managing fertility  changes across the SH and HP intervention conditions. In these analyses, the FET calculates the exact probability of significant differences in the reported assignments of participants in the two intervention conditions. Independent sample t-tests were performed on outcome variables to assess baseline differences between the SH and HP intervention conditions. A series of separate mixed repeated measures ANOVA were conducted on scores on each outcome variable across the three time conditions, pre-test, post-test and followup as the within-subjects variables, with intervention condition (SH or
HP), gender (men or women) and cancer type (reproductive or non-reproductive) as the between-subjects factors. An
alpha level of .05 was used for all statistical tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fertility is a key aspect of quality of life detrimentally affected by cancer, resulting in significant reductions in well-being for people with cancer and their partners.  However, health professionals rarely address this important health problem. This study will examine the experience and construction of fertility post-cancer, from the perspective of people with cancer, their partners, and health professionals, and elucidate pathways to difficulty or re-negotiation.  Based on these findings, interventions will be developed, and evaluated in a randomised controlled trial.
