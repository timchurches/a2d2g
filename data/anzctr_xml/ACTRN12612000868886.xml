  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients were randomized to 2 groups according to applied treatment protocol
Group 1: Crystallized phenol will be applied into pilonidal sinus tract. The amount of the crystallized phenol  will differ according to the patients sinus tract. the patient will be followed for three weeks for wound healing. Closure of the sinus tract in three weeks will be accepted as cure. In case of failure in the healing of sinus tract in three weeks, the crystallized phenol application will be performed respectively.
Group 2: Surgical technique either primary closure or marsupialization will be performed. primary closure for patients who does not have infection on the surgical site and marsupialization for patients who had acute infection on surgical site were the reason for surgery technique . For both techniques the duration of surgery were estimated as 1 hour. The patients follow up will continue until the full wound healing occurs.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pilonidal sinus disease is an acquired disease at the sacrococcygeal region that can be treated by a number of surgical techniques. Crystallized phenol application seems to be an alternative therapy for pilonidal sinus disease with higher success rates, lower costs, faster recovery and earlier return to work. The aim of this presentation is to compare the crystallized phenol application and surgery for pilonidal sinus disease .</summary>
