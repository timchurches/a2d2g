  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Increasing physical activity (PA) is a major health priority in Australia and internationally due to the associated health burden. It is widely believed that access to electronic games decreases PA in children. Whilst there is considerable research on the impact of TV viewing on PA and obesity, there is little research specific to electronic games. The available evidence suggests electronic games and TV have different associations with PA. Playing electronic games is an important discretionary leisure activity for the majority of Australian children, yet the impact of this on PA has not been tested experimentally. Further, the influence of different game technologies and child characteristics on the impact is not known. Finally, whilst it is assumed playing electronic games displaces more vigorous activities, this has not been demonstrated. 
Aims
This project will assess the impact of electronic game use on PA in children by:
1)	comparing PA and energy expenditure in a home-based RCT where children have either no electronic games or access to traditional electronic games. We hypothesise that PA and energy expenditure will be reduced when children have access to traditional electronic games. 
2)	comparing PA and energy expenditure in a home-based RCT where children have access to either traditional electronic games or new active electronic games. We hypothesise that PA and energy expenditure will be greater with new active electronic games, but still less than no games.
3)	examining responses of different children to explore whether the impact of access to electronic games is greater in some children. We hypothesise a stronger effect on children with poor coordination skills, greater adiposity, poor social confidence, more positive attitudes to technology and less positive attitudes to PA. 
4) examining displacement of sedentary and active leisure activities by electronic games. We hypothesise that all electronic games will displace active non-electronic leisure activities.</summary>
