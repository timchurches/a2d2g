  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Trancranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a non-drug and non-invasive treatment for
      depression and has been investigated for the treatment of psychiatric illness for over 15
      years. There is now established evidence indicating TMS is an effective treatment for
      depression. However, the effectiveness of TMS varies between people, thus requiring further
      research to investigate its optimal application. Investigators want to compare the
      effectiveness of different forms of TMS, given with differing stimulation settings to the
      right or left side of the brain that has been associated with depression. This could
      potentially help clinicians in the future to improve the prescription of TMS as a treatment
      for depression.</summary>
