  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard chemotherapy or investigational agents used to treat patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is an aggressive cancer arising from the mesothelium of the pleural cavity, that is typically caused by previous inhalation of asbestos fibres.
Typical standard chemotherapy may include a combination of a platinum compound with pemetrexed or gemcitabine. Other chemotherapy agents that could be used include single agent vinorelbine and gemcitabine. 
Patients who are enrolled in other clinical trials using an investigational agent may be eligible for this observational study also.
Duration of observation is from commencement of chemotherapy to death.</interventions>

      <timepoint>Time of disease progression with chemotherapy as assessed by symptoms and/or imaging modality such as CT scans on routine clinical follow up as per the treating physician. This may typically involve restaging CT scan every 2 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy while on treatment followed by restaging scan every 2-3 months after completion of chemotherapy. This is at the discretion of the treating physician.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will investigate how to improve identification of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma who will derive benefit from treatment with chemotherapy and/or investigational agents, and also identify any potential factors that may predict overall outcome of the patients including survival (prognostic factors) so that individualised therapy is possible for patients with malignant pleural mesotheliom.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have a pathological diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma, and about to commence on chemotherapy of choice by the treating physician including first line, second line or experimental regimens.

Trial details:
Participants with malignant pleural mesothelioma in all stages of disease will be recruited.
Participants will be treated with the current chemotherapy of choice by the treating physician, including first line, second line or experimental regimens. There is no study specific intervention.
participants will be consented for collection of their tumour tissue, blood samples and answering some questionnaires at baseline and subsequent follow ups.</summary>
