  <interventions>
    <interventions>Theta burst stimulation (TBS), motor training

TBS is a safe, painless form of patterned repetitive non-invasive brain stimulation. It consists of bursts containing 3 biphasic pulses at 50Hz repeated every 200ms, given intermittently (iTBS) or continuously (cTBS). ITBS (600 stimuli) is applied for 2 seconds on and 8 seconds off, for a total of 192 seconds.  CTBS (600 stimuli) is applied continuously for 40 seconds.



TBS is delivered to the scalp overlying the primary motor cortex, applied by an experienced researcher blinded to data collection.

TBS intensity will be 90% of active motor threshold. TBS will take up to 192 secs to deliver.  Either iTBS, cTBS or shamTBS will be delivered in a randomised order over three experimental sessions held at least 1 week apart (wash-out period).

5 minutes after TBS (in each of the thrree experimental sessions) the patient will complete 16 minutes of motor training.  Motor training consists of four, 4 min blocks.  Patients will be required to move pegs in and out of a pegboard.  The number of pegs moved will be counted. 

There is only one treatment arm, all participants will receive TBS and motor training in each experimental session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham TBS, motor training.


ShamTBS will be applied to either primary motor cortex using a sham coil. The sham coil is identical in appearance to the coil used for actual stimulation.  It will be given to mimic either cTBS (over contralesional M1) or iTBS (over ipsilesional M1). The type of shamTBS (shamiTBS or shamcTBS) will be determined randomly for each patient.  They will only recieve one form of shamTBS. 

The sham coil makes the same audible clicks as real TBS and provides a slight cutaneous sensation, but delivers no stimulation.  ShamiTBS will take 192 seconds to deliver and ShamcTBS will take 600 seconds to deliver.

ShamTBS is delivered in one of the three experimental sessions and followed 5 minutes later by motor training (as described previously).</comparator>

      <outcome>Sensorimotor integration with % short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI).


SAI is assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation.  Peripheral nerve stimulation will be delivered via a digitial electrode to the index finger of the contralateral hand.  The stimulation intensity will be 2 - 3 times perceptual threshold. TMS will be delivered following peripheral stimulation, at an interstimulus interval determined for each individual (25,30 or 40ms). 

The pairing of these stimuli results in inhibition of the motor evoked potential (MEP).  The MEP is recorded using electromyography. The magnitude of inhibition after TBS and training will be compared to the inhibition recorded at baseline.</outcome>

      <outcome>Corticomotor excitability with transcranial magentic stimulation (TMS).


TMS will be delivered over  ipsilesional and contralesional M1.  Motor evoked potentials will be recorded using electromyography, with electrodes over the first doral interosseous bilaterally. Corticomotor excitability of ipsilesional and contralesional M1 will be determined by averaging contralateral MEP area over 16 stimuli to the affected (cMEPipsi) and non-affected (cMEPcontra) hands.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Advances in acute medical care have increased survivorship after stroke, but frequently patients are left with disability, commonly including deficits of the motor system. Despite neurorehabilitation, most patients have ongoing impairment six months after stroke, which limits activity and restricts participation in life roles. Upper-limb weakness, in particular, is a major limiting factor in recovery of function. It is important to explore new ways to help improve upper limb recovery following stroke.  

Theta burst stimulation (TBS) of the primary motor cortex can be used to increase or decrease the excitability of the brain (where excitability refers to the responsiveness of neurons in the brain). We have previously shown that priming the brain with TBS, before practising a grip lift task with the affected hand, can improve grip function. We hypothese that TBS allows the primary motor cortex in the stroke affected hemisphere to be more receptive to inputs from the sensory cortex and this in turn allows strengthening and formation of new neural connections during subsequent precision grip training.  We expect that this mechanism explains the observed improvements in performance of the affected hand.

This project therefore aims to extend our previous findings by investigating these hypotheses.  This will provide important knowledge regarding the mechanisms that give rise to behavioural improvements following primed motor training.</summary>
