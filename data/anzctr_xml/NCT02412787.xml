    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Idursulfase-IT

Experimental: Idursulfase-IT - All patients in this study will be treated with intrathecal idursulfase-IT in conjunction with Elaprase therapy. Patients who complete Visit Week 52 assessments of Study HGT HIT 094 and who meet the eligibility criteria and for whom informed consent is provided will be enrolled in this extension study. All patients will receive idursulfase-IT at the same dose and frequency (10 mg once every 28 days) as selected for the HGT-HIT-094 study. Patients who are younger than 3 years of age will continue to receive an adjusted dose.


Treatment: drugs: Idursulfase-IT
Patients will receive idursulfase-IT treatment once every 28 days at a dose of 10 mg. Idursulfase will be administered intrathecally (IT) by an indwelling intrathecal drug delivery device (IDDD).

          5. The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to anesthesia or is thought to

                  S Access Port, as judged by the Investigator

               3. The patient's drug therapy requires substances known to be incompatible with the
                  materials of construction

               4. The patient has a known or suspected local or general infection

               5. The patient is at risk of abnormal bleeding due to a medical condition or therapy

               6. The patient has one or more spinal abnormalities that could complicate safe
                  implantation or fixation

               7. The patient has a functioning CSF shunt device

               8. The patient has shown an intolerance to an implanted device</exclusivecriteria>
