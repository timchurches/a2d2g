  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each subject was assessed in 5 different sessions and all the sessions were separated by at least 48 hours. In the first session subjects were familiarized with the testing procedures and interventions. In the remaining 4 sessions, 4 interventions were applied in random order (one intervention per session). The 4 interventions were: WBV alone (WBV), ES alone (ES), WBV and ES simultaneous (WBV+ES), and 30s of WBV followed by 30s of ES (WBV30/ES30). In these sessions, 10 sets of 1 min of intervention and 1 min of rest were carried out with subjects seated on their own wheelchair with feet placed on the vibration platform. 

The frequency of vibration was set at 10 Hz and the amplitude at 5 mm (peak to peak). 
When ES was used, a rectangular, biphasic and symmetric wave with a pulse width of 400 microseconds and 8 Hz was applied. Three, 2-mm-thick, self-adhesive electrodes were used on each leg: one electrode (10x5 cm) was placed about 2 cm below the popliteal fold, and 2 electrodes (5x5 cm) were placed as close as possible to the motor points of the gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis. Current intensity was increased until the subjects motor threshold (mean achieved intensity: 46.6 +/-12.3 mA). 

Finally, interventions were applied by a qualified profesional in sport sciences.

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Arterial Mean Blood Velocity

The popliteal artery was imaged in a longitudinal section with an ultrasound system (MyLab 25, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) using a pulsed color Doppler with a linear array transducer (LA 523, 7.5-12 MHz; length, 50 mm; Esaote, Genua, Italy) on the right popliteal fossa. The probe was positioned to maintain an insonation angle of 60 degrees. Each ultrasound image was recorded for a period of 4 s. In that period, there were between 3 and 5 beats, and the mean of these beats was analyzed (MyLab Desk 8.0, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) to obtain mean (MBV) and peak (PBV) systolic blood velocities </outcome>

      <outcome>Superficial Temperature 

Before the blood flow parameters were collected, the surface temperature (ST) of the left gastrocnemius was measured using an infrared thermometer (PCE-777, PCE Instruments, Southampton, United Kingdom). In order to have a reliable measure of this variable, a mark with ink was made between the two gastrocnemius heads</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The normality of the dependent variables was checked and subsequently confirmed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) in treatment and time was applied. When a significant F-value was achieved, pairwise comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni post hoc procedure. Effect size statistic was calculated to determine the magnitude of the effect independently of the sample size. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the aim of this study was to analyze the acute effects of isolated, consecutive, and simultaneous application of WBV and ES on the popliteal arterial blood velocity and ST of the calf in SCI subjects. Our hypothesis is that WBV+ES would elicit greater blood velocities and ST responses than the isolated or consecutive interventions in SCI patients. </summary>
