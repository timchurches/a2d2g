  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of methylnaltrexone administered as
      subcutaneous injections in subjects who have opioid-induced constipation and an advanced
      illness. The hypothesis is that methylnaltrexone will be safe and effective in relieving
      opioid-induced constipation in these subjects.</summary>
