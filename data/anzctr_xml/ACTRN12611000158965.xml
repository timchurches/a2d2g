    <concealment>After the second baseline BPDSI assessment, patients will be randomized over three conditions: Schema Therapy (individual focus: weekly individual and group sessions) or schema therapy with a group focus in which the partcipants receive group treatment twice a week(GST) in blocks of by the central research assistant (at the main Netherlands site) using a computerized randomization program. The order in which the formats of GST will be delivered is randomized over sites, so that order of group format type is balanced over sites, controlling for therapist learning and time effects. 

 It will be explained to patients why the main assessor needs to be blind and they will be asked not to talk about the type of treatment they receive. After each assessment, blindness will be assessed by asking the assessor to guess the patientâ€™s condition. The assessment of healthcare costs is done by a second unblinded assessor due to the information needed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In the last five years, a treatment specifically developed for borderline personality disorder namely Schema Therapy has been found to be more effective than existing usual treatments and a specialized form of psychodynamic therapy. When compared to other specialized treatments, Schema Therapy has very low drop-out rate and is very effective, not only in reducing symptoms, but in improving quality of life. Schema Therapy can lead to full recovery from BPD and normal functioning.  However, this schema therapy is yet to be tested outside of the centres that developed the programme.  

A large scale international study to investigate the efficacy of the treatment programme across six countries in several different languages is planned for 2011.  The research will compare two different delivery modes of Schema Therapy with existing treatments to see if there is some benefit of this new therapy.  The study will enable us to determine not only if the therapy is beneficial in other parts of the world, but by including an Australian site, we can make specific recommendations in an Australian context.</summary>
