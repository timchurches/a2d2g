  <interventions>
    <interventions>D-Cycloserine and Exposure Therapy versus Pill Placebo and Exposure Therapy. Participants are given 9 weekly 90 minute sessions (once per week) of individual cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT; involving psychoeducation, relaxation training, cognitive therapy and exposure therapy). Five sessions involve intensive 90 minute exposure therapy (sessions 4 through 8; involving assisting participants to systematically adn gradually face theirs fears whilst resisting any ritualising). One group of participants receives D-Cycloserine (either 25mg or 50 mg depending on weight) before each of the 5 exposure therapy sessions. Each dose is given orally in capsule form 1 hour before each of exposure therapy sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Pill placebo (sugar pill) plus CBT (therapy is exactly the same as that provided in the D-Cycloserine condition).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research aims to provide preliminary data on a randomised controlled treatment trial for treatment refractory childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)  that is, children and adolescents with OCD who continue to suffer disability even after first-line evidence-based treatment. Treatment evaluated in this study will be 5 (+3) sessions augmented behaviour therapy, specifically intensive exposure and response prevention, with D-Cycloserine  an antibiotic drug traditionally used to treat tuberculosis. D-Cycloserine is a glutamatergic partial N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist, which has recently been shown to facilitate fear extinction in humans and animals and has also demonstrated to improve treatment outcome when combined with exposure therapy in social phobia, acrophobia or fear of heights, and OCD in adult samples. This drug is yet to be investigated in a sample of children and youth with OCD.</summary>
