  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised control trial of patients who have a severe brain injury to determine if
      patients who receive a standardised sensory stimulation program emerge earlier from a
      vegetative state. The experimental group would receive, in addition to their normal
      occuaptional therapy, sensory stimulation which would involve the daily application of
      stimulation to all five senses using the Sensory Modalities Assessment and Rehabilitation
      Technique (SMART).</summary>
