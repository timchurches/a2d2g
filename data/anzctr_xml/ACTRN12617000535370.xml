  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a Phase 1, first in human, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study consisting of a total of 24 healthy subjects: 3 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 subjects assigned to pirenzepine: 2 assigned to placebo in each cohort). 
Each treatment will be administered topically to the lower extremities (right and left calves [i.e., anterior lower leg/shins] and tops of feet) by study staff using gloved hands.
The names of the 2 formulations that will be used are WinF90 (6.5% pirenzepine) and WinFB34 (4.0% pirenzepine).
Cohort 1 will be administered 6.5% pirenzepine topical solution WinF90 or matching placebo  5 mL applied once daily for 14 days.
Cohort 2 will be administered 4.0% pirenzepine topical solution WinFB34 or matching placebo  5 mL applied once daily for 14 days. 
Cohort 3 will be administered 4.0% pirenzepine topical solution WinFB34/matching placebo or 6.5% pirenzepine topical solution WinF90/matching placebo  administered for 14 days with dose volume and dose frequency to be determined following review of Cohort 1 and 2 data.
</interventions>
    <comparator>WinF90 and WinFB34 will have matching placebo's containing the same formulations as the active Pirenzepine compositions minus the active ingredient pirenzepine dihydrochloride.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 different pirenzepine formulations after daily topical dose administrations in healthy subjects for 14 days.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by ECG and vital sign monitoring, adverse event recording, local skin irritation assessments and Subject assessment of post-dose discomfort at the test site using a Visual Analog Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Vital signs will be measured on Day -1, Day 1 (pre-dose and 1, 4, and 8 hours post-dose); pre-dose on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12; Day 14 (pre-dose and 1, 4 and 8 hours post-dose); Day 15 and Day 16.
ECG will be performed on Day -1, Day 1 (pre-dose and 1, 4, and 8 hours post-dose); Day 2 (pre-dose); 1, 4 and 8 hours post-dose on Day 7, and Day 14 (pre-dose and 1, 4 and 8 hours post-dose; Day 15 and Day 16.
Blood samples will be collected on Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14. Subjects will be required to fast for at least 8 hours prior to collection.
Urine samples will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1, Day 7 and Day 14.
Skin irritation (including redness, swelling, itching, pain) at the IP application site will be assessed using a Dermal Rating Scale following IP administration by study center staff on Day -1 through Day 16 at pre-dose; and 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose (+/-30 mins).
Subject Assessment of discomfort via Visual Analog Scale on Day -1 through Day16 at pre-dose; and 1 hour and 4 hours post-dose (+/-30 mins).

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second primary endpoint for the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an alternative dosing regimen in healthy subjects with 1 of the pirenzepine topical formulations.

    <sequence>A computer generated randomization schedule will be prepared by an unblinded statistician prior to the start of the study. IP will be prepared in accordance with the randomization schedule.
After signing the informed consent form (ICF), each subject will be given a Screening Number according to the screening order. During the Treatment Period, subjects will be randomized to receive pirenzepine or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 respectively. Subjects will be randomized on Day -1. At the time of randomization, the subject will be assigned a unique Randomization Number, which will be allocated in ascending order from the list of random numbers based on the predetermined randomization schedule, and according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. Confirmation of the Randomization Number allocated will be documented in the drug accountability records and recorded in the eCRF</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize plasma pirenzepine and its desmethyl metabolite concentrations and resultant PK parameters across study subjects and treatments.

Relative bioavailability will be calculated using AUC and Cmax parameters e.g. AUC test/AUC reference or Cmax test/Cmax reference. The similarity of the AUC and Cmax values will be tested statistically, using the analysis of variance method (ANOVA). Further details will be provided in the SAP.</statisticalmethods>
