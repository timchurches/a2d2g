    <interventions>Both intervention and control groups will be healthy, screened with a health questionnaire, examination and blood tests from Visit 1. They will be randomised into the experimental group, called "IV fat emulsion" group or the control group, the "no IV fat emulsion" group. Both groups will be allowed to continue their usual diet prior to scanning--a diet questionnaire will be taken on arrival for Visit 2. Oral glucose (15g) will be administered to both groups. In the experimental group, it will be administered 15 minutes prior to IV intralipid administration (also 45 minutes prior to FDG administration). In the control group, it will be administered 45 minutes prior to FDG administration. The whole process will last 2-3 hours, involving the insertion of a cannula, the administration of the drug, the radionuclide and then the scan.

The intervention group of 5 subjects randomised to the IV fat emulsion  will receive IV fat emulsion 30 minutes prior to scanning. Intralipid is intravenous fat emulsion, comprising soya oil, egg lecithin and glycerol. The Intralipid group will receive the protocol used for local anaesthetic toxicity: Intralipid 20% 1.5mL/kg bolus dose followed by 30 minutes of 0.25mL/kg/min. Both groups will be imaged as per usual 18F-FDG cardiac PET protocol on Visit 2.

After IV injection of 18F-FDG, subjects will be kept in a quiet room for 45-60 minutes. Plasma glucose measurements before injection will be taken in all volunteers. The acquisition will be limited to a single bed step encompassing the heart. Subjects will be instructed to breathe normally during image acquisition and will be iteratively reconstructed using attenuation correction. 

There will be a washout period of at least 2 days before the intervention group receives the control group treatment ("no IV fat emulsion"). In brief, this will entail the same oral glucose load 45 minutes prior to administration of 18F-FDG and subsequent scanning with FDG cardiac PET as per usual protocol.

There is a total of 2 scans administered to all participants, with the first on Visit 2 and the second on Visit 3.</interventions>

      <outcome>To assess for any immediate medical adverse effects post-preparation with IV fat emulsion in PET scans.

The known risks related to IV fat emulsion are low. Most side effects are not serious, such as raised body temperature, shivering, chills, nausea and vomiting (less than 3%). Occasionally, serious medical complications develop including severe allergic reaction or blood disorders can develop (1 per 1,000,000).

After the procedure, the participant will be monitored for 30 minutes for complications such as any persisting symptoms of shivering, chills, abdominal pain, bleeding, anaphylaxis. This will be performed by asking the patient and performing vital signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and capillary oxygen saturation and temperature. If the patient has any concerns after this, they will be referred to their General Practitioner or will be able to contact Principal Investigator Doctor Michael Li in hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Visit 2 or Visit 3 (Day 0 or Day 7) - depending on when fat emulsion is received.
0 minutes - IV fat emulsion administration
30 minutes - FDG administration
90 minutes - PET scan and images are taken
120 minutes - history from participant of adverse events and vital signs taken
After 120 minutes - contact Principal Investigator for any events</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project aims to help improve detection methods for heart disease. The purpose of this research project is to investigate whether it is possible to prepare patients faster and whether it is possible to improve imaging of the heart for cardiac PET imaging. Usual practice is to have patients on a high fat, low carbohydrate diet from the evening beforehand and then to have them fasting for 4-6 hours immediately prior to the scan.

The new method is called intravenous fat emulsion (trade name Intralipid), which should be able to be administered rapidly. This will be tested to see if it is an effective preparation for positron emission tomography using a sugar-based radionuclide as an alternative method of preparation.</summary>
