  <interventions>
    <interventions>Triage clinics were carried out in each of the eight professional Australian symphony orchestras on a fortnightly basis over a 16 week period.  The clinics were designed to allow immediate access to an experienced physiotherapist for advice in relation to performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). Clinics were set up for an hour during a designated lunch break between rehearsal calls to facilitate availability. Participants could sign-up to the clinic via an anonymous booking system or attend on the day if there were available appointments. Due to time constraints physiotherapists were advised to keep appointments at an average of 15 minutes.

All triage clinics were conducted by experienced physiotherapists with post-graduate qualifications in sports, musculoskeletal or occupational physiotherapy.  Physiotherapists were instructed to assess the participants condition and then provide a provisional diagnosis.  The participants would then receive one or a combination of: a) education and advice relating to their provisional diagnosis, b) basic acute management and/or c) a referral to a suitable medical practitioner or allied health professional for further consultation or treatment. Each participant completed a three-month follow-up questionnaire to review their response to the advice given, and whether this resulted in changes to the presenting PRMD.</interventions>

      <outcome>Preventability of these performance-related musculoskeletal disorders seen at the on-site physiotherapy triage service as per the opinion of the experienced physiotherapists.  This opinion is guided by the following definition: Unpreventable injuries are high-velocity, high-energy collision that coincides with a vulnerable joint poisition and cannot be avoided with appropriate conditioning.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The term triage is used to refer to health services that  provide a preliminary assessment of patients reporting an injury to then determine an appropriate course of management.  This approach has been shown to be successful in many other elite performance domains within the athletic and dance populations.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of on-site physiotherapy triage clinics in a national cohort of professional orchestral musicians. Outcomes will include recording the numbers of musicians using the service, analysing the consultation information from the physiotherapists, and evaluating the 3 month follow up feedback from the musicians on their perceived helpfulness of this service.</summary>
