    <interventions>Patients allocated to the targeted therapeutic mild hypercapnia protocol will be sedated as per unit gudelines and at the clinical discretion of the treating intensive care doctors to achieve moderate to deep sedation (a target Richmond Agitation Scale Score of 4). Arterial blood gases and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels will be measured at baseline and then used to guide respiratory rate adjustments of minute ventilation to remain within the target PaCO2 range of 50-55 mmHg for 24 hours following randomisation.. Arterial blood gases will be repeated every 4 hours for 24 hours following randomisation or if end-tidal carbon dioxide values change &gt;5 mmHg. Adjustments to be made to the minute ventilation in order to stay within the target PaCO2 range will be made at the clinical discretion of the treating intensive care doctors. Strategies to monitor adherence to the target PaCO2 range will be via respiratory rate monitoring that displays a continuous record of PaCo2 values and as recorded on the participant's physiological observation chart while in the intensive care unit.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients allocated to the standard care (targeted normocapnia) protocol will be sedated to achieve moderate to deep sedation (a target Richmond Agitation Scale Score of  4). Arterial blood gases and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels will be measured at baseline and then used to guide respiratory rate adjustments of minute ventilation to remain within the target PaCO2 range of 35-45 mmHg for 24 hours following randomisation.. Arterial blood gases will be repeated every 4 hours for 24 hours following randomisation or if end-tidal carbon dioxide values change &gt;5 mmHg. </comparator>

Baseline and outcome variables will be compared using Chi-square tests for equal proportion, Students t-test for normally distributed outcomes and the Mann-Whitney test for any non-parametric data. Multivariate models adjusting for any baseline imbalances and known covariates will be performed using logistic regression. A p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The TAME Cardiac Arrest trial will study the ability of higher carbon dioxide (CO2) levels to reduce brain damage, comparing giving patients normal to slightly higher than normal blood CO2 levels and assessing their ability to return to normal life-tasks. It will be the largest trial ever conducted in heart attack patients in the ICU. This therapy is cost free and, if shown to be effective, will improve thousands of Australian lives, transform clinical practice, and yield major savings.</summary>
