  <interventions>
    <interventions>For this group of patients for whom surgery is palliative, the two different treatment intervention arms are as follows:
a) the standard practice of initially undergoing surgery to remove the primary cancer followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, or b) treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy alone, reserving surgery until such a time as disease progression results in bowel complications, and surgery to remove the primary tumour must be performed.
In the first group, surgery to remove the tumour will be performed by open laparotomy and resection, or by laparoscopic (keyhole) resection as per the surgeon's standard practice. Chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy to follow involves a full course of systemic chemotherapy where systemic therapy comprises optimal treatment as judged by the treating oncologist/radiation oncologist. Treatment may include experimental agents and patients may participate in other chemotherapy clinical trials.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator or control treatment in the SUPER study is the systemic chemoradiotherapy group in which  patients receive chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for their colon or rectal cancer, with surgery to remove the primary tumour reserved until such a time as disease progression results in bowel complications, and therapeutic intervention, such as surgery or endoscopic stenting relating to the primary tumour, is required.
Chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy involves a full course of systemic chemotherapy where systemic therapy comprises optimal treatment as judged by the treating oncologist/radiation oncologist.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is to determine whether surgical resection of the primary tumour in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer decreases intestinal complications and improves overall survival and quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients' clinical status and cancer history and baseline quality of life assessment will be completed within 4 weeks prior to randomisation. 
Morbidity/mortality data will be collected for patients randomised to surgical intervention, including endoscopy as well as any patients who require emergent surgical intervention at any timepoint.  
A review of patients monthly for six months then every 3 months until death, either at a corresponding visit to the treating surgeon/oncologist or phone call by the study co-coordinator, will be done to determine if intestinal complications have occurred. 
At 1,2,3,4,5,and 6 months, quality of life questionnaires repeated.
Overall survival will be measured from the date of randomisation to date of death from any cause.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>On confirmation of eligibility, patients will be recruited through the hospital, clinic or surgeons' rooms at each site.  Sites will fax randomisation data to the central coordinating body, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Clinical Trials Centre (CTC).  Only authorised staff at the NHMRC CTC are eligible to access the randomisation system.  Upon verification of site accreditation, patient eligibility, that documentation is correct and complete, a check is performed to ensure that patient duplication will not occur, before allocation to either treatment arm is performed.  This allocation is by an electronic randomisation system which generates patient study ID and treatment arm. Patients will be randomised to surgical or no surgical intervention to remove their primary colon or rectal cancer.  Confirmation of randomisation, patient ID and treatment arm is faxed by the NHMRC CTC to the study investigator or nominated colleague at the study site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of surgically removing the primary tumour in patients with colorectal cancer where the cancer has already spread to distant sites. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you have cancer of the colon or rectum (bowel) which has spread to further sites in the body. 

Trial participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will follow the standard practice of having surgery to remove the primary cancer, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The other group will receive treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy alone, reserving surgery until such a time as the disease causes bowel complications, and surgery must be performed to remove the primary tumour. 

Patients will be assessed before and after receiving treatment and thereafter at 3 monthly intervals until death. Quality of life questionnaires will be repeated at 1, 2, 3, 4,5 and 6 months. Studies suggest that only a minority of patients (approximately 20%) develop serious intestinal complications from the primary tumour, and that it may not be worthwhile subjecting all patients to major surgery at the outset. This study aims to find out optimal management by comparing the two treatments and their impact on overall survival and quality of life.
The  SUPER study hypothesises that patients with Stage IV colon or rectal cancers receive optimal palliative treatment 
through the combined use of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and do not need to undergo elective resection of the primary tumour.
The SUPER study will compare two strategies in the treatment of non-curable,  colon or rectal cancer cancer to determine whether the standard practice of initially undergoing surgery to remove the primary cancer followed by chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy offers best management, or whether chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy alone should be offered, reserving surgery until such a time as disease progression results in bowel complications, and surgery to remove the primary tumour must be performed.</summary>
