    <sequence>A person independent of the study (a doctoral student with no contact at all with study participants) will do the randomization and allocation of treatment, using a randomization table created by computer software. They will then put this information into a sealed envelope so that it cannot be influenced. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analyzed using mixed model MANOVA to test for differences between control and experimental conditions in levels of self-compassion.Second, to investigate whether self-compassion predicts levels of depression, distress and adherence behaviors and HbA1c,  general linear model analyses will be conducted.

Fifty participants will recruited. While, to our knowledge, there has been no research involving the mindful self compassion programme in diabetes patients, a previous study by Neff and Germer (2013), in a physically healthy population, reported results of a randomized controlled study, reporting a large effect size of MSC group participation (N= 27 for treatment group, N = 25 for waitlist control), with significant large improvements in depression (d = .86,) and self-compassion (d = 1.67), and medium effects in anxiety (d = .76), stress (d = .37), and overall life satisfaction (d = .51) in the intervention group,  compared to control.
