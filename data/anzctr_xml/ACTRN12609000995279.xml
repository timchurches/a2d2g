  <interventions>
    <interventions>mobile suction dressing (Vacuum Assisted Closure or VAC device), early mobilisation:  The negative pressure dressing will consist of a mobile VAC system, comprising of a dressing and suction tubing on a piece of foam secured on the graft with gelonet and staples.  The VAC dressing group will be discharged on the same day and will be only mobilising to bathroom, kitchen and their bedroom.  The VAC dressing is kept on for 5 to 7 days and is not disturbed over this period (so it is not reapplied).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Graft success at day 5-7 when dressings removed as measured by a standardised wound photograph: Each wound is to be photographed with a scale ruler in place to aid calculation of wound area then mapped with GIMP image processing software to assess percentage of take (defined as the area that is attached to the underlying tissue and viable).</outcome>

b)systemic infection  septicaemia
2.Immobility   
3.Poor vascular supply to leg: either absent foot pulses OR ankle/brachial blood pressure index &lt; 0.8 OR requires referral to vascular services before grafting
4.Enrolled in another clinical trial.
5.Lack of home support or ability to manage daily activities independently with wound dressing and drain at home.

    <concealment>Eligible patients will be flagged by the surgical doctors of the Hammodat or Martin General Surgery team at the time of outpatient clinic appointment for consideration of surgery for their leg lesion.

Participants will be randomised into two groups by simple random allocation on computer by the researcher not directly involved in the care of the participants in the trial. Allocation will be in an opaque sealed envelope, opened by the booking clerk (independent of the study researchers) at the time of booking the theatre list (to enable appropriate equipment and nursing allocation).</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to perform a prospective, randomised control trial on whether negative pressure suction dressings and early ambulation are comparable to or improve split skin graft take over conventional bolster dressings for lower leg wounds.
The lower leg is a common site for skin grafts, however healing of the skin of the lower leg can be slow leading to graft failure.  Traditionally, a bolster dressing (a padded dressing over the graft) and bed rest for at least five days are recommended.   Negative pressure dressings (of which the Vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) system is commonly used internationally and in New Zealand) have been used to assist complex wound healing and graft take.  The system generates a negative pressure environment which is shown to improve various factors leading to wound healing. However there is a lack of proof for whether such suction dressings improve healing more than the conventional dressings and bed rest techniques for skin grafts. 
Our study is designed to determine if negative pressure suction dressings and early ambulation are comparable to or improve split skin graft take over conventional bolster dressings and bed-rest for lower leg skin graft wounds.</summary>
