  <interventions>
    <interventions>facilitated advance care planning conversations with documentation of any resultant decision-making.  This will involve a semi-structured interview that addresses goals of care and treatment options as well as end-of-life decision making that will be lead by a single trained facilitator.  The conversations will take on average 1 hour and follow-up conversations will occur on an as neded basis depending up[on the needs of the individual patients.  Family members will be involved in these conversations if identified as patients as being important for decison-making.  It is anticipated that for those patients who have family members that live in close proximity, that family participation will be requested by the patient.</interventions>
    <comparator>standard treatment: patient would have to specifically ask to engage in conversations about end-of-life care and this would not be a standardized conversation and would depend upon the physician caring for that patient.</comparator>
