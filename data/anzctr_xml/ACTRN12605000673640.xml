  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: 
This study is an observer-blinded cross-over study that aims to compare the short-term effects of two different forms of humidification of inspired gases for children with tracheostomies. The study compares the use of a Heated Humidifier to the use of a Heat and Moisture Exchanger (HME or Swedish nose) in providing humidification of the gases that children with tracheostomies breathe. The study will take place during the time period that children are admitted to the hospital following performance of a tracheostomy. These children are generally well during this period and are admitted while their parents are being trained in the care of a child with a tracheostomy and it is safe for them to go home. 

Each child will receive each form of humidification for a 20 hour period. There will be a one night interval and then the child will cross-over and receive the alternate form of humidification for a second 20 hour period. Assessment will be at the baseline for each period, after 2 hours of treatment and after 20 hours of treatment. Assessment will include suctioning of airway secretions for bacterial culture, mucus viscoelasticity, levels of inflammatory markers in airway secretions, oxygen saturation, and clinical examination plus any adverse events or failure to tolerate treatment.</summary>
