             year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
             symptoms. Postmenopausal status may be confirmed by serum FSH and oestradiol
             concentrations at screening if deemed necessary by the PI. Surgical sterility will be
             defined as females who have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal
             ligation.

             Society/European Respiratory Society [American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory
             Society, 2004] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a preventable and treatable
             disease characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow
             limitation is usually progressive and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory
             response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette
             smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also produces significant systemic
             consequences.

    <summary>Phase IIa, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, multi-centre study in
      subjects diagnosed with moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The primary
      objective is to evaluate the effects of 12-weeks of treatment with GW856553 7.5 mg twice
      daily (BID) compared with placebo on the percentage of sputum neutrophils at 12 weeks. Twelve
      weeks of treatment with SERETIDE 50/500 BID will be compared with placebo for effect on
      sputum neutrophils as a positive control arm in the study</summary>
