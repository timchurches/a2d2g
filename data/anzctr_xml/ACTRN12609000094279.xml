  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aquatic physiotherapy sessions of specific upper limb exercise therapy, prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist, undertaken in a warm water pool using the hydrostatic properties of the pool.  Sessions of 30 minutes duration twice weekly for the first six weeks post surgery.  Aquatic physiotherapy sessions provided in addition to usual care.  
Usual care physiotherapy determined by treating physiotherapist including active, assisted and resisted exercises and manual therapy techniques aimed at regaining range, strength and function of the upper limb.   Sessions of 20 minutes duration provided up to twice weekly post-operatively, for up to 12 weeks, depending on nature of the surgery.</interventions>
