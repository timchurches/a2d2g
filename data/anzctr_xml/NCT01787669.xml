  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Eyes Previously Treated with bevacizumab:

          1. Diabetic macular oedema affecting the fovea that has persisted despite ongoing,
             monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab over at least 6 months, the last being
             2 to 3 months prior to the screening visit.

          2. There must be an historical OCT available from 1-4 weeks after the last bevacizumab
             injection with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral
             domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to bevacizumab.

          3. At screening, the bevacizumab treated eye must have DMO with retinal thickness &gt; 300
             microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT

             Eyes Previously Treated with dexamethasone:

          4. Diabetic macular oedema affecting the fovea that has persisted despite two
             dexamethasone implants 5 or fewer months apart, the last being 5-8 months prior to the
             screening visit.

          5. There must be an historical OCT available from 8-14 weeks after the last dexamethasone
             implant with retinal thickness &gt; 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral
             domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to the dexamethasone implant.

          6. At screening, the dexamethasone treated eye must have DMO with retinal thickness &gt; 300
             microns in central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT

          7. Age &gt;= 18 years

          8. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus

          9. Best corrected visual acuity of 20-78 letters (approx 6/120 -6/7.5)

         10. Previous macular laser treatment, or the investigator believes laser treatment is
             unlikely to be helpful

         11. Intraocular pressure &lt;22mmHg

         12. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at the
             screening visit and prior to treatment. A woman is considered of childbearing
             potential unless she is postmenopausal and without menses for 12 months or is
             surgically sterilised

    <summary>The specific aim of the study is to test the following hypothesis:

      That switching between treatments from bevacizumab to Ozurdex or vice versa in eyes with
      diabetic macular oedema with no or incomplete response from one therapy is beneficial.</summary>
