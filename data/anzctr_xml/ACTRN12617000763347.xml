    <interventions>The administration involves two times a day topical application of AKP-11 ointments  to participants with atopic dermatitis (AD) for up to 28 days. The 1 g ointment contains 0 mg or 30 mg of active AKP-11 contained in a sachet which will be applied twice daily to an allocated atopic dermatitis area as determined by the investigator. Participants are allocated to receive 0 mg (placebo) or 30 mg of AKP-11. The allocated area will be equal or less than 3% of treatable body surface area. During each application, the entire content of the study ointment will be applied thinly on the allocated atopic dermatitis
area/s (~1.5mg/ cm2). After the study ointment has been applied in a uniform layer, the
area will be thoroughly rubbed for approximately one minute. The application site can be covered with clothes after study ointment application.</interventions>

      <outcome>Safety endpoints: Clinical signs and symptoms (Adverse events (AEs)) and Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs; ). Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Examples of an AE include:
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition: New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study: Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction: Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE). The Investigator and designated study personnel will monitor each participant for AEs during the study. All AEs reported between consent and final follow-up will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). The investigator or designee will ask the participant non-leading questions in an effort to detect adverse events. Examples of this are: How are you feeling? Or
Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual? In addition, participants should be encouraged to spontaneously report any unusual feelings or sensations.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The existing treatments to treat atopic dermatitis have limitations with side effects and long-term use.  The medication called AKP-11, is an experimental topical formulation being investigated for its potential as a treatment for atopic dermatitis. The use of AKP-11 in this study is purely experimental. AKP-11 as ointment was applied to 10 psoriasis and 8 atopic dermatitis participants and no serious side effects were reported. The primary purpose of this study to to further determine a safety, tolerability and efficacy of topical doses of AKP-11 when administered to participants with atopic dermatitis.</summary>
