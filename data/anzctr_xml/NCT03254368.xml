  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - ZGN-1061
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: 0.05 mg ZGN-1061 (A) - 0.05 mg ZGN-1061 subcutaneous injection once every 3 days

Experimental: 0.3 mg ZGN-1061 (B) - 0.3 mg ZGN-1061 subcutaneous injection once every 3 days

Experimental: 0.9 mg ZGN-1061 (C) - 0.9 mg ZGN-1061 subcutaneous injection once every 3 days

Placebo Comparator: Placebo (D) - Placebo subcutaneous injection once every 3 days


Treatment: drugs: ZGN-1061
