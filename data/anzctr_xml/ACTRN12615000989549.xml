  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the experimental group will receive acupressure therapy on Shen Men (HT7) and Yongquan (K11). The acupressure therapy will be delivered thrice weekly for four consecutive weeks during their routine HD/HDF sessions. The therapy time at each acupoint will last for 3 minutes each and the applied intensity will depend on the patients individual tolerance level.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive sham acupressure therapy on a non-specific acupoint-Zhongquan (EX-EU3) and a sham acupoint (S). The sham acupressure therapy will be delivered thrice weekly for four consecutive weeks during their routine HD/HDF sessions. The therapy time at each acupoint will last for 3 minutes each and the applied intensity will depend on the patients individual tolerance level.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the Study is to determine whether the acupressure therapy delivered over 4 weeks during thrice weekly HD/HDF sessions can decrease the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores.  </outcome>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Block randomisation with blocks of eight will be used to allocate patients to treatment. Patients will be allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio. Therefore, within each group of eight, four will be allocated to the intervention and four to the placebo. 

Allocation concealment will be achieved by utilising a sealed opaque envelope and randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent researcher. </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation sequence will be generated by an independent researcher and each random number will be kept in a sealed opaque envelope. </sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Single-blind trial where participants will not be aware whether they are receiving acupressure treatments at 'real' or 'sham' acupoints.  This information will only be known to the therapist delivering therapy who will not disclose this information to the participants or other study investigators or outcome assessors. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>1. STATA (version 14.0) will be used for data entry and analyses. Results will be expressed as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, meanÂ±standard deviation for continuous normally distributed variables, and median with interquartile range for continuous non-normally distributed variables. Repeated measures ANCOVA will be used to examine the differences in the change in PSQI scores between the treatment and control groups. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered to represent a statistically significant result. 

2. The SIESTA study is a pilot study to examine the efficacy and acceptability of acupressure as a therapy in HD/HDF patients in Australia. As such, no formal sample size calculation has been conducted. The study aims to recruit 40 patients to help achieve its objectives. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether acupressure therapy will be able to improve sleep quality in patients receiving haemodialysis (HD) or haemodiafiltration (HDF) for treatment of end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Other outcomes include change in quality of life, adverse reaction at the site of acupressure application and patient acceptability. </summary>
