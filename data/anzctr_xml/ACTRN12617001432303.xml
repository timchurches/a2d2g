    <interventions>Enhancing Neurobehavioural Gains with the Aid of Games and Exercise (ENGAGE). This intervention involved parents and children attending a weekly 1.5hour group session for five weeks; run by a clinical psychologist with specialist training in administering ENGAGE and over 5 year experience in the area of child clinical psychology. , These sessions were followed by two weeks of individual phone calls and then a final group session in the 8th week. While attending the intervention, a group of up to five parents were together in one room where they were taught a new set of games each week, over 5 weeks,  and asked to play them with their children for 30 minutes a day.  The games were provided within a manual given to each parent. All of the games targeted neurocognitive areas known to be associated with self-regulation (see below for a list of all the games along with a brief description).  In an adjacent room, the children were taught the same games so as to familiarize them with the games, engage them in the activities, and make it easier for parents to introduce the games to them at home.  When all of the games had been taught (after the first 5 weeks), parents were encouraged to continue to play the games for the remaining 3 weeks of the intervention, increasing the complexity of the games as their child developed the skills. They then received individual phone calls once a week for two weeks (Session 6 &amp; 7) where they were aided in further individualizing the program to their own child and any issues or questions were addressed by the clinical psychologist who had been facilitating the groups. Following this a final group session was held (session 8. This was in the form of a booster session and focused on maintenance of the program over time.  While the active intervention lasted 8 weeks in total, parents were encouraged to continue to play the games once the intervention sessions had ceased.
Intervention adherence was assessed via daily diaries that parents completed regarding which games they played each day and for how long. 

List of the games included in the ENGAGE programme.

Games targeting Behavioural Self-Regulation:
Musical Statues - Move around while music is playing. Freeze when the music stops

    <comparator>Triple P (Positive Parenting Programme) is an extensively studied, well validated, gold standard behaviour management programme designed to teach parents skills in managing their children's challenging behaviour.
Standard levle 4 group Triple P was used in this study. It is an 8 week programme. For the first 4 weeks (Sessions 1-4) a group of up to 5 parents attended a weekly 1.5 hour session where they were taught 17 core child management strategies. These were divided into 10 strategies used to promote positive development (e.g., talking with children, physical affection, spending quality time together, setting a good example) and 7 strategies for managing misbehaviour (e.g., setting rules, ignoring unwanted behaviours, time-out). They received a manual with information on all of these strategies explained inside. After 4 weeks, parents received 3 weekly phone calls (Sessions 5-7) designed to help parents continue to implement the strategies taught in sessions 1-4. In the eighth week (Session 8) of the programme parents attended a final group session focused on maintenance of the programme. 
The programme was administrated by a clinical psychologist (who was not a member of the research team and blind to our specific research hypotheses), The psychologist had received formal training in Triple P and was an accredited Triple P practitioner. 
Treatment adherence was monitored via daily diaries recording strategies used to manage difficult behavior.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is characterised by dysregulation in activity levels, attentional control, and impulse control. It emerges during preschool, often persisting into adulthood. Several effective short-term treatments exist, however, improvements are rarely maintained when treatment ceases. Current treatments involve external regulation of symptoms through medication or behaviour management. Our novel early intervention programme addresses the neurocognitive deficits associated with ADHD and teaches preschool children to self-regulate. Results from our open-label trial showed significant reductions in ADHD symptoms and improvements in brain functioning within areas involved in self-regulation. Importantly, improvements in self-regulation were associated with maintained ADHD symptom reduction up to 12-months post-treatment. The proposed randomised control trial will provide a critical test of our programme against treatment as usual (Triple P - parent training).
