  <interventions>
    <interventions>Duloxetine will be administered for eight weeks via oral capsules. Participants will receive 30mg duloxetine per day for the first week of the active arm of the trial, uptitrating to 60mg for the following six weeks. Participants will then receive 30mg duloxetine for the final week of the active arm. There will be a two week wash-out period before crossover to the second study arm.

Adherence will be monitored via capsule counts at each study visit. Participants will also be asked whether they have missed any doses during weekly monitoring phone calls. If a participant reports missing doses, strategies for remembering to take the study medication (e.g. taking the study medication with meals, using reminder notes) will be suggested.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were conducted using a = 0.05 (two-tailed), and 80% power, aiming to detect a difference of 2.8 points on the FACT/GOG-NTx, equivalent to an effect size of 0.408. In order to achieve this effect size, and assuming a correlation of 0.6 within patient between periods on  FACT/GOG-NTx scores, a sample size of 40 would have at least 80% power to detect these differences on the primary endpoint. Assuming a drop out rate similar to previous trials of duloxetine in CIPN, sample size will be adjusted by 20%, resulting in a total sample size of 48. Data for the primary endpoint will be compared via paired t-tests within patients. Comparisons between conditions will be undertaken using analysis of covariance with the baseline measure included as a covariate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial aims to assess whether treatment with duloxetine results in a reduction in chronic neuropathic symptoms experienced as a result of neurotoxic chemotherapy treatment.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have had daily symptoms of peripheral neuropathy for at least 3 months after completing chemotherapy. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive the drug duloxetine or placebo (inactive treatment) for 8 weeks. After a two week washout period, participants will switch conditions and receive placebo or study drug for another eight weeks. Those allocated to the study drug arm will be started on duloxetine 30 mg once daily, increasing to 60mg daily for weeks 2-7, and back to 30mg daily for week 8. Participants randomised to the control group will receive a daily placebo capsule to the dosage matching the treatment arm. Placebo tablets will look identical to duloxetine, and participants will not know which treatment they are receiving. All participants in the trial will receive duloxetine for 8 weeks.

All participants will have liver and kidney function tests performed at baseline and at monthly intervals. Clinical examination, nerve conduction and excitability studies, functional assessment (nine-hole peg test) and self-report measures will be undertaken at baseline and after each 8 week treatment period. Patients will be asked to keep a symptom diary, which will be checked at each study visit.</summary>
