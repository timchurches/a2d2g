  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single Gallium -68 citrate PET-CT will be performed in addition to the routine Gallium -67 SPECT-CT study. 
In participants with fever of unknown origin, approximately 98 MBq of Ga-68 citrate will be administered intravenously. After a minimum of 60 minutes following injection, whole body PET-CT imaging will be performed on Siemens PET-CT, image reconstruction will include CT attenuation correction. 
For participants with suspected bone/joint infection approximately 135 MBq of Ga-68 citrate will be administered intravenously. After a minimum of 60 minutes following injection, PET-CT imaging of the region of interest will be performed on Siemens PET-CT, image reconstruction will include CT attenuation correction. 
The Gallium -68 citrate PET-CT and the Gallium -67 SPECT-CT scan will be performed ideally within 48-72 hours of each other. Patients will be followed for up to 3 months to record subsequent treatment regimens: antibiotics, surgery, radiological and clinical responses to therapy and biopsy results when performed.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is the current standard of care, Gallium -67 SPECT-CT.  150 MBq of Ga-67 citrate will be administered intravenously.
48-72 hours after tracer injection whole body or localised planar images will be performed with a 256 x 1024 matrix and at 5 cm/min. SPECT-CT (either 1 or 2 SPECT-CT) of the suspected site of infection clinically or region of abnormal activity on the whole body or localised planar images will be obtained with 48 views of 35 sec on the Siemens Symbia gamma camera (or equivalent) with Medium Energy Collimators. SPECT-CT field of view to be determined by Nuclear Medicine Physician as per normal clinical practice.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare Ga-68 citrate PET-CT with Ga-67 citrate SPECT-CT for diagnosing infection in patients with suspected bone/joint infection or with PUO
This will be assessed based on the analysis of:
 Site(s) of Ga-67 uptake on SPECT-CT,
 Site(s) of Ga-68 uptake on PET-CT.
In case of disagreement between the specialists in Nuclear Medicine and PET-CT analysing the
studies, the final diagnosis will be allocated based on biopsy results, results of additional imaging (CT,
MRI), duration of antibiotic therapy, and relevant correspondence This will be independently reviewed
by an Infectious diseases specialist, who will be blinded to the Ga-68 PET scan results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess image quality and reporter confidence with Ga-68 PET-CT
Image quality scores, reporter confidence scores and inter-reporter agreement for Ga-68 citrate PETCT
will be compared with Ga-67 citrate SPECT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the cost-benefit of routine Ga-68 citrate PET-CT compared to Ga-67 citrate SPECT-CT in
the management of patients with suspected bone/joint infection or PUO.
The following data will be used to perform the cost-benefit analysis:
 Time between request received and completion of imaging (days/hours)
 Time between injection and completion of imaging (hours/minutes)
 Time between completion of Ga-67 citrate imaging and inpatient discharge (days/hours)
 Imaging acquisition time (minutes): total time patient is on camera
 Estimated radiation dose to patient
 Patient comfort score based on the answers to the participant questionnaire
 Referring physician questionnaire - impact of imaging test on discharge planning. This will be
incorporated into the estimation of cost savings if there is a projected reduction in inpatient
days in hospital.
An estimate of financial cost of Ga-68 PET-CT compared to Ga-67 SPECT-CT will be made based on
the length of inpatient stay in hospital, and the cost of the imaging procedure. For Ga-67 SPECT-CT
the actual inpatient stay will be used and for Ga-68 PET-CT an estimate of inpatient stay will be made
based on time between Ga-68 PET-CT request and completion of imaging.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare Gallium-68 citrate PET-CT with Gallium-67 citrate SPECT-CT, the current standard of care, for diagnosis in patients with suspected bone/joint infection or with pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO).
Image quality and reporter confidence with Ga-68 PET-CT will be assessed and the cost-benefit of routine Ga-68 citrate PET-CT compared to Ga-67 SPECT-CT will be evaluated. On completion of the study an informed recommendation for future infection imaging protocols for bone/joint infections and PUO will be made based on clinical efficacy and cost-benefit analysis.</summary>
