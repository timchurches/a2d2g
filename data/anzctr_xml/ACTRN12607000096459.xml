  <interventions>
    <interventions>ANZ 8613 is a phase III study evaluating the subsitution versus addition of endocrine therapy at the point of disease progression in patients with advanced breast cancer.

Eligible patients are randomised to one of two treatment arms:
Arm A: Continue tamoxifen + MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)
Arm B: Stop tamoxifen + begin MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate)

In Arm A, tamoxifen is administered in oral tablet form, at the same dose and schedule the patient is receiving at baseline (ie at the time of progressive disease).
In both Arm A and Arm B, MPA is administered orally in a daily dose of 500 mg, commencing on the day of randomisation.

Patients randomised to Arm B should stop (non-protocol) tamoxifen prior to commencing protocol therapy with MPA.

For both Arms, patients should remain on only the randomised treatment for a minimum of four (4) weeks before any progressive disease is confirmed or new treatment introduced.

All therapies used in this study are standard - the uniqueness of this protocol is in the way these therapies are used.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Sites of disease progression</outcome>
      <timepoint>Categorised as original, current, new or a combination; assessed at 4, 8, 12 weeks and 12 weekly until disease progression, patient withdrawal or death.

      <timepoint>Including thromboembolic event, weight gain, nausea and vomiting, vaginal bleeding and hot flushes are graded from 0-4 (where 0=not present; 4=life threatening); assessed at 4, 8, 12 weeks and 12 weekly until disease progression, patient withdrawal or death.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposal in this protocol is to determine (in patients with advanced breast cancer) whether it is better, at disease progression,  to continue the policy of substituting the original therapy with a replacement; or alternatively to continue the original treatment and add the new therapy to it, since the existing therapy may be controlling some previously active disease sites.</summary>
