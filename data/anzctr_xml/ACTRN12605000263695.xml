  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 3 months of each humidification device. One provides humidification from a heated humidifier set to deliver conditioned air at 37C and 100% relative humidity overnight, with the heat and moisture exchanger used during the day. This will be compared to humidification using a heat and moisture exchanger (Portex Thermovent T) day and night for 3 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>The trial compares two different methods of humidification, heated humidifier compared with a heat and moisture exchanger. Participants will be randomised to receive 3 months of humidification via each of these methods in a cross-over manner. No washout period is provided between treatment methods due to the requirement for humidification in patients with tracheostomy</comparator>
