  <interventions>
    <interventions>An incomplete step-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial, with Supported Playgroups as the unit of randomisation will be conducted with parents of young children 0  4 years of age attending Supported Playgroups. The trial is the third and final phase in the development of a complex intervention. A two month program will be implemented and evaluated at baseline, 10 weeks and follow up at 20 weeks. Results will be compared with control groups of matched Supported Playgroups receiving their usual programs. 
Features of the intervention include:
* Delivery of six (selected from ten) evidence-based nutrition and active play messages. Discussions take no longer than 10 minutes to discuss during usual Supported Playgroups. Two example messages are: play outside every day and eat fruit and vegetables. Six of the ten messages are selected by Facilitators based on the needs of the group, and Facilitator confidence to discuss the message. Local service providers and /or researchers assist SP Facilitators to deliver the messages
* Training program for Supported Playgroup Facilitators to deliver the program. Training is conducted by the research team as one x 6 hour session, or two x 3 hour sessions based on SP facilitator availability and includes case scenarios and mastery to build knowledge and confidence. 
* A culturally competent approach using existing local capacity within Supported Playgroups to enhance usual service delivery. Facilitators will also use existing Supported Playgroup resources to discuss messages with parents. They will consider cultural needs of their groups during delivery of the messages. 
* Parental empowerment; problem solving and active listening. Facilitators will select different times during the playgroup and/or different modes of discussion (whole group, small groups, one-on-one) to deliver the messages based on each group need. 
* Practical focus  shopping, cooking, mealtime behaviour, active play, limit screens. Each message is presented pictorially, supported by 3-4 evidence statements (ie WHY the message is important) and 3  4 practical strategies (HOW families can implement the message) with considerations for developmental stage of the age group. Role modeling during Supported Playgroup will enhance practical applicability. 

Consistent with the socio-ecological model of health encompassing the social determinants of health, the intervention is informed by theories of cultural competence, social learning, health belief and health literacy. This framework builds on existing strengths of parents to increase their confidence and self-efficacy. Cultural consideration is critical because many Supported Playgroups target culturally diverse families. The approach is strengthened by working with existing Supported Playgroup providers and facilitators, which will minimise the major barrier of engaging families with high needs and the other barriers such as low help-seeking behaviour, transport, social stigma, and cultural concerns. 
Researchers monitor fidelity of the each of the core components. They are present during training and delivery of each session by the facilitators. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Using an incomplete step-wedge design, the comparator group comprises Supported Playgroups who will receive the intervention at a later date. The comparator group continue to attend usual Supported Playgroups. This provides opportunities for parents and children to socialise with other families. This may include incidental participation in incidental activities such as talks given by guest speakers during the course of usual Supported Playgroup activities. </comparator>

      <outcome>Child outcomes: 
Composite secondary outcome: 
Changes in child nutrition and active play practices.
Nutrition practice questions will be selected and modified from the most recent national child nutrition survey questionnaire (children 2  8 years), the Eating and Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. Key questions refer to drinks, fruit and vegetable consumption and food security. Selected questions about physical activity, television viewing and risk in play will also be used. Parents will complete this questionnaire. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>It is estimated that a total of 128 participants will be required to detect a difference between the intervention and control arms of 0.5 standard deviations from the mean desirable behaviours relating to early child nutrition and active play, with an 80% power, at a 5% level of significance. This expected effect size of 0.5 standard deviations of the mean scores on quantifiable desirable behaviour change in nutrition and active play is based on existing evidence in similar studies. However, to account for clustering among participants within a supported playgroup the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) measure of 0.02 is used. This is considered a conservative measure in the literature, and commonly used in health behaviour change research. Assuming an average of 10 participants per supported playgroup, there is a Variation Inflation Factor (or Design Effect) of 1.2; and assuming a conservative attrition rate of 40%, it is calculated that 212 participants are required in the total sample size. This attrition rate of 40% is a conservative estimate based on the pilot program results. During the Pilot Program attrition, which was defined as failure to attend more than three sessions over 3 months, was substantially less than 40% (i.e. ~25-30%). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial is the third phase of a complex intervention that by definition, involves large variability in a target population and is a placed-based initiative for highly vulnerable families.  
Our research is informed by a needs assessment (Phase 1) and feasibility study (Phase 2). 
We will assess the impact of child nutrition and active play advice delivered in community-based early childhood settings to vulnerable families. We will train Supported Playgroup facilitators and bicultural workers to will deliver six key messages (chosen from 10) about child health and development issues. Building on established relationships between facilitators, bicultural workers and their families, the program is delivered by facilitators in their existing Supported Playgroups using place-based resources, during one school term. 
We previously found that children attending Supported Playgroups were over-represented among those consuming sweet drinks and packaged foods, and viewing excessive hours of television. Parents reported concerns about the safety of their children during active play and some powerlessness in providing healthy food. Supported Playgroup parents also described greater difficulties accessing, understanding, and using health information than other families in the same locations of social disadvantage.  
Our subsequent feasibility study co-designed by stakeholders demonstrated effective communication about key messages in child nutrition and active play by Supported Playgroup facilitators. More specifically, it resulted in improved knowledge and confidence of SP facilitators and parents, and changes in parenting behaviours. Although key messages in child nutrition and active play have been successfully used in early childhood interventions in Australia, culturally and linguistically diverse and significantly disadvantaged families have not participated. Innovation in effective delivery of child nutrition and active play messages is urgently required for high needs families.

Research questions
Can early childhood settings be used as a platform to convey key child health and developmental messages to parents of young children living with significant social and economic disadvantage? Can Supported Playgroup facilitators effectively communicate key messages about child nutrition and active play? How can the evidence-based knowledge be best disseminated for specific family and playgroup contexts?  What knowledge will families recall away from Supported Playgroups and will it translate into child-health practices and better connections to existing services? To this end, the general hypothesis is that when well-considered and sensitively delivered messages about child nutrition and active play are embedded into Supported Playgroups, parental knowledge will increase and child-health practices will improve. This experience will also increase the social connectedness and ultimately the self-efficacy in parenting of highly disadvantaged parents.

Specific Hypotheses
1.	That increased parental knowledge and self-efficacy about child nutrition and active play will promote improved child health-related behaviours. 
2.	That Supported Playgroups are an effective place-based setting to convey child health and development information to vulnerable families. 

Aim
Our overall research goal is to address health and social inequalities among vulnerable families with young children. 

Specifically this project aims to
1.	Improve child nutrition and active play-related behaviours in vulnerable families.
2.	Advance knowledge about effective strategies for achieving translation of the research findings into policy in early childhood settings.
