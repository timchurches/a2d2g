  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants complete a 10 minute online questionnaire on physical activity levels before pregnancy and current physical activity levels via an iPad Kiosk whilst waiting in the reception area prior to their appointment with their practitioner.

Intervention Group 1:
Tailored advice without practitioner endorsement.
Once participants complete their baseline survey, they will be instructed to collect their print-based personally-tailored physical activity advice (based on participant information collected during baseline survey) from the reception desk at the conclusion of the consultation with their medical practitioner. Their highly personalised tailored physical activity advice will cover the same content as those in the control group received, however the information will be tailored and personalise, as well as additional information on the benefits of physical activity during pregnancy, aerobic and resistance-based exercise recommendations, advice for active living during pregnancy and a number of strategies to help increase physical activity levels. Furthermore, all of this information will be presented in a highly personalised and tailored way in relation to the individuals physical activity behaviours. The physical activity advice will include a summary page at the beginning of the document of personalised and tailored physical activity recommendations and will also encourage participants to visit the Fit4Two website.

Intervention Group 2:
Tailored advice with practitioner endorsement (Obstetrician or Midwife).
Upon completing the baseline assessment, participants in this group will be provided with the same print-based personally-tailored physical activity advice and information as those in intervention group 1. However, their tailored physical activity advice will be instantaneously sent from the iPad to a wireless printer located within the practitioners consultation office, where the practitioner has the opportunity to briefly look over the contents provided prior to the patient coming in. The tailored physical activity advice can then be directly handed to participant by their practitioner. Practitioners will then be asked to go over the advice with the patients and to endorse the contents. Practitioners will also endorse the Fit4Two website and encourage participants in this group to log into the Fit4Two website and actively participate in each of the weekly modules.

The Fit4Two Website:
The Fit4Two website consists of four weekly behaviour change modules, guided by the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), that have previously been identified as successful at increasing physical activity in pregnant women. At the completion of each module, participants are provided with tailored feedback that is based on their responses to the survey questions that participants answer at the beginning of each weekly module. The four additional  Fit4Two website modules include: (1) goal setting and action planning where participants are encouraged to make physical activity plans including when they will exercise, who they might exercise with, where the exercise will take place, and what barrier/s might come up and how they will overcome them; (2) overcoming barriers such as environmental barriers and lack of time; (3) developing social support networks including work colleagues, family and friends; and (4) physical activity reinforcement such as identifying the exercise during pregnancy guidelines, the benefits associated with meeting the guidelines and the participants exercise behaviours. Each of these modules apply behaviour change constructs that have previously been identified as effective to increasing physical activity among pregnant women. In addition to the weekly module, participants will also receive access to a weekly action planning tool, which guides participants in setting detailed SMART goals and an action plan for their physical activity over the coming week.

The tailored advise is developed and generated by the Fit4Two web-based software (based on algorithms and coding), and developed in conjunction with behaviour change and exercise during pregnancy experts.

For the purpose of this study practitioners are referred to as Obstetricians and Midwives.

Data collected at baseline includes activity behaviours (aerobic and resistance-based activity) before pregnancy and current activity behaviours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Generic advice without practitioner endorsement (wait list control group):
Upon completing the baseline assessment, participants will be instructed to collect their non-tailored (generic) physical activity advice from the reception desk at the conclusion of the consultation with their medical practitioner. This physical activity advice, printed on plain A4 paper, will provide standard information on current physical activity guidelines for pregnant women. This minimal intervention can be considered as wait list control and is unlikely to significantly increase the physical activity of the participants. Participants will be provided with full access to the Fit4Two website upon the completion of their 3 month follow-up survey.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility will be assessed by undertaking semi-structured interview with practitioners and support staff.  At baseline, they will be asked about their initial perceptions regarding the intervention. At follow up, they will be asked if they implemented the intervention as intended, and whether or not they believed the intervention was feasible to deliver based on its operational requirements.

      <outcome>Acceptability will be measured by a number of composite outcomes including intervention adherence (by the number of consenting participants successfully completing the tailoring questionnaire on the ipad), website engagement (total no. of visits, clicks and total time spent on website), website usability (SUS - System Usability Scale - validated instrument) and satisfaction items relating to website quality, relevance and usefulness (a modified version of the eHealth Engagement Scale survey instrument, used in previous web-based computer-tailored interventions). </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible, participants will be required to be proficient in English, aged 18-45 years, currently pregnant with a gestation age of 12-32 weeks, and considered healthy (free of any medical or obstetric contraindications) and able to participate in physical activity. To ascertain contraindications, potential participants will be required to complete an online version of the Physical Activity Readiness Medical Examination for Pregnancy (PARMed-X for Pregnancy). If participants answer 'yes' to any of the screening questions, they will be advised that they are unable to participate in the study at this stage, and that they might like to discuss their ineligibility with their practitioner. If approval is sub-sequentially provided by their practitioner to participate, the participant can then register. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>Differences in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) between groups will be determined using a time X group interaction model (zero-inflated negative binomial regression will be used for data that is not of a normal distribution). Chi-square (categorical outcomes) and analyses of variance (continuous outcomes) will be performed to determine between group differences for feasibility, acceptability and usability outcomes. Where there is evidence of a significant difference between groups, post-hoc tests will be conducted to determine which of the three groups are different from each other. All statistical tests will be conducted using SPSS Version 20 (IBM Corp, NY). Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Interviews will be transcribed and analysed by thematic analysis to identify common themes. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inactivity during pregnancy is associated with adverse health and pregnancy related outcomes for the mother and her unborn child. This innovative randomised controlled trial aims to increase physical activity in pregnant women by integrating an already examined eHealth intervention (Fit4Two) into clinical practice. This intervention will provide participants with highly personalised and automated physical activity feedback, endorsed by their practitioner. As such, participants will receive high quality care in a convenient, credible and time efficient manner, whilst placing very little additional burden on practitioners.</summary>
