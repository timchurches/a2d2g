  <interventions>
    <interventions>Measurement of lung function at baseline and at review (spirometry, lung volumes).
Measurement of lung biomarkers at baseline and at review (exhaled nitric oxide, multiple breath nitrogen washout, forced oscillation device, sputum induction).
Dose adjustment of inhaled corticosteroids based on baseline level of asthma control. The frequency of the medication treatment remains the same for each individual patient as it was prior to entry into the study:
If patients are not well-controlled at baseline, then the inhaled corticosteroid dose will be doubled over the 8-week period.
If patients are well-controlled at baseline, the inhaled corticosteroid dose will be halved in the first 4 weeks and quartered over the subsequent 4 weeks. Patients are reviewed at the end of the 8-week period. If patients remain well-controlled after the initial 8-week period, then patients can stop their inhaled corticosteroid and continue to be monitored over another 8-week period.

Patients can return for review if their asthma control worsens at any stage during the study. This is an end-point for the study. In this instance, patients are treated as clinically indicated and will return to the care of their usual treating doctor after the study.</interventions>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the sensitivity and specificity of the following baseline measurements: 
Severity of airway hyperresponsiveness to mannitol, measured by forced oscillation device (FOT) or spirometry;
Ventilation heterogeneity, measured by multiple breath nitrogen washout;
Exhaled nitric oxide; and
Sputum inflammatory cells
to predict:
a) optimization of asthma control following 8 weeks of increased treatment with combination therapy 
b) loss of asthma control over 8 weeks when the dose of combination therapy is reduced</outcome>

      <outcome>The baseline measurements will be repeated at the end of the study period to provide alternative measures of asthma control, to be used in secondary analyses.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the ability of various physiological and inflammatory markers to predict changes in asthma control following changes in the dose of combination therapy. The direction and magnitude of the dose changes are determined for each patient by their baseline level of asthma control. If the baseline variables, either alone or in combination, can predict future benefit or risk from change in treatment then the study will provide new insights into the clinical management of asthma.</summary>
