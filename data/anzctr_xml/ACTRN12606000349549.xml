  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will examine a computerised version of a known effective treatment for anxiety disorders (CBT) in the form of a programme called CLIMATE. Partcipants will be recruited from the waiting list of a publicly funded specialist anxiety disorders unit in Christchurch. An intial assessment will determine suitability and written informed consent sought. Consenting patients will then be will be randomly allocated to either stay on the waiting list or to receives the compuertised treatment. Partcipants will be assessed at pre-treatment, at the end of treatment (3 montsh) and at 6 months.</summary>
