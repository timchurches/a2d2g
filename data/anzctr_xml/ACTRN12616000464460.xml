  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will undergo a single autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) procedure conducted by an orthopaedic surgeon. AMIC is an enhanced version of the original microfracture technique in which a type I/III collagen matrix (Chondro-Gide, Trademark) is placed over the cartilage defect to stabilise the fragile bone marrow cell infiltrate and provide infrastructure for tissue repair and regeneration. AMIC is an effective treatment for chondral lesions of the knee, ankle and hip, and can be performed arthroscopically, reducing total treatment time and minimising morbidity. The procedure takes between 1-2 hours, inclusive of recovery time.

A single CelGro (Trademark) membrane will be used in the AMIC procedure.  CelGro (Trademark) is a type I/III collagen matrix obtained by a standardised, controlled manufacturing process. The collagen is of porcine origin and is carefully purified to remove foreign DNA and other substances that could provoke immunogenic reactions.  CelGro (Trademark) has a bilayer structure with a porous side that allows for the ingrowth of cells.  The scaffold consists of natural collagen without further cross-linking or chemical additives.  CelGro (Trademark) is delivered sterile in a sealed pouch and presents as a white to off-white sheet with both a smooth and slightly rougher surface.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability are measured through;
- Adverse events related to study treatment or procedures
- Additional surgical or significant medical intervention required as a result of treatment failure
-Presence or absence of systemic immune reactions or other systemic adverse event related to the study treatment. 

Adverse events related to the study treatment may include, hip infection and allergic reaction to the scaffold. Persons highly sensitive to porcine material may react to the scaffold.

Adverse events related to arthroscopic hip surgery may include, discomfort and swelling in the groin, thigh, lower back and buttock regions. Rare adverse events related to hip surgery include; infection, temporary numbness in the groin and the standard risks of undergoing general anaesthesia.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Articular cartilage is aneural, avascular and has limited capacity for self-repair.  Articular cartilage defects pre-dispose patients to developing osteoarthritis, and if left un-treated, damage can become so severe that joint replacement is indicated.  Autologous Matrix-Induced Chondrogenesis (AMIC) is an enhanced version of the original microfracture technique, in which a type I/III collagen matrix (Chondro-Gide, Registered Trademark) is placed over the cartilage defect to stabilise the fragile bone marrow cell infiltrate and provide infrastructure for tissue repair and regeneration. 

Currently, the majority of commercially available collagen membranes are manufactured in Europe or the USA from locally-produced source material.  Australian-sourced biological materials are valued due to the historically low rate of zoonotic infectious diseases and absence of transmissible spongiform encephalitis. CelGro (Trademark) is manufactured in Australia, using collagen originating from Australian Government veterinarian-certified animals bred and raised in Western Australia, eliminating disease transmission concerns associated with foreign products.  

This study will use CelGro (Trademark) as the collagen matrix in AMIC treatment for osteochondral defect in the hip. </summary>
