  <interventions>
    <interventions>A laterolateral frontal incision is made  followed by a 4 cm x 4 cm right frontal craniotomy crossing the superior sagittal sinus. The dura is incised and two Lamitrode 44 electrodes (St Jude Medical, Plano, Dallas, TX) are placed interhemispherically, touching the rostral anterior cingulate cortices. This surgery may take ~2 hours.

Electrodes will be activated on Day 3 or Day 17 in a blinded manner. Stimulation patterns will be optimized over 1 week, initially with a 3 Hz burst stimulation with 5 spikes at 500 Hz in cycle mode (5 seconds on, 5 seconds off). The stimulation design can be individually adjusted to further optimize the anticraving effect. This might include burst or spike frequency adjustment, or switching to a noise-like pattern.

Electrodes will remain in place permanently.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol craving may be a major factor in why some patients with severe alcoholism can't stop drinking, or relapse after a period of abstinence. This craving may be caused by abnormally increased activation of a part of the brain (the anterior cingulate cortex). It may be possible to suppress craving and thus help abstinence from alcohol, by using neuromodulation methods. Initially we would identify patients who have reduced craving in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation of this brain area. Patients could then have an electrode implanted that could help maintain long-term abstinence from alcohol, and may also potentially help improve symptoms of depression and anxiety.</summary>
