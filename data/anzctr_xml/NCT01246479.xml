    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Blood draw
Other interventions - IC51 has given in the parent study IC51-322

Other: No treatment - subjects will be followed up on immunity (analysis of blood samples) and safety


Treatment: surgery: Blood draw
blood draw at Month 12, Month 24 and Month 36.

Other interventions: IC51 has given in the parent study IC51-322
No more vaccinations in IC51-324 since this a study for long-term follow-up on safety and immunogenicity after vaccinations in parent study IC51-322.
