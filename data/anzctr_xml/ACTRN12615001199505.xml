  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single arm prospective community intervention trial.

Participants will be invited to take part in a joint MDA program for trachoma and scabies, with the first trachoma MDA dose at the same time as the first of two scabies MDA doses.
All participants are offered the same treatment regardless of the presence or absence of clinical signs of trachoma or scabies at the time of the intervention.

Trachoma MDA: Participants will be offered 1 oral dose of azithromycin (directly observed) at 20 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 1 gm. Pregnant women will be offered a choice of azithromycin or 1% topical tetracycline  (twice daily application to the eye for 3 weeks). Individuals aged less than 6 months will be offered topical tetracycline at the same dose as pregnant women.

Scabies MDA: Participants will be offered 2 doses of oral ivermectin (directly observed) at 200 micrograms/kg 7 days apart. Participants for whom ivermectin is contra-indicated will be offered 2 doses of topical 5% permethrin cream 7 days apart. Topical permethrin will be  applied to the whole body in line with standard treatment of scabies.

In a subset of randomly selected villages individuals will undergo a skin check to collect baseline data on the prevalence of scabies and impetigo. Diagnosis is made clinically and no samples are collected. Procedures in these villages are otherwise identical with regards to the MDA intervention.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Coverage of the MDA in the study population, separate for trachoma and scabies MDA.
This is calculated by
Primary Method: Comparing study records to community population data
Secondary Method: Capture-recapture comparing population present when the D1 and D8 doses of Ivermectin are administered </outcome>
      <timepoint>1 Month post first dose administration.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of self-reported short-term adverse events. Data will be collected by report to study staff at D1 and D8. 
The most commonly reported adverse events are:
1.	Headache
2.	Dizziness
3.	Itch
4.	Tummy pain
5.	Nausea
6.	Vomiting
7.	Diarrhoea
8.	Fever
</outcome>
      <timepoint>As the adverse event profile of single dose Ivermectin is well known the focus is on adverse events that accompany co-administration with Azithromycin.
Adverse event data will therefore be collected 1 week post the first study drug dose (time of co-administration)

    <concealment>The entire province of Choiseul was selected to be included in the study. 

This study entails two components.
Mass drug administration which will take place in the entire province and an efficacy subgroup which will take place in ten randomly selected villages at baseline and an additional ten randomly selected villages at 12 months.

MDA Inclusion:
In each community, residents will be identified from the most recently available population lists. Local nurses will inform communities of the forthcoming visit by the study team. In each village community members will be given an opportunity to meet the study team, and to understand what is involved and ask questions. 

Prior to performing any study specific procedure, verbal consent will be obtained for each subject. Information sheets explaining the study will be distributed to community nurses who will be trained in explaining the study. These information sheets will also be available to study participants. For subjects below the legal age, a parent or legal guardian must also provide verbal consent.

Skin Survey Subgroup.
In addition to the procedures outlined above for MDA, additional steps will be taken in the 20 randomly selected villages (10 at baseline and 10 at 12 months) where prevalence surveys for scabies and impetigo will be conducted by performing skin examinations. The project coordinator and a study nurse will provide additional information on the skin examination and obtain informed consent.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The aim of the MDA programme is to prove that large scale co-administration for the purposes of NTD control programmes is feasible. As such a formal sample size calculation for the MDA component of the study is not appropriate. In the field MDA programmes cover populations of between 10,000-100,000 people at a time. With an anticipated population of between 25-30,000 people taking part in this MDA project it is anticipated we obtain data sufficient to inform wider co-administration efforts.

Coverage (primary outcome)

We will calculate coverage by age group and sex, separately for azithromycin, for single dose of ivermectin/permethrin and for both doses of ivermecting/permethrin, in two ways. First, we will calculate use as a denominator the populations from the most recently available official admininistrative data. Second, we will use the capture-recapture method, making use of the two visits for ivermectin/permethrin administration, to calculate an estimate of population size by age groups and sex. This method makes the assumption that the presence or absence of a person at each of the two visits is a random, independent event, and makes use of the proportion present at both, compared to proportions at one visit only, to calculate a population size estimate.
The coverage estimates from the official administrative data will be used to make comparisons with the coverage rates for azithromycin MDA alone in other provinces of the Solomon islands. These comparisons will be made descriptively, understanding that there are multiple factors that may influence coverage. Other factors that may influence coverage, particularly geographic differences, will be considered. The co-administration will be deemed to have been a success for azithromycin MDA if the coverage falls within the range of coverages achieved in other provinces for azithromycin MDA. For ivermectin/permethrin MDA, single dose coverage should be virtually identical to azithromycin coverage.
In further analyses, will analyse coverage by age group and sex.

Safety (secondary outcome)
We will record the number of self-reported AEs, which will be will be categorized as above and expressed as a rate. The rate from this study will be compared to the rate of AEs described in
25 communities in the previous co-administration study (11-30%) and to studies that have documented AEs for single administration of ivermectin and azithromycin respectively. We will document and report any serious AEs.

We will record and report deaths and emergency hospital admissions in Choiseul province in the 3 months following MDA, and compare to the 3 months prior.

Efficacy against scabies (and impetigo) based on skin examinations:
Prevalence of scabies (and impetigo) at 12 months in 10 villages will be compared to prevalence in 10 independently selected villages at baseline. The statistical test of significance for this comparison, to be applied at the two-sided 0.05 level, will be a modified version of the chi-squared test that takes account of the sample sizes in both the baseline and 12 months sampling points. With an anticipated baseline prevalence of 20% for scabies and an anticipated efficacy of the intervention of 80% a subset of 10 randomly selected villages provides adequate power to assess this outcome.

Efficacy against severe SSTI requiring hospitalisations
Annual incidence rates of admissions with severe SSTI will be calculated for the pre- and post- intervention periods. We will use Poisson models to assess the impact of MDA by calculating overall and age-specific incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals.

Efficacy against skin disease as measured by presentations to clinics
We will use Poisson models to compare the number of presentations to primary care for skin-related consultations in the pre- and post-intervention periods. Incidence rate ratios (post vs. pre) and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of co-administration of azithromycin and ivermectin in large populations in these settings and to provide data to support co-administration in other settings.
Alongside this the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of large scale ivermectin-based MDA for scabies and to addresses the problem of how to scale up MDA for scabies control in high prevalence countries, and specifically in settings where there is already an infrastructure and established need for trachoma MDA.
