  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three study groups. The study groups are composed of two intervention groups (1 and 2) and one control group (3).

Intervention group (1): 
"I-strip" neuromuscular taping will be applied on lower trunk muscles, from sacral base to twelfth thoracic vertebra. 
Subjects will bend forward during the applicaton and both sides will be taped. 
The tape will be applied with paper-off tension. 
The tape will be applied just on one accasion and it will remain in place for 24 hours.
Intervention group (2): 
"I-strip" neuromuscular taping will be applied on lower trunk muscles, from sacral base to twelfth thoracic vertebra. 
Subjects will bend forward during the applicaton and both sides will be taped. 
The paper-off tension tape will be applied with approximately 50% stretch.
The tape will be applied just on one accasion and it will remain in place for 24 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group (3): 
"I-strip" neuromuscular taping will be applied on lower trunk muscles, from sacral base to twelfth thoracic vertebra. 
Subjects will be placed in a neutral positionduring the applicaton and both sides will be taped. 
The tape will be applied without tension.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To analyze the differences in muscle lengthening after applying the neuromuscular tape on the erector muscles of the spine in subjects with nonspecific low back pain.
The differences in muscle legthening were assessed using the standard sit and reach test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The measurement will be performed before the placement of the neuromuscular taping, 5 minutes and 24 hours after the placement of the bandage, and 5 minutes after the removal of the tape. Three measurements will be recorded and  the average will be calculated.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To know the variation of lumbar range of motion, in subjects with nonspecific low back pain, after the application of the neuromuscular tape on the erector muscles of the spine. 
Lumbar range of motion (flexion and lateral bending) was assessed using an inclinometer and the standard sit and reach test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The measurement will be performed before the placement of the neuromuscular taping, 5 minutes and 24 hours after the placement of the bandage, and 5 minutes after the removal of the tape. Three measurements will be recorded with the sit and reach test and  the average will be calculated.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine Pressure pain threshold  variation at the erector spinae and gluteus medius trigger points in subjects with nonspecific low back pain.
Pressure pain threshold will be measured using an analogue algometer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The measurement will be performed before the placement of the neuromuscular taping, 5 minutes and 24 hours after the placement of the bandage, and 5 minutes after the removal of the tape.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>There will be a volunteer recruitment campaign, using posters in the University buildings as well as through an email distributed by the universiy information service. 

Those interested in participate in the study will be scheduled for a first interview, which will consist of information about the study, check on compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and signature of informed consent.
Once accepted participation in the study, the volunteer will be registered with a code. 

There will be two interventional groups, one formed by patients who are going to receive a standardized therapeutic neuromuscular tape application as described by Kenzo Kase and the other formed by patients who are going to receive neuromuscular tape application with more tension than Kenzo Kase proposed 
The control group will be formed by patients who are going to receive a placebo neuromuscular tape application. 

Once registered, volunteers will be allocated to one of the three study groups. The allocation concealment will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be "off-site".</concealment>
    <sequence>The method of secuence generation will be by simple randomization using Epidat program application.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are several treatment options for nonspecific low back pain. Recently there is a new option, the neuromuscular taping, on which there are few studies about its action and effectiveness.
The neuromuscular taping is a bandaging alternative technique that has recently emerged as a viable option for treating athletic injuries.
According to various theories, could improve a variety of physiological problems, including range of motion.

The main objective is to analyze the effects that occur on lower trunk muscles, after application of neuromuscular tape, in patients with a history of nonspecific mechanical low back pain.
Our hypothesis is that the application of neuromuscular taping, on the erector spinae muscles, increases the extensibility, lumbar ranges of motion and pain threshold to pressure of these muscles.</summary>
