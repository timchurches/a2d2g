  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants are adult in-patients at a tertiary Australian hospital. The monitoring system consists of a monitor with a screen and cables which attach to a finger-cuff containing a bladder. This finger-cuff is similar to a blood pressure cuff and is designed to fit the index or middle finger, which inflates periodically and measures blood pressure and cardiac output. The monitor can calculate complex haemodynamic parameters from the input of information like the height, sex, weight and central venous pressure of the patient. This monitor is not standard equipment at the medical emergency team review, and is used in some patients undergoing surgery and has been studied in emergency department patients. Therefore this is a non-invasive intervention for the purposes of applying a monitoring system in order to observe the cardiac index.
An appropriately sized finger-cuff is applied to the participant's finger. This is done by the trial investigator who is either a registered nurse on the Medical Emergency Team (MET) service or a doctor trained in the use of this monitoring system. The application of the monitor is aimed to commence prior to any resuscitation, however does not impede it. The measurement of interest is the cardiac output and index which are recorded on to the monitor. The monitor screen is covered with a flap as the parameters are not intended for observation by the treating team during the MET. Monitoring to be continued throughout the MET until it is stood down or ceased at 60 minutes from the first application of the monitor, whichever is earlier. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patient's with severe infection can present with low blood pressure and require immediate treatment and sometimes cardiac output monitoring to understand how best to treat them. The primary purpose of this study is to understand their cardiac output prior to commencement of resuscitation on adult patients who have low blood pressure in hospital using a finger cuff which is non-invasive and previously shown to be validated in some patient populations. The aim of the study is to describe the range of cardiac output in patients who deteriorate in hospital. It is hoped that this will allow description of important subtypes who will benefit from specifically tailored therapies.</summary>
