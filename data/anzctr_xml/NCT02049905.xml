Dacarbazine administered at 1000 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion (IVI), over 90±15 minutes on Day 1 every 21 days until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs;

Gemcitabine, 900 mg/m2 by IVI over 90 minutes on Days 1 and 8, plus docetaxel, 100 mg/m2 by IVI over 1 hour on Day 8 of a 28 day cycle until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs;
Doxorubicin, 75 mg/m2 by IVI over 5 to 30 minutes every 21 days for a maximum cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 or unacceptable toxicity occurs; or
Ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 administered over 2 to 4 hours on Days 1-4 of a 21 day cycle + mesna per standard site administration regimen until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
