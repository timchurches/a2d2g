    <statisticalmethods>The normal tear break up time (TBUT) has been reported to have a mean value 14.7 and standard deviation of 4.7 seconds. To be able to detect a 1 standard deviation change in TBUT, a sample size of 7 is necessary. Assuming approximately a 50% discontinuation rate, our study aims to recruit 16 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preservatives in eye drops, such as benzalkonium chloride (BAK), are necessary to prevent microbial contamination, but have been known to affect the comfort and health of the eye's structures, especially if used for long periods of time. This study will investigate the impact of BAK in participants using preserved and unpreserved atropine eye drops on their ocular comfort and health, as well as on the action of the drug itself.</summary>
