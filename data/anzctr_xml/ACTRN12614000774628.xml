  <interventions>
    <interventions>This involves the intervention group of primary carers of individuals with  depression reading a cognitive behaviour therapy based bibliotherapy manual; 'The Good Mood Guide: A Self-Help Manual for Depression,' plus a short weekly telephone contact, for 8 weeks, of approximately five minutes duration with one of the researchers. Adherence was also assessed through the weekly telephone calls, whereby the researcher asked a standardised set of questions about the content of the specific module. Answers to these questions enabled the research to ascertain complicance with the readings.

The manual contains eight modules, each module containing reading, writing and activities to be completed over a one-week time-frame. Each module takes approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete. The entire program was designed to be completed in eight weeks. By reading the manual, it is anticipated that participants will have an increase in their resilience. Data will be collected at three timepoints: Baseline (Week 0), end of program (Week 8), and 4 weeks follow-up (Week 12).
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group of primary caregivers will not be given the self-help manual  but will continue to receive standard family support (standard outpatient support group) as well as a short weekly telephone call of approximately five minutes duration from a researcher. The duration of control group intervention is eight weeks. Data will be collected at three timepoints: Baseline (Week 0), completion of the intervention (Week 8), and 4 weeks after completing the intervention (Week 12).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess if there is any difference in the level of resilience of carers who complete the guided-help manual, at 12-week follow-up, compared to a control group who continue to receive only the standard care approach to caregivers of individuals with depression. 

Resilience assessed using the following psychometric instrument: Resilience Scale measures the degree of individual resilience (Wagnild &amp; Young, 1993). It contains 25 items rated on a 7-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 25 to 175; higher scores reflecting greater resilience.

      <outcome>To assess if there is any difference in the experience of caring of carers who complete the guided self-help manual, at 12-week follow-up, compared to a control group who continue to receive only the standard care approach to caregivers of individuals with depression. 

Caregiving experience assessed using the following psychometric instrument: Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI) (Szmukler et al. 1996), a 66-item instrument which measures caregivers' appraisal of their caregiving experience.

Level of expressed emotion assessed using the following psychometric instrument: Family Questionnaire (Wiedemann et al. 2002), a 20-item self-report instrument, which assesses the level of expressed emotion in a family. Expressed emotion is a type of negative communication involving excessive criticism and emotional over-involvement directed at a patient by family members.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study was to assess whether a self-help manual for caregivers of individuals with depression was effective in strengthening their resilience, reducing expressed emotion and improving their experience of caregiving. The study involved two groups: an 'intervention' group who studied the manual, and a 'control' group who did not study the manual.</summary>
