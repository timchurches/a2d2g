  <interventions>
    <interventions>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
20 minutes, 2x week, for 4 weeks
Anodal-tDCS sessions will be delivered by a constant current stimulator (Empi) and involve 20 minutes of constant current 2mA stimulation (equivalent to 0.08 Ma/CM2) over their left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the anode electrode will be placed over F3 according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement.

The intervention will be administered by PhD (psychology) student Emily Corti, under the supervision of Dr Andrea Loftus. Miss Corti has been trained in the administration and safety procedures regarding the use of tDCS. Dr Loftus has an extensive background in the use of tDCS and is the director of the Curtin University Neuroscience Laboratory.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo
Sham tDCS provided to control participants

The tDCS machine can be switched to 'sham' condition, where the tDCS will 'ramp up' for the first 30 seconds of the stimulation time. After the 30 seconds the sham participants will experience no stimulation for 20 minutes. At the end of the 20 minutes the participants will again experience some sensation as the tDCS ramps down. This is to ensure participants are unaware they have been placed in the control group. (The control group can be wait-listed at the end of the study if they wish).
The electrodes are placed in the same position as for the anodal stimulation. The tDCS machine is just switched to 'sham'.</comparator>

(1) Attention and Working Memory domain: The Letter-Number Sequencing subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV and The Stroop (Colour-Word) Test.
(2) Executive Function domain: The CANTAB Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) subtest and Verbal fluency will be assessed using the Controlled Oral Word Association Task.

(4) Memory domain: Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) and the Paragraph Recall subtest of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RMBT) will be used to assess memory.
(5) Visuospatial domain: Judgement of Line Orientation (JLO) and the Hooper Visual Organisation Test (HVOT) will be used to assess visuospatial abilities.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will examine motor cortex excitability and cognition in people with chronic low back pain (CLBP). This project will investigate transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving motor cortex excitability and cognition in CLBP. Participants motor cortex excitability and cognition will be measured before, and after 4-weeks of tDCS. It is predicted CLBP participants will demonstrate abnormal motor cortex excitability and impaired cognitive function, compared with age and gender-matched controls. It is also predicted that tDCS will restore normal motor cortex excitability and improve cognitive functioning in people with CLBP. The findings will provide a better understanding of the relationship between CLBP and the brain and the therapeutic potential of tDCS for CLBP.</summary>
