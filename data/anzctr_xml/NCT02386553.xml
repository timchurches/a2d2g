  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to examine the efficacy of multiple doses of Nusinersen
      administered intrathecally in preventing or delaying the need for respiratory intervention or
      death in infants with genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
      Secondary objectives of this study are to examine the effects of Nusinersen in infants with
      genetically diagnosed and presymptomatic SMA.</summary>
