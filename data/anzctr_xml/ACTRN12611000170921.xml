    <interventions>Debridement of randomised sinus cavity vs no debridement for contralteral sinus cavity
This occurs after sinus surgery to clean the operated site from blood and crusts
THIS OCCURS IN THE CLINIC. IT LASTS ABOUT 15 MINUTES. THE MECHANISM IS CLEANING BLOOD AND CRUSTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE , WITH THE THOUGHT THAT THIS PREVENTS ADHESION FORMATION AND PAIN BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS WORKS - SEE BRIEF SUMMARY FIELD REGARDING THIS CLINICAL QUESTION  AS REQUESTED.</interventions>
    <comparator>No debridement
No cleaning of the cavity occurs

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic sinusitis affects up to 20% of the population with a significant impact on quality of life for the sufferer. Endoscopic sinus surgery is currently the treatment of choice for chronic rhinosinusitis which fails to respond to medical therapy. This usually involves a combination of oral antibiotics, oral and topical steroids, and saline irrigation of the nose. The main complaint which patients have from this type of surgery is the discomfort and pain associated with debridement of the sino-nasal cavity following surgery. The main cause of failure of this surgery which may require revision surgery is poor wound healing with the formation of excess scar tissue in the form of bands between sides of the nose, called adhesions. 

Regular wound debridement to achieve the best outcomes following ESS has been strongly advocated, but the basis is largely empirical. Experts in the field have called for regular cavity debridement.  There is no standardized regime for post operative care amongst ESS surgeons. In some cases debridement as frequently as daily during the early healing phase has been used. Weekly debridement for the first few weeks until healing occurs is still commonly employed. 

Sinus cavity debridement is uncomfortable and unpleasant for patients. It requires regular visits to the treating surgeon, with considerable cost implications on the patient and the health service.  The literature as it stands is conflicting. There is only 1 pilot study investigating 17 pts in a non-blinded fashion. This pilot study demonstrated no significant difference in adhesions, however this was non-blinded and involved only 17 patients. There are studies that point to early debridement as key to limiting adhesion formation, whereas other studies show that minimal post-operative care is equally successful. 

The aim of this study is to ascertain whether early debridement, with its related costs and patient discomfort, limits adhesion formation as evaluated by a blinded observer, via video-endoscopy at 3 months post surgery.</summary>
