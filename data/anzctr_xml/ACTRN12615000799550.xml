  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The DIVIT study is a prospective, observational study of hospitalised patients that have been diagnosed diverticulitis and diverticular disease. We will plan to identify those admitted to the Gold Coast  and Robina Hospitals with the condition, and following them through their admission and discharge. 

In Liaison with the Acute Surgical and Gastroenterology teams at the Gold Coast Hospital will enable the Research team to identify potential candidates. We will also monitor the computer tomography (CT) scans performed at the Gold Hospital health service for diagnosis of diverticulitis that are related to presentation. We will follow their progress with use of the electronic medical records (eMR).

Information about the study as well as a questionnaire looking at particular clinical factors will be given to the patients who have consented for the study. 

As part of standard clinical care, patients will undergo blood tests, stool tests, imaging and endoscopy. These are what is comprised of standard treatment for acute diverticulitis. There is no alteration in their clinical care.

We will then analyse the collected data to determine any predictors for severe disease/ recurrent disease as stated in our aims. The data will be kept for 5 years, and at the end, will be deleted and consent forms will be destroyed.

We hope to capture a sample size of around 150-200 patients over the 2 year period

The purpose of the research is to identify and better understand the factors that cause diverticulitis, and distinguish between people who are more likely to develop the disease early in life and also get frequent attacks. This could have implications in aggressive approach or more conservative approach to management of acute and recurrent diverticulitis.
