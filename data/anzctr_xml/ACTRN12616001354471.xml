  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recently, BioFlo(Trademark) PICC (Angiodynamics) has become available and approved by the Therapeutic Good Administration. The technology enhancements include added Pressure Activated Safety Valve that is designed to resist back flow and reduce blood reflux on the inside of the catheter to mitigate occlusion or BSI. As well, the BioFlo(Trademark) has Endexo technology that makes the PICC more resistant to the accumulation of blood components particularly platelets and thrombus.

Patients will be randomly allocated to this intervention. The PICC lines will be inserted in Radiology by a radiologist.. A research nurse will access patients' health record weekly (coincides with weekly dressing changes) to monitor for signs of complications including blockage and bloodstream infection from the date of insertion until PICC removal. The PICC will remain in situ until device failure or no longer required, at the discretion of the treating doctor. There is no maximum duration of PICC use for the purpose of this study. </interventions>
    <comparator>Currently, the hospital uses PowerPICC(Trademark), a powerinjectable polyurethane PICC that, is capable of an injection rate of 5 mL per second, has a kink-resistant design, and is designed to better fit veins (smaller diameter in the middle for the peripheral veins, and larger diameter in the distal tip for the larger veins).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Catheter-related blood stream infection  defined as a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection where the PICC line was in situ for 2 days or more and must be in place when the infection occurred.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be checked weekly (coincides with dressing changes)  to monitor for infection from time of PICC line insertion until time of central line removal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occlusion will be judged based on the nurses documentation of the incidence of blockage (e.g. resistance, sluggish flow) in which interventions were employed to resolve it. Interventions include, but not limited to, flushing the line, arm repositioning, redressing, and obtaining a PICC-o-gram or ultrasound. Thrombosis will be determined based on the results of the PICC-o-gram or ultrasound.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be checked weekly (coincides with dressing changes) to monitor for occlusion from time of PICC line insertion until time of central line removal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events E.g. catheter rupture, sensitivity or allergy, severe pain</outcome>
      <timepoint>Medical records will be checked weekly (coincides with dressing changes) to monitor for adverse events from time of PICC line insertion until time of central line removal.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are considered a conventional mode of treatment provision in most hospitals, and mostly favoured by patients and clinicians. However, the effectiveness of PICCs can be offset by complications, most commonly occlusion and bloodstream infections. As a result, PICC technology is advancing and designed to limit complications, hence the hospital currently uses PowerPICC(Trademark). Recently, a newer product BioFlo(Trademark) claims to have better technology, thus hypothesised to have better protection against occlusion and bloodstream infections.  The proposed study aims to compare and evaluate the effectiveness two types of PICC lines  BioFlo(Trademark)and PowerPICC(Trademark) - on the incidence of bloodstream infections and the incidence of occlusions in a private haematology/oncology setting. It is anticipated that the results of this study will determine the product to be used across the Mater Misericordiae Limited Brisbane. </summary>
