  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diabetic retinopathy is a common cause of severe loss of visual and the most common cause of legal blindness in individuals between the ages of 20 and 65 years in developed countries. Macular oedema is the commonest cause of visual loss in diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic macular oedema is treated with laser coagulation to the macular area according to established guidelines which take into account the extent of the leak and its proximity to the fovea. This treatment does not, however, always work and is inherently destructive.
This study is a prospective, double-masked, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone three months or more after focal or grid laser photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular oedema will improve the visual acuity of eligible eyes.
Study treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone or placebo will be administered within one week of the baseline angiogram and OCT and on the day of the baseline visual acuity measurement. Triamcinolone (0.1 ml Kenacort 40, 40mg/ml triamcinolone acetate, Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceuticals, Australia) will be injected into the vitreous.
If there is still oedema present, laser treatment will be performed after 4 weeks from the triamcinolone treatment.
The duration of the study is 2 years.</interventions>
    <comparator>Eyes randomized to receive placebo will be prepared the same way but only balanced salt solution will be administered subconjunctivally.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Clinically significant diabetic macular oedema involving the fovea in one or both eyes (phakic and/or pseudophakic) which persists at least 3 months after adequate macular photocoagulation. Best corrected visual acuity in the affected eye(s) 6/9 or worse.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Glaucoma which is uncontrolled or is controlled but with glaucomatous visual field defects. Loss of vision due to other causes (e.g. age related macular degeneration, myopic macular degeneration). Significant macular ischemia (FFA). No useful vision in fellow eye. Known allergies to triamcinolone acetate or steroids. Patient is already under systemic treatment with &gt; 5mg prednisolone (or equivalent) daily. Intercurrent severe disease such as septicaemia. Any condition which would affect follow-up or photographic documentation (e.g. geographical, psycho-social, media opacities).</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>When the ophthalmologist is satisfied that the patient understands the study design and is willing to enter the study the patient is asked to sign the informed consent form. A randomized schedule has been generated using computer generated pseudo random numbers with variable block sizes. Treatment assignments are kept as a series of numbered opaque envelopes stored in a locked filing cabinet in the clinic. The identification of patients will consist of a code made up of the patient’s initials and number. Observers assessing best corrected visual acuity will be masked to treatment allocation, as well the investigator who performs laser treatment and decides whether further treatment is indicated or not. The surgeon performing the injections will be unmasked to treatment allocation. The photographer and OCT operators need not be masked.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients were randomized to receive study treatment using a series of serially numbered, opaque envelopes containing an assignment to treat or placebo. Treatment assignments will be compiled using a list of computer generated pseudo-random numbers in permuted blocks of variable size. In patients with only one eye eligible for the study, the eye will be randomised to receive treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone or a sub-conjunctival injection. In patients with both eyes eligible for the study, the right eye will receive the treatment assignment in the envelope and the fellow eye will receive the reverse treatment.</sequence>
