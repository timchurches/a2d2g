    <interventions>The enhanced dietary supplement regime will consist of a shake made from 22g whey protein isolate powder administered to provide 20g protein; creatine monohydrate (5g); and glutamine (0.6g/kg fat free mass/day). The enhanced dietary will also include beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (38mg/kg/day rounded to nearest 500mg) given in capsule form. Inactive ingredients used in the shake are maltodextrin powder (8g) and sucralose (5g). The shake will be made on 250ml skim milk and will be consumed once per day. The supplement regime also includes a paediatric multivitamin (Vitamin A 582.5 IU, Vitamin B1 350 microg, Vitamin B2 550 microg, Vitamin B3 6 mg, Vitamin B5 1.5 mg, Vitamin B6 650 microg, Vitamin B12 750 microg, Folic acid 50 microg, Vitamin C 20 mg, Vitamin D3 100 IU, Natural Vitamin E 15 IU, Biotin 25 microg, Calcium 5 mg, Iodine 75 microg, Iron 1.3 mg, Magnesium 5 mg, Manganese 12.5 microg, Zinc 1mg; 1 chewable capsules per day for participants aged 5 to 6 years; 2 chewable capsules per day for participants aged 7-12 years), fish oil (1050mg per day in 2 chewable capsules), and vitamin D (2000 IU/day in two gel capsules).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project seeks to explore the efficacy of a standard nutritional supplement in comparison to a standard nutritional supplement enhanced with creatine monohydrate, glutamine and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate in maintaining or improving functional ability in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It combines the expertise of nutrition and dietetics with neurologists to enhance the outcomes of this population group where little is known of their nutritional needs since the standard introduction of steroid therapy.
The primary outcome measures functional ability using the StepWatch Activity Monitor. Secondary outcome measures include 6 minute walk test, DXA to measure body composition, functional questionnaires and quality of life questionnaires. Our dietary supplement that we
propose to use in this study is contained within a high protein shake, and includes a multivitamin, vitamin D and essential fatty acids given alone or in conjunction with creatine monohydrate (CrM), glutamine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB). This will be a 12 month, randomized control cross over trial using 24 age matched pairs with a 2 month lead in period and 2 week washout.</summary>
