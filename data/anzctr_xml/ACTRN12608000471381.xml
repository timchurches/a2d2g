  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants who have been randomised to receive Gabapentin will receive 1,200 mg of gabapentin orally as a single dose one hour before surgery. Day one post operatively or when the patient is able to tolerate diet, they will receive 300mg of Gabapentin eight hourly orally. This regime will continue for three weeks. They will also receive whatever analgesic regime is determined appropriate by the treating anaesthetist.</interventions>
    <comparator>The participants randomised to receive placebo will receive 4 microcrystalline cellulose capsules (sugar capsules) orally as a pre-med one hour before their operation. Day one post operatively or when the patient is able to tolerate diet, they will receive one capsule orally eight hourly for three weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the impact of Gabapentin on post thoracotomy pain at three months we will invite the participants to attend an out patient appointment at the Pain Management Clinic. Primary outcomes will be measured by the participant's activities, the presence or absence of persistant pain, length of rehabilitation (either in an approved centre or with relatives), if they have achieved unrestricted daily living activities and the date that they have returned to work. A 15 item short form McGill Questionnaire will be completed and measurements of punctuate hyperalgesia around the thoracotomy incision with a von Frey device will also take place at this final assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, three weeks and three months post operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the impact of Gabapentin on acute pain post operatively the participanrs will be followed up for the first three days by the Acute Pain Management Team who will record the best and worst pain score per twenty four hours for days 1 to 3. The participants will be instructed to use the numerical rating scale (0= no pain, 10= worst pain imaginable) to indicate the level of pain that they may/may not be experiencing. The participant's charts will also be assessed and analgesic requirements will be recorded. Additionally a four point categorical system/ side effect score relating to sedation, nausea, vomiting, itch and hallucination will also be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately post operatively to day three post operatively.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the recovery of patients undergoing thoracotomy using Gabapentin for analgesia we will use a 15 item short form McGill Pain questionnaire on discharge. At this time a mechanical punctuate von frey device will be used to measure punctuate hyperalgesia around the thoracotomy incision. The particpant will be contacted at three weeks post operatively by telephone to assess for any complications. Reports on mobilisation and the ease at which this is accomplished will also be recorded.
Adverse side effects will also be recorded and the severity noted.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge from hospital, three weeks and three months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing surgery usually experience some sort of pain post operatively. There are many drugs which can be taken to reduce or take away the pain. There are also different types of Anaesthetic procedures to help a patient who is in pain (such as an epidural for pain relief in childbirth).
There have been recent advances in medicine which show that using several different types of pain medication is more effective used together and has fewer side effects such as nausea and vomiting, constipation and drowsiness. Also at this time, there is a theory that receiving pain relief just before an operation can help reduce the pain afterwards.
Unfortunately for some patients the pain can be hard to control and it may bother them for some time (months or years) after the operation. We call this chronic pain and it is a common and difficult problem to manage.
Previous experience has shown that using various pain medications is a useful approach to treating pain as there are many factors that can cause pain. It makes sense to use different medications to target the different pain pathways which are aggravated after surgery. 
Some pain relieving drugs have been found to have some unacceptable side effects. It has reduced the choice of medication that we can use to treat pain. We are proposing to use a drug that is commonly used for the treatment of chronic pain, Gabapentin. Gabapentin was first used for the treatment of seizures but it was quickly found to be useful in treating chronic pain. Gabapentin is licensed in Australia for treating pain and seizures. There have been some studies recently that have shown that it is helpful in treating immediate post operative pain (acute pain). As well as studying the effects of Gabapentin on post operative pain, we would also like to investigate whether continuing Gabapentin for 3 weeks after a thoracotomy helps prevent or reduces chronic pain.</summary>
