    <interventions>Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy treatment is usually delivered in small doses over many treatments (usually 5 to 20 treatments). SABR treatment is different as it uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1 or 2 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages with the aim of destroying all cancer cells at the site of treatment. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses.

SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. We aim to test the ability of this new technique to control the cancer spots that have spread from the breast to the bones and that are being treated with SABR.

Initially you will be assessed to check that you are suitable to join the study. This screening period may last for a number of weeks and will involve the following procedures. All of the tests that you will undergo during this screening period would normally be done as part of your standard care, even if you were not participating in this study.

* Medical history
* Physical examination with a focus on where the cancer has spread to in the body
* CT scan (Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis) 
* CT of extremity (only if the cancer is present on an extremity)
* Whole body bone scan
* Other investigations, for example an MRI scan (magnetic resonance imaging) may be ordered by your doctor

Also as part of this study you will be required to have a special scan called an 18F-PET/CT (stands for fluoride-positron emission tomography/computer tomography) scan. This involves an injection of a radioactive material/tracer and then a scan to see where your breast cancer has spread to.

If the tests show that the research study is suitable for you, and you still wish to take part, you can join the study and begin the treatment.

You will have either a single session of SABR treatment (20Gy in 1 fraction per area to be treated) or in some cases where there is not enough time available or for technical reasons you may be required to return for two or three sessions (i.e. You may receive 28Gy in 2 fractions).

In order to deliver this treatment, you may need to attend a planning CT scan session, where you will receive a CT scan and your body measurements are taken in the position that you will be lying in for your radiotherapy. This visit takes approximately one hour. Once the radiotherapy treatment has been planned, a further mock-up visit may be required to ensure that the radiotherapy plan can be smoothly delivered when it comes to the time of treatment. This session will take between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. When the treatment starts, the total time required to deliver the treatment will be approximately one hour. 

Follow-up will involve a visit at approximately 1 month, and every 3 months until two years after the SABR treatment. At each visit, a doctor will review your general health and whether anything new has happened to you since the last study visit (including any bad reactions or injuries), any side effects you may be experiencing, an assessment of how well you can perform daily activities and a review of any further anti-cancer treatments you may have undergone.

At 12 and 24 months after your SABR treatment, you will have a CT scan and whole body bone scan, as well as a another 18F-PET/CT scan (at 12 months only), which will be very similar to the scan before your treatment. The purpose of this scan is to assess the effect of the treatment on your bone lesion(s).

    <statisticalmethods>Primary Aim: 
The point estimate for feasibility as a binary variable will be provided along with its 95% CI. Feasibility will be considered to have been achieved for a given patients if all of the following conditions hold true for that patient:
a) Successful completion of treatment within 3 days of intended treatment
b) Image guidance verification of treatment delivery within 5mm

The point estimate for tolerability as a binary variable will be provided along with its exact 95% CI.
The treatment will be considered tolerable if:
a) No greater than 15% (4 of 30) of the patients will experience a grade III or higher acute toxicity
b) There will be no grade 5 toxicities related to SABR

Secondary Aims: 
The proportion of patients who suffer from grade 3 or higher acute toxicities will be provided along with its exact 95% CI. Acute toxicities will include those under the following categories:
* Gastrointestinal Disorders
* General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions 
* Hepatobiliary Disorders
* Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders 
* Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified (incl cysts and polyps)
* Renal and Urinary Disorders 
* Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders
* Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders

The effectiveness of treatment will be assessed by means of the local progression free survival (LPFS). Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to describe LPFS. LPFS at 1 and 2 years will be estimated from the Kaplan-Meier curve, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

A trained PET physician will provide a visual analysis of Na-18F PET scans. Na-18F PET response will be described at 12 months as counts and percentages with exact 95% confidence intervals. This exploratory analysis will be restricted to patients alive and not lost to follow-up at 12 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of stereotactic ablative body radiosurgery in patients with oligometastases from breast cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a confirmed primary diagnosis of breast cancer, with evidence of 1 to 3 bone metastases. 

Study details: 
Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a new form of cancer treatment involving high precision radiotherapy. Standard radiotherapy treatment is usually delivered in small doses over many treatments (usually 5 to 20 treatments). SABR treatment is different as it uses a dose of radiation delivered in 1 or 2 treatments that is much higher than standard radiotherapy dosages with the aim of destroying all cancer cells at the site of treatment. The total dose of radiation may be 5-10 times higher than standard radiotherapy doses. SABR treatment appears to be effective in controlling cancer in other sites elsewhere in the body, including the lung, kidney and the liver. All participants in this study will be treated with SABR delivered in 1-3 sessions of 45-90 minutes duration. Participants will be regularly monitored during treatment and for a period of up to 24 months post treatment in order to evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of treatment, as well as treatment response.
