  <interventions>
    <interventions> A mental health literacy training program on depression and schizophrenia, which revolves around the Story bridge (Lubman et al 2014) will be conducted for the intervention cluster. The program will be an interactive 3-hour session for each intervention cluster group. The training program will be delivered face to face, using a combination of Power-Point presentations, video-recordings and large- and small-group discussions, about people with depression and schizophrenia. Participants will also be given printed material about people with depression and schizophrenia: Guidelines for Carers of Someone with a Mental Disorder (www.mhfa.com). The training program will take place at participants' routine meeting place in their district, and will be delivered by Yaw Amankwa Arthur, a PhD Candidate.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>In Brong Ahafo region there are 27 districts and a total of 766 elected assembly members. The study is planned with equally-sized control and treatment groups, with individuals clustered within districts, with each district comprising an average of 29 assembly members (approximately). For the control group, we anticipate a difference of 5 points in mental health literacy scores (as assessed by the Attitudes and Beliefs about Mental Health Problems: Public Views questionnaire (Jorm, Korten, Jacomb, Christensen, &amp; Henderson, 1999) from baseline to 12 weeks. For the intervention group, we anticipate a change in 10 points in the intervention group cluster scores from baseline to 12 weeks. We anticipate data variability across both groups to be 10 points. We anticipate the intra-class correlation coefficient to be 0.03; of approximately medium magnitude. Hence, about 3% of total data variability is anticipated to occur between clusters; corresponding to a clustering design effect of 1.56. 

At a 5% level of significance and a power of 80%, we would need to recruit a total of 128 participants (64 intervention group participants and 64 control group participants) to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the intervention and control group clusters are equal without clustering. Hence, we aim to recruit and cluster 2-3 intervention and 2- 3 control group clusters. To allow for some attrition, an additional 10% of the estimated sample size will be recruited, making a total of 140 participants.
Demographic characteristics of the participants will be summarised using frequencies and percentages. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be conducted on the groups mean of the measures. Cronbachs alpha will be used to assess the reliability of each scale at baseline. Pairwise comparisons will be undertaken to compare the different combinations between the three time points of the intervention and the control group clusters. The Chi-square will also be used to analyse the differences in knowledge, stigmatizing and discriminatory scores at baseline and follow-up time points.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mental health literacy program on Ghanaian assembly members knowledge about and attitudes towards people with mental  disorders. Based on a power analysis, 128 participants in six districts will be recruited. Districts will be clustered and randomised into intervention and control group clusters. Participants in the intervention cluster will be exposed to a mental health literacy program, while the control cluster will be given a brochure with basic information about mental health. Outcomes will be evaluated using standardized instruments about mental disorders. A quantitative process evaluation will be conducted on participants who took part in the training program. A randomised sample of the intervention cluster will also be interviewed to qualitatively evaluate the program.  It is hypothesised that assembly members who participate in the mental health literacy training program will have higher mental health literacy and less stigmatizing attitudes than those who receive a brochure about mental health. The results of this study may contribute to Ghanas mental health literacy programs because its effectiveness may assist participants who are local legislators to appreciate the need to commit resources for programs.</summary>
