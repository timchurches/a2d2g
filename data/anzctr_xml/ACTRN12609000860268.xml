    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of febrile neutropenia (FN).
4 hourly oral temperature monitoring using digital oral thermometer (Terumo) .
Full blood count (including absolute neutrophil count) is measured from Day 7 of chemotherapy till recovery from neutropenia (&gt; 1.0 x 10^6/Liter).  Onset of fever [defined as either (38 degree celcius twice an hour apart when there is  no evidence of sepsis) OR (38C once when there is evidence of sepsis) 
] during neutropenia indicate febrile neutropenia. (primary outcome).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Temperature measurement is started immediately upon commencing chemotherapy until recovery from neutropenia.
If the blood count is normal at starting chemotherapy, full blood count (FBC) including absolute neutrophil count is measured every other day from Day 7 of chemotherapy till recovery from neutropenia (&gt; 1.0 x 10^6/Liter).  FBC measurement is started earlier if subject  have evidence of marrow infiltration.</timepoint>

      <timepoint>If the blood count is normal at starting chemotherapy, full blood count (FBC) including absolute neutrophil count is measured every other day from Day 7 of chemotherapy till recovery from neutropenia (&gt; 1.0 x 10^6/Liter).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patient receiving myeloablative chemotherapy are at risk of developing febrile neutropenia (FN) which is an oncology emergency.  Most  FN are microbilogically negative but infection are mainly opportunistic infection arising from the gastrointestinal tract.  Chemotherapy leads to mucosal injury besides the marked drop in peripheral white cell count. Ciprofloxacin has been used as a selective gut decontamination to reduce the amount of gut flora. Honey has been shown to have both antimicrobial activiti as well as mucosal protectation.  Uncontrolled study also showed that honey shortened period of neutropenia.  We do not know if this is due to true accelerated marrow rejuvenation or that the level of chemotheray was depressed following drug-honey interaction.  'Madu tualang' is a local honey product which is being studied if the above research question can be answered in controlled clinical trial.</summary>
