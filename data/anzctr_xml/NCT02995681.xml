  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Balance training
Other interventions - Pulmonary rehab

Experimental: Pulmonary rehab and balance training - The intervention group will receive standard pulmonary rehab plus additional balance training.

Active Comparator: Pulmonary rehab - The control group will receive pulmonary rehab only and a pulmonary rehab home program (walking and lower extremity resistance exercises) upon discharge from pulmonary. They will also receive the same monthly phone calls and three home visits at three, six and nine months to ensure proper technique and progression.


Other interventions: Balance training
Balance exercises will include: functional lower extremity training, gait training under challenging conditions and training to increase stability during changes in body positions.

Other interventions: Pulmonary rehab
Pulmonary rehab includes: supervised exercise (aerobic exercise, resistance exercise) disease-specific education, and psychological and social support.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People living with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) have problems with their
      balance and a high incidence of falls compared to those of a similar age. Pulmonary
      rehabilitation is recommended for people with COPD, however, these training programs do not
      typically include balance training or fall prevention strategies. In this study, patients
      with COPD who report problems with their balance or have had a fall in the last two years
      will be assigned to a treatment group (balance training plus pulmonary rehabilitation) or
      control group (standard pulmonary rehabilitation). We will record the number of falls using
      monthly diaries and evaluate patient's balance, strength, confidence and quality of life.</summary>
