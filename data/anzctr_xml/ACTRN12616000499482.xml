  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible schools using an online lunch ordering service will be approached and randomised to receive an online multi-component public health nutrition intervention. The aim of the intervention is to increase the purchase of healthy food and beverage menu items from school canteens using an online lunch ordering service.The following evidence-based strategies will be employed:

1. Availability: Canteen managers will be supported to improve the relative availability of healthy items sold at their canteen. Specifically, a dietitian will classify foods and beverages sold by schools as red (low in nutritional value), amber (moderate nutritional value) or green (high nutritional value) according to NSW government school canteen policy Fresh Tastes @ School and provide a comprehensive feedback report to schools encouraging canteen managers to improve the relative availability of healthy items ('green') by increasing the availability of healthy items (green) or removing unhealthy items (red) from menus. These reports will be distributed via email to both the canteen manager and Principal at a minimum of 1 time point, immediately prior to the redesigned canteen menu being uploaded online. A brief phone call (approx.15 minutes) will be made to the canteen manager and/or Principal to discuss contents of the feedback report. 

2. Labelling: 
a. Traffic light labels - Each online menu item will be labelled with a single traffic-light label based on the Fresh Tastes @ School classification (red, amber or green).
b. Label Guide - A definition of green, amber and red foods will appear at the top of webpage, and when user hovers their mouse over each traffic light symbol 
c. Descriptions  Green menu items that require assembly of ingredients and that are commonly purchased as a main meal item (e.g. Sandwiches/Salads/ homemade hot meals) will include a hedonic description directly under the item name.

3. Placement: Healthier menu categories (i.e. fruit, sandwiches, salads) and items within categories will be will be ordered to give green items positions of greatest prominence i.e. positioned first. Where there are multiple flavours of a red or amber food, users will be required to click on the category before the full list of items are displayed. Conversely, all green items will appear in the main website interface.

4. Prompting: Healthier menu categories (i.e. sandwiches, salads, fruit) will display images and a positive purchase prompt. When users select a red or amber hot food item they will also be provided with a suite of green add-ons (water, fruit or vegetable) called meal extras.

Schools in the intervention group will be required to retain the menu design throughout the study period (for a minimum of 2 months).

Intervention Fidelity:

The research team will have access to a schools online menu in its build phase, this will minimise error in the application of intervention strategies from the online provider. The online provider will also supply the research team with monthly reports describing changes made to the menu over the preceding month. These reports will enable the research team to identify the addition of new menu items. New menu items will be labelled and positioned according to the redesign strategies. The research team will contact the provider to make the required changes. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>School canteens represent an ideal setting in which to deliver public health nutrition strategies given their wide reach, frequent use and access by children. Online lunch ordering services in school canteens represent an attractive opportunity to deliver public health interventions to improve healthy canteen purchases at scale with high fidelity. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of an online intervention in reducing the total energy, saturated fat, sodium and sugar content of online lunch purchases for primary school students. The study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design, with schools currently using an online canteen ordering system randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the intervention or control (standard online ordering only). The intervention will include the evidence based strategies shown to influence  healthy food purchasing (availability, menu labelling, placement and prompting). The intervention will be assessed through between group comparison of nutritional analysis of purchasing data automatically recorded by the online ordering system over a 2 -month period post-intervention commencement.</summary>
