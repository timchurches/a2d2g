  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aimed to compare changes in various blood and urine markers of bone metabolism and inflammation in post-menopausal women drinking magnesium bicarbonate supplemented spring water or spring water without supplements. Additionally, the following other factors were investigated for change between treatment groups and general safety
1.venous blood pH  
2.urine pH 
3.blood pressure 
4.serum lipids
5.serum biochemistry
6.haematology
7.urinalysis</summary>
