  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy for people with high risk non melanoma skin cancer.

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, have high risk non melanoma skin cancer, and will be available for a 5 year follow-up assessment. 

Trial details
Participants in this trial will receive wide local excision of their skin cancer and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).  SLNB is a procedure in which the local lymph node ("gland") that drain the patch of skin containing the tumour are excised. These lymph node(s) are examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present. If cancer cells are found, patients will undergo completion lymphadenectomy (i.e. surgical removal of the rest of the regional lymph nodes). 

This trial will evaluate the rates of positive sentinel lymph nodes in patients with high risk non melanoma skin cancer and assess morbidity or injury associated with the sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure.</summary>
