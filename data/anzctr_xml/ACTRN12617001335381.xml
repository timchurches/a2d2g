  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy volunteers aged 30-60 years will go through 6 different intervention challenges performed by oral intake of alcohol-containing beverage consumed sententiously with an oral capsule of tested product (placebo or PC lycosome formulation). 
The order in which each participant completes the challenges will be randomized.
 First three challenges will be conducted  with one-week intervals.  
After one-month rest three other challenges will be performed with the similar one week interval. 
Challenge 1. Ingestion of a placebo pill with simultaneous intake of the first dose of moderate amount of alcohol (0.5 g/kg).
Challenge 2. Ingestion of unmodified phosphatidylcholine (PC) formulation containing 450 mg of PC with a simultaneous intake of moderate amount of alcohol (0.5 g/kg).
Challenge 3. Ingestion of phosphatidylcholine lycosomes PC-L 450 mg and lycopene 7mg with simultaneous intake of moderate amount of alcohol (0.5 g/kg).
One month rest period will take place. 
Challenge 4. Ingestion of a placebo pill with simultaneous intake of the second dose of alcohol (1.0 g/kg).
Challenge 5. Ingestion of unmodified phosphatidylcholine (PC) formulation containing 450 mg of PC with a simultaneous intake of second dose of alcohol (1.0 g/kg).
Challenge 6. Ingestion of phosphatidylcholine lycosomes PC-L 450 mg and lycopene 7mg with simultaneous intake with the second dose of alcohol (1.0 g/kg).

All formulations will be taken once during iso-caloric breakfast 1 hour before moderate alcohol intake.
Adherence to the protocol will be verified by questioning the patients and laboratory tests (measurements of phosphatidylcholine and/or lycopene metabolites in blood).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute alcoholic injury liver is a substantial medical problem originating from accumulation in the blood and tissues ethanol and acetaldehyde. Even single intake of ethanol-containing beverages is accompanied by poorly reversible abnormalities of hepatic and neurological functions.   Systematic consumption of ethanol-containing drinks leads to the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis, portal hypertension, and results in higher mortality of drinkers. Besides direct toxic effect of alcohol and its metabolites on hepatocytes and other cells, there is well acknowledged  role of free radicals and  lipid peroxidation  products in alcoholic injury. Therefore, use of antioxidants, such as lycopene, , as well as use of membrane-stabilizing agents, such as phosphatidylcholine,  may have a substantial preventive impact  on acute alcoholic injury of the liver. A combined, highly bioavailable  nutraceutical formulation of lycopene and phosphatidylcholine, in which lycopene is chaperoned by phospholipid,  is in the scope of the present clinical trial which is aimed at the prevention of acute hepatic injury after single alcohol  intake.</summary>
