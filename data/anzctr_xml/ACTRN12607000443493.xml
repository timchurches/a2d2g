  <interventions>
    <interventions>Brief solution-focussed approach to reducing overweight in 5-9 year olds delivered by GPs. GPs were trained in family healthy lifestyle counselling and families were provided with a set of purpose-designed family materials. The participants were 258 families with children aged 5-9 at entry who were found to be overweight/mildly obese in a height and weight survey conducted in general practice. Families randomised to the intervention group receive four GP consultations over a three month period to discuss healthy lifestyle changes. The families randomised to the usual care group do not receive these consultations. Both groups are followed up by the research team six and twelve months after joining the project. They complete study questionnaires, are reweighed and measured, and record 7 full days of physical activity by accelerometry. Both groups were followed up again 3-4 years after joining the project, and again completed these measures.</interventions>
