  <interventions>
    <interventions>For Plasmodium falciparum:
The first 80 patients will receive Artemether-Lumefantrine (in a fixed combination of 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine in a tablet) will be administered orally in a twice daily dose for three days, as follows: One tablet to those weighing 5-14kg; two tablets to children with 15-24 kg and three tablets to children weighing 25-35 kg. Four tablets to those over 35kg. The full course of treatment for all study patients consists of 6-doses given twice daily. 

The next 80 patients will be administered dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine.  A fixed dose of 40 mg dihydroartemisinin and 320 mg piperaquine phosphate) will be administered orally as a weight per dose regimen of 2.25 and 18 mg/kg per dose of dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine phosphate. The medicine will be given a daily dose over three days. 

For plasmodium vivax: Chloroquine phosphate 150 mg base per tablet will be given a total dose of 25 mg per kg. body weight as: 10 mg per kg body weight for days 1 and 2 while 5 mg per kg body weight on day 3. 

All drug administration is supervised over the period of three days.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study end-point is the classification assigned to a patient. Valid study end-points include: treatment failure, completion of the follow-up period without treatment failure, loss to follow-up, withdrawal from study, and protocol violation. At all times, the well-being of the patient will take priority over his or her continuation in the study. 

Early treatment failure: danger signs or severe malaria on day 1, 2 or 3 in the presence of parasitaemia;parasitaemia on day 2 higher than on day 0, irrespective of axillary temperature; 	parasitaemia on day 3 with axillary temperature equal to 37.5 degrees celsius; parasitaemia on day 3 equals 25percent of count on day 0.
Late treatment failure:
1 Late clinical failure - danger signs or severe malaria in the presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 4 and day 28 (day 42) in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure; or presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 4 and day 28 with axillary temperature  equal to or great than 37.5 degrees celsius ( or history of fever) in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure

Late parasitological failure - presence of parasitaemia on any day between day 7 and day 28 with axillary temperature great than 37.5 degrees celsius in in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure or late clinical failure

Adequate clinical and parasitological response - absence of parasitaemia on day 28, irrespective of axillary temperature, in patients who did not previously meet any of the criteria of early treatment failure, late clinical failure or late parasitological failure
</outcome>
      <timepoint>A standard physical examination will be performed at baseline (day 0 before dosing) and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days. A complete medical history, demographic information and contact details will be taken at baseline.</timepoint>
