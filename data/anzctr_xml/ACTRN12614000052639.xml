  <interventions>
    <interventions>Medical, nursing and allied health interventions will not change from those routinely provided. If a patient satisfies certain screening criteria, the physiotherapist will assess the patient as per usual practice, including the patients ability to follow commands and trunk/limb strength, and decide on the appropriate type of mobility intervention.  The type of mobility intervention will be progressed over time, as per the patients condition and tolerance, from progressively upright positions in bed, bed exercises, sitting on the edge of the bed, sitting balance, functional exercises in sitting, standing, standing balance exercises, marching on the spot, sitting out of bed and walking.  These mobilisation activities may involve the use of equipment (e.g. lifting machines, appropriate seating). Mobility interventions will commence once the patient is deemed medically stable and will continue for the duration of their in-patient stay. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of mobilisation.
The feasibility of early mobilisation will be documented by recording the following parameters: 
* Number of physiotherapy sessions where the criteria to participate in mobilisation are met.
* Number of physiotherapy sessions where the criteria to participate in mobilisation are not met (and reasons why).
* Type of mobilisation undertaken.
* Days from admission to mobility milestones (e.g. sit out of bed, stand, walk).
* Ward location on each occasion of mobilisation (e.g. Intensive Care Unit, High Dependency Unit or neurosurgical ward).
* Ventilatory status (i.e. mechanically ventilated or not).

      <timepoint>Duration of acute hospital stay.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of mobilisation.
The safety of mobilisation will be documented by recording the following parameters:
* Deterioration in conscious state and/or
* Increase in intracranial pressure or vasospasm requiring active treatment and/or
* Excessive increase or decrease in blood pressure or heart rate accompanied by signs of cardiovascular stress and/or
* Increasing ectopic beats, arrhythmia or signs and symptoms of myocardial ischaemia and/or
* 4% or greater decrease in percutaneous oxygen saturation, respiratory pattern unacceptable, signs of respiratory distress and/or
* Patient appears distressed and/or
* Inadvertent removal of attachment(s) and/or
* Fall.
Any intervention(s) required in the management of these adverse events will also be recorded.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study involves a prospective, single-group, observational design.  No aspect of usual clinical care (i.e. medical, nursing, physiotherapy or other allied health) will be altered.  Instead, the study involves documenting the feasibility and safety of our usual practice with respect to early progressive mobilisation of patients with non-traumatic acute subarachnoid haemorrhage or subdural haemorrhage.</summary>
