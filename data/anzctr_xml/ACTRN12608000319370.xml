  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a one-year extension study to investigate the long-term safety, tolerability and efficacy of open label flupirtine for the treatment of painful HIV-SN in patients who have pain inadequately controlled by opioids. 

The study will consist of a Dose Optimisation Stage (Stage 1) and a second Dose Maintenance Stage (Stage 2). 

The Dose Optimisation Stage of the study consists of a variable number of 2-week study periods during which the dose of flupirtine will be optimised for each study subject individually in response to feedback regarding pain, side effects and Quality of Life (QoL) during study visits. Minor adjustments to opioid dose may also occur if pain control is maintained and side effects experienced by the study subjects suggest opioid excess. 

Study subjects will begin the Dose Optimisation Stage with the introduction of 200-300mg/day flupirtine (2 - 3 capsules) to be taken orally along with their regular opioid medication. The dose of flupirtine and opioid medication may be adjusted fortnightly by the Principle Investigator using patient feedback, pain and QoL scores.

Dose optimisation will continue fortnightly until:
1.the study subject experiences effective pain relief  at a flupirtine dose that does not produce side effects that in the opinion of the patient are unacceptable
2.the study subject has reached the maximum flupirtine dose of 600mg. 
3.the patient does not wish to continue
4.it is the opinion of the Principle Investigator that dose optimisation should not continue. 

it is anticipated that Dose Optimisation stage of the trial will last approximately  2 - 3 months. At the conclusion of the Dose Optimisation Stage the Principle Investigator shall, in consultation with the study subject and using pain scores, reported side effects and QoL responses as a guide, choose the best dose of flupirtine (to be taken in combination with opioids ) for the study subject. The study subject may remain on this dose combination during the Dose Maintenance Phase and the remainder of the extension study. 

During the Dose Maintenance Stage of the study, subjects will be required to attend the study site monthly for assessment and dispensing of flupirtine. Drug doses may be re-optimised by the Principle Investigator (according to study subject feedback as per the Dose Optimisation Stage) during the Dose Maintenance Stage. It is anticipated that the Dose Maintenance Stage of the trial will last 9 - 10 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Painful HIV-SN is a neurological complication of HIV infection that can result from either the HIV disease process itself and/or from the use of some of the anti-retroviral medications that are used to treat HIV. There has been considerable research into the treatment of painful HIV-SN neuropathy. However, treatment with currently available pain killing medications rarely renders the patient pain free and the use of medications may be limited by side effects.

This current research project is only being offered to the participants who have taken part in the previous research project entitled  A placebo controlled multiple dose research project of Flupirtine for the treatment of painful HIV-SN. 

The previous study has the protocol number CNSBio 01/07.  CNSBio 01/07 is investigating the short-term (one week) effectiveness and safety of the pain killing medication Flupirtine when taken in combination with opioids for the treatment of painful HIV-SN. CNSBio 01/07 is not yet completed and the results of this clinical trial are not yet available. 

The purpose of this research project is to investigate further if the drug Flupirtine is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-SN when taken in combination with opioids for longer than a week (up to one year). 

Flupirtine is an experimental treatment. This means that currently the drug is not an approved treatment for painful HIV-SN in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or in Australia by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). It is however approved for the treatment of back pain, muscle stiffness and pain associated with surgery and arthritis in Germany, Russia, Portugal, China and Brazil. CNSBio Pty Ltd is sponsoring the current research project with the aim of developing Flupirtine for the treatment of painful HIV-SN in Australia and America if flupirtine proves to be safe and effective in this context.</summary>
