    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this study is limited by the number of patients who decline or attend less than three sessions of PR, and in turn who are likely to then enrol in the SYLO group. In the 2014/5 audit of PR at CCDHB, 323 patients were referred to the pulmonary rehabilitation programme at Wellington, Kenepuru and Kapiti hospitals. Sixty-seven patients (20%) declined, and forty-four (25%) attended less than 4 sessions. We estimate it is likely that about 30 patients will agree to attend the SYLO intervention. The comparator group of patients attending S-PR is anticipated to be between 250 and 300 patients. The primary outcome variable for this study will be HADS score for which the minimally clinical important difference (MCID) is 1.5 points and standard deviation in our feasibility study was 2.3 points. (35) 

The nominated sample size of 30 in SYLO and 250 in S-PR has over 90% power to detect the MCID for the HADS.

Simple data descriptions and plots will be used to characterise the participants. We will compare continuous outcome variables using t tests, sensitivity analyses by ANCOVA, and count variables using Poisson regression.</statisticalmethods>
