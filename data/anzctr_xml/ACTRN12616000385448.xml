  <interventions>
    <interventions>2ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was injected intrathecally in 10 seconds without barbotage as a single dose from L4-L5 interspace of spinal cord by an anesthesiologist. The dose administered was controlled by the study staff as a standard dose of 2ml according to study protocol. Surgery started when the level of spinal anesthesia reached T6 dermatome</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The effect of hip/shoulder size ratio on the spread of spinal anesthesia is detected by loss of pinprick discrimination at 5,10,20 and 30 minutes after administration of spinal anesthesia. The hip size was measured between the two iliac crests and the shoulder size between the two acromion processes of the patients by a tape measure at sitting position on a horizontal operating table. The hip/shoulder size ratio is the division of the two measures of the patient. The spinal anesthesia is assessed by pinprick discrimination starting from the anesthesized region upwards cranially at midaxillary line till the feeling changed from dullness to sharp pain.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relation between the vertebral column length ( the measurements of vertebral column length was measured between the process of C7 vertebra to sacral hiatus and the distance from prominence of C7 vertebra to iliac crest by a tape measure) and the spread of spinal anesthesia (the spread of spinal anesthesia is assessed by pinprick discrimination starting from the anesthesized region upwords cranially at midaxillary line till the feeling changed from dullness to sharp pain) is assessed by correlation tests (Pearson and Spearman).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>sample size was determined by G*power statistical analysis program based on preliminary results of the study. A sample size 0f 72 was calculated to provide a %90 confidence interval. Kolmogorov  Smirnow and Shapiro  Wilk tests, repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman test, Tukey HSD, Spermans Rho Correlation Test, multiple regression analysis test But we determined the sample size to be 75 to overcome the possible dropdown patients</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>     There are more than twenty factors in the literature defined to effect the spinal anesthesia spread. In patients with a larger hip size and a narrow shoulder size, more cephalad spread of spinal anesthesia induced with a fixed amount of hyperbaric bupivacaine is observed.  We hypothesized that the increase in cephalad spread is strongly correlated with the increased hip/shoulder size ratio.
       Age, weight, height, body mass index, hip size, shoulder size, hip/shoulder size ratio, vertebral column length were recorded for 75 term parturient. The L4-L5 interspace was entered and 2ml 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine was given intrathecal in 10 seconds without barbotage. Pearson Correlation Test was performed for the correlation between age, height, weight, body mass index, hip/shoulder size ratio, and vertebral column length</summary>
