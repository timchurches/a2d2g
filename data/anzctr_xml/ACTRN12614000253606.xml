    <studytitle>CORD CLAMPING STUDY: Early versus delayed cord clamping and its effects on infant heart rate and oxygen saturation in the first minutes after birth.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In newly born infants, greater or equal to 32 weeks gestation, does early cord clamping  &lt; 60s after birth versus delaying cord clamping (90 to 180s) after birth, or after breathing has established, result in less bradycardia (Heart rate (HR) &lt;100 bpm), when HR is measured 90s after birth?</scientifictitle>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Before birth (prior to second stage of labour or first incision at a caesarean section) study infants will be randomised  to a treatment group according to location ( operating theatres or birthing room)  and gestational age strata (32+0 to 36+6 and &gt;= 37+0 weeksâ€™ gestation). The sequence of randomisation concealment has been generated independently and assignment concealed in consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Block randomisation will be used with random block sizes.
Randomisation will be blocked in 3 randomly allocated block sizes to ensure concealment of allocation.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Three intervention groups</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Data Analysis:The difference in mean heart rate between assigned groups and within assigned groups at 90s after birth will be tested with analysis of variance  (ANOVA). If the heart rate data is not normally distributed the non-parametric equivalent of one-way ANOVA, the Kruskal-Wallis test will be used.
Sample size:In one of our previous studies 50 % of study infants had a HR &lt;100 bpm at 90 s. To reduce the proportion of HR &lt;100 bpm to 35%, with 80% power, alpha &lt;0.05, requires 227 in each of the groups. A total of 681 infants is required. To account for post randomisation exclusions (for example an obstetric emergency or the need for neonatal resuscitation), an additional 10% will be enrolled. Thus, we will recruit 749 infants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The active management of the third stage of labour involves clamping and cutting the umbilical cord and application of controlled cord traction after adminstration of syntometrine,  to deliver the placenta. The optimal timing of cord clamping is unknown and practice varies amongst professionals globally. Many healthy newly born infants experience bradycardia (heart rate less than 100 beats per minute) in the first few minutes. The timing of clamping the umbilical cord may influence the proportion of babies experiencing bradycardia. 
The aims of this randomised controlled study are
1. To determine if delaying clamping of the cord reduces bradycardia in the first minutes after birth in near term and term infants
2. To determine if delaying clamping of the cord has an effect on the need for delivery room resuscitation
3. To determine if there is a difference in heart rate and oxygen saturation centiles in the first 10 mins after birth in three groups of infants 
(i) born after early (&lt; 60s after birth) cord clamping compared to (ii) infants born after delayed (90-180 s after birth) cord clamping or (iii) when the umbilical cord is clamped following the onset of regular respirations (10 s after accoucher determines onset of regular respirations) by the infant.
