  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - Serious adverse events (SAEs) assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From Month 0 to Month 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Any and Grade 3 Solicited Local Symptoms - Assessed solicited local symptoms were pain, redness and swelling. Any = occurrence of any local symptom regardless of intensity grade. Grade 3 pain = pain that prevented normal activities. Grade 3 redness/swelling = greater than (&gt;) 30mm diameter and persisting more than 24 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 7 days (Days 0-6) after each and any vaccination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Solicited General Symptoms - Assessed solicited general symptoms were arthralgia, fatigue, headache, malaise, rash, temperature [defined as oral temperature equal to or above (=) 37.5 degrees Celsius (°C)] and urticaria. Any = occurrence of any general symptom regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 arthralgia, fatigue, headache, malaise, rash = general symptom that prevented normal activity. Grade 3 temperature = greater than 39 degrees Celsius (°C). Grade 3 urticaria = urticaria distributed on at least 4 body areas. Related = general symptom assessed by the investigator as causally related to the study vaccination.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 7 days (Days 0-6) after each and any vaccination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Subjects With Any, Grade 3 and Related Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) - An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any was defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited AE regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination. Grade 3 = event which prevented normal, everyday activities. In adults/ adolescents, such an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work/ school and would necessitate the administration of corrective therapy. Related = event assessed by the investigator as causally related to study vaccination.</outcome>
