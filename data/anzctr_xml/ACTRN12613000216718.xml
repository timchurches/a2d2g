  <interventions>
    <interventions>R&amp;R2 is a manualised cognitive-behavioral intervention developed for antisocial youths and adults with mental health problems.  It consists of 16, 90-minute, sessions which run on a weekly basis. It is a revised version of the original 36-session R&amp;R programme and aims to reduce anti-social behavior and attitudes and improve pro-social thinking, cognitive and problem-solving skills. The programme employs a variety of methods to engage individuals such as individual group exercises, audiovisual material and workbooks which include homework assignments.  The programme consists of 5 treatment modules: (1) a neuro-cognitive model which introduces techniques to increase attentional control, impulse control, memory and constructive planning; (2) a problem-solving module which encourages problem identification, generation of multiple alternative solutions and consequential thinking; (3) an emotional control module which involves management of anxiety, anger and conflict; (4) a social skills module which aims to increase awareness of the thoughts and feelings of others; and (5) a critical reasoning module which aims to develop skills in the assessment and evaluation of information.  The R&amp;R2 programme combines group and individual treatment.  Individual treatment incorporates the use of a mentoring paradigm, whereby a mentor provides coaching sessions outside of group sessions.  Their purpose is to facilitate the transfer of skills learned in group sessions into daily activities. Mentors are provided with written guidance on how to structure individual sessions.  R&amp;R2 facilitators are provided with training in how to deliver the programme.  Programme integrity and consistency is ensured through (1) regular steering committee meetings; (2) random observations of group sessions by one of the programme authors; and (3) group supervision meetings of facilitators to prepare for sessions, process and discuss sessions that had been delivered and (4) regular meetings and supervision between program facilitators and mentors.  Furthermore, R&amp;R2 maximises programme integrity by fostering consistency through its structured, manualised design.  Assessments are made at baseline and 16 weeks later at the end of treatment phase.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waiting list control group who continue their treatment as usual (both pharmacological and nonpharmacological).  Other treatments are not controlled for.  Control group is not asked to refrain from engaging in other interventions during the study period but they are not permitted to attend the R&amp;R2 programme during the study period.  They are assessed at baseline and 16 weeks later at the end of treatment phase.  They are offered the intervention thereafter.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The growing popularity of cognitive skills offending behaviour programmes (OBPs), developed for use in the prison service, has led to an interest in whether such programmes are feasible and effective for mentally disordered offenders (MDOs).  In particular, poor programme retention has been associated with high risk MDOs.  This study aims to investigate effectiveness of an OBP (the R&amp;R2 cognitive behavioural group programme) that has been adapted for use with MDOs when delivered to high risk patients detained in a high secure hospital setting.  As an OBP that has been developed to be more responsive to the needs of MDOs it is hypothesised that the programme is feasible to run, determined by low patient drop out of treatment.  It is further hypothesised that compared with controls, group participants will show significant improvements in violent attitudes, anger, coping processess, social problem solving, and ward behaviour.</summary>
