  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dry-needling, advice and exercise:

Participants receive a copy of the educational booklet Whiplash injury recovery: a self management guide published by the Motor Accident Insurance Commision, Queensland (MAIC).  This booklet will be issued on completion of the initial assessment session at the Whiplash Laboratory and inclusion in the trial. 

The intervention is a 6 week programme which includes 6 x 30 minute treatments of dry-needling and exercise delivered in the first 3 weeks, followed by 4 exercise only sessions in the following 3 weeks.

Dry needling involves tapping a very fine filament needle into senstive muscle areas identified by the physiotherapist.  The muscles that mat be treated include the posterior muscles of the neck and shoulder girdle region.

The exercise component will comprise of specific exercises to improve range of neck movement, muscle control of the neck flexors and extensors and postural control of the neck and shoulder girdles. All exercises will be low load and sub-maximal in nature and are designed to be pain-free.  Participants will attend the physiotherpist for education of this exercise programme and they are encouraged to carry-out their home exercise programme 2-3 x a day, each session lasting 10 minutes.  The postural corrections and similar components of the programme should be incorporated in the participants' every day activities.  The participant is encouraged to continue their exercise programme and self manage on completion of the 6 week programme.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham dry-needling, advice and exercise:

Participants receive a copy of the educational booklet Whiplash injury recovery: a self management guide published by MAIC.  This booklet will be issued on completion of the initial assessment session at the Whiplash Laboratory and inclusion in the trial. 

The intervention is a 6 week programme which includes 6 x 30 minute treatments of sham dry-needling and exercise delivered in the first 3 weeks, followed by 4 exercise only sessions in the following 3 weeks.

Sham dry-needling uses a blunt needle that does not penetrate the skin. The procedure for identifying sensitive muscle areas of the neck and shoulder girdles will the same as for the intervention.

The exercise component is identical to the exercise programme delivered to the dry-needling programme.  The exercise component will comprise of specific exercises to improve range of neck movement, muscle control of the neck flexors and extensors and postural control of the neck and shoulder girdles. All exercises will be low load and sub-maximal in nature and are designed to be pain-free.  Participants will attend the physiotherpist for education of this exercise programme and they are encouraged to carry-out their home exercise programme 2-3 x a day, each session lasting 10 minutes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some people with chronic whiplash have increased sensitivity to various stimuli such as pressure and cold. These people dont respond as well to standard exercise based approaches to treatment. Dry-needling techniques have been shown to decrease the sensitivity in other conditions, but the effects for people with whiplash it not known. Dry needling is one of many techniques used by physiotherapists. It involves tapping a very fine needle into the tender muscle areas and it is similar to acupuncture.

This study aims to find out whether or not dry-needling added to a standard exercise program will decrease pain and disability in people with chronic whiplash. We also need to know whether or not the effects are better than those of sham dry-needling and exercise.

It is hypothesised that dry needling will decrease pain and hypersensitivity associated with chronic whiplash and thus facilitate the effects of the exercise program.</summary>
