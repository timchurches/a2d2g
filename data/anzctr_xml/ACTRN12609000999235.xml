    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All surgical inpatients recruited to the study will be asked to complete a screening tool. Patients identified by the screening tool with one of more problems (needs) will be randomly allocated to either receive assistance from the HEALTH multidisciplinary team or continue with usual care.  Before the start of the study, a list of study numbers and treatment allocations  (control or HEALTH team intervention) will be prepared. The allocation for each study number will then be printed and sealed in an opaque envelope.  Once a subject has been identified as eligible for the study, and has provided written consent to take part, they will be allocated the next available study number.  The envelope belonging to their study number will then be opened and they will be allocated to the stated treatment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocations will be assigned from computer generated random numbers using a permuted random blocking strategy in order to accumulate subjects to the two treatments at a similar rate.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Fremantle Pain Medicine Unit has been introducing education for people with persistent (ongoing) pain, and many of these techniques/strategies can be useful for people with other health conditions. 

The aim of the project is to up-skill inpatients in the use of active self-management strategies through early identification and early intervention by HEALTH teams [Hospital Education, Activities and Living to Take Home]. This process will commence whilst patients with complex or chronic conditions are inpatients, thereby providing benefits for patients and   for the health care system. 

This randomised controlled trial will measure the impact of a screening tool to enable early inpatient self-management training with the primary outcome to reduce surgical inpatient length of stay and cost of the inpatient stay. It is also expected to generate an improvement in patient outcomes beyond the hospital episode by matching of patients problems with appropriate resources.</summary>
