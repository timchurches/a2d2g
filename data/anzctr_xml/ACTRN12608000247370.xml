    <concealment>Participants from renal units are approached to participate in the study. A full informed consent process of four weeks was performed before subjects give written consent to participate in the study. The person consenting the patient is not aware of the group the patient will be allocated to. The allocation is performed off-site by a third party using a randomly generated sequence created by a computer software.</concealment>
