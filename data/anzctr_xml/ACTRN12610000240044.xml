  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will consist of a reminiscence activity (lasting approximately 20 minutes in a single session). In the face-to-face session, participants are asked by a psychologist several questions that prompt memories of situations in which they were successful at solving problems or overcoming obstacles. These questions are designed to prime the participant to remember mastery related experiences.</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>To be eligible for the study, participants must (a) be at least 60 years (b) report high levels of hopeleness (as indicated by a score of 2 or more on item 2 of the Beck Depression Inventory II), (c) demonstrate adequate cognitive functioning (as  indicated by a score of 23 or more on the Mini Mental Status Examination).</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Referrals will be sought from health professionals, aged care facilities and public notices. Individuals interested in participating will be invited to to speak to their health professional or researchers.
Potential participants will be screened for study eligibility. Eligible participants will be consented. Allocation codes will be concealed from researchers who are responsible for enrolling the participants or administering study procedures. Codes will be sealed in opaque enveloped and revealed after enrollment and pre-treatment procedurs.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two conditions using an unrestricted method of randomization. Simple randomisation is accomplished by using a randomisation table created by a computer software (i.e., computerised sequence generation).</sequence>
