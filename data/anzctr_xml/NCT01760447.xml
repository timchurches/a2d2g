    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sitagliptin + Metformin XR FDC
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to Sitagliptin + Metformin XR
Treatment: drugs - Metformin XR
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to metformin XR
Treatment: drugs - Insulin glargine
Other interventions - Background insulin

Experimental: Sitagliptin + Metformin XR FDC - Phase A: two sitagliptin + extended-release (XR) metformin fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets (MK-0431A XR) orally daily (total daily dose: 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg metformin XR) plus two placebo to metformin XR tablets plus/minus background insulin for 20 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated as glycemic rescue therapy during Phase A of the study. Phase B: two sitagliptin + metformin XR FDC tablets orally daily (total daily dose: 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg metformin XR) plus two placebo to metformin XR tablets plus/minus background insulin for 34 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated during Phase B of the study depending on the participants' glucose and A1C levels.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo to Sitagliptin + Metformin XR FDC - Phase A: two placebo to sitagliptin + metformin XR FDC tablets orally daily plus two metformin XR tablets (total daily dose: 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg) plus/minus background insulin for 20 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated as glycemic rescue therapy during Phase A of the study. Phase B: two placebo to sitagliptin + metformin XR FDC tablets orally daily plus two metformin XR tablets (total daily dose: 1000, 1500 or 2000 mg) plus/minus background insulin for 34 weeks. Insulin glargine may be administered, or background insulin may be up-titrated during Phase B of the study depending on the participants' glucose and A1C levels.


Treatment: drugs: Sitagliptin + Metformin XR FDC
Sitagliptin + Metformin XR fixed-dose combination tablet (sitagliptin/metformin: 50/500 mg, 50/1000 mg) administered with a meal, preferably in the evening

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to Sitagliptin + Metformin XR
Matching placebo to Sitagliptin + Metformin XR fixed-dose combination tablet administered with a meal, preferably in the evening

Treatment: drugs: Metformin XR
Metformin XR tablet (500 mg, 1000 mg) administered with a meal, preferably in the evening

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to metformin XR
Matching placebo to metformin XR tablet administered with a meal, preferably in the evening

Treatment: drugs: Insulin glargine
The insulin regimen and dosing will be at the discretion of the investigator (based on locally accepted, national, or international guidelines for the indication and use of insulin glargine). When thresholds for rescue are met, participants who are not on background insulin will initiate insulin glargine.

Other interventions: Background insulin
Participants who enter the study on background insulin will continue on the same dose and formulation of insulin throughout the study. When thresholds for rescue are met, participants who have entered the study on background insulin will uptitrate their background insulin dose.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of sitagliptin
      (administered as MK-0431A XR) compared with the addition of placebo to therapy with
      extended-release metformin (metformin XR) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) in pediatric participants with inadequate glycemic control on metformin therapy (alone
      or in combination with insulin). The primary hypothesis is that the addition of sitagliptin
      reduces hemoglobin A1c (A1C) more than the addition of placebo after 20 weeks of treatment.</summary>
