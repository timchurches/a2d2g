  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying tacrolimus, methotrexate, and sirolimus to see
      how well they work compared to tacrolimus and methotrexate in preventing graft-versus-host
      disease in young patients who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant for intermediate-risk
      or high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second complete remission and high risk acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. Giving chemotherapy, such as thiotepa and
      cyclophosphamide, and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop
      the growth of cancer cells. It also helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help
      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted
      cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving
      tacrolimus, methotrexate, and sirolimus after the transplant may stop this from happening. It
      is not yet known whether tacrolimus and methotrexate are more effective with or without
      sirolimus in preventing graft-versus-host disease.</summary>
