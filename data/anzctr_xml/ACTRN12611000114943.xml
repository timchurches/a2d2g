    <interventions>A Psychological Wellbeing practitioner will work with participants to develop a personalised intervention plan.  Participants will receive a 15 minute telephone or skype consultation or email support with the practitioner each week for 8 weeks to help the participant problem solve any issues that arise and reinforce motivation to continue with the intervention.  The intervention will use cognitive behavioural strategies.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of implementing low intensity interventions within a university health service.

The objectives are to:
1.	Increase the identification and early intervention of students who are experiencing high levels of distress.
2.	Evaluate the effectiveness of low intensity intervention on student wellbeing (vs. screening and treatment information alone);
3.	Evaluate uptake, retention, and perceived relevance and utility of LI-CBTs within a health service context.</summary>
