    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Changes of heart failure medications

Experimental: Daily BNP - Subjects will be asked to test their BNP at home every day for a period of 180 days using the AlereTM HeartCheck System (the Test System). In addition to BNP, weights and signs and symptoms of HF will be collected each day of testing. The HeartCheck data is transmitted via a secure wireless protocol to the HealthCOM health monitoring portal where it is available to the medical staff. The subject's's physician and medical staff will be required to evaluate the data and determine if a change in HF treatment is advisable. All changes of heart failure medications are at the discretion of the treating physician and medical staff of the institution.


Treatment: drugs: Changes of heart failure medications
Changes in dosage of existing medications or introduction of new medications to improve heart failure condition.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in BNP - After a short lead-in period, an algorithm (similar in concept to a moving average) will be applied to the BNP data resulting in a BNP-based parameter. The primary endpoint of the study is a significant lowering of BNP across the population, such that values for the population are reduced to levels below a predetermined threshold and kept below the threshold for the duration of subsequent testing and observation.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>HABIT-II is a feasibility study aimed at home monitoring of patients with heart failure.
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has strong correlations to the severity of heart failure.
      Lower BNP levels are closely associated with better clinical outcomes. The goal of HABIT-II
      is to demonstrate that the results of daily patient self-testing of BNP at home will provide
      sufficient information to guide physicians to modify therapy and lower BNP levels over time.</summary>
