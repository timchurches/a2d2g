    <interventions>Observation of Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) and State Entropy (SE, validated depth of anaesthesia monitor) 5 minutes prior to emergence from anaesthesia. Recording of postoperative pain, measured 5-minutely on an age-appropriate 0-10 pain scale for 15 minutes after recovery room admission. 

All patients will receive a routine general anaesthesia with sevoflurane based maintenance/with a laryngeal mask airway or an endotracheal tube at discretion of treating anaesthetist. All patients receive standard anaesthesia monitoring with addition of depth of anaesthesia monitoring with SE. 
Clinical care will not deviate from routine practice (only children in whom an anaesthetic with sevoflurane/opioid +/- local/regional block is planned will be included, keeping MAC range between 0.8-1.3, see criteria below) for this study anaesthetic/analgesic drugs may be administered at any time during the study period (excluded medications, see below). If any of the excluded medications has to be administered, the patient will be withdrawn from the study protocol.

During the anticipated last 5 minutes of the surgery (last 5 minutes prior to anticipated lightening of depth of anaesthesia to state entropy more than 60, period of only mild surgical stimulation [i.e. skin closure, application of plaster or wound dressing]), data (blood pressure, heart rate, SE, SPI) are downloaded from the anaesthesia monitors (standard anaesthesia monitor at PMH plus portable anaesthesia monitor to collect data of SPI and SE) by means of a data collection software (S5 collect, GE Healthcare) and stored on a laptop PC. After the 5-minute period, it is anticipated that the attending anaesthetist will allow state entropy rated depth of anaesthesia to become lighter (= &gt; 60) and that the patient will finally wake up from the anaesthetic. The latter may take place in the theatre or the recovery room). No influence will be made on the speed or method of patient arousal/extubation.

In the recovery room, as per routine clinical practice, a patients pain will be rated on a 0-10 pain scale every 5 minutes for 15 minutes (time counting from first time point a patient is deemed conscious and non-delirious. Pain will be assessed as usual at PMH via age-appropriate pain scales: Pain in the group 2-3 yrs. will be assessed using the FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability) score, in group 4-8 yrs. by the Revised Faces Pain Scale (FPS-R) and in group 9-16 yrs. by means of a Numeric Rating Scale (0 representing no pain and 10 the worst possible pain).

Treatment of pain will not be influenced by the protocol.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Definition of the optimum (highest combined sensitivity and specificity) cut-off value for Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) to distinguish between no to mild versus moderate to severe postoperative pain in children.
Pain will be measured using numerical rating scale (NRS; 0-10) for children aged 9-16, FPS-R for children aged 4-8 and FLACC for children aged 2-3. 
Cut-off for pain scales are as follows:
No to mild = 0-4 and moderate to severe = 5-10 for NRS
No to mild = 0-4 and moderate to severe = 6-10 for FPS-R
No to mild = 0-4 and moderate to severe = 5-10  for FLACC

    <statisticalmethods>105 patients will be enrolled over the 3 age groups (35 per group, grouped according to different pain scales used: 2 to 3 years, 4 to 8 years and 9 to 16 years.) as the sympatho-vagal balance in children is known to change with age. The proposal is essentially an accumulation of 3 pilot studies involving 30 patients in each project. 
As the distribution of SPI values at the end of surgery in children is unknown, we aim to include data from the maximum number of patients per group (n=30) we can justifiably include in a pilot investigation. As in a previous study in adults 4 7 % of patients data could finally not be analysed due to technical problems, cancellations or protocol violations, and as we assume a slightly higher rate of such problems in children (based on previous experience at PMH), we ask to include 35 children per group in order to allow for a loss of up to approx. 15% of data. 
While we can learn from the adult study with regards to the general study design and the timing of the measurements, we cannot use the adult data to extrapolate down to children since the sympatho-vagal balance is known to change with age. 
A study population of n=30 per age group (90 in total) is a generally accepted number for pilot studies for monitoring devices for nociception to see if a clinically significant signal can be detected. 
The Ledowski study (Ledowski T, Burke J, Hruby J. Surgical Pleth Index: prediction of postoperative pain and the influence of arousal. BJA 2016 in press) included data from 65 adult patients. Receiver-operating curve analysis showed as an optimum intra-operative cut-off SPI value of 30 to discriminate between NRS for pain (0-10)  0-3 vs. 6-10. For this value, the negative and positive predictive values (NPV/PPV) to discriminate between NRS scores 0-3 vs. 4-10 were 50% and 89.7%, respectively. SPI was significantly affected by arousal and SPI scores obtained during this phase were not predictive of postoperative pain.  

Analysis of data will be made after checking all data for normal distribution (K-S test). Depending on the outcome, data found normally distributed will be displayed as mean (SD) vs. non-normally distributed data which will be displayed as median (25th/75th percentiles). For analysis of SPI, blood pressure and heart rate the mean or median (as appropriate) of the values collected over the 5 minute observation period will be used for further calculations. To investigate the correlation between SPI and pain scores, both the highest of the 3 pain scores as well as the mean/median will be used (using either Spearmans or Pearsons correlation coefficients, as appropriate). In order to dichotomize the recorded pain scores (both mean/median and highest of scores used), a rating of 0-3 will be used to reflect no or mild vs. scores from 4-10 moderate-severe pain. The calculation of receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) will allow us to investigate the sensitivity as well as specificity of different SPI scores for the prediction of moderate-severe pain. The SPI with the highest combined sensitivity and specificity will be used as cut-off value and for further analysis (positive and negative predictive value). Though principally any positive predictive value (PPV) of SPI for moderate-severe postoperative pain may be useful, we consider a PPV &gt; 75% to be of clinical relevance.
For the definition of statistical significance, an alpha error of 5% and a beta error of 20% are set.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, validated depth of anaesthesia and depth of muscle relaxation monitors are available and routinely used in anaesthesia care. However, depth of analgesia has not been specifically monitored and anaesthetists tend to rely on clinical signs (i.e. blood pressure or heart rate) in order to estimate the need for intraoperative analgesics (i.e. opioids). However, the latter may be unreliable and hence a monitor for analgesia is highly desirable. Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) is a score (0-100), which is calculated from the beat-to-beat interval of the heart rate and also the peripheral pulse wave amplitude. Essentially, this data is utilized to reflect the cardiac and peripheral sympathetic tone of a patient  the latter is assumed to correlate with the depth of analgesia. The acquisition of this raw data is achieved via the standard peripheral oxygen saturation sensor and the latter is then computed into the normalized score. SPI requires no change of anaesthesia technique nor any extra monitors or consumables. Its merely a software patch for GE monitoring systems. Though SPI has been demonstrated to reflect intraoperative stimuli (i.e. knife to skin incision), it cannot be used in awake patients as then the score is subjected to too many artefacts (e.g., arousal is a strong sympathetic stimulant). However, a recent study by Ledowski et al. at Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia has shown a high positive predictive value for SPI more than 30 monitored just before patient arousal to indicate moderate-severe postoperative pain. Though this is promising, no study has yet investigated this matter in children. This observational trial proposes to prospectively investigate the association of SPI with postoperative pain in the recovery room in children from 2 to 16 years.

Hypothesis: SPI during the last minutes of surgery may be predictive of moderate-severe acute postoperative pain on recovery room admission.
