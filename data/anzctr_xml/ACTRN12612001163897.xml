  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electrical Stimulation (ES) Cycling

A 30 min incremental progressive, individualised ES cycling program performed five times a week for four weeks as well as usual care. ES Cycling involves applying a small electrical current through pads attached to the skin over 4 muscle groups on the affected leg. This will be applied from 10-15 minutes initially increasing to 30 minutes 5 times weekly over a 4 week period. The parameters will be individualized and adjusted according to the participants' comfort levels. It will take approximately 10 minutes to set up a participant on the ES cycle however once set up the therapist will be able to provide one-to-one assistance to other people whilst supervising participants. This will allow more people to receive supervised exercise simultaneously.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive usual physiotherapy care only. Usual care will consist of a daily one-hour strength, endurance, fitness, balance, dexterity and activities of daily living (ADL) re-training session administered by a Physiotherapist for 4 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary objective: 
To determine whether four weeks of ES cycling in addition to usual care results in greater improvements in quadriceps strength and walking ability in people with an acquired brain injury compared to usual physiotherapy alone. 

Secondary objective:
To determine whether four weeks of ES cycling in addition to usual care improves global lower limb strength and reduces spasticity in people with an acquired brain injury compared to usual physiotherapy alone.

The null hypothesis is that application of ES cycling in addition to usual physiotherapy will not improve peoples lower limb strength and walking ability more than usual physiotherapy alone.</summary>
