    <interventions>Health Coaching Intervention and Standard Medical Care. 
A health coaching program will be delivered across a 6 month period and will consist of 8 sessions delivered over the telephone of 30 - 45 minute duration (baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 26, week 32, week 36). Written educational material will be posted to all participants in the intervention group. 

The health coaching program is designed to:
1. offer verbal and written access to evidence- based information about the menopausal transition and its management

2. offer quality information and building of skills and capacity to manage bothersome issues identified 

3. promote changes to hazardous lifestyle practices associated with increased risk of depression and poor health outcomes

4. offer education about mental health, with a particular focus on depression

5. optimise the management of chronic medical conditions

6.  promote monitoring and active surveillance of depressive symptoms.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: We expect that 14% of participants in the control group will develop a depressive episode over 12 months compared with 6% of people in the health coaching group (absolute risk reduction of 8%, 95%CI 0.8%,15.2%). The expected number of people needed to treat to prevent one person developing depression is 12.5. The expected prevalence was derived from population based studies showing that the prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of depression during the menopausal transition is about 14% compared with about 6% during other times. A sample size of 300 women (1:1 allocation) will give the study 80% power to declare such a difference as statistically significant (alpha 5%). These numbers take into account loss of 40 women during follow up.

We will use means and standard deviations to describe continuous variables with normal distribution, medians and inter-quartile ranges for ranked variables and frequency tables for categorical variables.  We will evaluate the primary endpoint of the study (cumulative incidence of depression) according to the intervention using logit models. Potential confounders will be taken into account by means of statistical modelling. Changes of scores over time will be investigated using mixed models that will take into account the severity of symptoms at the baseline assessment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Menopause is the point in time when a womans menstrual periods stop.  The years leading up to a womans final period is referred to as the menopausal transition and, on average, lasts 4 to 7 years. Previous research has found that about 1 in every 4 women experience symptoms of depression during this transition period. Some women may also notice changes that include: irregular menstrual periods, hot flushes, sleep disruption, night sweats, vaginal and urinary problems and low libido.  Fortunately, the most bothersome features of the menopausal transition can be managed successfully, including the changes in mood.  What we would now like to find out is if we can prevent changes in mood occurring altogether by addressing relevant risk factors for depression that might be present during the menopausal transition.  This project requires the participation of midlife women who are experiencing symptoms consistent with the lead up to menopause.  Eligible participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups:  

Standard Medical Care or Standard Medical Care and a Health Coaching Program

Women allocated to the health coaching program will have access to a health coach for a minimum of 8 telephone coaching sessions.  The health coach will offer informational material on menopausal transition, depression and healthy lifestyle behaviours in addition to providing problem solving skills based training. A series of validated self-report measures will be mailed to all study participants at four time points (Baseline and at 8 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks).  These measures will collect demographic, lifestyle and clinical information.  The primary outcome of this study is the diagnosis of  depression (major depressive episode or dysthymia) according to DSM IV at follow up.   We will test the following hypothesis: women randomly assigned to health coaching program will have a lower 12  month prevalence of depression than women randomly assigned to standard care.
