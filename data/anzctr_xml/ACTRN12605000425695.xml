  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment of patients with Advanced Stage IV Melanoma using Vaccinia Melanoma Cell Lysate (VMCL). VMCL is currently an unregistered experimental agent that has been previously tested for treatment of stage III melanoma patients in a large Australian trial. This showed the agent to have a high degree of safety with very few adverse events. The scheduled treatment period will be 18 months, however, the treatment may be continued in individuals who show a significant clinical response.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy, measured by performance status (ECOG score).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated at regular time-points according to the schedule of clinical visits initially 2-weekly, then monthly, then 3-monthly.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival, measured by performance status (ECOG score).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluated at regular time-points according to the schedule of clinical visits initially 2-weekly, then monthly, then 3-monthly.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A range of immunological measures that will be correlated with clinical outcome. The aim is to determine any associations between clinical responses and immunological parameters, in order to better predict who might respond to VMCL therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These will be evaluated at regular time-points according to the schedule of clinical visits and blood tests initially 2-weekly, then monthly, then 3-monthly. A further aim is to design better therapy.</timepoint>
