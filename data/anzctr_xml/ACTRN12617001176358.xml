    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was based on a previous study (Chauhan S, Bisoi A, Kumar N, et al. Dose comparison of tranexamic acid in pediatric cardiac surgery. Asian Cardiovascular and Thoracic Annals. 2004; 12: 121-24) in which the postoperative mean blood loss for the first 24 hours of the patients in boluses group was 20±13 ml/kg. A 35% difference in the mean blood loss of (i.e.13±5) ml/kg between the Tranexamic infusion and boluses groups was suggested to be considered significant. A sample size of 27 subjects in each group was considered sufficient to detect a 35% difference in blood loss with a power of 0.8 and type I error of 0.05. It was assumed that the study dropout rate would be 10% and therefore a total of 60 patients (30 in each group) were recruited.
All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Packages for Social Science version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Normality of age, weight, height, Time to chest closure and postoperative bleeding was checked by kolmorov-smirnve test then applied student t-test and for non-normal data Mann-Whitney test used to compare mean (SD) difference between groups. Frequency and percentage was computed for gender. P = 0.05 was considered as significant. GLM Univariate analysis procedure (instead of stratification) was used to control confounder like age, height, weight and gender to observed effect on outcomes. P = 0.05 was considered significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excessive bleeding in both adults and paediatric cardiac surgery increases morbidity and mortality.  Paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at high risk for intraoperative and postoperative bleeding.Increased bleeding in children exposes them to transfusion of blood and blood products, hence increased risk of complications associated with transfusion.
Tranexamic acid is being used to reduce bleeding but there is no specific dose or regimen. We compared two different regimens of Tranexamic acid i.e infusion and bolus to see which is better in terms of Post-operative bleeding, chest closure time and blood products usage.</summary>
