  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline at Month 1 in Retinal Thickness in the Study Eye During Stage 1 - Retinal thickness is assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the study eye. The retina is the light-sensitive part of the eye. OCT is a laser-based, noninvasive, diagnostic system providing high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the retina. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline at Month 1 in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in the Study Eye During Stage 1 - BCVA is measured using an eye chart and is reported as the number of letters read correctly (ranging from 0 to 100 letters). The lower the number of letters read correctly on the eye chart, the worse the vision (or visual acuity). An increase in the number of letters read correctly means that vision has improved.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single intravitreal injection of
      AGN208397 to treat Macular Edema associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion. This study is being
      conducted in two stages: Stage 1 will enroll approximately 21 subjects who will receive a
      single open label intravitreal injection of either 75 ug, 300 ug, 600 ug or 900 ug of
      AGN208397 and be followed for 12 months post treatment; based on Stage 1 results, Stage 2
      will enroll approximately 96 subjects who will receive a single masked intravitreal injection
      of one of three doses of AGN208397 or Ozurdex® and be followed for 12 months post treatment.</summary>
