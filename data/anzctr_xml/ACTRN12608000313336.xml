  <interventions>
    <interventions>A subtitled DVD will be shown to the patient during the home visit conducted by the researcher in the presence of an interpreter or English-speaking family member. 
The DVD will contain health information for consumers regarding medicines in relation to their chronic conditions to enhance decision-making and behavioural change.
A medication review will be conducted during the home visit by the researcher which involves checking the medication regimen with the patient to reach agreement about their treatment. Fortnightly 5-10 minute follow-up telephone calls will be made by an interpreter in liaison with the researcher or researcher with a family member who can interpret for the patient for a period of 12 weeks exploring any queries or problems relating to their medications. The intervention will last for 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment is the usual care provided to patients by the outpatients' clinic. Standard treatment will be assessed by a survey of outpatient clinic physicians. The control group will not receive the intervention but will have the same data collected at all time points with the intervention group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to assist culturally and linguistically diverse consumers safely manage their complex medication regimens for the co-existing comorbidities of cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Taking medicines as prescribed is critical for well-managed chronic diseases. Approximately 40% of Victorians with CVD, diabetes and CKD speak a language other than English at home, most commonly Greek, Italian, and Vietnamese, which increases the likelihood of medicine-related problems. A language-specific medication intervention to enhance medication self-efficacy will be developed and tested. Better medicine self-efficacy results in improved general wellbeing, medication safety and reduced healthcare costs. 

Null hypothesis: 1.	Compared to patients receiving standard care, patients who receive the intervention will show no change in medication self-efficacy</summary>
