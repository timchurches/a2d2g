  <interventions>
    <interventions>Any patient with a Central Venous Access Device (CVAD) admitted to cancer care services unit will be eligible to participate in this prevalence audit. Patients will have demographic data collected: e.g. admitting diagnosis, co-morbidities and CVAD characteristics. 

Participants will be reviewed by a research nurse once weekly (standard) or twice weekly (if there are any signs of skin impairment). All changes to the skin surrounding the CVAD site will be documented. These changes will be categorised into known skin damage diagnoses using visual prompts and definitions, including pressure injuries (Graded 1,2,3,4 ) skin stripping, tension injury or blister, erythema, skin tear, irritant contact dermatitis, allergic dermatitis and maceration. Participants will be monitored until discharge from hospital.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This observational study will explore the prevalence and risk factors of central venous access device (CVAD) associated skin injury and the types of skin injuries which occur in cancer patients.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 16 years or above, are receiving care within a Cancer Care Services inpatient unit, and have a CVAD in place.

Study details
All participants in this study will have the skin surrounding their CVAD device assessed by a study nurse once per week, or twice per week if there are any signs of skin injury, for the duration of their hospital admission. Nurses will also note any management/treatment received for the CVAD-associated skin injury if present.

It is hoped that the results of this study will help researchers to understand the prevalence of CVAD-associated skin injuries, in order to support the development of evidence-based solutions for their prevention and treatment in the future.
