  <interventions>
    <interventions>A four lesson, universal, social media literacy intervention for early adolescents, will be delivered by research personnel, face-to-face, in grade 7 and 8 classrooms.  Each lesson will be of 45-50 minutes long and one lesson will be conducted in each of four consecutive weeks. The first social media literacy lesson will include classroom activities to explore motives for social media posting to inform critical social media use.  These activities will include examination of postings on social media including advertising and celebrity posts. In the second lesson, the realism of social media images and the effect of viewing images on how students feel about themselves will be explored.  In the third lesson,students will find social media images with positive and negative feedback and examine emotions associated with feedback and motives for different types of feedback.  They will create a non-appearance focused social media profile.  In the final lesson, students will work in small group to create a social media campaign using the social media literacy skills they have gained.  To ensure treatment fidelity, staff delivering the intervention will be trained and a sample of lessons will be recorded.</interventions>
    <comparator>No intervention control group - lessons as usual.  Students will receive their usual English, health or home lessons (depending on the subject in which the social media literacy program is placed) and will not receive any information about the effects of viewing social media.</comparator>

      <outcome>Body satisfaction/dissatisfaction assessed using a reliable and valid questionnaire (Weight and Shape Concerns subscales of the Eating Disorder  Examination Questionnaire).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disordered eating symptoms will be assessed.  Dietary restraint with the DEBQ Dietary Restraint subscale (van Strien et al., 1986) and body change behaviours with the Body Change Questionnaire (Ricciardelli, &amp; McCabe, 2001), These are both valid and reliable questionnaire measures in early adolescents.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depressed mood will be assessed with the valid and reliable questionnaire, the  CESDR-10 (Haroz et al., 2014). </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to examine whether social media literacy mitigates the negative impact of social media engagement on body dissatisfaction, disordered eating and well-being.  As a means to address this question, the impact of a brief, universal, class-room based social media literacy intervention for grade 7 and 8 girls and boys on these outcomes will be evaluated and the moderating effect of social media literacy examined.</summary>
