20 minutes of static stretching for the ankle joint and the great toe. Stretches to be performed at the end range of motion 3 times a week for 6 weeks

20 minutes of dynamic stretches through the range of motion of the ankle joint and the great toe. Stretches to be performed 3 times a week for 6 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A reduction of peak plantar pressure of 10 N/cm2 at the foot. Peak pressure will be measured with the Pedar-X mobile in-shoe plantar pressure system (Novel gmbh, Munich, Germany). The Pedar-X is the gold standard in plantar pressure assessment in diabetes and is non-invasive.</outcome>

Day one after intervention
Six- weeks after intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>An increase of 10 degrees of range of motion of the ankle and big toe joints. Range of motion, will be measured using standardised clinical measurement procedures with degrees of motion read from a goniometer. A standardised lunge test will also be used to measure ankle joint range with a goniometer, and a ruler to measure distance of the foot from the wall.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adolescents with diabetes display limited joint mobility. Because of the association with high pressures under the feet, poor sensation and foot ulceration with disease progression, limited joint mobility assessment is a standard procedure in diabetic foot care. Clinical interventions to
reduce high pressures under the feet include orthoses, footwear and surgical correction. While stretching
has been reported to improve ankle joint range of motion in the general population, limited evidence is available for individuals with diabetes. The evidence for calf stretching in
adolescents where prevention of contractures and high plantar pressures in the early stages of disease may be most beneficial have not been investigated. This study will use a randomised control study to investigate the efficacy of stretching on the ankle and big toe joints  to reduce high pressures under the feet and contractures of the ankle and foot joints.</summary>
