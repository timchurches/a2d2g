  <interventions>
    <interventions>Collaborative Case Conceptualisation (CCC) is designed as a prelude to traditional treatment with the aim of improving treatment motivation and engagement and therefore treatment outcome. It targets proposed anorexia nervosa (restricting type) maintaining factors namely obsessive-compulsive and perfectionistic behaviours and cognitions, avoidant behaviours and cognitions, positive beliefs about anorexia nervosa and responses of close others. 

CCC is done jointly with the patient and uses motivational techniques and an understanding of learning principles with a focus on the maintaining factors of AN. The collaborative assessment is conducted across 3 sessions (one session per week, each lasting approximately 1 hour) by psychology interns (post-graduate provisional psychologists). The assessments are largely focussed on identifying biopsychosocial maintaining factors for the disorder and during the assessment the therapist is constantly listening for examples of these factors. Using psychoeducation and socratic questioning, a shared understanding is developed in regards to the eating disorder and what keeps it going.  This process then informs with the development of collaborative treatment goals.  At completion patients will be provided with a formulation letter summarising the joint understanding of the maintaining factors of the disorder. A log of attendance at sessions will be used to monitor adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Assessment as Usual (AAU) is usual care assessment and will include a mental status examination, assessment of clinical history (including family corroboration), and a physical examination. The assessment is conducted across 3 sessions (one session per week, each lasting approximately 1 hour) by psychology interns (post-graduate provisional psychologists). At completion patients will be provided with a diagnosis, traditional formulation and management plan. A log of attendance at sessions will be used to monitor adherence.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The target sample size for the current study has been determined after considering both power analyses and feasibility of recruitment. Based on McIntosh et al. (2005) a 62.5% retention rate was conservatively estimated (it is expected that this rate will be higher given the current study involves 3 rather than 20 session). The power analysis was performed using G*Power. Using the effect size found in the McIntosh study (w= .90) as an estimated treatment effect for the current study, a total sample size of 20 participants  was needed to achieve 81% power to detect a strong effect, at alpha = 0.05. As such, we aim to recruit 32 participants  in the current study, to account for the anticipated attrition  rate based on McIntosh.

Completer and intention to treat analyses will be conducted. Descriptive statistics, effect sizes and measures of precision will be reported and linear mixed-effects models for repeated measures over time will be used to examine outcomes. Reliable clinically significant change (Evans,Margison, &amp;Barkham, 1998). will be calculated to provide an indication of the meaningfulness of the change achieved by individual participants Exploratory analyses of the impact of the proposed mediators on intervention outcome will be conducted using regression procedures (Baron &amp; Kenny, 1986). Cost effectiveness will be assessed by estimating the costs and outcomes of each intervention using a within trial analysis (Glick, Doshi, Sonnad, &amp;Polsky, 2007) and benefits will be measured using the outcome variables. The relationship between costs and outcomes, incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost utility analysis will be reported. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the efficacy of collaborative case conceptualization (CCC), a novel assessment approach (based on the Maudsley Model of Treatment for Adults with Anorexia Nervosa), compared to standard assessment as usual (AAU) for adults with Anorexia Nervosa. It is hypothesized that, relative to usual care, CCC will result in improvements in general psychopathology and quality of life 12-month follow-up. This study will also examine post-assessment outcomes and potential mediators of the effect of CCC (i.e., obsessive-compulsive and perfectionistic behaviours and cognitions, avoidant behaviours and cognitions, pro-anoretic beliefs and responses of close others).</summary>
