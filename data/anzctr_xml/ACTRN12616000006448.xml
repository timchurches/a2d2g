    <interventions>Restricted volume resuscitation. Patients with clinically suspected sepsis and hypotension which persists after an initial bolus of 1000mls intravenous fluids will be eligible. Particiants randomised to the restricted fluid arm will be commenced on an intravenous infusion of a vasopressor agent (noradrenaline or metaraminol as per local hospital protocol), titrated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65mmHg by the treating clinician. A maintenance infusion of 1-2mls/kg/hour of intravenous fluid will be started and further fluid boluses of 250mls may be administered at the discretion of treating clinician according to usual clinical practice. The trial protocol will run for 6 hours from randomisation after which treatment will continue as guided by the treating team. All administered fluids will be accurately recorded. Research blood samples will be obtained at randomisation (Time 0), and at 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours for biomarkers of interest.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard volume resuscitation. Patients with clinically suspected sepsis and hypotension which persists after and initial bolus of 1000mls intravenous fluids will be eligible. Participants randomised to standard care will receive a further 1000mls intravenous fluid bolus (2000mls total) + further fluid as indicated, according to international consensus guidelines as determined by the treating clinician. Participants whose blood pressure remains inadequate following fluid resuscitation will be commenced on an intravenous infusion of a vasopressor agent (noradrenaline or metaraminol as per local hospital protocol), titrated to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of at least 65mmHg by the treating clinician. A maintenance infusion of 1-2mls/kg/hour of intravenous fluid will be started and further fluid boluses of 500mls may be administered  at the discretion of treating clinician according to usual clinical practice. The trial protocol will run for 6 hours from randomisation after which treatment will continue as guided by the treating team. All administered fluids will be accurately recorded. Research blood samples will be obtained at randomisation (Time 0), and at 3 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours for biomarkers of interest.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome (feasibility) is a 30% reduction in fluid administered over the first 6 hours. In a recent Australian clinical trial (the ARISE trial) in this population the control arm received a mean volume of 4200 +/-2650 mls of fluid in the initial 6 hours. A clinically meaningful reduction would be 2800 +/-1800mls. A total of 86 participants will have 80% power to detect this difference with alpha 0.05. The trial will enroll a total of 100 participants to allow a 'margin of safety'.

Differences in continuous variables will be analysed using the  t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test depending upon the distribution. Chi squared or Fishers exact test will be used for categorical data. 

For biomarker analyses, those which are normally distributed or can be transformed, linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation will be employed to analyse the pattern of biomarkers over time. Differences in the pattern of biomarkers over time between the restricted volume and the standard volume groups will be tested by the interaction of time and group in the model. Additional covariates will be added to adjust for treating centre, illness severity and comorbidities. For biomarkers with skewed distributions resistant to successful transformation, quantile regression with per person cluster adjustment will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sepsis can occur when a person becomes unwell due to an infection. It is caused by inflammation throughout the body and affects the functions of organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. Sepsis can cause low blood pressure and impaired blood flow to the bodys tissues. This is sometimes called septic shock.

First line treatment of septic shock is to give intravenous fluid to help restore the circulation. Standard guidelines recommend at least 30ml/kg initially, or approximately 2 litres in an adult. Often up to 5 litres is given in the first 6 hours. However, the volume required varies between individual patients, and calculating the correct amount can be difficult. There is emerging evidence that giving too much fluid can be harmful by leaking into the tissues (such as lungs), impairing organ function, delaying recovery and increasing the risk of complications.

Other research suggests that giving excessive fluid affects the bodys immune responses. In particular this can lead to adverse effects on the normal function of small blood vessels within tissues. This may be one mechanism by which too much fluid leads to harm.

An alternative means of restoring adequate blood pressure is to use a drug called noradrenaline. This is a chemical produced naturally by the body, which causes blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure. Noradrenaline, given by a continuous infusion through a drip, has been routinely used for decades for this purpose and is known to be safe and effective. Normally noradrenaline is commenced in patients whose blood pressure does not improve after 2-3 litres of intravenous fluid.

While our current guidelines recommend initial generous fluid administration for septic shock, it has been suggested that using lower volumes of fluid may result in less inflammation and harmful effects, particularly on the cells which line the walls of blood vessels and control their function. This study aims to test this hypothesis.

We propose comparing an approach where patients receive a smaller volume of fluid in their initial resuscitation, against the standard guideline-recommended volume. Participants will be randomised to one or other group. We will measure the blood levels of certain chemical markers of inflammation and blood vessel function. We aim to demonstrate that giving a lower amount of fluid in the initial resuscitation phase is feasible clinically, and results in less alteration of blood vessel function and inflammation in the body.
