  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomisation 1: Transradial  approach to arterial access.
Both the femoral and the radial artery are routinely used as entry sites for coronary angiography and angioplasty. Although femoral artery access is more common, radial artery access is associated with reduced bleeding complications. The procedure may take 30minutes to 1 hour.  

Randomisation 2:  Ultrasound-guided access
The operator will use an ultrasound probe to guide the needle into the femoral/radial artery. The procedure may take 30minutes to 1 hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Randomisation 1: Transfemoral approach to arterial acess
Both the femoral and the radial artery are routinely used as entry sites for coronary angiography and angioplasty. Femoral artery access is the most commonly used. The procedure may take 30minutes to 1 hour. 

Randomisation 2: Standard approach to access.
The operator will follow standard procedure (that is, manual access without ultrasound guidance) for arterial access. The procedure may take 30minutes to 1 hour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Major Bleeding as defined by the ACUITY TRIAL. That is:

* A reduction in haemoglobin level of at least 4g/dL without an overt bleeding source or at least 3g/dL with such a source.
* Intracranial or intraocular bleeding.
* Haemorrhage at the access site requiring intervention.
* Retroperitoneal bleed.
* Presence of a haematoma of at least 5cm in diameter.
* Reoperation for bleeding, or
* Transfusion of a blood product.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week, 30 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vascular complications such as pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistulas, compartment syndrome or limb ischemia resulting in the need for vascular surgery. This will be assessed 1 week after the procedure by a vascular surgeon using ultrasound. 

There will be a 30 day follow-up via telephone.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week, 30 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including death, myocardial infarction, urgent target lesion revascularisation and stroke</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week, 30 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Procedural failure, this is defined as the need to access a second site due to the inability to cannulate the randomised approach.</outcome>

    <concealment>Allocation concealment using sealed envelopes</concealment>
    <sequence>Our method of randomisation will include the use of opaque, sealed same-coloured envelopes. After completion of baseline evaluations and assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient will be consented and randomized using an opaque, sealed envelope system. This will consist of a pre-arranged box containing 100 opaque, sealed same-coloured envelopes of equal numbers of radial and femoral options. After randomisation, the patient will be randomised a second time using another pre-arranged box containing 100 opaque, sealed same-coloured envelopes of equal numbers of ultrasound-guided and standard options. These envelopes will be randomly topped up. Randomisation will be defined as the time the opaque envelope is opened. An allocation number will be assigned to each qualifying patient and will allow identification of the patient throughout the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine which of two different approaches in accessing an artery, transfemoral (via the artery in the groin) or transradial (via the artery in the wrist), both of these are currently used in clinical practice, is least associated with bleeding and procedural related complications.

It will also determine whether using an ultrasound machine to guide the arterial access will reduce bleeding and other procedural related complications.</summary>
