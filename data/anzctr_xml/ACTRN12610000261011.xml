  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adolescent males were alternately allocated to the intervention treatment (low glycemic index (GI) diet) or the comparator treatment (high GI diet) for a period of 8 weeks.  Low GI foods included verified low GI brands of muesli and a processed fruit snack, and lasagne (average daily GI of low GI diet intervention was 51).  Macronutrient and energy intakes were similar between this intervention group and the comparison group (high GI).  Severity of inflammatory lesions on the face, insulin sensitivity (homeostasis modelling assessment of insulin resistance), androgens and insulin-like growth factor-1 and its binding proteins were assessed at baseline and 8 wk, a period corresponding to the school term.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment was a high GI diet administered over 8 weeks.  This was assumed to be a reflection of a typical teenage diet.  This diet included verified high GI brands of wheat breakfast biscuits and a processed fruit snack, and baked potato with chili con carne.  The average daily GI consumed was 61.  Macronutrient and energy intakes were similar between this comparison group and the intervention group (low GI).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity of facial acne lesions as outlined below.  A dermatologist who was blind to diet allocation assessed facial acne severity by examining the number and degree of inflammation of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules and nodules, not comedones or scars) on the face under bright lighting.  Acne was graded on a scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no acne, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe.  Photographs were taken of the forehead and right and left cheeks.  Two subjects were chosen at random for repeat assessment by the same dermatologist to determine intra-observer variation (0%).  When illness precluded the attendance of the first dermatologist, a second dermatologist completed some of the final assessments.  The first dermatologist later graded photographs from these assessments and an average was taken from the two grades of facial acne severity.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We hypothesised that in the context of weight maintenance and identical macronutrient (e.g. carbohydrate) and fibre intake, the replacement of high GI carbohydrates with low GI carbohydrates would improve acne severity by lowering blood insulin concentrations.  We studied adolescent males attending boarding school so that food intakes could be more easily controlled.</summary>
