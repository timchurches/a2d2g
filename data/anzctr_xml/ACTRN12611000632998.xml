  <interventions>
    <interventions>This randomised, cross-over trial involves two short-term experimental conditions, separated by a two week washout period. Each experimental condition will be undertaken for 10 consecutive workdays (Monday-Friday) in a controlled research setting.
 
The sitting/standing (intervention) condition will require participants to undertake their usual daily occupational tasks while systematically interchanging between a seated and standing working posture every 30 minutes, with these transitions being achieved using electric, height adjustable sit-to-stand desks. Ambulation/movement will not be restricted when in the standing working posture. Participants will spend a total of four hours desk bound (seated) and four hours standing (that is, a total of eight programmed transitions between seated and standing working posture) in the simulated office environment on each day. The intervention condition is designed to represent a viable workplace environment where equal proportions of the working day are spent sitting and standing.</interventions>
    <comparator>The prolonged sitting condition (considered to reflect usual office practice) will act as the control condition and involve desk bound (seated) work in the simulated office environment for eight hours each day. Ambulatory movement during this period of time will be restricted to brief interruptions for meals and using the toilet only. The control experimental condition is designed to represent a sedentary workplace environment which mandates non-discretionary sitting time (for example, call centres).</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Interested volunteers will be screened for eligibility via a telephone-administered interview with the research coordinator. During the interview, the research coordinator will explain the study details in lay terms and outline the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the participant is suitable and willing to take part, a copy of the plain language statement will be forwarded to them by mail or email. There will be no relationship to potential participants. Once the participant has a thorough understanding of the study and procedures involved, they will be invited to attend a face to face screening visit at the Healthy Lifestyle Research Centre at Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. During the screening visit, participants will have the opportunity to raise any concerns they may have and they will be asked to either reread the plain language statement and give informed consent or decline to take part in the study. Anthropometric measurements will be obtained at this screening visit, and participants will have the opportunity to test any personal work equipment (typically a laptop computer that will be connected to the wireless internet) in the simulated office environment, in preparation for the trial.  During each experimental condition, participants would be asked to wear two small lightweight devices which measure and store information regarding the frequency and duration of times spent sitting, standing and walking. These devices will be worn everyday (during waking hours) starting from your familiarisation visit to the completion of the last experimental condition. One instrument, known as an accelerometer, will be worn with a belt at hip height. The other instrument, known as the ActivPal inclinometer, will be fixed to the front of the upper thigh with Micropore tape.
Participants would also be required to wear an armband (Sensewear device) during each experimental condition (in work hours only) to measure how much energy you are expending whilst working in a standing and/or seated posture.
Once a potential subject has been deemed eligible to participate and provided their informed, consent they will be randomised to the order which they receive the two experimental conditions. The method for allocation concealment will involve a computer generated list of the order of treatments which will not be disclosed till after enrolment in the study is complete.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation allocation sequence will be generated using a online website program(http://www.randomization.com).  Randomisation will be based on two treatment groups with balanced permutations, with the total number of subjects (n=24) divided into two blocks.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>New epidemiological and experimental evidence, from our group and others, indicates that prolonged sitting is associated with adverse cardio-metabolic consequences, independent of time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Furthermore, we have recently reported for the first time that breaks in sedentary time (such as standing from a seated position) are beneficially associated with several cardio-metabolic biomarkers, independent of total sedentary and moderate-to-vigorous activity time.

Our pilot research in a cohort of Australian workers indicates that office-based workers spend more than three quarters of their total work time sedentary. Combined with evidence from the USA that workplace sitting time is associated with cardiovascular disease risk, these new findings suggest that reducing prolonged periods of unbroken sitting in the workplace may offer a novel and economically viable means of improving cardio-metabolic health in the working population. No intervention study has systematically investigated the effects of reducing workplace sitting time on cardio-metabolic risk factors. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that brief bouts of light intensity activity during prolonged periods of sitting acutely improves postprandial glucose and insulin in older, sedentary adults during a single-day intervention. The proposed study will extend upon these findings and examine -- in a simulated office environment -- the short term (10-day) effect of reducing workplace sedentary time through systematic, sustained bouts of standing, on biomarkers of cardio-metabolic risk. 

Given the enormous societal burden associated with cardiovascular disease and its associated conditions, this is an important and timely study. Furthermore, the workplace has been identified by the National Preventative Health Taskforce as a key environment for health promotion and disease prevention. Findings from this rigorous, experimental study will determine whether reducing workplace sedentary time through increased standing is beneficial to cardio-metabolic health.  This novel experimental investigation will provide a key element of the evidence base to underpin the development of future workplace innovations, programs and policy strategies which aim to reduce sedentary behaviour.</summary>
