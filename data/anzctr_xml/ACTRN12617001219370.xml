  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of posaconazole (1 x 40 mg/mL) oral suspension on one occasion and the innovator formulation of posaconazole (1 x 40 mg/mL) oral suspension on two occasions  with each dose seperated by a one week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of posaconazole.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours prior to receiving breakfast. Subjects will be provided with a standardised high fat breakfast which they must start eating 30 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose will be administered orally through a syringe and swallowed with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. The full amount of suspension must be swallowed and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of posaconazole  (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for posaconazole using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU guidelines.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All formulations will be labelled as Formulation A, B and C. The identification of each treatment will only be known to the Managing Director and the Section Head - Trials and Regulatory Affairs. 
The method of allocation concealment will be determined by central randomisation by computer.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant will be identified by a 3 digit screening number and a 2 digit subject number. The screening number will be issued once the participant has given written consent to participate in the study and the two digit subject number (randomisation number) after acceptance into the study.
The method of sequence generation will be completed by simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software (i.e. computerised sequence generation).</sequence>
