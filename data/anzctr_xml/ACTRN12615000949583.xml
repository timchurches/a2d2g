  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention(s) are seven-week training programs where participants train at the lab three days per week for 45 min training sessions. Interventions will occur on an individual basis supervised by a trained exercise physiologist. There are three different interventions, of which participants will perform one only (random allocation).

Intervention 1: Blood-flow restriction (BFR)
Exercises performed are bicep curls (3 sets; 10 repetitions; 50% 1 RM) performed by the dominant arm followed by four sets of bilateral knee flexion and leg extension exercises (1 set x 30 reps, 3 sets x 15 reps; 30% 1 RM).
The rest period between bicep curl sets is 3 min. The rest period between leg extension and knee flexion sets is 30 sec.
The leg exercises are performed with pressurised cuffs applied to the most proximal portion of the upper legs to restrict blood-flow to the working muscles. These cuffs are inflated to a pressure equal to 60% of the pressure required to completely occlude blood-flow through the legs.
Participants are supervised/monitored throughout all training sessions to ensure safety and adherence to the protocol.

Intervention 2: High-intensity (HI)
Exercises: Dominant arm bicep curls (3 sets; 10 repetitions; 50% 1 RM), Knee flexion (4 sets; 8 repetitions; 80% 1 RM) and leg extension (4 sets; 8 repetitions; 80% 1 RM). No blood-flow restriction applied.
The rest period between bicep curl sets is 3 min. The rest period between leg extension and knee flexion sets is 2 min.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study comprises part of a PhD project.
It aims to identify what are the primary mechanisms responsible for muscle growth following light-load blood-flow restriction training in the legs, and how it can also affect muscles in other limbs. This will be compared with an equal-intensity training group without blood-flow restriction, a heavy-load resistance training group, and an untrained control group. This will be investigated using a seven week strength training study. </summary>
