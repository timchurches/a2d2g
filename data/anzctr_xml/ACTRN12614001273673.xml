  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Power Sleep device is a non-customised, self-fitted intra-oral mandibular advancement splint designed to manage snoring and mild sleep apnoea. The Power Sleep device will be used for a single night whilst in bed, while simultaneously linked to an overnight polysomnography sleep study device at the participant's own home. Adherence will be measured using a single-item question "On the night that you used the device, for how much of the night did you use the device?" with responses ranging on a four point likert scale consisting of o (did not use device), 1 (some of the night), 2 (most of the night), 3 (the entire night). </interventions>

      <outcome>Side effects (assessed by the Side-Effects Questionnaire and clinical assessment). This questionnaire is not validated, but was developed by collating the known side-effects of other existing oral devices used for sleep apnoea. Therefore, it will be accompanied by a clinical assessment to ascertain and record any additional or unexpected side-effects. Examples of possible side effects include: dry mouth, excessive salivation, temporomandibular symptoms (pain, clicking, limited opening), muscle spasm or stiffness, altered occlusion (bite), tooth pain, mobile teeth, broken teeth, biting of lips or cheeks mouth ulcers, periodontal problems, root resorption, muscle spasms, difficulty getting back to sleep after waking to go to toilet, issues with retention of device, and poor adherence.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Latest research demonstrates that up to 40 million Americans (17%), and 4 million Australians (17%) suffer from snoring and/or Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (Kryger, Roth, Rement Principles and Pracice of Sleep Medicine, 5th Ed.). Nevertheless, only a small percentage have received treatment (5% in America and less than 1% in Australia; American Society of Sleep Medicine, USA, 2014). Current treatments are costly, time-consuming and difficult to tolerate. The Power Sleep (PS) oral device is a non-customised, self-fitted intra-oral mandibular advancement splint designed to manage snoring and sleep apnoea. This product has the potential to deliver a clinically effective outcome while reducing cost and increasing comfort levels. The current study aims to examine the efficacy and safety of the Power Sleep (PS) oral device in the management of snoring and sleep apnoea. A pre-post test design involving measures at baseline and using the oral device will be employed using approximately 30 participants aged 18-65 with sleep apnoea. It is hypothesized that the Power Sleep (PS) oral device will have a salutatory effect compared to baseline measures on: (a) snoring loudness; (b) snoring frequency; (c) Apnoea Hypopnea Index-REM (AHI-REM); (d) Apnoea Hypopnea Index-Total (AHI-Total); and (e) mean minimum oxygen saturation (min SaO2).</summary>
