  <interventions>
    <interventions>Soft tissue mobilization group: Patients in this group received soft tissue mobilization provided by an experienced physical therapist. The physical therapist used hands to apply forces in order to release on erector spinae, quadratus lumborum and thoracolumbar fascia area. The duration of treatment was 20 minutes.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Stretching exercise group: Patients in this group were instructed a stretching exercise program by an experienced physical therapist. Eight stretching exercises in this program contained prayer stretching in 3 directions, trunk lateral flexion stretching in sitting position for both sides, trunk rotation stretching in supine position for both sides, and knee to chest stretching. Patients had to sustain each stretching for 15 seconds. and perform 5 times with the assistance of physical therapist first and 5 times by themselves. Completing all stretching exercises would take 20 minutes. Patients only received one session stretching exercise program.

Superficial heat group: Patients in this group were positioned in prone position with a heating pad on their low back region for 20 minutes once. The temperature of heating pad was around 65 Celsius degrees.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The relationship between the improvement of pain intensity and decrease of the soft tissue hardness has not been investigated in previous studies. The purposes of this randomized controlled trial were to compare the immediate effects among soft tissue mobilization, stretching exercises, and superficial heat on decreasing soft tissue hardness, pain, increasing pressure pain threshold, lumbar mobility, and perceived improvement in subjects with low back pain and to examine the relationships among decrease of the soft tissue hardness and improvement of the pain intensity and pressure pain threshold. The hypothesis is that soft tissue mobilization group shows the most positive improvement on all outcome measures.   </summary>
