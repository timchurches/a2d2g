    <interventions>In this study, detection thresholds of different sensory attributes including canola oil (triglyceride-rich), paraffin oil (triglyceride-rich), oleic acid (free fatty acid-rich) and canola oil + oleic acid (triglyceride- and free fatty acid-rich) will be determined in a repeated measure design to examine test-retest reliability and to compare detection thresholds of the four stimuli. Each of the four stimuli will be tested on 3 separate days. Hence, in total there will be 12 non-consecutive measuring days with one testing session of approximately 1 hour per day  for each subject. All sessions will be held in the Deakin University Centre for Advanced Sensory Science laboratories.

To determine detection thresholds for fat and fatty acids, concentrations of canola oil (9.90, 32.69, 46.09, 65.37, 92.18, 130.10, 183.70, 259.54, 366.75, 518.10, 731.87, 1033.58, 1634.37 mM),  paraffin oil (5.41, 17.88, 25.21, 35.76, 50.42, 71.15, 100.47, 141.95, 200.59, 283.37, 400.29, 565.30, 893.90 mM), oleic acid  (0.02, 0.06, 1.00, 1.40, 2.00, 2.80, 3.80, 5.00, 6.40, 8.00, 9.80, 12.00, 20.00 mM) and canola oil + oleic acid (9.90+3.80, 32.69+3.80, 46.09+3.80, 65.37+3.80, 92.18+3.80, 130.10+3.80, 183.70+3.80, 259.54+3.80, 366.75+3.80, 518.10+3.80, 731.87+3.80, 1033.58+3.80, 1634.37+3.80 mM) will be prepared in a non-fat milk emulsion, 
Detection thresholds will be determined using the 3-alternative forced choice method. In this method, subjects receive a set of 3 samples, one test sample containing the stimulus and two control samples. Subjects are instructed to taste and expectorate each sample and to identify the odd one out. Since samples are expectorated and the test stimuli are present in the daily diet, no washout phase is included. Concentrations are presented in ascending order. Whenever a subjects answer is incorrect, the concentration of the test sample is increased until a concentration is reached, that can be detected by the subject. Following a correct identification of the test sample, the subject receives a new set of samples with the same concentration as correctly identified before. Whenever the subject identifies the same concentration three consecutive times in succession, this concentration is documented as detection threshold. To mask visual cues, the sensory testing is conducted under red light. To mask olfactory cues, subjects are instructed to wear a nose clip during testing.

On each of the 12 study appointments, a detection threshold for one of the four stimuli is determined. Additionally, anthropometric measurements (body weight and height) will be measured during the first study appointment to determine the subjects body mass index. On the second study appointment, taste intenstiy testing for sucrose (100, 200, 300 mM)  and sodium chloride (100, 200, 300 mM) will take place after the measurement of the detection threshold. To control for normal taste function, subjects will recieve three different concentrations of the stimulus (sucrose/sodium chloride in randomized order). After introducing the subject to a labelled magnitude scale, they have to taste each sample and rate its intensity on this scale. Saliva samples will also be collected after the first detection threshold for canola oil is assessed to determine the level of the saliva enzyme lingual lipase which is responsible for hydrolyzing triglycerides into free fatty acids which can evoke sensory signals by interacting with fat-specific receptors. 

Each testing day, subjects will report what they have eaten from the time they awoke in the morning. By evaluating these food diaries and additional questionnaires (Food Frequency Questionnaire, Food Like-Dislike Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scales on physiological conditions such as hunger, appetite, etc.), the subjects eating behavior can be assessed. Additionally, conclusions about the influence of the food composition on sensory sensitivity can be drawn. </interventions>

1. Determine taste thresholds for canola oil, oleic acid, sucrose and sodium chloride. Correlations between mean thresholds with BMI and food consumption (dietary pattern) will be used to determine if there are associations between taste thresholds with food consumption and BMI.

2. Information concerning participant's food consumption and food behaviour will be used to evaluate differences between subject's thresholds.

3. Saliva samples will be taken to measure the level of lingual lipase to examine associations between taste thresholds and lingual lipase activity.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is a major health issue that is currently affecting millions of people worldwide. Differences in the taste system due to genetic and dietary factors might explain why some individuals are more prone to become obese than others. There is increasing evidence that humans, apart from being sensitive for the five primary taste qualities, can also taste fat in form of free fatty acids when additional sensory cues are masked. However, in the common diet, the concentration of free fatty acids is relatively low and fat is mainly consumed in the form of triglycerides. The present study aims to determine detection thresholds for canola oil as a triglyceride-rich source of fat and to investigate the associations between individual differences in fat taste sensitivity with detection thresholds of additional sensory stimuli, diet, body mass index, and saliva composition.
In this study, detection thresholds of fat (canola oil, paraffin oil, canola oil + oleic acid) and fatty acids (oleic acid) will be determined in a repeated measure design in 30 subjects between 18-55 years. Each of the four stimuli will be tested on 3 separate days with 1 testing sessions per day. Hence, in total there will be 12 testing sessions of approximately 1 hour on 12 measuring days for each subject.
All sessions will be held in the Deakin University Centre for Advanced Sensory Science laboratories. At the initial study appointment, body weight and height will be measured to calculate the subjects body mass index. Saliva samples will also be collected during the first session to determine the level of the saliva enzyme lingual lipase which is responsible for hydrolyzing triglycerides into free fatty acids. Additionally, eating behavior-related questionnaires and food diaries of each testing day will be collected. Each testing day, detection thresholds of one of the four stimuli will be determined using the ascending 3-alternative forced choice method. In this method, subjects receive a set of 3 samples (one test sample containg the stimulus at a specific concentration and two control samples) and the instruction to taste each sample and to identify the odd one out.</summary>
