  <interventions>
    <interventions>Moderate physical activity: groups of 10-15 subjects trained three times a week for 12 weeks in the periods March-July, 2011 and 2012.

1) Training group 1: 60 minutes of brisk walking at an intensity of 65-75% of maximal heart rate.

2) Training group 2: 30 minutes of circuit training: crunch, lat machine, chest press, leg press, leg extension, sitting calf. Each exercise was repeated 12 times for three sets at 65% of 1-Repetition Maximum Test After that 60 minutes of brisk walking at an intensity of 65-75% of maximal heart rate was performed (Total training time 90 minutes).

Professional coaches followed all the training sessions providing technical instruction, supervision and encouragement. Participants received generic dietary advice. Adherence was  measured by frequency of attended training sessions.</interventions>

Soluble markers. Soluble biomarkers were measured in cryopreserved plasma samples, drawn at baseline and after 12 weeks of training, by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays according to manufacturers recommendation. These included high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble CD14 (sCD14)(R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), D-dimer (Asserachrom, Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres-Sur-Seine, France), interleukin-18 (IL-18)(Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) and myostatin (Cusabio Biotech, Wuhan, China). 

Flow cytometry for cell-activation markers. T-cell activation was measured on cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient from EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood. After thawing and PBS-washing, 3 x 105 cells were stained using phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-HLA-DR, PE-cyanin red 5.1-conjugated anti-CD38, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-CD3, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 (BD-Biosciences, San Diego, CA). CD38+ and HLA-DR+ cells were gated from the CD3+/CD4+ or CD3+/CD8+ cells on a 2-dimensional dot plot. Analyses were performed by FACSCalibur with CellQuest software (BD-Biosciences) and results reported as percentages of CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T-cells expressing both HLA-DR and CD38.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The use of antiretroviral drugs has dramatically reduced the progression and mortality of HIV infection, which has now become a chronic condition. However, this treatment involves taking several medications, which must be used in combination for the entire life. Side effects are frequent and occur with alterations of cardiovascular system, renal system, bone mineralisation. In addition, chronic HIV infection is per se associated with increased systemic immune activation. As a result there is an increased risk in HIV-infected patients to develop cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes, renal failure, osteoporosis and other problems resulting from metabolic disorders.

There are several measures that can be implemented to reduce the risk of developing these conditions, which include both interventions of lifestyle, such as diet and exercise, and different pharmacological approaches. Among these interventions, there are several evidences that physical activity is helpful in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases in the general population, changing the risk factors for these diseases. There are preliminary evidences that physical exercise is also effective in HIV-positive people with impaired metabolism in modifying several risk factors for developing cardiovascular disease.

The effects of physical activity are different depending on the type and intensity of physical activity. Generally, aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular parameters, while resistance training counteracts the reduction of muscle mass. In people while type 2 diabetes, the combination of the two types of activity improves cardiovascular and metabolic parameters. Aerobic exercise seems effective in reducing body fat in HIV-infected people with increased storage of fat in the abdomen, while the combination of aerobic and resistance training seems to be effective in reducing abdominal fat, total fat, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.

The study aims to evaluate the benefits of moderate physical activity for people living with HIV infection treated with antiretroviral drugs, including aerobic physical activity or the combination of aerobic and resistance training. Benefits will be measured by an improvement of the state of health, physical fitness, and metabolic and inflammatory markers, and it also intends to assess whether the combination of aerobic and resistance training is superior to aerobic activity only. The innovative aspect of this program in the inclusion, as aerobic activity, of brisk walking, that is a technique for walking a high speed engaging significantly the muscular and cardiovascular system.
