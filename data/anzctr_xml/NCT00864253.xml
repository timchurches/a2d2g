  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression Free Survival (PFS) Based on a Blinded Radiology Assessment of Response Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Guidelines - PFS was defined as the time from the randomization date to the start of disease progression or patient death, whichever occurred first. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the last known time that the patient was progression free. In the event of palliative radiotherapy or surgery, they were censored at the last assessment where they were documented to be progression-free prior to the date of radiotherapy or surgery. In follow up, participants who began new anticancer therapy prior to documented progression were censored at the last assessment where they were documented as progression free. Those with two or more missing response assessments prior to a visit with documented disease progression (or death) were censored at the last visit where they were documented to be progression free. RECIST defines progressive disease as a = 20% increase taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameters recorded since the treatment began.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Response assessment completed every 8 weeks until disease progression for up to 106 weeks; data cut off 30 June 2012</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant Survival - Survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death (any cause). Participants were censored at the last known time that they were alive.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Summary of Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (AEs) - A Treatment Emergent AE (TEAE) was any AE that began or worsened after the start of the study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug or end of study whichever is later. A treatment related toxicity was one considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably or definitely related to study drug. AE's were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) V 3.0 criteria and the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild, Grade 2 = Moderate, Grade 3 = Severe, Grade 4 = Life threatening, and Grade 5 = Death A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that is fatal or life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; requires prolonged hospitalizations; is a congenital anomaly birth defect in the offspring of a patient, and conditions not included in the above that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</outcome>

    <summary>The main purpose of this research study is to compare the safety, tolerability, and anti
      tumor activity of an investigational drug, ABI-007 versus Dacarbazine in patients with
      metastatic melanoma who have not previously received chemotherapy. ABI-007 is a new
      preparation of the active drug paclitaxel. It contains the same medication as the
      prescription chemotherapy drug AbraxaneÂ®. AbraxaneÂ® is approved by the FDA for the treatment
      of metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease
      or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Dacarbazine is approved by the FDA for
