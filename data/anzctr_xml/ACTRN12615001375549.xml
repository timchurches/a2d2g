  <interventions>
    <interventions>Consumption of a formulated milk beverage containing 9 grams of dairy protein, 13g of carbohydrate and 3.2 g of lipid dissolved in 200 ml of water. Energy =504kJ

At baseline all participants will undergo DXA and pqCT scans to estimate body composition on muscle size as well as isometric strength measurements.. Participants will undergo a primed constant infusion of 13C6 phenylalanine for three hours in the rested fasted state before a muscle biopsy will be obtained from the vastus lateralis to calculate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). They will then preform 3 sets of unilateral knee extension and leg press for a randomly selected leg. They will then consume either the treatment or placebo beverage. Additional biopsies will be obtained from each leg at 90 and 210 min after beverage consumption while the isotope infusion is maintained. MPS will be calculated form 0-90 and 9-210 min after beverage consumption.  .    </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dairy protein is know to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and resistance exercise is know to act synergistic to further increase MPS. It is not known if a small dose of dairy protein (9 g) can increase MPS. It is hypothesized that 9 g of dairy protein will increase MPS at rest and that MPS with be further increased when 9 g of dairy protein is combined with resistance exercise.  </summary>
