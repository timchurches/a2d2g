  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased pulsatility index of retinal vessels in OSA patients. This will be assessed using post data capture analysis on retinal videos recorded from each individual. The pulse amplitude of both retinal artery and veins will be measured using custom algorithms in OSA and controls.   </outcome>

      <outcome>Need of ocular screening for OSA patients. If significant results are obtained, using methodology described in the primary outcome a screening tool may be developed to screen the eyes in OSA patients for early diagnosis</outcome>

Our previous study on glaucoma and control subjects showed a mean difference of 8mm/s, 15 micrometers, 10% and 20 micrometers for retinal pulse wave propagation, vessel diameter, pulsatility index and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness respectively, between the two groups. Based on this, we computed the average effect size to be 0.3. With type-I error (alpha) of 0.05 and power of 0.95, a sample size of ~100 (50 in each group) will be sufficient to detect a difference between these two groups.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition consisting of intermittent upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to periods of hypoxia (reduced oxygen levels) and acute hypertension (high blood pressure). It has been hypothesized that in OSA, physiological changes can result in retinal ischemia (restriction in blood supply to tissues) and associated retinal vascular changes and progression of glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve.  In a previous study, we did not find an increased prevalence of optic disc edema or other optic neuropathies in the OSA population. However, retinal vascular changes were more common in patients with severe OSA, independent of blood pressure, suggesting that OSA patients should undergo ophthalmologic screening.  Despite this, the risk for various ocular disorders among patients with OSA remains unclear, particularly because in prior studies only static (single) measures of retinal vessels were considered. Additionally, these studies did not adequately control for potential confounders of these associations, such as obesity and hypertension. The aim of the current study is to investigate dynamic (real time videos) retinal vasculature characteristics in OSA patients and determine any associated changes of the retina in this group of patients. This will provide a new-insight into specific OSA related changes in the eye.</summary>
