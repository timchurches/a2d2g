    <interventions>A self-monitoring digital health program (MonitorMe), offered through the My Digital Health platform for adults in the general community, will be evaluated using a quasi-experimental trial design. People taking part in the study will receive immediate access to the MonitorMe program following completion of the pre-program survey.

MonitorMe is self-help digital health program designed to enable people to self-monitor their mood and daily lifestyle events with minimal effort, and provide them with decision supports to help them interpret their self-monitoring scores and stayed engaged. These decision support tools also provide the person with relevant feedback and timely life skills strategy information and practice tools that either work at maintaining their current healthy behaviours or assist them to get back on track when things are not going so well (depending on what their actual scores indicate). The skill strategy information covers biological, psychological, social, and wellness domains, all designed to increase mind and body health (e.g., brain &amp; gut nutrition, emotional regulation strategies, sleep hygiene, social connectedness, practising gratitude) and take approximately 5-20 minutes to work through. Background information is also provided on health and wellbeing (e.g., the stress response, brain/neural plasticity). 

Participants will be asked to complete the self-monitoring survey each day taking approximately 1 minute. Then, once every week, participants will be asked to use the Monitoring Graph decision support tool that will walk them through their self-monitoring scores from the past 7 days. Using the decision support tool will require 2 to 20 minutes per week (depending on their individual scores). Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., daily self-monitoring survey reminders, alerts if their scores indicate a decline, when to complete program assessment surveys). The MonitorMe program includes text, graphics, audio, video, quizzes, an interactive self-monitoring tool, interactive games and downloads. MonitorMe can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants will be asked to complete a pre-program survey assessment (Week 0), followed by 5 additional during assessments (one every 4 weeks), and a post-program (Week 25) and 6-month follow-up (Week 49) assessment survey. Participants will also be asked questions relating to their program engagement levels at post-program assessment. Although the evaluation trial runs for 49 weeks, participants will be able to have continued access to MonitorMe digital health program after that time. At any stage, participants can opt out of the study / or the program, by clicking a button in their My Profile section. 

Participant engagement with the program will be obtained through by passive analytic data (e.g., what pages / strategies they visited / used and when), as well as reviewing the completion of daily mood and lifestyle event survey data and the scheduled intervention assessments.
