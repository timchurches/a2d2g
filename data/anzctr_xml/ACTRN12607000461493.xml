  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two alternative advance notification strategies will be trialed. Intervention 1 will consist of a simple 'advance notification of an invitation to participate in screening for Colorectal Carcinoma (CRC)' letter incorporating messages introducing the concept of screening for CRC, increased risk for CRC and the value of screening to reduce risk. Intervention 2 (enhanced advance notification) will include those messages plus more complex messages to reduce known barriers (lack of knowledge about CRC and its prevention, aversion for faecal sampling, low perception of the value of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) screening). The advance notification letters will be followed in 2 weeks by a standard invitation-to-screen letter. A control group will receive the standard invitation only. Invitees have 12 weeks from date of invitation-to-screen in which to participate in screening.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Invitees randomly selected by computer from an extract of the Australian electoral roll are randomly allocated by a computer to a screening program with a preliminary notification letter (2 types) or without notification letter. Invitations to participate are sent by mail, there is no direct interpersonal contact. Help line calls are answered without knowledge of intervention group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Group sizes of 600 each were determined by power analysis assuming that an intervention that produces a 10% increase in participation is a significant program improvement. All eligible people were assigned a random number using the MS Excel RAND function. The listing was ordered by ascending random number. The first 600 were assigned to intervention group 1 (enhanced advance notification), the second to intervention group 2 (standard advance notification), the third to control (no advance notification).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has demonstrated that the use of a simple advance notification letter preceding an invitation to participate in bowel cancer screening resulted in a significant increase in population participation compared to no advance notification of invitation. This study further explores the value of advance notification by comparing screening participation between 3 groups: 1) using an enhanced version specifically addressing known barriers (aversion for collecting faecal samples, lack of knowledge about bowel cancer, low perception of the value of screening); 2) a simple advance notification letter and 3) a control group not receiving advance notification.</summary>
