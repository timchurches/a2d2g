  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is essentially a single centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, ascending dose study in healthy subjects. 

This study is divided into three parts.

The first part comprises of single dose cohorts to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, and the maximum tolerated dose, was well as an assessment of the food effect of DSM265. 

The first single ascending dose (SAD) Part 1 of the study will involve up to seven cohorts for the single dose treatment (8 subjects per cohort for cohorts 1 - 6. 10 subjects for Cohort 4 and where the same 10 subjects will be used for Cohort 7. There will be at least a 7 day wash-out period between doses for cohorts 4 and 7.

The mode of administration is an oral solution. As this part is an ascending dose study, the actual dose for the subsequent cohorts will be determined after review of safety and PK data from the first 3 cohorts.
Cohort 1: 6 subjects will receive 25 mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo;
Cohort 2: 6 subjects will receive 75 mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo;
Cohort 3: 6 subjects will receive 150 mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo;
Cohorts 4 (fasted state) and 7 (fed state): 8 subjects will receive x mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo. 
Cohort 5: 6 subjects will receive xx mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo;
Cohort 6: 6 subjects will receive xxx mg DSM265; 2 subjects placebo.</interventions>

2. Healthy male and female (of non-childbearing potential) subjects age 18 to 55 years  in good health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening.
a. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had at least 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels at the local laboratory levels for post-menopause; or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least six months ago. Women on oral contraceptives are to be excluded from the study, also women who have had a tubal ligation.
3. At screening and baseline, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will be assessed in the sitting position after the subject has rested for at least three (3) minutes and again when required after three (3) minutes in the standing position. Investigators can be guided by the following ranges:
a. oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 degrees celcius
b. systolic blood pressure, 90-140 mm Hg
c. diastolic blood pressure, 50-90 mm Hg
d. pulse rate, 40-90 bpm
4. When blood pressure and pulse are taken after at least 3 minutes standing, there should be no more than a 20 mm Hg drop in systolic or 10 mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure and increase in heart rate (&gt;20 bpm) (compared to the sitting results) associated with clinical manifestation of postural hypotension. Any subject exhibiting clinical manifestations of postural hypotension should be excluded.
5. Must have haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis results at screening that are within the reference range or, if outside the range, not clinically significant as judged by the investigator and confirmed and agreed by the medical monitor; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT and bilirubin must be within the reference range at screening

Vasectomised males to use a condom for the entire study and 12 weeks following drug administration.
9. Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Urine cotinine levels will be measured during screening and at each baseline for all subjects. Smokers will be defined as any subject who reports tobacco use and/or who has a urine cotinine greater than or equal to 500 ng/mL. For light smokers (defined as less than 5 cigarettes per day) to pass the cotinine test, smoking should be stopped at least 24 hours prior to reporting to the centre (i.e., Day -2, early morning). Smoking will not be allowed during the study.

iii. Pancreatic injury or pancreatitis in the last 6 months;
iv. The Investigator should be guided by the following criteria:
a. Any single parameter may not exceed 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A single parameter elevated up to and including 1.5 x ULN should be re-checked once more as soon as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to enrolment/randomisation, to rule out lab error.
b. Any elevation of more than one parameter excludes a subject from participation in the study unless otherwise agreed by the medical monitor. Testing may be repeated once more as soon as possible, but in all cases, at least prior to enrolment/randomisation, to rule out lab error.
Re-check results must not be clinically significant in order for subject to qualify and confirmed and agreed by the medical monitor.

    <designfeatures>This study is an ascending dose study being studied in 3 parts, and depending on the results of the previous parts, the study can then move on to the next part. It uses an adaptive design. If the pharmacokinetic parameters attain levels acceptable to the sponsor and Safety Review Team, the study will proceed to the induced malaria infection study. Likewise, if the pharmacodynamic parameters attain levels acceptable to the sponsor and Safety Review Team (SRT), the study will proceed to the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase.</designfeatures>
