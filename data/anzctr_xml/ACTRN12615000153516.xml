    <interventions>This is a proof of concept study:

Recruitment of patients will take place over 5 months. 

Patients presenting to general practitioner (GP) will be invited to participate. Upon consent GP or practice nurse (PN) will undertake a non-fasting finger prick test using the Cardiocheck PA analyser to measure patient's LDL-c level. If level is above 4.9mmol/L, a fasting lipid blood test will be carried out to confirm the results. If a level above 4.9mmol/L is maintained, patient will be recalled and assessed using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Score (DLCNS) for FH. Patients with a score under or equal to 5 will be classed as low complexity FH and managed at the discretion of the GP. Patients with a score above 5 will be referred for FH in a shared care model between GP and specialist. As part of clinical care, first degree relatives will also be offered further investigations for FH.

Patients with confirmed LDL-c levels &gt;4.9mmol/L will have their risks of FH assessed using the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network scoring system.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an inherited condition which results in excessively high levels of cholesterol in the bloodstream from birth, with increased risk of heart problems by age 40 or earlier if not treated. Early diagnosis and treatment are very effective and reduces long-term disease costs. This study examines the feasibility of employing a new method of detecting FH through GP clinics using a finger prick cholesterol blood test. If FH is diagnosed, close relatives will also be checked so early treatment can be offered. This proposed innovative approach will alleviate hospital load and allow FH to be managed by the patients GP and lipid specialist in shared care approach</summary>
