  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a single center, four-period, open-label, complete crossover (meaning subjects will receive all treatments) study to investigate:
* The single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as a liquid formulation compared to a tablet formulation under fasted conditions (no food for at least 8 hours prior to dosing, water permissible until 1 hour pre-dose).  
* The effect of a meal on the single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as a tablet formulation.
* The effect of prior administration of a Proton Pump Inhibitor on the single dose pharmacokinetics of PRN1008 when administered as a tablet formulation.

Participants will be screened for participation within 28 days before dosing. Participants will be admitted to the study unit the day before dosing (Day -1), then dosed in the mornings of Days 1, 3, 5 and 10, and will remain in the clinic up to Day 11, after collection of the final PK sample.

All participants will complete all four Periods of the study 
Participants will be randomized to order of treatment  (1, 2 &amp; 3) for the first three Periods. All participants will receive Treatment 4 as the final treatment. Therefore, the final Period will be identical for all participants.

Treatments are as listed below. Doses will be administered approximately 48 hours apart for the first three treatments:

Treatment 1
Immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 liquid formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile. Participants will be in a fasted state (i.e an overnight fast -no food-of at least 8 hours, water permissible until 1 hr pre-dose).Food will be restricted until 4 hours after dosing.

Treatment 2
Immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 tablet formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile. Participants will be in a fasted state (i.e an overnight fast -no food-of at least 8 hours, water permissible until 1 hr pre-dose).Food will be restricted until 4 hours after dosing.


Treatment 3
Immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 tablet formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile. Participants will be in a fed state (following an overnight fast of at least 8 hours, and water restricted for 1 hour before food administration, participants will receive a standardized moderate fat meal (breakfast). The meal will be started 30 minutes prior to dosing and ingested within 30 minutes.Further food will be restricted until 4 hours after dosing.

Treatment 4 
Following collection of the final PK sample from Period 3, participants will begin dosing esomeprazole 40 mg once daily  (oral capsule) in the morning, on Days 6  10.  On Day 10, immediately prior to and following a single oral 300 mg dose of PRN1008 tablet formulation, blood samples will be obtained over a period of 24 hours for determination of the PRN1008 PK profile. The Day 10 PRN1008 dose will be administered in a fasted state (i.e an overnight fast -no food-of at least 8 hours, water permissible until 1 hr pre-dose). Food will be restricted until 4 hours after dosing.

All doses are administered and monitored by study staff  to ensure compliance.

There are 6 possible sequences in which the listed treatments will be completed:
*   1234
*   1324
*   2134
*   2314
*   3124
*   3214

Following discharge from the study unit, subjects will return for a follow-up assessment  one week (plus or minus 2 days) after final study drug administration.

The total duration for participants will be up to approximately 47 days.

    <concealment>Participants cannot commence enrolment procedures until all entry criteria have been fulfilled.  Where clinical significance of an abnormal screening test result (lab or any other test) is considered uncertain, the test may be repeated.
Participants will be recruited from the study sites's internal database.  Eligible subjects will be allocated to a treatment by a treatment scheduled randomly generated by a biostatistician.
Whilst the treatment allocation is not concealed, participants will be randomly assigned to one of six possible treatment schedules.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be numbered sequentially in the following format:

Brnn (where B is the study number, R is the replacement number should the participant be a replacement, nn being the sequential number into the study starting with 01).

Subjects will be randomised to a treatment via a simple randomisation table created by computer software (i.e computerised sequence generation) which will be provided to the site by the biostatistician.

The investigator or designee will enter data of each enrolled participant.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Safety and Tolerability:
Quantitative safety data will be summarised by descriptive statistics (simple counts, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) by treatment group.  Summaries will also be presented for the change from baseline, when appropriate. 

Pharmacokinetics:
Plasma concentrations and the computed PK parameters will be listed for PRN1008. Individual and mean concentration versus time data will be plotted on linear and semi-logarithmic scales. Summary statistics of PK parameters (primary and secondary) will be presented for each treatment period including means, geometric means, standard deviations, coefficient of variation (CV), medians and ranges, as appropriate.

Geometric mean ratios and 90 percent confidence limits of AUC and Cmax by formulation will be computed. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be applied to the log-transformed primary PK parameters. Additional summaries or analyses may be applied to the data as appropriate.

No formal sample size calculations were performed. The sample size of the study was determined by practical considerations, and is typical for a study of this type. Based on past experience with PRN1008, 12 subjects are sufficient to characterize the PK of a single dose administration considering observed PK variability.
