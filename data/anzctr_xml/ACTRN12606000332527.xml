    <studytitle>An Investigation of Chiropractic NET for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A Comparative Clinical Investigation to determine whether the addition of Chiropractic Neuro Emotional Technique (NET) to an existing treatment (treatment plan participant is already on as prescribed by their referring specialist eg pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic treatment plan)  can improve outcomes (ie; decrease inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity) as measured by Conners Parent Rating Scales-Revised:Long Version (CPRS-R:L) &amp; Conners' Teacher Rating Scales-Revised:Long Version (CTRS-R:L) in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>2 Experimental GROUPS:- approx 35 participants in each group, will be randomly allocated to (2) Experimental Group 1: ADHD children on existing treatment plan plus NET treatment (3) Experimental group 2: ADHD children on existing treatment plan plus sham NET treatment Experimental groups will be treated 2x/week for 1 month, then 1x/month for 6 months at which time study will conclude. At start time, 1 month &amp; at 7 months CPRS-R:L questionnaires will be issued to parents to complete.</interventions>

      <outcome>Primary outcomes measured are the 3 core features of ADHD (ie; inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) as measured by the Conners Parent Rating Scales: Revised-Long Version (CPRS:R-L). Positive outcomes would show a decrease in the CPRS:R-L overall. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GENERAL AIM: -To determine whether the addition of a Chiropractic (NET) intervention to a pre-existing treatment can improve the outcomes of children with clinically diagnosed ADHD. SPECIFIC AIMS: -To determine whether chiropractic (NET) treatment in addition to a pre-existing treatment is more effective than that pre-existing treatment alone in children with ADHD. -To determine the responses of the above in the short term (1 month) and long term (7 months). NULL HYPOTHESIS: -That the addition of Chiropractic (NET) intervention has no effect on the clinical outcomes of children with clinically diagnosed ADHD. THE CLINICAL OUTCOMES BEING INVESTIGATED ARE: (1) Decrease in CPRS-R:L &amp; CTRS-R:L (2) Decrease in subscales of CPRS-R:L &amp; CTRS-R:L eg decrease in inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity. Those who will be blinded in the study are the participants and their parents, the assessor and the data analyst.</summary>
