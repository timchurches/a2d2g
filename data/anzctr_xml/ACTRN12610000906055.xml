  <interventions>
    <interventions>The single full body resistance exercise session using machines and free weights administered individually by an accredited exercise physiologist. It will take approximately 40 minutes to complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each of the 6 exercises at 70% of 1RM. The 6 exercises will consist of three upper (supine bench press, lateral pull-down, seated upright row) and three lower (incline seated leg press, leg curl, leg extension) body exercises.

There will then be a seven day washout period before undertaking the aerobic exercise session.</interventions>
    <comparator>One 30 minute session of aerobic exercise completed under the supervision of an accredited exercise physiologist will be completed on a cycle ergometer at 60% of VO2 max.

There will then be a seven day washout period before undertaking the resistance exercise session.</comparator>
