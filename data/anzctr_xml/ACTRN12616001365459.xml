    <interventions>Considered the best way in order to maintain a healthy body and pain-free, maintaining perfect posture, along with regular physical activity, increase awareness to design an educational program of preventive approach, designed to be implemented in the environment school. This program, as well as the back-school, developed and implemented by Zachrisson (1981), aims to reduce the number of musculoskeletal complaints, especially in the spine area, presented by school children. It is believed that postural educational habits also play an essential role in the health of children, the Back-school program is responsible for bringing postural education for the school context, with different preventive strategies for children to apply in their daily lives.
This back-school education program recommends the following postural habits - Seated; standing; lying; backpack and transportation; Weight of transport:
- Sitting: Maintenance of standing back against the back of the chair; positioning the region of the closest possible glutes of the chair and your feet flat on the floor. Where the chair did not allow proper support of the feet on the ground, the students were asked to put a support (books, shoe box);
- Standing with the upright head; back straight and feet apart at shoulder width;
- Lying in lateral decubitus cushion in the head with a height equal to distance between the shoulder and neck and pillow between your legs;
- Carry a backpack with a strap on each shoulder, avoid carrying more than 10% by body weight.
- Survey and object transfer: proper way to pick up objects on the floor: perform the activity bending your knees and not the spine; correct way to transfer objects from one place to another, stand in front of the object, hold it with both hands and close to the body, avoiding twisting the trunk.
This program is carried out during physical education classes, with a frequency of 30 minutes 3 times a week for 4 weeks. The sessions with students were always carried out by the principal investigator, PhD in Human Kinetics, and the only teacher the role of observer. Before these sessions with students, the principal investigator instructed the teachers to the same rules to be passed to students, these sessions began a week before the investigation period and lasted until the end of it. These sessions were always conducted by the principal investigator and were conducted only for teachers in lectures with a frequency of 1 time 1 time per week for 5 weeks, giving indications of the positions that should guide their students during the class period.
These attitudes were reinforced with meetings held by the principal investigator, and teachers role of observing the posture of his students and guides them when they are inadequate, indicating the ideas postures provided in study sessions.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>For this purpose, all students in the 5th grade and 9th grade were invited to participate in this study.
In a population of 259 students (121 of 5th grade and 138 of the 9th grade) participated 204 students (78.8%) and 102 students of the 5th grade (84.3%) and 102 students in the 9th grade (73.9% ).
SPSS, 20.0 version was used in order to treat all the statistical data, for normality verification Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied before a descriptive analysis. This last, was calculated based upon standard methods. In order to analyze any characteristically difference between both groups, the t test was applied. In order to find variable relations Pearsons correlate coefficient (r) was applied. The statistically level of significance was establish in p = 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study of the relationship between the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain and postural changes in the children and teenagers are of great relevance, because it allows the establishment of criteria in health care in individuals in the process of growth and maturation. The aim of this study is: i) Verify the influence of the postural habits and postural behavior during school period and; ii) Check if an ergonomics recommendation (with Back School postural recommendation program) can mean positive changes in the perception of back pain, according to ecological and environmental approach. The Back School program has assumed an important role in changing postural habits. We can consider the inclusion of postural education in the school environment with students from the 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education, i.e.  preventive work , clarification and guidance can be developed for children and adolescents acquire attitudes of self-care with the spine and learn to prevent possible postural problems. The individuals were equally separated in two groups: Experimental Group and Control Group. A sample of 204 students from the 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic education (children and teenagers) with age between 10 and 15 years old. Scale of bodily discomfort was adopted to check the references of the level of pain. The results indicated that there is a direct and significant (p &lt;0.01), correlation between the time of onset of pain and perceived that same (2.59+/- 0.88 in chronic pain compared to 2:09+/- 1:09 in acute pain) intensity. Regarding postural habits, 88.5% of participants had poor posture, and these significantly (p &lt;0.01), higher perception of pain (2.44+/- 0.98) compared with participants with adequate postures (2,06+/- 0.83). The relations obtained seem to prove the crucial role that postural education can have in therapeutic/reeducation terms, and especially in terms of prevention.</summary>
