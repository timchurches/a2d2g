    <summary>The study is designed to determine whether an antibiotic called azithromycin (1gram dose) given once a week for a year will reduce the number of chest infections, the severity of these chest infections and decrease the damage these chest infections are doing to the lungs of Aboriginal adults with lung disease.</summary>
