  <interventions>
    <interventions>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure, the outcome of 500 consecutive cases were observed for (operative, post operative complications, long time procedure, or long hospital stay) &amp; divided accordingly to 2 groups complicated and non complicated and the pre-operative variables (e.g history, U.S, or laboratory) will  be tested for significant statistical analysis</interventions>
    <comparator>uncomplicated cases, versus the complicated cases (operative &amp; short post -operative complications, long procedure, long hospital stay) over the early post operative course ( one month)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1- is to define the pre - operative risk factors of a difficult procedure of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. i.e (difficult procedure means complicated cases , long hospital stay, or long procedure). Early operative post operative complication ( as haemorrhage , duct injury &amp;  ileus, etc) 
The cases are classified into two groups complicated  and Non complicated group according to patient's sheet of preoperative operative and post operative sheet including follow up sheet, using clinical examination and assessment or radiological or endoscopic intervention when needed data entry and analysis was done using SPSS  V 17, quantitative data of variables well be represented as means an SD, T test will be used to compare between means of two groups,qualitative data well be presented as numbers and percentage and compared using the Chi square test. Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval well be used to assess the risk of developing complications in relation to the studied variables. All factors proved significant association with complications by crude analysis well be entered into binary logistic regression variation analysis to determine the independent predictors of complications. P is significant if equal or less than 0.05 at confidence interval 95%.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at one month post operative</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>secondary outcome is the morbidity of the procedure
 over all complication rate, and single complication incidence and rate as numbers and percentage from the total sample</outcome>
      <timepoint>early operative post operative complication ( as haemorrhage , duct injury &amp;  ileus) within one month, late complications (as port site hernia) within 6 to 12 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to evaluate the risk factors that may reflect a technical difficulties of the popular procedure like laparscopic cholecystectomy, through identification of the complicated cases (Long procedure, conversion, early complications, or long hospital stay) and to compare with uncomplicated cases reaching may be to a score of difficulty, which may be used for surgical trainee or resident programs</summary>
