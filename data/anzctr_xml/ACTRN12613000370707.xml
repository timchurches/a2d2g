    <concealment>Information regarding the trial will be included as part of the welcome information for all women booking at the hospital.  Potential participants will be identified by clinicians in the antenatal clinic at antenatal visits at greater than or equal to 37 weeks.  All women booked for an induction of labour using intravaginal Prostaglandins at greater than or equal to 37 weeks will be provided with written information regarding the trial by clinicians and given the opportunity to discuss the details of the study with the research midwife.  When the woman presents to the hospital to be induced, the treating clinician will ask the woman if she desires to be involved, she will be invited to sign a consent form, randomized and a staff information sheet will be filed in the medical record.  The research midwife will keep a log of all potentially eligible participants and the reasons for participation or not as per CONSORT guidelines.   

Sealed opaque envelopes will be prepared by MMRC and stored by the research midwife securely in the Birth Suite.  The envelope will be opened by the midwife in Birth Suite at the time of her morning review (and after obtaining written consent).  Given the nature of the proposed intervention (administration of PGE2/artificial rupture of membranes) it is not possible to blind the clinicians or the patient as to their allocation.     </concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be according to computer-generated random allocation list into 2 study arms.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 250 would detect 
a) a difference of 5 hours (20.5 hours to 15.5 hours) in  the time from 1st dose PGE2 to birth and
b) an increase in proportion of in-hours births from 25% to 44% 
with a power of 80% and a type error of 0.05

These assumptions are based on the observed outcomes following the introduction of a policy change at Mater Health Services and Bundaberg Base Hospital.  

Statistical analyses of the data will be performed by the investigators in consultation with a statistician. The initial analysis will assess the adequacy of randomization procedure in ensuring comparability of the study groups. In this analysis demographic and other baseline characteristics will be compared. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed comparing the study groups. The Chi squared test will be used for categorical outcomes and students t-test for data measured on a continuous scale.   If imbalance is identified in important baseline characteristics or demographics, a second analysis will be undertaken controlling for these factors using multivariate analysis.    The level of significance for the primary outcome measures is set at 0.05 and Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons will be undertaken for secondary outcome measures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Induction of labour is very common and may be associated with increased obstetric intervention.  Information which helps guide the best approach to induction would potentially benefit many women and may help reduce healthcare costs.  It is proposed to conduct a randomised controlled trial of women undergoing induction of labour who have commenced induction with a single dose of intravaginal Prostaglandin gel (PGE2). Women would be randomised to PGE2 arm (continue to administer further doses of PGE2 until the cervix is ripened and then perform an artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) and commence Syntocinon infusion to induce contractions) or the ARM group (perform ARM immediately or as soon as technically possible, followed by Syntocinon infusion to induce contractions).</summary>
