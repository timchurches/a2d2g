      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) - An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label, randomized, parallel group study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      obinutuzumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone
      or prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy versus rituximab (MabThera/Rituxan) with CHOP in previously
      untreated participants with cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20)-positive diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Participants will be randomized to receive either obinutuzumab 1000
      milligrams (mg) intravenously (IV) every 21 days or rituximab 375 milligrams per square meter
      (mg/m^2) IV every 21 days for 8 cycles, in addition to 6-8 cycles of CHOP chemotherapy IV
      every 21 days. Participants randomized to the obinutuzumab arm will receive an additional two
      doses on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. Anticipated time on study treatment is 24 weeks.</summary>
