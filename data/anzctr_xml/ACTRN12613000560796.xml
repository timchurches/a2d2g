  <interventions>
    <interventions>Stage 1 - Focus groups will be conducted with 30 health professionals with previous experience working with cancer patients from cultural and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds. Participants will be asked to undertake a 60 min focus group that will explore personal cultural awareness and values surrounding diversity; problem areas of communication with CALD patients; perceived barriers and enablers to effective communication with CALD patients; issues involved in working with interpreters; coping with divergent cultural beliefs about cancer.  Stage 2 - The findings from Stage 1 will inform the development of two communication skills training (CST) interventions - a self-paced (2 hour total duration) interactive online component and a 1 1/2 hr workshop. The workshop will be conducted after participants have undertaken the online component, and will use role-play simulations to demonstrate how to apply communication skills in a realistic clinical scenario.  Stage 3 - Randomised phase II feasibility study. Approximately 140 health professionals will be randomised to either 1) complete the online CST intervention only or 2) complete the online intervention followed by the 1 1/2 hr workshop. Both groups will complete the same online intervention. Both groups will be given 2 weeks from completing the baseline questionnaire within which to complete the online program. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire (T1), post-intervention questionnaire immediately after (T2), and then again six months post-intervention (T3). The questionnaire will evaluate the perceived impact of the interventions on actual clinical practice, confidence, and readiness to experiment with culturally competent communication. Usage data will be collected including time spent online, modules accessed, duration and completion of each module, time of day of access to modules. The workshop will be undertaken within 12 weeks of completing the online program. </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-rated competence in communicating with CALD patients. This measure includes 8 Likert-type items adapted from previous CST studies. </outcome>

T3 (six months post-intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived practice and readiness to communicate in a culturally competent manner - 
This measure includes 16 Likert-type response items. These will be framed to assess the frequency of behaviours eg "How often do you check understanding of complex concepts with your CALD patients?" (practice) or "How likely are you to try out different ways of dealing with the same communication problem involving CALD patients?" (readiness)</outcome>
      <timepoint>T2 (post-intervention)
T3 (six months post-intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction with the intervention - 
This measure includes 7 Likert-type response items that will assess different components of the interventions including: perceived relevance, usefulness, and acceptability; relevance of cultural scenarios; quality of case scenarios. Participants allocated to the online +workshop intervention arm will also be assessed on perceived quality of the facilitation, perceived usefulness of feedback and the opportunity to practise skills through role-playing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>T2 (post-intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functionality - 
Three items will assess the functionality of the online intervention including ease of navigating the website, quality and ease of viewing the video case studies online, and the ease of accessing additional resources. </outcome>
      <timepoint>T2 (post-intervention)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preference for format of intervention - 
Approximately 15 items will elicit preferences for the process, length, content, and format of the interventions. For example: "I would prefer to attend a workshop of longer/shorter duration." or "I would have like the online website to be shorter."</outcome>

Allowing for a loss to follow up at six months of 10%, a sample size of 71 in each intervention group will be included at baseline to achieve a final sample size at the six-month follow up of 64. This will detect changes across time in self-rated confidence in communicating with CALD patients of 0.5 of an effect size with 80% power at a 5% significance level (2-sided), which we consider a clinically significant change. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will develop and evaluate an online communication skills training program and compare it in terms of efficacy to an online + workshop training program for oncology health professionals working with cultural and linguistically diverse patients. 

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a health professional aged 18 years or more, who has worked for at least two consecutive years in an oncology setting in the fields of medical oncology, radiation oncology or as an oncology nurse. 

Trial details: Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in both groups will undertake an online communication skills training intervention. This involves undertaking a self-paced, interactive online module (approximately 2 hours in duration), to be completed within two weeks of completing the baseline questionnaire. Participants in group 2 will also attend a 1 1/2 hour workshop within 12 weeks of  completion of the online intervention that will develop communication skills through role-played scenarios. Participants will be assessed on completion of the intervention to evaluate their competence in communicating with cultural and linguistically diverse patients, and satisfaction with the program. </summary>
