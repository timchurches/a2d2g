    <interventions>Randomisation of Carbon Dioxide versus Air as the insufflation agent during colonoscopy &amp; impacts this has on post-procedural pain/discomfort

Patients presenting for colonoscopy with an intact colon (that is not had any previous bowel resections) will be randomised through concealed envelopes to either carbon dioxide or air as their insufflation agent during their procedure. Once the procedure is completed, the patient will be asked to rate their pain using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) from 0-10 by a blinded trained member of the nursing staff. Scoring of pain will take place at 15, 30 &amp; 60 minutes post procedure.

Air or carbon dioxide will ONLY be used for the duration of the colonoscopic procedure for which the patient has been consented for. The agent will be used to insufflate the colon to enable the procedure to be performed; the duration will be until completion of the colonoscopy as deemed by the proceduralists. The amount insufflated per agent during a procedure is not routinely recorded (as it makes no physiological difference) and the time for the colonoscopy varies accordingly (in fact, it is one of our secondary endpoints - to measure the time to completion and determine if a difference exists between the two agents). There will be otherwise no difference as to what is performed during a 'routine' colonoscopy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Air is the control treatment; at present most colonoscopic procedures are performed using air as the insufflation agent. Although carbon dioxide is available as an alternative in most institutions/endoscopic units, the standard is still air and the choice of agent is presently left up to the individual proceduralist to determine.</comparator>

      <timepoint>The proceduralist will be asked to complete a short questionnaire indicating if they had successfully completed the procedure or had abandoned it for whatever reason in free text (difficult sedation, difficult anatomy, etc.). This is to ensure that all patients recruited have a complete colonoscopy for purposes of data analysis; those that have an abandoned procedure will be withdrawn from the trial.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Patients are placed on the colonoscopy waiting list for their procedure by a treating specialist at the hospital after being assessed as requiring the procedure. Although specialists consenting these patients for the procedure will be aware that this trial exists, they are not involved in recruiting patients for the trial and will be unaware if the patient is to be included or not.

Patients are then met prior to their colonoscopy and are informed about the trial using a Patient Information &amp; Consent Form by a member of the research team. Once they have consented, they are randomised to a treatment arm by the investigator contacting the Department Secretary. All randomisation are done using the randomisation function of Microsoft Excel and placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Upon contact, the Department Secretary will open a sealed envelope and inform the investigator whether the patient has been randomised to air or CO2.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation is done using the equation function of Microsoft Excel where the random generator number function is used; subsequently this list is then sort according to order &amp; allocated to either air or CO2.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Air is currently used as the insufflation agent during colonoscopy to allow for visualisation &amp; detection of colorectal lesions. Recently, there has been a trend towards introducing carbon dioxide as an alternative agent as this reportedly reduces post-procedural discomfort. There have been several trials internationally that have revealed this trend, but none so far in Australia.

Our aim is to randomise adult patients with intact colons (those who have not undergone any bowel resection) to either air and carbon dioxide with the aim of assessing and comparing their post-procedural discomfort using a visual analog scale from 0 to 10. Other information such as the time to completion of the procedure and time to reach the end of the colon (that is the caecum) will be obtained.

We propose that the use of carbon dioxide as the insufflation agent during colonoscopy is better in terms of improvement of post-procedural discomfort than air.</summary>
