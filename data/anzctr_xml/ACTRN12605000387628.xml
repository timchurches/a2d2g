  <interventions>
    <interventions>BCSG 27-02 is being conducted internationally by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG). The study is coordinated in Australia and New Zealand by Breast Cancer Trials (formerly the Australia and New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group). This trial will evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after radical treatment of a first loco-regional recurrence of breast cancer. IBCSG 27-02 is an international, multicentre, randomised phase III clinical trial of 977 patients with radically treated isolated local and/or regional recurrence of invasive breast cancer after mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery. Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive one of the following: a. Chemotherapy b. Observation Patients may receive radiation therapy and hormonal treatment if the tumour is hormone receptor positive. The adjuvant chemotherapy and hormonal therapy regimen selected is at the discretion of the treating clinician in accord with protocol guidelines. Hormonal therapy is mandatory for patients with ER and or PgR receptor positive tumours. The type and duration of the hormonal therapy is at the discretion of the treating clinician, and will be based on the patient's menopausal status and any previous hormonal therapy treatment. Standard doses and agents should be used. The adjuvant chemotherapy is preferred to consist of 2 or more drugs for a duration of between 3 and 8 cycles, to commence within 4 weeks of randomisation and within 10 weeks of loco-regional recurrence. Radiotherapy is mandatory for patients who have not received prior adjuvant radiotherapy. </interventions>

      <timepoint>Causes of deaths without relapse of breast cancer will be assessed at the time of two interim analyses planned prior to reaching four years of median follow-up.  The target number of events for the study is 347 so, interim analyses will be planned after 135 events and after 240 events have been observed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life - Results of a questionnaire completed by each patient, will compare differences in QL between patients randomised to receive adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of an operable local or regional recurrence of breast cancer and patients randomised to the observation arm</outcome>
      <timepoint>Quality of Life will be assessed at randomisation and at months 9 and 12  from time of randomisation</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Breast cancer sometimes recurs locally (comes back in the breast, chest or lymph nodes) despite the best initial treatment. Women with breast cancer that has recurred locally are usually treated with further surgery, radiation and/or hormone therapy. This international phase III trial will determine if adding chemotherapy to the standard treatment for a local recurrence can further improve cure rates for such women. Women who enter the trial will be randomly assigned to receive standard treatment or standard treatment plus chemotherapy. The type of chemotherapy will be chosen by the treating doctor.</summary>
