  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomized double blind prospective study will be conducted on 90 patients aged 18 years or above undergoing modified radical mastectomy. Patients will be randomly assigned into three groups (30 patients each).Patients in group ketamine bupivacaine (KB) will receive  PECs block with 30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine added to ketamine hydrochloride 1mg/kg .Patients in group dexmedetomidine bupivacaine (DB) will receive PECs block with 30 ml of 0.25%bupivacaine added to dexmedetomidine 1ug/kg .Patients in bupivacaine group(B) will receive PECs block with 30 ml of 0.25%bupivacaine .


The local anaesthesia will be prepared by our hospital pharmacy  in unlabeled 30 ml syringes according to the randomization table and will be handed to the anaesthetist before starting the procedure.Both the patients and the anesthetist will beblinded to the study drug.

In  all  patients  general anesthesia will be induced using 2 µg/kg fentanyl, 2.5mg/kg propofol and 1 mg/kg lidocaine. Endotracheal intubation will be facilitated by 0.5 atracurium and will be maintained by 1 MAC sevoflurane in 50% Oxygen /air mixture in a low flow breathing system (FiO2 = 0.5) .
PECs block will be done in all patient by an anaesthetist blinded to the solution to be injected. PECs block will be done with an in plane Ultrasound guidance to inject  10 ml of the local anesthetic solution between pectoralis major and pectoralis minor  muscles and 20 ml the needle is then advanced from the medial to lateral side parallel to the ultrasound beam and then 20ml of the solution is injected between  the pectoralis minor and serratus anterior muscles

    <statisticalmethods>80% power of detecting difference at 0.05 level of significance using a confidence interval of 95% was obtained by calculating sample size of 30 patients patients per group giving a total target of 90 patients to enforce the study.
Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version17.0. One-way ANOVA will be used to compare mean age , weight, baseline hemodynamics, duration of anesthesia  and surgery, total morphine consumption, time for first analgesic rescue  ,  and intraoperative fentanyl requirements among the three groups. A value of p &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Pearsons chi-squared or Fishers exact test will be used to compare the need for rescue analgesics, satisfaction score and side effects. Repeated measures ANOVA will be used to perform inter-group comparisons for HR, BP and NRS. Post hoc analysis was performed with Tukeys test. KruskalWallis will be applied to compare sedation scores among the three groups. If found significant, then pairwise MannWhitney test will be applied as a post hoc test and a p value &lt; 0.02 will be considered significant due to the Bonferroni correction.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Significant postoperative pain can follow major surgical procedures for cancer breast . postoperative pain that not well controlled has a lot of negative consequences as the patient sufferings, more hospital costs with extended hospital stay, and it is a risk factor in the development of chronic post-mastectomy pain .Procedural interventions involving regional blocks are found to be more effective than pharmacologic means .Pecs 1 and 2 can provide effective postoperative analgesia for such procedures . Pecs 1 and 2 blocks are field blocks that aim to deposit the local anesthetic between the pectoralis major and minor muscles and between pectoralis minor and serratus anterior respectively to block the different peripheral nerves supplying breast and so providing complete analgesia for breast surgery . Dexmetomedine an alpha2 receptor agonist has been used as an adjuvant to local anesthetic for various regional anesthetic techniques with significant prolongation of duration of analgesia . Ketamine a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist has a reported local anesthetic and analgesic properties .Studies on caudal administration of ketamine combined with the local anesthetic has shown that it is effective for prolonging the duration of postoperative analgesia.  Very few studies about the efficacy of ketamine for prolonging the duration of analgesia when combined with local anesthetic for peripheral nerve blocks with different conclusions. 
Therefore our study was planned to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of ultrasound guided Pecs 1 and 2 blocks with local bupivacaine versus bupivacaine added to either ketamine or dexmetomidine in patients undergoing breast cancer surgery.
