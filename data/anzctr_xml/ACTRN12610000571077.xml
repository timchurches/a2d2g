  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the effectiveness of nimotuzumab (TheraCIM h-R3) in combination with external radiotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at stage IIB, III and IV. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have non-small cell lung cancer which is suitable for palliative radiation therapy, and is at stage IIB, III or IV. 

Trial details
Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will receive 200 mg nimotuzumab in addition to 2 weeks' standard radiation. The second group will receive a non-active compound (placebo) plus standard radiation. 
Despite aggressive surgical and chemotherapeutic interventions, non-small cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in men and women, with overall cure rates of less than 15%. Nimotuzumab is a novel therapy which may offer new hope.</summary>
