  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention arm will be asked to rinse and gargle a 20 mL alcohol-based mouthwash (i.e. Listerine) for 60 seconds under direct observation with a stopwatch before they receive standard treatment for pharyngeal gonorrhoea on the day. The standard treatment for pharyngeal gonorrhoea is Ceftriaxone 500mg in 2mL of 1% lignocaine as a single intramuscular injection plus a single dose of oral capsule Azithromycin 1 gram. All participants will be asked to rinse and gargle once only, and no follow-ups and adherence to the intervention is required in this study. </interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Proportion of pharyngeal gonorrhoea positive by culture at the tonsils. Testing will be ascertained from MSHC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the day of randomisation. Pharyngeal swabs will be taken by the clinicians before rinse/gargle, and 5 minutes after rinse/gargle. No follow-ups is required in this study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of pharyngeal gonorrhoea positive by culture at the posterior pharynx. Testing will be ascertained from MSHC</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the day of randomisation. Pharyngeal swabs will be taken by the clinicians before rinse/gargle, and 5 minutes after rinse/gargle. No follow-ups is required in this study. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of using alcohol-based mouthwash as a preventive intervention for pharyngeal gonorrhoea. This will be assessed using questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed by the principal investigator and has been reviewed and revised by several associate investigators.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the day of randomisation. Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire including questions on their recent sexual behaviours, general information on the use of mouthwash, and the acceptability of possible preventative and intervention options to prevent against pharyngeal gonorrhoea. The questionnaire will take approximately 5 minutes and will be given to participants in a hard copy format. No follow-ups is required in this study. The outcome will be assessed before the intervention.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A researcher who is not involved in this trail will out the group allocations into 60 sealed and opaque envelopes. All sealed envelopes will be locked in an office, with access restricted to the study team, and sequentially taken for each new recruit. The coordinator recruiting patients will be unaware of the study group until the envelope is opened in front of the patient. Patients in both groups (i.e. Listerine or saline) will receive standard treatment straight after the second pharyngeal swab was taken.</concealment>
    <sequence>A simple 1:1 randomisation in blocks will be used to ensure equal numbers in each arm of the trail. The sequence will be generated by computer software (i.e. Stata). </sequence>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We have assumed that we would recruit about 75% of men who are diagnosed with pharyngeal gonorrhoea to the intervention study. If we assume alcohol-containing mouthwash can reduce the proportion of cases who have a positive pharyngeal culture by 50% (from 80% to 40%) we would need 28 individuals in each arm or 56 individuals in total in the intervention study at 80% power with a 2-side significance level of alpha=0.05. We would like to round the sample size (n=56) to the nearest 10 (n=60) with 30 in each arm because there will be a very small proportion of participants are willing to take the intervention but may not be willing to complete the questionnaire.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Men who have sex with men tested positive for pharyngeal gonorrhoea at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC) who volunteer will be randomised to receive an alcohol-containing mouthwash or a saline on the day when they receive treatment for pharyngeal gonorrhoea. The primary outcome is the proportion of cases who test positive for pharyngeal gonorrhoea by culture after gargling an alcohol-containing mouthwash.     </summary>
