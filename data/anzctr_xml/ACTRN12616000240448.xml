  <interventions>
    <interventions>Skin-to-skin care (SSC), defined as placing a newborn prone directly onto their mothers or fathers chest 
a) duration: first 30 min of SSC will be defined as washout period and the subsequent 60 min of SSC will be used for the primary outcome. The duration of SSC will therefore last for at least 1.5 hours but might be continued as long as desired to avoid handling the preterm infants.
b) NIRS assessment: the regional cerebral oxygenation (rcO2) will be measured with a small Fore-Sight Sensor (CAS Med. Medical Systems Inc., Branford, CT, USA), which will be placed on the infants forehead. The sensor will be connected to the Fore-Sight device (CAS Med. Medical Systems Inc., Branford, CT, USA) and this will be connected to the monitor. Continuous data will be recorded.
c) There are three observation periods mentioned above: 1. baseline period (control) 2. intervention period, 3. post-intervention period. Each period contains a 30 min washout period and a 60 min observation period. However, SSC might be continued as long as desired to avoid handling of the preterm infants. The recordings after the 60 min
observation period will not be analysed for the primary outcome. 
d) The NISC nurse will organise and supervise the SSC and the unit protocol will be used to transfer and manage the infant during the SSC. The researchers will be responsible for the placement and management of the NIRS probe. No special training will be necessary for nurses looking after babies in the study, but in-servicing about the study will be
provided. 
e) The researcher will stay on the bedside during the whole study time to record handling of the infant and other possible influencing factors.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size and power estimates:
The outcome measure for this study is the difference in regional cerebral oxygenation between ski-to-skin and incubator care for each patient (ie the paired difference in percentage oxygenation). The required sample size is therefore dependent on the standard deviation of these paired differences. 
Before we began the study the first study (NIRSCC, ACTRN: ACTRN12615000959572), we had no estimate as to the probable size of this standard deviation, so we calculated our required sample size (68 patients) based on effect size: we assumed that skin-to-skin care was 0.1 standard deviations worse than incubator care, and set a non-inferiority margin of 0.5 standard deviations. After we had recruited 15 patients, the standard deviation of the paired differences in our sample was 1.8.  So, assuming that the true standard deviation of the paired differences is 2.0, the non-inferiority margin the study was powered for was 1% (ie skin-to-skin would be considered inferior if regional cerebral oxygenation was 1% less in skin-to-skin than in incubator care). We decided that this non-inferiority margin was too small, and that the smallest non-inferiority margin that would be clinically meaningful would be a 1.5% difference. We have therefore recalculated the sample size: With 40 patients, the study will have greater than 90% probability that the lower end of the 95%CI for the paired difference in oxygenation  will be &gt;-1.5%, assuming that the true difference between skin-to-skin and incubator care is -0.2%, and the standard deviation of the paired difference in oxygenation is 2.0. 
We decided to use the estimated sample size of 40 patients for the NIRSSC-2 study. 
Again the statistician will review the SD of the mean differences between incubator care and skin-to-skin care after studying 15 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Skin-to-skin contact (SSC) has advantages for newborn babies. It increases weight gain, reduces mortality, severe infection, and length of hospital stay. There are, however, conflicting results from studies, which measured physiological parameters (heart rate, breathing frequency and oxygen saturation) of preterm babies.  This uncertainty is a barrier to implementation of SSC especially in very immature preterm babies. Both too much and too little oxygen supply to the brain contributes to morbidity and mortality in very preterm babies. Regional brain oxygenation (rcO2) can now be measured by a technology called near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). There is a lack of knowledge about brain oxygenation during SSC. If stability in rcO2 during SSC could be demonstrated this would provide reassurance that SSC is safe and could be used in immature babies. The primary objective of this study is to measure rcO2 during SCC compared with measurements when the baby is being cared for in their incubator or cot. We aim to include 40 very preterm babies with a gestational age at birth less than 33 weeks. We hypothesise that rcO2 remains stable during SSC (noninferiority trial). The brain oxygen levels will not be visible to the medical and nursing staff. The primary outcome will be changes (mean of the differences) in rcO2 between SSC (intervention) and incubator care (baseline) (1 hour period for each observation). Secondary outcome will be changes (mean of the differences) in physiological parameters e.g. peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) equal to (SpO2  rcO2)/SpO2) heart rate (HR), and respiratory rate (RR), axillary body temperature and sleep status (quiet sleep vs. active sleep)  between SSC (intervention) and incubator care (baseline), the number of hypoxemic (SpO2 less than 80%) and bradycardic episodes (bradycardia: fall in instantaneous HR by one third of the infants baseline HR lasting for at least 5 seconds between SSC (intervention) and incubator care (baseline), changes (mean of the differences) in rcO2, SpO2, fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) equal to (SpO2  rcO2)/SpO2, HR, RR, number of hypoxemic and bradycardic episodes, axillary body  temperature, and sleep status (quiet sleep vs. active sleep) between post intervention incubator care and pre-intervention incubator care (baseline) (1 hour period for each observation). Further sub group analysis will be changes (mean of the differences) in rcO2 obtained during washout period with those obtained during the main observation period for all three periods (baseline, intervention, postintervention) and changes in rcO2 (mean of the differences) obtained during feeding periods with the rest of the observation period for all three periods (baseline, intervention, post-intervention). </summary>
