  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this system vital signs (with informed consent) will be gathered from patients and sent to a control unit for centralized monitoring. The system can complement the role of nurses in monitoring patients vital signs. They will be able to focus on holistic needs of patients thereby providing better personal care. Advance and complex medical algorithms will be developed in order to detect several events by using vital signs. 

Wireless network technologies will be utilized for transmission of vital signs in the proposed system, as they provide flexibility and mobility to patients. The proposed system will be tested in real-time in public hospital wards after obtaining ethical approval. The capability, suitability and limitation of the chosen technology and the results will be evaluated and validated with two different methods, i.e. comparing with other systems and by agreement with expert using Kappa analysis.

Total 30 participants will be considered. Each participant will be monitored for 5 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Older patient monitoring: Older people can be monitored continuously or periodically from a remote place (home), older people home, rest home, handicap home, or hospital.
This will help reducing work load of medical staff and access to the patient's vital data. This outcome will be validated with two different methods, i.e. comparing with similar remote monitoring systems and by agreement using Kappa analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at sixth month after the sample data collected</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Early and multiple disease detection: The early detection of the events, by giving a warning or alarm, so that any critical situation can be avoided and depending upon the input parameters, different events can be detected. This outcome will also be validated with two different methods, i.e. comparing with similar monitoring systems and by agreement using Kappa analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at sixth month after the sample data collection</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Better health monitoring: Proposed system will monitor patient's vital signs continuously, identify events and alerts medical staff in case of an emergency. This system can be implemented in hospital or home. In case of hospital it will reduce work load of medical staff and in case of home, it will reduce patient's travelling time, money, doctor's time, hospital cost and patient will have its environment freedom. This outcome will be validated by agreement with the expert using Kappa analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at one year after the data collection</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is aimed to evaluate and develop an intelligent monitoring system combined with biological data for patient (human) tracking and monitoring. This project aims to improve the performance of current patient monitoring systems by identifying the shortfalls of existing technology and developing a system for providing alerts to the health care professionals as well as the user in the event of detecting a serious illness symptom.</summary>
