  <interventions>
    <interventions>A new 10-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (10vPCV- Synflorix(Registered Trademark)) is now available as an intervention. Like the old intervention, a 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix is given 0.5ml intramuscular (IM). There are two groups in the study: Group 1: 1 dose of 10vPCV for those children &amp; adolescents who completed their primary 7vPCV course (3 doses) Group 2: 3 doses of 10vPCV 2 months apart for all other children &amp; adolescents diagnosed with leukaemia.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary study end point is a blood test measuring serologic response (defined as detection of titres &gt; 0.35 microgram/mL measured by serotype specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to at least 3 pneumococcal serotypes) to primary immunisation, or, in patients exhibiting protective antibody levels prior to first vaccination, a greater than 2-fold increase from baseline antibody concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Group 1: 1 month post the single 10vPCV vaccine dose Group 2: 1 month post the third 10vPCV vaccine dose There are two different time points reflect those receining a booster (group 1); compared to those receiving a primary course (group 2)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>functional immune response to the 10vPCV measure by avidity and opsonphagocytosis assay (OPA)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Group 1: 1 month post the single 10vPCV vaccine dose Group 2: 1 month post the third 10vPCV vaccine dose There are two different time points reflect those receining a booster (group 1); compared to those receiving a primary course (group 2)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of the vaccine with a particular focus on tolerability in the older age group (10-18 years) for which 10vPCV is currently not licensed</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout the study- a safety diary is to be kept by the patient/guardian for 5 days post each vaccine dose. 

On day 5 post each vaccine dose the patient will be contacted by the researchers to complete a complementary safety data log of any reactions. The patient/family will also be able to contact the study team at any point if they have any concerns.</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria will include those children who suffer a relapse or have a Bone Marrow Transplant. If a study subject relapses following commencement of the study they will be excluded from further participation. Patients will not be vaccinated until their blood count is satisfactory: platelets&gt;/= 50 x109/L and neutrophils&gt;/=500 x 106/L. Recent immunoglobulin (within last 9 months) or previous severe adverse reaction to vaccinations will also be exclusion criteria as per the Australian Immunisation guidelines.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children receiving cancer therapy are at an increased risk of illness and death due to Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD), caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae. This study aims to determine the immune response in the blood (immunogenicity) of pneumococcal vaccination given as soon as possible after diagnosis in children and adolescents with leukaemia.

A 10-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (10vPCV), marketed as Synflorix(Registered Trademark), came onto the National Immunisation Program in 2009. The latest Australian Immunisation Guidelines (9th edition) recommend that those who develop haematological malignancies, such as leukaemia, have pneumococcal vaccine boosters according to their age. It is recommended that the pneumococcal vaccines be given as early as possible after diagnosis and ideally before chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is started. 

This study aims to protect leukaemia patients from IPD as soon as possible after diagnosis. The study patients will be divided into two groups:

Group 1: 1 dose of 10vPCV vaccine for those children &amp; adolescents who have already completed their childhood primary pneumococcal conjugate vaccine course (3 doses) 
      Group 2: 3 doses of 10vPCV vaccine 2 months apart for all other children &amp; adolescents

The endpoint is a blood test 1 month after each dose.  That is Group 1 is assessed once and Group 2 is assessed 3 times. The blood test is to determine if the participants have responded as well as healthy subjects to at least 5 of the 10 serotypes in the Synflorix(Registered Trademark) 10vPCV vaccine.</summary>
