  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intravenous Cephazolin 50mg/kg every 8 hours or Flucloxacillin 50mg/kg every 6 hours until clinical defervescence, then change to high dose oral Cephalexin 25mg/kg every 6 hours. Antibiotics are given for a minimum 3 week duration. Weekly follow up programme until children are cured clinically, which will be the endpoint of antibiotic treatment . Children are anticipated to have no more that 6 weeks of antibiotics unless clincially indicated, with the reason clearly stated. Children are excluded from the study if they do not acheive clinical defervescence by 10 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Long duration, ie 3-6 weeks, of intravenous Flucloxacillin 50mg/kg every 6 hours or Cephazolin 50mg/kg every 8 hours, via peripherally inserted central catheter, given either by caregivers at home, or given as inpatient. Children will be given antibitoics for a minimun of 3 weeks, and be reviewed weekly to to monitor progress and determine endpoint of treatment. A maximum antibiotic duration of 6 weeks is anticipated unless clinically indicated, the reason for which will be clearly specified.</comparator>

      <outcome>Recurrences of disease
1) Increase in C-reaction protein after defervescence with other symptoms and signs to indicate worsening of disease during tratment. 
2) Fever &gt;38 degrees on two occasions in a 24 hr period, with other cause of fever excluded during treatment
3) New xray change beyong expectation from the initial illness within 12 months from presentation
4) Positive blood cutlures relatedto the initial infection
5) Further surgical complications after defervescence
6) Non-resolution of initial symptoms including fever, bone or joint pain indicative of osteomyelitis +/- septic arthritis during  course of treatment
7) Reappearance of inital symptoms including fever, bone or joint pain indicative of osteomylitis +/- septic arthritis after completion of treatment.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children with be identified from the Starship daily admission sheet. Most children with suspected musculoskeletal infections will proceed to imaging and / or surgical aspiration or washout within 48 to 72 hours, and be started on intravenous antibiotics prior to or after the dianostic procedures. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, chidlren and their caregivers are approached for recruitment and consent for the study. Randomisation will occur once participants achive defervescence, which is defined by sustained reduction of temperature to normal levels and improvement of pain and symptoms. Allocation is concealed and performed by contacting the holder of allocation schedule who is off site and by computer. Recruitment is allowed from the time of diagnosis to defervescence. 100 children will be recruited into the study over a period of 2 years.</concealment>
    <sequence>Once defervescence is achieved and all diagnostic tests are completed, randomisation by minimisation will be performed using variables including sex, age, and number of surgical procedures. Allocation is concealed. Characteristics of the new subject will be fed into a computer containing the file of characteristics of the children already enrolled in the study. The minimisation software will be run to allocate the new patient. Children are radomised to into 2 treatment groups.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the best treatment of bone infections for children in New Zealand. NZ has one of the highest incidence of osteomyelitis in developed countries. Current hospital management includes 3-6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, partly administered by caregivers at home, via a long intravenous line inserted under general anaesthetics. 
This study investigates if oral antibiotics following a short duration of intravenous therpay are an effective and safe treatment.</summary>
