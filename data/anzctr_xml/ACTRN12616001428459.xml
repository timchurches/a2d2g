  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sensory awareness training - Participants randomised to the sensory awareness group were initially separated and provided sensory awareness training in the form of face-to-face Feldenkrais ATM (awareness through movement) for approximately 40 minutes.  Feldenkrais method is an "..educational system that develops a functional awareness of the self in the environment" (Buchanan &amp; Ulrich 2001).  The practitioner verbally guides participants through a sequence of gentle movements based on functional activities such as reaching, and encourages attention of these.  The initial training was delivered as a group by a trained Feldenkrais practitioner who is also a Neurophysiotherapist.   The initial training was supplemented with audio recordings of two sessions, a 'sitting' session focussing on relaxation and awareness, and another lesson targeting the dominant hand.  Each lesson goes for approximately 40 minutes.  The audio recordings were provided via a CD and a download link, to allow downloading of the audio file over the internet if required.   

(Additional) Motor Practice - Participants randomised to the additional Motor practice group were separated and instructed in methods for motor practice in the form of staged scalpel practice, including: holding a pen in the same manner as a scalpel and replicating usual movement either in free space or on paper, varying the applied pressure; using a scalpel on inanimate objects such as soap or oranges.  The initial session was run by a podiatrist not involved in data collection.  Subsequent sessions could be done by each participant in their own time, although a set time in which participants could access the student clinic for practice was also provided at one of the sites.

Participants from both groups were instructed to undertake training as regularly as they could, but at least three times per week.  The timing of, and specific activity in which they were to engage (ie which lesson for the sensory awareness group, or which motor activity for the additional motor practice group), was not specified but left to the discretion and motivation of each participant.  It was hoped this would improve compliance and reflect more real-life conditions.

Each participant from the two intervention groups were required to keep a small log book of the duration of each practice session undertaken and the chosen activity was completed.  The training period was defined as being of at least two weeks duration, but needed to be continued until follow-up testing was undertaken.

    <statisticalmethods>An apriori power calculation was determined based on the Purdue pegboard measures from a study with a related intervention.  This was based on 80% power and an effect size of 0.75.  Categorical values for each group (such as location, sex, handedness, musical instrument history and gaming history) were compared using a Chi Square analysis.  Continuous variables (such as age, height and intervention duration) were compared using a generalised linear model univariate analysis of variance.  Data were evaluated for distribution and transformed as necessary.  Evaluation of the psychological measures from the IMI were evaluated using a repeated measures mixed model analysis with location included as a fixed effect to account for possible variation between the sites.  The objective dexterity tests were compared for between group differences using repeated measures mixed model analysis.  Age, sex, location, handedness and other demographic variables were either included or removed as fixed variables to determine the most appropriate model based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values.  Significance was set at p &lt; 0.05</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of two separate interventions via a randomised controlled trial on the dextrous performance of novice podiatry students in order to identify an evidence-based strategy to help target students struggling with manual clinical skills. One of the interventions will target afferent input (sensory system) via sensory awareness training whilst the other will target efferent output (motor system) via additional motor practice.</summary>
