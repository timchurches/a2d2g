This trial registration is for the FASHIoN study sites in the United Kingdom. The same study is also underway in Australia. The Australian arm of FASHIoN includes the same outcome measures and study protocol as the UK study #ISRCTN64081839. In addition the Australian study includes radiographic (structural) and biomechanical measures. 
The Australian sites were assumed to be under the same trial registration ISRCTN64081839 as the parent UK FASHIoN study until very recently the decision was made to register the Australian arm of FASHIoN separately. </secondaryid>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>140 participants will be recruited from sites in Australia. Participation will be over a 3-year period. Participants will be allocated to either:
1. Hip Arthroscopic Surgery - performed by an experienced trained surgeon will involve viewing and treatment of the hip joint through a minimally invasive arthroscope inserted into the hip joint. Detailed guidelines for acetabular rim trimming, labral repair, labral resection, chondroplasty, microfracture and osteochondroplasty of the femoral head-neck junction will be followed by all surgeons consistent with the FASHIoN trial protocol. This procedure takes approximately 1.5- 2 hours
Pre-operative: 
Patients will undergo routine preoperative care, including an anaesthetic consult assessing fitness for surgery and general anaesthesia. 
Peri-operative:  
Arthroscopic hip surgery will be performed under general anaesthesia in a lateral or supine position.  Arthroscopic portals will be established in the central and peripheral compartment under radiographic guidance according to the surgeons usual practice. Shape abnormalities and consequent labral and cartilage pathology will be treated. Bony resection at the acetabular rim and at the head-neck junction will be assessed by intraoperative image intensifier radiograph and/or satisfactory impingement free range of movement of the hip. Osteo-integrative anchors will be used during the surgical procedure to avoid any issues with post-op MRI quality and dGEMRIC accuracy.
Post-operative: 
Patients will be allowed home when they can walk safely with crutches (usually within 24h hours). On discharge all patients will be referred to outpatient physiotherapy services for a course of rehabilitation as per usual care for that surgeon. We will not specify a protocol for the duration, mode and format of this post-operative physiotherapy. These post-operative physiotherapists will be distinct from those providing PHT to avoid contamination between groups.  Patients will also have a post-op MRI done at 12 months.

2. Best Conservative Care - a package of physiotherapy-led therapy entitled 'Personalised Hip Therapy' given over a 12-week period with an option of booster sessions up to 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>A course of best conventional care (a structured programme of exercise-based care supervised by a physiotherapist - this has been called personalised hip therapy) aimed at improving the muscle strength and control around the hip joint.
PHT is a package of physiotherapy-led best conventional care for FAI.  It was developed during the UK FASHIoN feasibility study and 'road-tested' during the pilot trial. Although the name for this intervention is new, the care being offered represents a consensus of what physiotherapists, physicians and surgeons currently provide, and regard as 'best conventional care' for FAI. PHT will be delivered by at least one qualified physiotherapist at each site, who will be trained in a FASHIoN PHT workshop.
Pre-treatment. 
Participants will receive a PHT information pack that describes what to expect during the course of their treatment. The first core component of PHT is an assessment of pain, function and range of hip motion. 
Treatment. 
PHT has three further core components: (i) an exercise programme that has the key features of individualisation, progression and supervision; (ii) education; and (iii) help with pain relief (which may include an X-ray or ultrasound guided intra-articular steroid injections where pain prevents performance of the exercise programme). The intervention is delivered over a minimum of 12 weeks with a minimum of 6 patient contacts. Some of the patient contacts are permissible using either telephone / email for whom geographical distance prevents all contacts being carried out face-to-face. 
It is recommended that initial appointments are between 40 and 60 minutes, and that follow up appointments are 20-30 minutes.
PHT includes a phased exercise programme that begins with muscle control work, and 	progresses to stretching and strengthening with increasing ROM and resistance. This programme is not a set protocol, rather the physiotherapists are asked to select appropriate exercises from a set of 24 exercises as appropriate for each individual participant.
Participants are provided with a personalised and written exercise prescription that is progressed and revised over treatment sessions, with provision of exercise sheets. Participants are asked to complete their prescribed exercise programme at home, at a frequency and duration deemed appropriate by their treating physiotherapist.
Post-treatment.  
Typically, PHT will be delivered over a minimum of 12 weeks. However, in situations where the patient needs additional review, support or guidance, a further four booster sessions with the physiotherapists are permitted between 12 weeks and 6 months. 

Participant are provided with a treatment diary to monitor progress with their exercise program and to encourage compliance however this is not compulsory.

    <concealment>Possible FAI patients (younger adults with hip pain) will be identified by collaborating surgeons from referral letters. 
Diagnostic consultation:
Surgeons will assess patients as usual, taking a history, examining the patient, and performing appropriate imaging investigations. Patients in whom a diagnosis of FAI is made, and who meet the eligibility criteria, will receive a description of the condition from their surgeon and an explanation that there are two possible treatments: an operation or a package of personalised hip therapy. They will be given patient information about FAI and the trial. Patients will be invited to a trial information consultation to discuss what action they would like to take.
Trial information consultation:
Patients will attend a Trial Information Consultation with a trained clinical researcher. Information will again be provided about FAI and its possible treatments, and about the trial. Patients will be given an opportunity to ask questions. Patients will then be invited to give their consent to become participants in the trial. Patients who wish to take more time to consider will be given an opportunity to do so. Patients who agree to take part will complete baseline questionnaires at this consultation.
Treatment allocation:
Concealed allocation procedures will involve central randomisation by computer.
Participants will be randomly allocated to arthroscopic surgery or personalised hip therapy by 1:1 secure online randomisation provided by Warwick University Clinical Trials Unit (CTU). </concealment>
    <sequence>The recruiting centre and FAI type will be used as stratifying factors when randomising. Each time a participant is randomised these factors will be entered into the computer randomisation program.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Consecutive consented FASHION participants from Melbourne will be approached for consent for the fine wire EMG substudy: In a subgroup of 20 participants, fine wire electrodes will also be used to assess muscle activation patterns of four deep hip muscles: posterior gluteus medius, piriformis, obturator internus, and quadratus femoris. The use of fine wire electrodes is necessary to reach these small deeper muscles surrounding the hip joint that play a critical role in its function and which cannot be accessed using surface EMG. The insertions into the aforementioned muscles will be performed, under real-time ultrasound guidance, by Professor Paul Hodges who has extensive expertise in the use of this technique. Standard sterile procedures will be used.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>The FASHIoN study sites in the  UK have based their sample size to provide adequate power for the analysis of the primary outcome (iHOT-33) which was necessary to satisfy the needs of their funding body. The Australian data will be pooled with the UK data to provide greater applicability of the results of the study. 
Sample size calculations for the Australian FASHIoN sites are based on those necessary for the primary structural outcomes that will only be investigated at the Australian FASHIoN sites (dGEMRIC imaging indices for hip cartilage). This was based on a statistical power of 90%, and two-sided significance of 5%. With a sample size of 54 patients in each group, we expect to detect a difference of at least 50ms between two study groups at 12 months based on a standard deviation (SD) of 80ms for the dGEMRIC index. 50ms was chosen as clinically significant based upon increased risk of subsequent total hip replacement. Previous research identified an R2  0.2-0.3 between indirect external measures of hip joint loading and hip neck bone density in people with hip OA, when two covariates (weight and height) were included, indicating a moderate relationship between biomechanical and structural measures. We expect higher R2 values, given that we have direct estimates of cartilage stress and strain. Being conservative, however, in order to achieve an R2 &gt; 0.2 between cartilage loading stimulus and dGEMRIC scores (with three covariates), a power of 90%, and two-sided significance level of 5% we require a total of 56 patients at each site. We will therefore aim to recruit a total of 140 participants (70 in Melbourne, 70 in Sydney) for the study in order to allow for a drop-out rate of 20%, including 5% cross over to the surgical group. 

The primary analysis will be of differences in baseline and 12 month dGEMRIC indices between the two treatment groups, on an intention-to-treat basis, presented as the mean difference between the trial groups with a 95% confidence interval. The dGEMRIC data will be assumed to be normally distributed; possibly after appropriate variance-stabilising transformation. The stratified randomization procedure should ensure treatment group balance across recruiting centres. We have no reason to expect that clustering effects will be important for this study, but the possibility of such effects will be explored as part of the analysis. We plan to account for clustering by generalizing a conventional linear (fixed-effects) regression approach to a mixed-effects modeling approach; where patients are naturally grouped by recruiting centers (random-effects) and, if amenable to analysis, also by therapist and surgeon. This model will formally incorporate terms that allow for possible heterogeneity in responses for patients due to the recruiting centre, in addition to the fixed effects of the treatment groups, and patient characteristics that may prove to be important moderators of the treatment effect such as age, gender and FAI type. This analysis will be conducted using specialist mixed-effects modeling functions available in the software package R (http://www.r-project.org/). Secondary analyses will be performed using the above strategy for other approximately normally distributed outcome measures including plain radiography, MRI, muscle strength, Full 3D gait analyses, EMG-informed NMS and FEM models, and the symptomatic outcomes (iHOT-33, EuroQoL EQ-5D, and Short-Form-12). Differences in dichotomous outcome variables such as adverse events, complications related to the trial interventions and the need for further procedures will be compared between groups using chi-squared tests (or Fishers exact test) and mixed effects logistic regression analysis will be undertaken, adjusting for the stratifying variables, with differences between trial intervention groups quantified as odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals). The temporal patterns of any complications will be presented graphically and if appropriate a time-to-event analysis (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis) will be used to assess the overall risk and risk within individual classes of complications. Ordinal scores for patient satisfaction will be compared between intervention groups using proportional odds logistic regression analysis, assuming that the estimated intervention effect between any pair of categories is equivalent. Although our inferences will be drawn from the intention-to-treat analysis, we will perform per protocol analyses to place these in context. We plan to perform a subgroup analysis by FAI type because it is likely that treatment effect is moderated by type. We do not anticipate that crossovers will be a major issue for this study. We therefore expect the main analyses to provide definitive results. If not completing (adhering to) or following (complying with) the PHT proves to be more problematic than we expect, we will augment the planned analysis with a complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background and study aims
The hip joint has two bones that fit together like a ball in a socket. In some people these bones press against each other and can cause pain called "femororacetabular impingement" (FAI). Parts of the hip called the 'labrum' and 'cartilage' cushion the hip joint and allow the smooth friction-free movement. FAI can injure both the labrum and cartilage and also cause pain. There is good evidence to suggest a link between FAI and the development of premature osteoarthritis of the hip, but we do not know the best treatment for FAI. There has been a rapid increase in the use of keyhole surgery to treat this condition called 'hip arthroscopy'. During hip arthroscopy the patient is put to sleep and the surgeon passes a small telescope and tools into the hip joint through small cuts in the skin. The tools are used to reshape bone around the hip to prevent further impingement. Many patients have already undergone surgery and had improvements in pain and hip function in the short to medium term. However, this research was not compared to conventional care and it is possible that they may have similar levels of improvement without an operation. An alternative treatment option for patients is a course of best conventional care (a structured programme of exercise-based care supervised by a physiotherapist - this has been called personalised hip therapy) aimed at improving the muscle strength and control around the hip joint. There are fewer risks associated with this type of treatment and it is less expensive. We therefore propose a study to find out which of these two treatments is most effective for treating patients with FAI up to 12 months after treatment. 

Who can participate?
The study aims to recruit 140 patients in Australia with hip pain, aged 16 and above.

What does the study involve? 
Patients are randomly allocated to either undergo arthroscopic surgery or receive usual care. Participants will receive their allocated treatment and will then be required to complete some questionnaires at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Participants will be asked about further procedures required for their hip condition at 2 and 3 years following recruitment. At 12 months we will conduct our first analysis to measure the effectiveness of the two treatments. 

Australian FASHIon study participants will have specialised MRI scans using a contrast agent (gadolinium) used to investigate changes in the hip joint cartilage health. We will ask participants to have these scans when they join the study and after 12 months. Participants at the Melbourne study centres will be asked to attend the gait laboratory at the University of Melbourne where hip range of motion, muscle strength and movement patterns will be assessed. These measures will be taken at baseline and 12 months. An addition subset of 20 participants will be asked to perform some functional tasks with fine wires inserted in their muscles to provide information about their muscle activity. </summary>
