  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will employ a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, three way cross-over design.

Participants will be required to attend three testing sessions (and one practice session). Each session will see participants taking one of three interventions (administered in capsules);

(1) Bacopa Monniera  300mg (2 x 150mg capsules, 2 x placebo capsules)
(2) Bacopa Monneria  600mg (4 x 150mg capsules)
(3) Placebo (4 x capsules)

On the testing days participants will complete baseline testing (consisting of the cognitive demand battery and cardiovascular measures) after which they will be administered their randomly assigned treatment. Two hours post dose participants will complete the testing again (cognitive demand battery and cardiovascular)

There will be a seven day washout period between each testing session.

Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either treatment (1) or (2) or (3) on their first testing day. This will be done by a randomised computer number sequence generator. Over the course of the investigation, they will complete all three treatments with treatment order counterbalanced across participants. A disinterested third party will be responsible for the blinding procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment (3): 4 X 150mg Avicel microcrystalline cellulose capsules

This is a cross over design, so all participants will be administer all treatments on different testing days separated by a one week wash out period.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aiming to determine the effects of Bacopa on cognitive function, cardiovascular function and stress. Bacopa is a herb found in wetlands and muddy shore lines that has been used in traditional Indian medicine as a treatment for epilepsy and asthma. Russo &amp; Borrelli (2005) claim that it has been used for over 3000 years as a memory and intellect enhancer. There is also evidence to suggest that Bacopa is an antioxidant, playing an important role in reducing the oxidation of fats in the bloodstream.

This study will investigate the cognitive, cardiovascular and stress effects of two doses of bacopa compared to placebo.

Participants will be required to attend three testing sessions (and one practice session). Each session will see participants taking one of three interventions (administered in capsules);

(1) Bacopa Monniera  300mg (2 x 150mg capsules, 2 x placebo capsules)
(2) Bacopa Monneria  600mg (4 x 150mg capsules)
(3) Placebo (4 x capsules)

On the testing days participants will complete baseline testing (consisting of the Cognitive demand battery and cardiovascular measures) after which they will be administered their randomly assigned treatment. Two hours post dose participant will complete the testing again (Cognitive demand battery and cardiovascular measures).

There will be a seven day washout period and the process will be repeated again.

Over the course of the investigation, participants will complete all three treatments with treatment order being randomised and counter! balanced across participants.
