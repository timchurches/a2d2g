  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this study, the surgical handling and clinical outcome of two totally different meshes use for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is compared. One is constructed with non-absorbable polypropylene (Prolene) mixed with an absorbable material poliglecaprone 25 (Monocryl) in a single sheet form. (ULTRAPROT, Ethicon Inc., manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson Company) The other mesh we compare is a polyester multifilament mesh constructed in an anatomical form to fit the inguinal canal. (PARIETEXT polyester mesh, Tyco Healthcare Ltd., manufactured by Sofradim Production).  Both types of mesh are applied by laparoscopic means into the extraperitoneal space permanently.

The approximate duration of the procedure is 60-120 minutes.  The primary endpoint is the mesh manipulating time;l therefore, the duration of procedure will be affected by the type of mesh used</interventions>
