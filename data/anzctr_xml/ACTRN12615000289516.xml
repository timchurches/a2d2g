  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ATL1103 is being developed as a potential treatment for acromegaly, a disease of excessive growth hormone and insulin-like growth hormone (IGF-I) action. Approximately four acromegaly patients will receive 300mg ATL1103 twice a week for 13 weeks. All treatments will be administered by subcutaneous injection.

The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a high dose of ATL1103, and to investigate the pharmacokinetic profiles of ATL1103. The effect of ATL1103 on serum IGF-I levels and on other pharmacodynamic markers will also be measured. </summary>
