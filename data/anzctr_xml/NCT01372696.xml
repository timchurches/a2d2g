  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Sample of polyp

Other: Tissue sample - Patients who consent to participate in this study will have a small sample of their polyp and normal tissue sent for molecular testing.


Other interventions: Sample of polyp
A small sample of the colonic polyp will be obtained for molecular testing. The remaining polyp will be sent for regular histological testing

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significant differences in molecular abnormalities. - The aim of this project is to look for statistically significant differences in molecular abnormalities from the three known genetic pathways, between the two different morphological types, granular and non-granular, to potentially demonstrate that these different polyps form via different genetic pathways.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Samples will be looked at and stored for approx 15 years</timepoint>
