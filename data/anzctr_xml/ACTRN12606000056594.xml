  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pilot study: A randomised controlled double blind study of the use of doxycycline to affect levels of CD34 positive cells, VEGF, MMP-9 and other factors following abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.
Grp A: patients will take doxycycline (100mg twice daily) for one week prior to surgery and 4 weeks post operatively.
Grp B: patients will take doxycycline (100mg twice daily) beginning on the day of surgery and for 4 weeks post operatively. Blood samples will be taken prior to, during and after doxycycline administration. Tissue samples will be obtained following surgery.
Main study: A randomised controlled double blind study of the use of doxycycline to affect levels of CD34 positive cells, VEGF, MMP-9 and other factors following superficial venous surgery for varicose veins. Details of this study will be expanded on when results of the pilot study have been analysed. Follow up of all patients with ultrasound, air plethysmography and clinical evaluation at 1 month, 6 months, 1, 3 and 5 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Main study: The recurrence of ultrasound detected venous reflux at the ligated saphenofemoral junction site in the groin due to neovascularisation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Outcome measured at one month, 6 months, 1 year and 3 years post surgery, with a possible 5 years follow up as well (unknown at this point)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pilot study: Primary outcome: patient tolerance of long-term doxycycline administration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tolerance will be monitored on a week to week basis during doxycycline administration, with patients to contact research staff if they experience any problems in between visits.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Main study secondary outcomes:a: Clinical recurrence, venous clinical severity score, patient satisfaction questionnaire, perforator recurrence after ligation. 
Levels of the factors mentioned above will be measured while the administration of doxycycline is ongoing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Outcome measured at one month, 6 months, 1 year and 3 years post surgery and possibly 5 years (unknown at this time point).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pilot study: Measurement of CD34 positive cells, VEGF levels, MMP-9 levels prior.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During and post surgery at one week intervals.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Double blinding:Main study only: Patients will be given doxycycline or placebo in identical bottles. Research staff involved in measurements will not be aware of the group getting doxycycline, although doctors involved in care of patient (eg GPs) will be notified. 
Primary goal of the main study will be to determine whether doxycycline is able to prevent neovascularisation in patients following superficial venous surgery.</summary>
