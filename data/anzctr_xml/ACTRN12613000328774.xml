    <interventions>Pulsed Electromagnetic Energy (PEME) Plus Normal Physiotherapy. PEME is a safe form of non-thermal non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. PEME is thought to assist the bodys own processes, in particular reduction in pain and swelling, and speeding the healing process. PEME treatment procedure: The device is an Actipatch pulsed radiofrequency energy device that emits a safe form of non-thermal non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation. The device has a carrier frequency of 27.12MHz, a pulse rate of 1000 Hz and a 100-micro seconds burst width. The peak burst output power of the 12cm antenna is approximately 9.8mW capable of covering a surface area of approximately 103cm2. The circuitry consists of low voltage (3V) digital electronics that control all timing functions. It produces a therapeutic radiofrequency field, with the antenna placed directly over the therapeutic site. It will be kept in place with a comfortable elastic Velcro wrap worn around the waist.  It is to be worn continuously for the first 7 days, after which use is discontinued. 

Normal Physiotherapy consists of standard manual therapy and exercise based approaches used by physiotherapists to treat low back pain.
Treatment will be given for twice per week for 4 weeks and last for 30 mins on each occasion.
Adherence to the protocol will be monitored by the clinic receptionist and the treating physiotherapist via appointment calendars and verbal feedback to the clinician.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo Pulsed Electromagnetic Energy (PEME) Plus Normal Physiotherapy.
The placebo PEME device is exactly the same as the active device and is to be kept in place with a velcro strap for 24 hours a day for the first 7 days, as per the treatment group. The PEME device to be used gives off a safe form of electromagnetic energy that does not produce any sensation to you at all. The placebo device has been altered so that no energy is given off.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients presenting at the School of Physiotherapy Clinics with mechanical low back pain will be given an advertisement for the study. If they are interested they will be given the information and consent forms, and a physiotherapist will answer any questions. A computer generated list will be used to randomise participants, and the clinics receptionist will offer a choice of one of forty opaque sealed envelopes to determine group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated list will be used to randomize participants meeting the inclusion criteria into one of two groups, PEME or Placebo.  After the participants have given informed consent, the clinic administrator will be responsible for randomization and issuing a PEME device according to group allocation, then the treating physiotherapist will instruct the participant on its use. Both participant and clinician will be blinded to group allocation. The treating physiotherapist will provide standard treatment and only be aware that participants are to wear the PEME device over the painful area continuously for the first 7 days.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical package for the social sciences software (SPSS); with alpha set to 0.05.  Normal descriptive statistics of the two groups such as means and standard deviations will be calculated.  ANCOVA will be used to analyze the outcomes data at initial and follow-up time-points.From previous studies in the literature it was determined that 16 points on the Oswestry Disability Index was a minimal Clinical Important Difference. To detect a difference between groups of at least 16 points on a 100 point scale (Oswestry score), with alpha set to 0.05 and power of 80% we require 20 participants per group to allow for up to 20% drop out.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of the study is to explore the added benefit, if any, of using a new application of pulsed electromagnetic energy (PEME) as an adjunct to normal physiotherapy approaches used in New Zealand for the treatment of low back pain. 
The experimental hypothesis is that the use of PEME as an adjunct to normal physiotherapy techniques will be effective in reducing pain and disability in patients suffering from low back pain. </summary>
