      <outcome>Cost-benefit of 12 dose isoniazid/rifapentine versus 270 dose isoniazid, in AUD per completed course of preventative therapy. Treatment completion is defined as administration of &gt;90% doses of prescribed medication within 16 weeks for short-course isoniazid and rifapentine (3HR) or 12 months for standard course of isoniazid (9H). Medication doses will be assessed clinically and via pharmacy dispensation records. Costs will be assessed from the perspective of the healthcare system, in AUD. </outcome>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be enrolled via the outpatient clinics of the Victorian Infectious Diseases Service. 80 participants meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled and randomly allocated to intervention or control group in a non-blinded fashion. Allocation will be performed by a pharmacist not involved in eligibility assessment.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size for this study has been calculated to consider cost differences between the intervention and control groups. Assuming an expected difference of 200$ between cost of the regimens, 36 participants per group will have a power of 80% to detect a difference with a=0.05. 
Cost-benefit analysis will be performed, comparing total costs associated with each of 9H vs 3HR in AUD. Costs will be assessed at the level of the healthcare system. Pre-determined costs for each outpatient visits and medication dispensed will be calculated in AUD. As Rifapentine is not currently PBS listed, expected costs will be taken from US commercial prices, in AUD, and sensitivity analysis will also be performed to consider the potential effect of price on overall costs. Any hospitalisation for side effects of therapy will be included, including additional pathology tests and a daily cost of hospitalisation. Daily costs associated with hospitalisation will be taken from National Hospital Cost Data Collection estimates. The relevant Medicare Benefit Schedule fee for any pathology or radiology tests will be applied to tests performed in an outpatient setting. 
Descriptive statistical analyses will be presented with regards to treatment adherence, adverse effects and end-of-treatment patient and staff satisfaction. Secondary analyses will be compared to consider differences in event frequency with inter-group comparisons made with chi2 analysis or Fishers exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables. P-values will be calculated and considered significant if p&lt;0.05. All calculation of probabilities will employ two-tailed tests.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to perform a multimodal comparison of  3-month courses of weekly isoniazid and rifapentine (3HR) with 9 months of daily isoniazid (9H) for latent tuberculosis infection, using a variety of indices:

a.	Cost-benefit
b.	Patient satisfaction
c.	Adherence to prescribed therapy
