  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the effects of rocuronium, a non-depolarising muscle relaxant when given subcutaneously.

In this study, we will compare the effects of subcutaneous rocuronium against intravenous rocuronium.  We will measure how long until it works, how much effect it has and how long it lasts.</summary>
