  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hot flushes are frequent and bothersome to many women previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and mood problems are often related to hot flushes. According to the literature a psycho-educational intervention seems to be a promising treatment for hot flushes but has not been rigorously studied in women with previous breast cancer. 
The primary purpose of the study will be changes in frequency of hot flushes and daily hot flush score (frequency x severity score for each HF). 
Hypothesis: A psycho-educational intervention utilising information provision, cognitive behavioural strategies and relaxation training will improve hot flushes, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety and mood disturbance in women with previous breast cancer. 
The psycho-educational intervention will involve four weekly group sessions during which information about hot flushes and related symptoms (insomnia, fatigue, anxiety and mood problems) will be given. We will also give strategies to improve and manage these symptoms according to some cognitive-behavioural strategies. In addition relaxation techniques will be taught to try to reduce the frequency/severity of hot flushes.</summary>
