    <summary>Background To evaluated the levels of CD18 on the surface of neutrophil infiltrating the vitreous fluid in patients with full thickness macular hole without diabetes (FTMH without diabetes, group A), full thickness macular hole with diabetes (FTMH with diabetes, group B), non proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR, group C), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR, group D).
Method Vitreous samples from twelve patients of group A representing controls were analyzed together with the vitreous samples of 12 patients of group B, 14 patients of group C and 19 patients of group D. The infiltrating of neutrophil and its surface level of CD18 were measured by flow cytometry. The level of CD18 was presented as the mean channel fluorescence (MCF) on a logarithmic scale. 
Results  Neutrophil were detected in none of the 12 vitreous samples from group A patients, in 6(50%) of the 12 vitreous samples from group B patients, in 9 (64%) of the 14 vitreous samples from group C patients and in 15(78%) of the 19 vitreous samples from group D patients. CD18 MCF on neutrophil from group B, C, and D were 2.978±1.446, 3.201±0.692, and 4.072±0.837, respectively. The difference among them was significant (F = 4.354, P = 0.021). Subjects with more severe DR were more likely to have a higher level of CD18 MCF (trend test,  P = 0.007). The level of CD18 MCF was significantly associated with the development of DR not only by simple correlation analysis (r = 0.46,P = 0.005) but also by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (beta = 0.147, P = 0.035). Other clinical parameters, including FPG, SBP, and HDLc, were also significantly associated with CD18 MCF by stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (P = 0.002, 0.011, and 0.009, respectively). 
Conclusion Our results confirm the contribution of neutrophil activation in the development of DR. Neutrophil activation may be served as a new target for the treatment of DR.</summary>
