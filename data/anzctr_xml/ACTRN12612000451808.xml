  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a programme of multi-model exercise classes delivered twice weekly, for a period of 16-weeks. Classes are conducted for 60 minutes and the overall program is designed to include progressions and variations. Each session includes aerobic (cardiovascular), strength (resistance) and motor fitness (balance, co-ordination, flexibility and agility) training.  Sessions are conducted by accredited fitness instructors, with a maximum of 20 participants and an instructor-to-participant ratio of 1:10.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In order to cope with population ageing it is vital that safe, affordable and effective strategies, to arrest or delay cognitive decline, are developed.  Research over 30 years has indicated that physical exercise produces small to moderate effects on cognition.  Recent studies indicate motor fitness, compared to physical fitness, has different effects on cognition.  This randomised controlled trial will test the efficacy of a novel, complex, community-based exercise program, in healthy women aged 65-75 years.  The outcomes measured will include cognitive and physical functioning and serum levels of biomarkers related to cognitive functioning.</summary>
