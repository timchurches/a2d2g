  <interventions>
    <interventions>anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab. 
The dose of omalizumab to be administered to each subject will be calculated using the subjects baseline total serum or plasma IgE levels (IU/ml) plus the subjects weight (kg) in accordance with the dosing table (described in the Xolair (Registered Trademark) (Omalizumab) Product Information Sheet). The Product Information Sheet is listed under Xolair (Registered Trademark) on the the Health Care Professionals page in the following website
https://www.novartis.com.au/products/healthcare-professionals
The dose will be given as a subcutaneous (SC) injection.
A single dose of omalizumab will be given. However, in accordance with the dosing table, each participant with sufficient body weight (kg) and total IgE levels to require a second dose of Omalizumab, will need their second dose of either Omalizumab or placebo to be given two weeks later. 
The treatment drug, omalizumab, (or placebo) will be administered at least 12 hours after the patient presents to hospital, at the enrolment visit.
Treatment will be given in the hospital, so adherence will be monitored by the person administering the treatment</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>We will analyse the data using an intention-to-treat analysis strategy to compare the difference in asthma severity scores, treatment response outcomes, length of stay in hospital, time to resolution of symptoms and subsequent exacerbation rates between the intervention and placebo groups.  Analysis of variance or independent sample T tests, where appropriate will be employed for the comparison of the outcome variables with a normal or transformed normal distribution.  For the data with a non-normal distribution, corresponding non-parametric tests will be used.  As we will follow up the clinical trial cohort up to 12 months, we will employ survival and Poisson analysis methods to investigate the effects of the intervention on the outcome variables: time to event and number of recurrent infections, respectively. 
We assume 80% will complete the follow-up as this is expected based on our experience in other clinical research trials and research studies.Â  Thus, we need to recruit at least 128 subjects. We have now also calculated the power with the primary objectives of time to recurrence of asthma symptoms (exacerbation). A two-sided logrank test with an overall final sample size of 100 subjects (50 in the control group and 50 in the treatment group) achieves 79.3% power at a 0.050 significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.5 when the control group hazard rate is a hazard ratio of 1.00. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial with the primary objective to determine the efficacy of omalizumab given to children aged 6-12 years during an acute asthma exacerbation to prevent asthma exacerbations in the subsequent six months.  
Subjects include male and female children aged 6-12 years presenting to Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) Emergency Department with moderate to severe acute asthma.  The treatment group (n=64) will receive one dose of omalizumab at the enrolment visit (Visit 1). The placebo group (n=64) will receive one dose of a placebo at the enrolment visit (Visit 1). However, in accordance with the dosing table (described in the Xolair (Registered Trademark) (Omalizumab) Product Information Sheet), each participant with sufficient body weight (kg) and total IgE levels to require a second dose of Omalizumab, will need to have a second dose of either Omalizumab or placebo two weeks later.  The treatment drug, omalizumab, (or placebo) will be administered at least 12 hours after the patient presents to hospital, at the enrolment visit  and following treatment, the patient will be monitored for a minimum of two hours by an experienced paediatrician. All children will also receive standard asthma therapy according to the PMH Clinical Practice Guidelines.  This study consists of 3-4 visits over six months (including the first enrolment and treatment visit) and 1 follow-up telephone interview at 12 months.
