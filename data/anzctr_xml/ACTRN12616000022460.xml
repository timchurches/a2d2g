  <interventions>
    <interventions>Micrococcus luteus Q24 will be cultured to achieve a concentration of 10^7-8 cfu/gram. The Q24 cells will be killed so only the metabolites remain and then formulated as an ointment using a Cetomacrogol base, a peony perfume and carotene for colour.. There will be a 5% concentration of the killed bacteria in the final ointment. The actual volume used will depend on the extent of the eczema and the size of the body . Initially active, placebo and Cetomacrogol ointment will each be applied as open tests to healthy unaffected skin on vertical sites (3 square cm) of the mid-upper back of each individual participant.. Skin reactions will be monitored every 15 minutes for 1 hour by the study investigator. If there are no reactions to the open test, the active, placebo, Cetomacrogol ointments and a saline control will be applied to a different site of healthy skin on one side of the spine using patch tests. Patches will be removed after 48 hours by the participant and read 72 hours later by study investigator. Providing there are no adverse reactions following the open and patch tests on healthy skin, the study investigator will test the ointment that the participant will be randomised to on eczematous skin of each individual. The participant will be observed by the study investigator for 1 hour following the application to eczematous skin. If there are no adverse reactions, participants will be provided with the appropriate ointment to apply thinly each day on all eczema sites on their body and one non-eczema skin site for a period of 4 weeks. There are no washout periods between the different tests, as each test is to be conducted in a different location of the body. 

Participants will be asked to keep a daily record of their use of the study ointment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo preparation will contain the Cetomacrogol base, the peonie perfume and carotene for colour, as used in the active intervention. The latter is so that both active and placebo appear a similar colour.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess safety, differences between active and placebo ointment in skin reactions after 1 hour,  including area involved, erythema (area involvement and strength), papules and vesicles will be assessed using the standard scale for repeated open application tests (ROAT). The ROAT scale of evaluation was developed by Johansen JD et al (Contact Dermatitis 1997:39:95) to evaluate repeated applications of the test substance. We are using a modified version of this test where the test substances are applied only once but have adopted this ROAT scale for reading the test results. As far as I am aware the test has not been validated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The open test is to be assessed every 15 mintue till 1 hour after application of the ointments</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assuming there is no reaction to the open test, a patch test to the active and placebo ointments will be applied, A reaction will be measured using a standard patch test protocol with grades ranging from no reaction, doubtful reaction, weak positive reaction, strong positive reaction and extreme positive reaction.  Each of these grades are determined by the amount of erythema, infiltration, papules and vesicles. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patches are removed from the skin after 48 hours and read after 72 hours,</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assuming no reaction to the patch test, tolerance to the study ointment that the participant is randomized to when placed  on eczematous skin will be measured using the intensity criteria from the internationally standardised  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). These include erythema, oedema/papulation, excoriation and lichenification.  The severity of each is scored on a scale of 0-3. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 15 minutes until 1 hour after application of ointment to eczematous skin.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess efficacy, differences between study groups  in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)  using this standard international measure of eczema severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and after 4 weeks of daily application of ointment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Using skin swabs from one non-eczematous site and from the most severe eczema site at baseline and at the end of treatment, differences in skin microbiota between eczematous and non-eczematous sites and between study ointments will be measured using 16sRNA DNA sequencing.  If the most severe site at the end of the study is different from the most severe site at baseline, a skin swab will also be taken from this site.   </outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks of daily use</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ease of use of study ointments will be assessed by questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of study ointments will be assessed by questionnaire</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self reported eczema severity measured by the standard Patient Orientated Eczema Measure (POEM) questionnaire.</outcome>
      <timepoint>POEM questionnaire to be completed at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation will be concealed by use of allocation schedules developed by a statistician who will not be involved in study assessments. The numbers on the schedules will correspond to numbers (for efficacy randomisation) or letters (for safety open and patch skin tests) on the pots of ointment..</concealment>
    <sequence>There are two stages of the study. For each stage, randomisation schedules will be prepared by a statistician using computerized sequence generation. 
1.	Safety testing of the product. There are 2 different tests at this stage - the open and the patch test. For each eligible participant undergoing the open test, the active, placebo or Cetomacrogol ointment will be randomly assigned using computerized sequence generation to an upper, mid of lower position on one side of the participantâ€™s mid to upper spine so the ointments are not visible to the participant. Then, for each participant undergoing the patch test, the active, placebo and Cetomacrogol ointments and saline control will be randomly assigned using computerized sequence generation to one of four wells within the patch test. For each test, the researcher applying the ointment will be different from the researcher who is assessing the skin at the end of the test. All participants, will also undergo a two week run-in period during which they use Cetomacrogol moisturizer daily.

2.	Efficacy All participants who demonstrate tolerance to the study ointments during the safety testing and the Cetomacrogol during the run-in period will be given a study number and randomly assigned using computerized sequence generation to the active (n=20) or placebo (n=20) arm of the study. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A phase 1 trial is not expected to be powered to show statistically significant differences in adverse events that may be attributable to an intervention.  Nevertheless indications of any safety concerns will be assessed by describing and comparing the degree of severity of any skin reactions  between study groups using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Positive and negative comments by participants will be coded and their frequency investigated by study group. The biological plausibility of any significant or large differences between study groups will be assessed by a physician.  The trial is also not powered to examine efficacy of the study probiotic, which is a secondary outcome.  Rather, mean (SD) EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) will be compared between groups and used to inform a power calculation for a larger future study. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eczema is a major problem among New Zealand children, particularly among Maori and Pacific peoples where infected eczema is a leading cause of hospitalization. We plan to safety test a lysate of Micrococcus luteus Q24 as an eczema treatment. This lysate is from a bacterium that naturally occurs on the skin. There is evidence that it has both anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties and thus offers a natural alternative to topical steroids and antibiotics, important given the well-recognized global problem of antibiotic resistance. This will pave the way for a larger test of efficacy and a new way of managing eczema.
