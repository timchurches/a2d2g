  <interventions>
    <interventions>In addition to standard care, the Study group will receive Pre-operative web-based "Your Coach for Knee Replacement" training modules providing cognitive and physical strategies to help patients cope with emotional and physical stressors experienced when having a knee replacement. Participants will be given access to 8 x 15 minute modules at their leisure within the 4-8 weeks before surgery. Topics include surgery expectations, preparing for surgery, physiotherapy regimes, walking with your new joint, keeping comfortable, self care, and preparing for home for home. Training modules will include educational text, tips, and strategies, interactive quizzes and how-to videos. Module completion and training module access time will be logged, with expectation a minimum of 75% of the modules to be completed for inclusion to the study analysis..

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective, single-centre, randomised, clinical study assesses the impact of a web-based coaching program for knee replacement patients on anxiety, pain, and recovery of physical function. All patients will receive an educative guidebook issued by Hollywood Private Hospital and detailing their surgical and recovery course (Standard care). Those randomised to recieve Your Coach (YC) for Knee Surgery training will be given access to the web portal and be asked to complete care modules combining cognitive and physical strategies to help patients cope with emotional and physical stressors experienced when having a total joint replacement.

The primary objectives are to assess whether web-based program is effective in reducing anxiety and pain, and subsequently enables earlier attainment of physical milestones such as first stand, independence walking with an aid, and hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to assess potential carry-over to improve joint function, quality of life and reported level of satisfaction with their care and surgical outcome in the longer term. 

The study will enrol 44 participants over a 12 month period. The study time points will be pre-operatively at baseline and just prior to surgery, 1-2 weeks, 3-months and 1-year following surgery.
