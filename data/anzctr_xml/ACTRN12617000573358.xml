    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iMindTime digital health program, offered through My Digital Health (parent platform). People taking part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program, or delayed access (7-week delay).

The iMindTime digital health program consists of six brief sessions delivered over 3 weeks, designed to make an individual more mindful or increase awareness of moment-to-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, sensations) and simply accept what is there without wanting it to change in any way. Participants will be asked to spend three days on each session before moving onto the next session. Each session will take 5-10 minutes to read and its user friendly and interactive components are designed to keep the user engaged. To consolidate learning, participants will be given activities (10-20 minutes per day) to complete offline to practise the principles of specific mindfulness exercises (i.e., mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of body sensations, mindfulness of emotions, mindfulness of sounds, mindfulness of thoughts and loving kindness meditation) and asked to provide simple feedback on this practise at the next session. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., remind them to log on, when to complete scheduled assessments) and will be asked several questions during the study period to monitor their progress. The iMindTime sessions include text, graphics, audio, quizzes, and downloads. iMindTime can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

The iMindTime program is housed within the participant's My Digital Health dashboard. My Digital Health is the parent platform that houses a variety of digital health programs. Via the participants dashboard, they are able to access several resources. This includes: My Dashboard, My Inbox, My Daily Monitoring, My Progress Graphs, My Timeline, My Profile and My Tutorial. 

Participants randomised to the iMindTime digital health (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 2) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 4) and a 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to iMindTime digital health program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). However, the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iMindTime digital health program (Week 11). While the during, post-intervention and follow up assessments are scheduled (and access to the program has been provided), participants will not be able to access the program until they have completed the scheduled assessments (or after the expiry time to complete the assessment has lapsed). Participants will retain access to the program until Week 20. 

Participant engagement with the program will be obtained through by passive analytic data (e.g., what pages / strategies they visited and when), as well as reviewing the completion of daily mood and lifestyle events surveys and scheduled intervention assessments.

</interventions>
    <comparator>People allocated to the delayed access group will complete the same questionnaires as the immediate access condition, but will not have access to the iMindTime digital health program for 7 weeks. In addition, participants in the delayed access group will not have access to the daily self-monitoring survey and graph during their 7 week wait period.</comparator>

Previous research has reported small-medium effects can be expected. Therefore, assuming a small-medium effect (i.e., GPower f(v) test = 0.30), significance set at 5% (p = .05), power at 80%, a total sample size of 126 will be required to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary analysis. However, allowing for a 50% attrition rate, we will be required to recruit N = 189 participants.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of the iMindTime program. The iMindTime program will be offered through the My Digital Health platform. 

People visiting the website, in response to advertisements or through self-interest, will be informed of the availability of the iMindTime program and invited to participate in the study. People who consent to take part in the study will be randomly allocated to either an immediate access to the program, or delayed access (7-week delay).

The iMindTime digital health program consists of six brief sessions, over 3 weeks, designed to make an individual more mindful or increase awareness of moment-to-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, sensations) and simply accepting what is there without wanting it to change in any way. Participants will spend three days on each session before moving onto the next session. Each session will require 5-10 minutes to read and its user friendly and interactive components are designed to keep the user engaged. To consolidate learning, participants will be given activities (10-20 minutes per day) to complete offline to practise the principles of specific mindfulness exercises (i.e., mindfulness of the breath, mindfulness of body sensations, mindfulness of emotions, mindfulness of sounds, mindfulness of thoughts and loving kindness meditation) and asked to provide simple feedback on this practise at the next session. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., remind them to log on, when to complete questionnaires) and will be asked to self-monitor their mood and lifestyle events. 

Participants randomised to the iMindTime digital health (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 2) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 4) and a 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to iMindTime digital health program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 8). However, the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they have completed the iMindeHealth program (Week 11). 

It is expected that people who undertake iMindTime immediately will show greater reductions in negative affect and increases in mental wellbeing at post and 1 month follow-up time points, relative to the delayed access group.</summary>
