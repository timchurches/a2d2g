  <interventions>
    <interventions>A multi-dimensional continence management intervention is planned, with three main components:
1. For each patient in the intervention group, a CNC will apply an evidence-based bladder management clinical pathway to audit patients needs and engage a multidisciplinary team in meeting these needs. The CNC will also monitor the team's response and follow up to ensure appropriate action has occurred. 
2. A patient education booklet detailing promotion of bladder and bowel function following fractured NOF. 
3. Education and motivation sessions will be provided across the multi-disciplinary provider team (eg, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, medical practitioners, dietitians), to ensure the team are enabled to respond appropriately. 

The Intervention will run for 6 months, from August 2005 to February 2006.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Review of patient records will assess: surgical anaesthesia (drug, dose, delivery), length of surgery, postoperative pain management, urinary retention, bladder management strategies(eg, catheterisation), symptomatology or diagnosis of urinary tract infections.</outcome>

    <sequence>Random numbers were generated in SAS V9.1.3 using the RANUNI function with fixed seed. The resulting uniform distribution of random numbers was verified visually by graphing. Study numbers were ordered according to the order of the random numbers from largest to smallest. Alternating batches of 20 study numbers were sequentially selected to be allocated to either the intervention or control group. This continued until 50% of study numbers had been allocated to the intervention group and 50% to the control group.</sequence>
