  <interventions>
    <interventions>The interventional drug to be utilized in this randomized controlled trial is the oral anti-epileptic drug, perampanel. Perampanel is an AMPA-receptor antagonist. Both intervention and comparator (placebo) medications will be identically encapsulated. 
Patients with WHO grade II-III supratentorial gliomas will be recruited pre-operatively and receive a 7T MRI scan. Post-operatively, patients will be randomized to receive perampanel or placebo for 16 weeks and be observed for a further 36 weeks, until at the study ends at 52 weeks.
For patients randomized to the active arm, perampanel will be started at 2mg at night and over the first 4 weeks (escalation phase) will be uptitrated to by 2mg every 2 weeks, eg 2mg for the first 2 weeks, then 4mg for following two weeks. 

At the start of the assessment phase assessment phase (week 5-16), perampanel will be increased to 6mg. Participants will remain on 6mg from week 5 until the end of week 16 unless seizures or side effects occur. 

At the end of the assessment phase all medications will be ceased and patients will enter the observation phase (week 17-52).
Participants will have 8 visits after randomization over the 52-week study period, during which post-operative seizures, compliance and side effects will be assessment by investigators. In escalation and assessment phases, participants will be questioned regarding their medication adherence, and tablet/bottle counting will be performed to aid in compliance assessment. Visits will occur at 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks and 4, 6, 9, 12 months. 
If post-operative seizures occur during the escalation phase, then after assessment by a study neurologist, standard titration will continue to occur if clinically appropriate. If seizures occur during the assessment or observation phase, or multiple seizures occur during escalation phase, then the endpoint will be reached and blind broken. The patient will be withdrawn from the study at this point and managed as per their treating physician.  

If side effects develop and are intolerable, one dose reduction of 2mg can occur.

    <comparator>The comparator group will receive a placebo as seizure prophylaxis. There is currently no evidence to support anti-epileptic drug treatment for prophylaxis after tumour surgery.

    <sequence>Simple randomisation using a randomisation table created by computer software

Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion, depending upon both operation (biopsy vs craniotomy and resection) and WHO grade (II vs III). This will ensure approximately equal numbers of each grade glioma are randomized to each treatment arm in study 1 and 2. A computer generated randomisation method will be utilized with an allocation table uploaded to a Redcap database program. An independent clinical researcher will given access randomise patients using the Redcap database, keeping all other researchers blinded. 

Stratifying on the basis of WHO grade will help ensure extra homogeneity between study arms. In study 2 (perampanel vs placebo), patients with no pre-operative seizures will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either perampanel or placebo. Investigators and patients will be blinded to the assigned treatment until the end of the assessment phase.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>This is primarily a hypothesis generating pilot RCT, Power calculations have however been performed for the planned sample size. Given total sample size of 40, allocation ratio 1:1, two-sided significant level of 0.05, and assumed 80% seizure free rate in patients taking placebo, Fishers exact test has 0.37 power to detect a 25% increase in seizure free rate in patients taking perampanel. With regards to time to first post-operative seizure analysis, the sample size of 40 has a power of 0.8 detect 61.4% increase in the median time to first post-op seizure
Clinicopathological characteristics will be compared on univariate analysis between intervention (perampanel) and comparison group (placebo). This will be examined using and Fishers exact test as appropriate for categorical variables, Independent T-test for continuous, normally distributed variables and Mann-Whiteny U-test for continuous, asymmetric variables. P value &lt;0.05 will indicate a significance difference.
Efficacy to be analysed in both i) intention to treat: randomly assigned to treatment groups and received at least one dose of study treatment and ii) per-protocol: excluded patients who were major protocol violators. Protocol violators will include poor compliance with study drug dosing,

Adaptive statistical analysis:
Adaptive increase in sample size will be performed if the results of interim analysis using data from the first 30 patients in each study are promising as per the methodology of Mehta and Pocock et al (Statistics in medicine 2011;30:3267-84).. For PEGASUS 2, the maximum sample size will be 78 (n = 39 in each group). Sample size was calculated with two-tailed Fisher's Exact Test, assumes perampanel provides superior outcome, assumes 80% seizure free rate on placebo and is able to detect greater than 20% absolute difference (using 80% power and type 1 error set at alpha 0.05).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine effectiveness of perampanel in the prevention of tumour associated epilepsy (TAE) in patients with grade II-III gliomas. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18-65 years and have a diagnosis of World Health Organisation grade II-III supratentorial glioma and have not experienced a pre-operative seizure.

Study details
Patients will be randomized (allocated by chance) to receive perampanel, or or placebo for 16 week. Doses will be escalated over the first four week before patients enter an assessment phase for the remainder of the trial. Patients will be followed up for 52 weeks. The primary outcomes are i) time to first seizure after escalation phase (weeks 5-52) and ii) proportion of patients seizure free during 12 week assessment phase. Secondary endpoints include measures of drug safety, tolerability and quality of life. Glutamate concentrations will be measured before drug treatment is commenced to assess whether it can be utilized to predict both post-operative seizure and response to perampanel.

This will be the first monotherapy epilepsy RCT utilizing perampanel. A positive study would support a larger randomized phase III trial examining perampanel monotherapy in tumour associated seizures prophylaxis. The novel use of 7T MRI to quantify glutamate offers the opportunity to assess if a non-invasive biomarker can help stratify seizure risk and perampanel response. This can pave the way for individualised and targeted epilepsy treatment and prevention.</summary>
