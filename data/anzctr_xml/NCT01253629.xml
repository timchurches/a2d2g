  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in behavioral symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome using the Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community (ABC-C) Total score in Stratum I - The ABC-C is a 58-item questionnaire that should have been completed as much as possible by the same rater. It is comprised of five subscales (irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity and inappropriate speech) plus the total score which ranks from 0 to 174 in patients who were fully methylated (FM)</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in behavioral symptoms of Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) using the ABC-C Total score in Stratum II - The ABC-C is a 58-item questionnaire that should have been completed as much as possible by the same rater. It is comprised of five subscales (irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity and inappropriate speech). Assessing the reduction in the (ABC-C) total score after 12 weeks of treatment in FXS patients with partially methylated (PM) FMR1 gene.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global improvement of symptoms in Fragile X using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scale - The CGI-I score ranges from 1 to 7 (with 1 being "very much improved", 4 being "no change" to 7 being "very much worse")</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change from baseline in irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech assessed by the individual subscales of the ABC-C scale - comprised of five subscales (irritability, lethargy/social withdrawal, stereotypic behavior, hyperactivity and inappropriate speech) plus the total score which ranks from 0 to 174</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of patients with clinical response in the ABC-C total score - response is defined as reduction of at least 25% from baseline in the ABC-CFX total score and a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the CGI-I scale at Week 12</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>improvement of repetitive behavior as measured by changes in the RBS-R - The Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R) includes six domains: ritualistic behavior, sameness behavior, stereotypic behavior, self-injurious behavior, compulsive behavior, and restricted interests. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 12</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
