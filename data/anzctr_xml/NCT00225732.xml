Other interventions: Normal saline as placebo comparator
250 ml normal saline as a placebo comparator was administered every 6 hours for a total of eight doses over the first 48 hours. Those patients who received the initial eight doses could continue to receive additional doses as needed through the end of the treatment period (day 5)

Treatment: drugs: Intravenous ibuprofen
800 mg intravenous ibuprofen diluted in 250 milliliters of normal saline was administered every 6 hours for a total of eight doses over the first 48 hours.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study of Caldolor (IV ibuprofen) administered to post-operative
      hospitalized adult patients every 6 hours for 48 hours is to determine the efficacy of
      Caldolor compared to placebo for the treatment of post-operative pain as measured by
      reduction in the requirement for the narcotic analgesic, morphine, post surgery</summary>
