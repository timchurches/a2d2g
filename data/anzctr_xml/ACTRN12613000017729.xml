    <scientifictitle>Among women seeking medical abortion with misoprostol and mifepristone through 63 days' gestation with access to use of ibuprofen and codeine/paracetamol as needed, does prophylactic administration of tramadol 50 mg or ibuprofen 400 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg administered immediately before misoprostol and then repeated four hours later decrease the maximal pain score reported at 8 hours following misoprostol use compared to women using placebos?</scientifictitle>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Compare the maximum pain level reported in the first 8 hours and first 24 hours after misoprostol administration across the three pain management strategies. To assess this outcome, all women will be instructed to record at 8 hours after misoprostol their maximum pain level as measured by VAS over the prior 8 hours in a symptom diary. All women will be instructed to record at 24 hours after misoprostol their maximum pain level as measured by VAS over the prior 24 hours in a symptom diary. These VAS scores in the treatment arms will be compared to the placebo arm and across groups.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomized to receive either tramadol 50 mg plus placebo, ibuprofen 400 mg plus metoclopramide 10 mg, or two placebo tablets to be taken immediately before the first misoprostol dose and repeated four hours later. They will be given 4 tablets of ibuprofen 400 mg with instructions to take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed, as well as 2 tablets of paracetamol with codeine with instructions to take 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed. Medications will be pre-packaged with accompanying VAS forms to facilitate accurate diary assessments.

Women will be recruited from among those seeking medical abortion up to 63 days’ gestation at 3-4 study sites in different countries. Before initiating data collection at all sites, a pilot phase will be initiated at one site with an assessment of study feasibility after the first 30 participants.	</concealment>
    <sequence>When the woman presents at the site requesting abortion, she will be evaluated in the standard manner at that site to determine if she is eligible for early medical abortion (EMA).  If she is eligible for EMA, she will be given a brief description of the study and asked is if she is interested in participating.  If she is interested, a screening case report form (CRF) will be used to determine if she is eligible for the study according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  

If the woman meets the eligibility criteria, study staff will provide a copy of the consent form and read the form with the woman, answering any questions she might have.  If the woman agrees to participate, she will be asked to sign the form. Consent for the abortion procedure will be obtained separate from the consent to participate in research.

Study staff will then collect the participant’s contact information, including the participant’s telephone number.  A CRF will be completed with basic demographic information and clinical information (see below).

Women will be allocated to treatment by the study staff who will maintain a file of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing the allocation.  The randomization scheme will be created by an investigator not involved with the on-site study-related activities, and it will be based on computer-generated random permuted blocks (using STATA statistical software, version 10.0, College Station, TX).  The allocation ratio will be one-to-one.  Treatment allocation will be stratified according to parity (sample will be 50% nulliparous and 50% parous in each treatment arm) in order to avoid imbalances in parity between the two treatment groups.  

Both women and study staff will be blinded with regard to their treatment.  The placebo will appear similar to ibuprofen, and study drugs will be pre-packaged in the sealed envelopes.

    <statisticalmethods>Quantitative data:  The primary outcome for this study will be the maximum recorded pain by VAS in the first 8 hours after misoprostol administration.  Secondary outcomes include: 
- maximum recorded pain by VAS in the first 24 hours after misoprostol 
-use of any additional analgesic beyond study drug
-total number of pills taken (study drug/ placebo and any additional analgesics)

Categorical variables will be compared between the three treatment groups using chi-square tests; means will be compared using ANOVA.  Logistic regression may be used to identify significant covariates that affect the outcomes.

All subjects will be included in the main analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle.  However, subjects may be excluded from a secondary analysis (or analyzed separately) if one or more of the following apply:
-lack of essential data from the subjects records making it impossible to judge treatment outcome;
-any violation of the study protocol including violation of eligibility criteria;
-treatment non-compliance.

Qualitative data:  In-depth interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and we will code them using the qualitative software Atlas Ti; coding will be done of the interviewers notes if the participant did not consent to recording.  Two investigators (or designees) will conduct a content analysis of the interview transcripts using the same software.  The investigators (or designees) will independently read through the transcripts to identify common themes.  The analysis will be an iterative process, whereby the investigators will be free to create and add new codes as the concepts emerge.  

Sample size: 192 participants (96 nulliparous and 96 parous) will be randomly allocated to each of the three treatment arms. This sample size allows for 90% power to detect a difference of 1.5 in the reported maximal VAS pain measurement between arms while accounting for an anticipated 10% loss to follow up rate. 

The sample size for this study is based on the primary outcome of maximum reported pain within 8 hours after taking misoprostol as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS).  VAS measurements for self-assessment of pain level have been extensively validated.  Previous research found that the maximum VAS score with early medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol was 7, ranging from 5-8.  Research has also reported that the minimally clinically significant difference in VAS scores is between 1.5 and 2. In order to detect a reduction in maximum VAS scores in the first 8 hours from 7 to 5.5, using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and power of 90% while accounting for 10% loss to follow up, we will need 96 women in each study  arm.  There is an interest in determining the effect of prophylactic medication between both parity groups; thus, the sample size has been calculated to determine the effect of prophylactic medication among both parous and nulliparous women. Accounting for stratification by parity,we plan to enrol a total of 576 women.  Because our treatment arms are independent of one another, we do not have to account for a multiplicity adjustment in our sample size calculations. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is a predictable feature of the medical abortion process, and for some women pain may be intense. Although pain is the most common side-effect encountered with medical abortion, little is known about optimal pain management during this process.  Currently, WHO recommends use of NSAIDs during medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol.  Previous studies have shown that NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, reduce pain once uterine cramping has started and is superior to paracetamol; however, it does not appear to be effective at preventing or minimizing the moderate to severe pain of medical abortion when administered alone prior to pain onset.  As pain is often cited as one of the worst features of medical abortion, and given that inadequate pain management may motivate some women to seek unnecessary clinical care, there is a clear need to identify the most effective methods of pain control in this setting.

This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic analgesia for pain relief during early medical abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether prophylactic administration of tramadol or ibuprofen plus metoclopramide is superior to analgesic administration after pain begins during the medical abortion process in terms of reducing maximal reported pain levels and subsequent use of pain medication (ibuprofen and oral narcotics).</summary>
