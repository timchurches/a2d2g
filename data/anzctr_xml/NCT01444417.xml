  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Romiplostim
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Romiplostim - Participants received once weekly subcutaneous romiplostim for 24 weeks at a starting dose of 1 µg/kg; weekly dose increases continued in increments of 1 µg/kg/week to a maximum dose of 10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of = 50 x 10^9/L.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received weekly subcutaneous placebo for 24 weeks.


Treatment: drugs: Romiplostim
The starting dose of romiplostim is 1 µg/kg administered weekly by subcutaneous injection. Participants will return to the clinic weekly to provide platelet counts and undergo dose titrations under the supervision of the treating physician. Weekly dose increases will continue in increments of 1 µg/kg up to a maximum dose of 10 µg/kg in an attempt to reach a target platelet count of = 50 x 10^9/L. Dose adjustment will be allowed during the treatment period to maintain a platelet count between = 50 x 10^9/L and = 200 x 10^9/L.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Matching placebo administered by subcutaneous injection

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Durable Platelet Response - A participant with durable platelet response was defined as achieving at least 6 weekly platelet counts of = 50 x 10^9/L during the last 8 weeks of treatment (platelet counts obtained from week 18 to week 25). If a platelet count from a participant was not available (missing) in a certain week, that week was imputed as non-response for that participant. Platelet counts were not deemed as a positive response for 4 weeks after the administration of rescue medication.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 18 to week 25</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Platelet Response - Overall platelet response is defined as either a durable platelet response or transient platelet response.
Durable platelet response was defined as weekly platelet count = 50 x 10^9/L for 6 or more times during week 18 to week 25 measurements. Participants may not have had a weekly response within 4 weeks after receiving any rescue medication.
Transient platelet response was defined as weekly platelet count = 50 x 10^9/L for 4 or more times during week 2 to week 25 measurements but without durable platelet response. Participants may not have had a weekly response within 4 weeks after receiving any rescue medications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 2 to week 25</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Weeks With Platelet Response - Number of weeks with platelet counts = 50 x 10^9/L during week 2 to week 25 measurements. Participants may not have had a weekly response within 4 weeks after receiving any rescue medications.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 2 to week 25</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Received Rescue Medication During the Treatment Period - Rescue medication is any medication (other than excluded medications) that is intended to increase platelet counts or prevent bleeding.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total Number of Composite Bleeding Episodes - A composite bleeding episode was defined as clinically significant bleeding events or the use of a rescue medication to prevent a clinical significant bleeding event during weeks 2 through 25 of the treatment period. A clinically significant bleeding event was defined as a Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade = 2 bleeding event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 2 to week 25</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Adverse Events - A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
fatal,
life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death),
requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or
other significant medical hazard. Adverse events were graded for severity according to the CTCAE version 3.0 grading scale, where Grade 3 = moderate, Grade 4 = life-threatening and Grade 5 = fatal.
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were those assessed by the investigator as possibly related to study drug. This relationship was determined by a "yes" or "no" response to the question: "Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by study drug?"</outcome>
      <timepoint>From the first dose of study drug until 4 weeks after last dose; 28 weeks.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
