  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When excessive alcohol or cannabis use occurs at a vulnerable age such as adolescence, the physical, psychological and developmental consequences extend into adulthood. Good level evidence favours brief interventions to prevent harm associated with substance use in a variety of settings. 
The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a brief intervention addressing excessive substance use in reducing the prevalence of excessive substance use in young people consulting family doctors (paediatricians, general practitioners and general internists).
Building on the experience of a pilot study in which we developed and successfully tested such a brief intervention in seven family practices in and around Geneva, we have designed a cluster randomised trial in primary care which aims to provide evidence of the effectiveness of this intervention. We hypothesise that the intervention can lead to a 15% reduction in the prevalence of at-risk alcohol and/or cannabis use in this population.</summary>
