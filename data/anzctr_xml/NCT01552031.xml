  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a pathological condition whose progression is
      characterized by stable periods broken up by intermittent acute exacerbations of the
      symptoms, during which a severe inflammatory process occurs often requiring hospitalization.
      During exacerbations the risk of death is very high making the social and economical impact
      of such events important.

      The need of rationalize the utilization of health care resources together with the
      optimization of patient's care has prompted the development of models of assistance based on
      home monitoring. At the present time most of the suggested models were based on the
      utilization of diaries for symptoms perceived by the patients. Even if positive results are
      reported in terms of reduction of in hospitalization many COPD patients tend to underestimate
      the severity of their condition and their compliance in recording their symptoms rapidly
      decreases with time.

      Attempts of using more objective measurements such as home spirometers have been done but
      poor results were reported mainly due to the difficulties in performing a spirometric test
      without medical supervision.

      A more suitable approach to get objective information on the function of the respiratory
      system is the Forced Oscillation Technique (FOT). Such methodology is based on the analysis
      of the response of the system to small pressure stimuli over-imposed to the normal breathing
      of the patients. The measurements require minimal cooperation and can be performed without
      medical supervision.

      The purpose of this study is to measure daily variability of FOT data measured at home of a
      group of COPD patients in order to identify possible correlations between symptoms change,
      breathing pattern, lung mechanical impedance and occurrence of exacerbation.</summary>
