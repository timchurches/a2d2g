  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to cervical Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides (SNAGs) as described by Brian Mulligan, passive joint mobilisation as described by Geoff Maitland or placebo groups. AThe first group of participants will receive SNAGS as described by Brian Mulligan (Mulligan, 2004). The participant, in the sitting position, is asked to move his head in the direction that produces their symptoms. The participant is to stop if any dizziness is reproduced. During the application of the mobilization, the participant should stay symptom-free. As the patient moves their head the physiotherapist gently glides the C1 or C2 vertebra and sustains the glide through the movement.  passive joint mobilisation or Maitland mobilisation is where the therapist uses his thumbs to rhythmically apply pressure to a vertebra. Participants will receive two to six treatments (15 -45 mins) by an experienced physiotherapist over three to six weeks at the discretion of the treating therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo group will receive an intervention with a detuned machine. This is a laser machine which has been deactivated by the manufacturer. The laser is commonly used by physiotherapists to treat musculo-skeletal symptoms (Reid et al, 2008). The laser will appear to operate normally to the participant, with a light and beeping sound, but will not produce any effective emission. The detuned laser, which has been shown to have a very strong placebo effect (Irnich, Behrens, Molzen, Konig, Glegitsch, Krauss, Natalis, Senn, Beyer &amp; Schops, 2001) will be given for 2 minutes on a site in the neck, without touching the skin. This duration is consistent with normal laser application in standard physiotherapy practise.</comparator>

      <outcome>Neck repositioning sense will be assessed with the CROM. This task tests the participants ability to actively reposition their head and neck.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to compare two forms of manual therapy against each other and to a placebo in reducing symptoms of cervicogenic dizziness (imbalance and neck pain) in the longer term. Although these are standard treatments in physiotherapy practice they have not been fully evaluated. Outcome measures will be five self-report questionnaires, keeping a diary and measurements of neck range-of-motion, head repositioning and balance.</summary>
