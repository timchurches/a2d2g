    <studytitle>A Novel Approach to Real-life Communication: Narrative Intervention in Aphasia</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For people with aphasia following stroke, is a manualised narrative intervention programme aimed at improving discourse in everyday communication situations more effective than usual speech pathology intervention as measured by improved language ability across the different levels of language (i.e. words, sentences, discourse) in everyday communication activities?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study compares two groups of clients with aphasia, one receiving a novel speech pathology intervention and the other receiving usual speech pathology care. Participants in both groups will receive 20 sessions of intervention (400 treatment sessions in total). Sessions (approx. 1 hour duration) will be offered 4 x per week over a 5 week period. This is  commensurate with length of stay at the local sites and realistic for community based intervention. A total of 200 therapy sessions will therefore be provided to the 10 participants in the experimental group, and 200 sessions to the control group (by the usual speech pathologist).
For the experimental group, the intervention protocol will be developed following principles set out in Whitworth (2010), using a metalinguistic approach to increase awareness of both sentence and narrative structure. Beginning with narratives using picture sequences, the therapy will focus initially on identifying the main event/s in each picture, accessing the verb and the relevant nouns for each event, followed by creating a complete argument structure around each. A framework for narrative discourse, based on story grammar, will be introduced, and sentences organized around setting the scene (the beginning), the events taking place (the middle), and concluding the story (the end). More naturalistic situations will be introduced using a mind-mapping approach where diagrams are then used to retrieve and then link ideas, events, and words in a way that leads to the organization and planning of thoughts for subsequent production. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive intervention determined by the usual speech pathologist in the same dosage as the intervention group. Usual care will involve therapy aimed to increase comprehension and production of language at the word and sentence levels, and functional communication goals determined by the client. This encompasses a large proportion of usual care tasks. The speech pathologist will have access to the assessment data with the exception of the data from the Discourse protocol.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the Curtin University Discourse Protocol (CUDP) to measure performance in connected speech of everyday communication tasks. Data have already been collected on 60 healthy adult speakers and will be available to the study for comparison. The protocol involves recount of events, procedural discourse, exposition (providing opinions) and story narratives which are analyzed on a range of parameters (Whitworth, 2010). These involve novel structural frameworks drawn from the child literacy and narrative literature, and linguistic features that have been found to be diagnostic across a range of language profiles, e.g. quantitative measures of overall sentence structure, coherency and cohesion.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A range of word and sentence level measures will be taken to monitor impact on other levels of language. These include:
1. Tests of Semantic processing (Pyramids and Palm Trees, Howard &amp; Patterson, 1992  noun semantics; Kissing and Dancing Test, Bak &amp; Hodges, 2003  verb semantics)
2. Selected word and sentence comprehension and production tasks (Northwestern Test of Verbs and Sentences, 2011).

There is no restriction on type of aphasia. Mild dysarthria and/or apraxia of speech may be present but should not be the primary difficulty. </inclusivecriteria>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a one-year pilot RCT to allow us to estimate effect sizes to do a proper power calculation.The primary interest is in using ANOVA with one between-subject factor (2 treatment types) and one within-subject factor (before and after treatment). An effect of treatment would be shown by an interaction between these factors.
Preliminary estimates of the power with 10 participants in each group, using the available information, were calculated using G*Power 3.1.
Assuming a correlation of 0.75 between pre- and post- measures (quite conservative for this group) there is power of 0.67 for detecting an interaction with an effect size f of 0.2 and 0.95 for an effect size f of 0.3.
All data will be entered into electronic databases at Curtin University with specialist statistical advice available from the Faculty of Health Sciences at Curtin University. A flow diagram will be used to report the number of participants enrolled in the study, randomised, and allocated to each group. Descriptive (e.g. means and standard deviations) and nonparametric statistics will be used to analyze the pre- and post-intervention data. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for study groups will be compared and reported to determine whether the two groups were equivalent at baseline. Statistical procedures will be used to compare groups for primary and secondary outcomes. Differences between participants receiving intervention vs. usual care will be examined using repeated measures ANOVA analyses with between subjects factors being intervention (usual care vs. experimental intervention) and the within subjects factor being measurement time-point (pre and post intervention, 4 week follow-up). For primary and secondary outcomes, the estimated effect sizes and associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a randomized control trial that will deliver and evaluate a highly innovative intervention for people with aphasia (i.e. loss of or reduction in the ability to use language) following stroke. Pilot work with the intervention, based around narrative structure and daily communication activities, has been successful in significantly improving language ability in everyday communication. The study will recruit 20 people with aphasia from Royal Perth Hospital and compare the novel protocol to usual speech pathology intervention. Outcomes will significantly refine future intervention with people with aphasia and facilitate translation of theory into routine clinical practice. </summary>
