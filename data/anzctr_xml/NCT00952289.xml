  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ruxolitinib
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Ruxolitinib - Participants received ruxolitinib orally twice a day. The starting dose was determined based on Baseline platelet count. Patients with Baseline platelet count &gt; 200,000/µL began a dose regimen of 20 mg twice daily. Patients with Baseline platelet count of 100,000/µL to 200,000/µL (inclusive) began a dose regimen of 15 mg twice daily. The dose was adjusted by the Investigator based on efficacy and safety to a maximum of 25 mg twice daily. Patients receiving benefit could continue treatment until the later of marketing approval or when the last randomized patient remaining in the study had completed Week 144 (36 months).

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Placebo tablets matching ruxolitinib were administered orally twice a day at a starting dose based on Baseline platelet count. Doses were titrated using the same guidelines as for active drug. Patients meeting certain protocol requirements detailed below were given the opportunity to cross over to ruxolitinib treatment.


Treatment: drugs: Ruxolitinib
Ruxolitinib phosphate tablets 5 mg administered as oral doses.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Matching placebo tablets were administered as oral doses in the same manner as active drug.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants Achieving = 35% Reduction in Spleen Volume From Baseline to Week 24 - Spleen volume was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or by computed tomography (CT) scans if MRI was not suitable, and analyzed by a blinded central laboratory reader. Patients who withdrew, crossed over to ruxolitinib prior to the visit, or had a missing value at the visit were considered non-responders.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Maintenance of a = 35% Reduction From Baseline in Spleen Volume Among Patients Initially Randomized to Receive Ruxolitinib - The maintenance of = 35% reduction from Baseline in spleen volume was assessed up until the data cutoff date using the Kaplan-Meier method for patients who had at least one measured = 35% reduction, and who either had at least one subsequent measurement or who subsequently dropped out prior to another assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline Visit and every 12 weeks until the data cut-off date (up to 14 months).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Maintenance of a = 35% Reduction From Baseline in Spleen Volume Among Patients Initially Randomized to Receive Ruxolitinib - The duration of = 35% reduction from Baseline in spleen volume was defined as the longest duration of consecutive measurements of = 35% reduction observed before the data cut-off date for patients who had at least one measured = 35% reduction, and who either had at least one subsequent measurement or, who subsequently dropped out prior to another assessment. The duration of a = 35% reduction from Baseline in spleen volume was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With a = 50% Reduction in Total Symptom Score From Baseline to Week 24 - Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) Version 2.0 diary. Using the diary, patients rated the following symptoms on a scale from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable): night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), and muscle/bone pain. The total symptom score ranged from 0-60 and was calculated as the sum of the 6 symptom scores. A higher score indicates worse symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Week 24. Baseline total score was the average of the daily total scores for the last 7 days prior to randomization. The Week 24 total score was the average of daily total scores from the 28 days prior to the Week 24 visit.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Symptom Score - Symptoms of myelofibrosis were assessed using a modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF) Version 2.0 diary. Using the diary, patients rated the following symptoms on a scale from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable): night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under ribs on left, feeling of fullness (early satiety), and muscle/bone pain. The total symptom score ranged from 0-60 and was calculated as the sum of the 6 symptom scores. A higher score indicates worse symptoms hence a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Week 24. Baseline total score was the average of the daily total scores for the last 7 days prior to randomization. The Week 24 total score was the average of daily total scores from the 28 days prior to the Week 24 visit.</timepoint>
