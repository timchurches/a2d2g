  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised into 3 different arms:

iQOS Arm: Participants randomised to this arm will be educated by the researcher for approximately 20 minutes (e.g. face-to-face) on the use of iQOS device and the participant tobacco diary. Each participant will be provided with two iQOS devices and two packs of iQOS HeatSticks at Baseline. The participant may choose their preferred iQOS HeatStick flavour from any HeatStick flavours commercially available in New Zealand. Use manual will be provided to the participants. The iQOS device can be used as often as the participant desires and conventional cigarette smoking is allowed occasionally. All iQOS device and conventional cigarette use is to be logged in the diary. The duration of the intervention is 8 weeks.

Conventional Cigarette Arm: Participants randomised to the conventional cigarette arm will not be supplied with conventional cigarettes or pouch tobacco. These participants will continue to smoke conventional cigarette or pouch tobacco of their preferred brand. Participants are not allowed to smoke during study assessments (including questionnaire completion). No restrictions on the frequency of conventional cigarette smoking apply. At Week 8, participants will be asked to take part in the "Treatment Extension" period on the use of the iQOS device as per the iQOS arm. All smoking activity will need to be logged in the tobacco diary.

Smoking Abstinence Arm: Participants will be confined from Baseline through to Day 3 and will be supplied with nicotine patches plus nicotine lozenges or nicotine gum. The nicotine replacement therapy is to be used according to the product guidelines. At the end of Week 8, the participants in this arm will not be offered to switch to other trial arms. The researcher will provide further guidance on continuing smoking cessation as appropriate.

An iQOS device is comprised of three main components - HeatStick, holder and charger. The iQOS HeatStick is inserted into the iQOS holder to pre-heat the device. Thereafter, the aerosol generated by the heating process is inhaled by placing the lips on the mouthpiece filter and drawing air through the iQOS HeatStick. During use, the iQOS HeatStick is heated according to a controlled temperature profile within the iQOS holder. The temperature is less than 350 degrees Celsius. At this temperature, the tobacco of the iQOS HeatStick is heated without combustion.

The iQOS HeatStick is similar in basic design to a conventional cigarette, but is shorter, contains less tobacco material and has an additional filter section. The participants will be educated by the researcher on the day of randomisation. All manuals will be provided as well as an access to an online video tutorials.

Adherence of participants to their treatment arms will be monitored through their tobacco diary.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is the conventional cigarette smoking inhalation and the smoking abstinence.

The use of iQOS device and its effects on HPHC levels will be compared to the control groups mentioned above.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the levels of 5 selected biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs in Maori / Pacific Islander smokers switching from conventional cigarettes to iQOS as compared to Maori / Pacific Islander smokers continuing to smoke conventional cigarettes and smoking abstinence after 8 weeks of use. The biomarkers that will be assessed from urine samples collected over 8 weeks are S-PMA (Benzene), MHBMA (1,3-Butadiene), total NNAL and cotinine levels and quantitative breath CO testing.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the nicotine dependence in an ambulatory setting in Maori / Pacific Islander smokers switching from conventional cigarettes to iQOS as compared to Maori / Pacific Islander smokers continuing to smoke conventional cigarettes. The Fagerstorm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) will be used to assess nicotine dependence.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterise the composite subjective effects related to smoking in Maori / Pacific Islander smokers switching from conventional cigarettes to iQOS as compared to Maori / Pacific Islander smokers continuing to smoke conventional cigarettes and smoking abstinence. 

The composite subjective effects of using the iQOS device as compared to conventional cigarettes will be assessed through the Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire (mCEQ, Cappelleri et al., 2007),  Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-brief, Cox et al., 2001), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS, Toll et al., 2007) and Device Rating Questionnaire (modified from Bullen et al., 2010). Subjective effects of using the iQOS as compared to smoking abstinence will be assessed through the QSU brief and MNWS. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>For each of the 5 selected biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs, the null hypothesis shall be that the mean exposure shall be equal for the iQOS treatment group, the conventional cigarette treatment group, and the smoking abstinence treatment group; the alternative hypothesis is that mean exposure is not equal for at least 1 pair of goups. For QSU-brief, and MNSW the null hypothesis shall be that the mean of the iQOS treatment group is equal to the mean of the conventional cigarette treatment group, and to the mean of the smoking abstinence treatment group; the alternative hypothesis is that the means are not equal for at least 1 pair of groups. 

For mCEQ, FTND, DRQ the null hypothesis shall be that the mean of the iQOS treatment group is equal to the mean of the conventional cigarette treatment group; the alternative hypothesis is that the means are not equal.  

The change from baseline in exposure to the 5 selected biomarkers, mCEQ, QSU-brief, FTND, DRQ and other secondary or exploratory variables shall be analysed with Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with the baseline value as the covariate. The assumptions of the ANCOVA such as Normality of the residuals, and constant variance shall be assessed with residual versus fitted plots and Normal probability plots. If necessary rectifying transformations will be applied, or the data may be analysed with the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for greater than 2 independent groups and the Mann-Whitney test for 2 independent groups for pairwise comparisons.  The Hochberg procedure will be used to control the probability of a Type 1 error. 

The endpoints will be assessed from the data collected from all participants who completed at least the first 8 weeks of the study, for whom baseline data are available and were compliant with the study procedures. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>iQOS is a novel device which heats a specifically designed tobacco stick, known as a HeatStick, rather than burning the tobacco.  In this way it offers smokers an alternative to conventional cigarettes. iQOS has been approved by the New Zealand regulatory authorities and is currently available on the market. The purpose of this study is to find out how the levels of harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) in Maori/Pacific Islander smokers is different depending on if they smoke conventional cigarettes, use the iQOS or abstain from smoking. The study also aims to characterize the subjective effects of smoking in the Maori/Pacific Islander population when switching from conventional smoking to iQOS as compared to continuing with conventional smoking and smoking abstinence.</summary>
