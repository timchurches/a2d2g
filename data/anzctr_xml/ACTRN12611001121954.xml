  <interventions>
    <interventions>Emergency cricothyroidotomy using a scalpel bougie endotracheal tube technique will be performed. This technique involves a transverse stab incision through the skin and cricothyroid membrane or trachea. Once inserted, the scalpel is rotated 90 degrees creating a triangular hole through which a bougie can be inserted down the trachea. This bougie is then used to railroad an endotracheal tube. This trial will compare the Magill tip (firm) and the Parker tip (soft) endotracheal tubes. Three anaesthetists will perform this procedure on 9 cadavers, and will use equal numbers of Magill or Parker tip tubes in a randomised fashion using a crossover design. Each cadaver will be used three times, with one cricothyroid and two tracheal incisions resulting in a total of 27 procedures.</interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional Magill tip endotracheal tube versus the newer designed Parker tip endotracheal tube. The Magill has a firm leading edge which is angled at approximately 60 degrees. The Parker tip has a soft atraumatic tip which is designed to fold and then re-form following intubation.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to simulate cricothyroidotomy using two different types of endotracheal tube, a Magill (rigid) tip and a Parker (soft) tip. The procedure is called a Scalpel bougies technique, where a scalpel stab incision is made through the skin over the cricothyroid membrane. A bougie ( a long hollow tube guide) is inserted through this incision into the treachea, and an endotracheal tube is then advanced over the bougie into the trachea. This endotracheal tube is used to administer life saving oxygen. This technique is only used in an extreme emergency when a patients airway has obstructed, and a doctor is unable to ventilate or intubate any other way. The procedure will be performed on cadavers, and the participants will be specialists anaesthetists. The study will be a prospective randomised controlled trial.</summary>
