  <interventions>
    <interventions>There is one intervention arm, Group circuit training. 
Group circuit training consists of;  - twice weekly balance training strategy exercise class (60 minutes, 8 weeks) aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, balance and reported fatigue. The training intervention providers were registered Physiotherapists with experience working with people with Multiple Sclerosis. Each training intervention Physiotherapist was provided with a list of exercises per station with progression strategies and modifications to be provided as suitable to progress the participant and manage any safety concerns. 
All classes were undertaken at local community halls. Exercises were performed for 5 minutes per station at intensity selected by the participant - best effort - but no more than borg rating of 6/10. A total of 10 stations were included, each lasting for 5 minutes (total of 50 minutes, with 2 stations dedicated to warm up (5 minutes) and cool down (5 minutes). There transition from station to station was 1 minute (total of 9 minutes). Each participant completed 59 minutes of activity, the final minutes used to answer any participant concerns. Rests were provided as required for each participant with no formal time period designated, however each participant was encouraged to pace themselves and to limit their rests to no more than 30 seconds at a time if taken.
Examples of exercises performed
Sit to stand from variable height chair - progressions: speed, base of support, preferential loading, height of chair. 
Marching on the spot - progressions, lifting legs higher, starting from toe off - into claw, reducing hand support, speed.
walking forward and backward - progressions longer steps, faster, narrower base of support
Balance standing dynamic - progression with reduced / altered base of support, increase dynamic trunk and arm movement, distance reached, holding distance reached, changing direction of distances reached, adding unstable surfaces
each interventions is personalised and adapted individually for the group program by the treating physiotherapists monitoring the participants skill of execution and encouraging variances to the task. At 4 weeks all participants were encouraged to increase intensity and beat personal goals of repetitions, speed, distances covered. 
The treating physiotherapists provided ongoing feedback and monitoring of participant adherence and needs. If a participant failed to attend without prior notification, phone contact was made to ascertain concerns / problems and encourage return. </interventions>
    <comparator>Home exercise - twice weekly balance training strategy exercises performed at home independently (60 minutes, 8 weeks) aimed at improving gait speed, endurance, balance and reported fatigue. 
Initial training intervention 1;1. lasting for 60 minutes provided by registered Physiotherapists with experience working with people with Multiple Sclerosis. 
Each participant taken through a list of predetermined exercises (same as provided for intervention arm). Each 5 minute station exercise had a progression strategy and modifications. There were 8 stations in total with two dedicated to warm up and cool down (total 50 minutes activity). 1 minute was allocated to allow transition / set up for next station (total 9 minutes). in total 59 minutes of activity was completed. The treating physiotherapist provided education on when, how and why to modify to ensure safety and participant engagement.  Each participant was provided with a written instruction / pictorial booklet for each exercise and station including modifications and progressions strategies. They were also provided with a exercise recording sheet. 
Each exercise was performed at an intensity selected by the participant - best effort - but no more than borg rating of 6/10. Rests were allowed, however participants were encouraged to pace themselves so they were active for the full 5 minutes of each station and if a rest was required to be no more than 30seconds. 
Equipment required for completion of each station were usual home furniture and environments, including, dinning room chair, lounge chair, step, table, hallway or bench. If the participant did  not have a step a phone book of 10-12cm height was provided which had been bound with masking tape to form a solid block. 
Examples of exercises performed
Sit to stand from variable height chair - progressions: speed, base of support, preferential loading, height of chair. 
Marching on the spot - progressions, lifting legs higher, starting from toe off - into claw, reducing hand support, speed.
walking forward and backward - progressions longer steps, faster, narrower base of support
Balance standing dynamic - progression with reduced / altered base of support, increase dynamic trunk and arm movement, distance reached, holding distance reached, changing direction of distances reached, adding unstable surfaces
The treating physiotherapist contacted the participant every 2 weeks via phone to discuss any concerns, ideas for modifications etc... The participant returned the exercise recording sheets at week 4 and 8. The participant were also provided with the treating physiotherapist contact number should they have urgent concerns or questions. At 4 weeks all participants were encouraged to increase intensity and beat personal goals of repetitions, speed, distances covered. 
The treating physiotherapists contacted the participant via phone if the returned exercise recording sheets had low adherence recorded. The contact goal was to encourage increased adherence and provide further feedback or support should that be needed. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to measure the effect of a functional balance training program on gait, endurance, balance and fatigue in people with MS performed by the participant in a group setting or by the participant independently at home twice per week. The secondary aim is to investigate any predictors of adherence to exercises.</summary>

    <ethicsreview>Approved</ethicsreview>
    <publicnotes>Ethics approval was originally obtained by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of ACT, NSW and Victoria ethics and research committee prior to the commencement of the project and first participant enrolment in 2003. This was completed during my employment with the Multiple Sclerosis Society of NSW (now  MS Society of ACT, NSW and Vic) . Further ethics approval was obtained from the University of Queensland to obtain an official ethics approval number in 2013 to facilitate publication of the findings. Levels of requirement for ethics had altered over the ensuing years necessitating this action. </publicnotes>
