    <concealment>Allergic rhinitis patients attending the health science Clinic, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia, who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be screened and will be invited to participate into this study. For those who has one or more than one of the exclusion criteria will be excluded in this study.

Explanatory statement will be given to those eligible participants and written informed consent will be obtained before the commencement of the study. Consenting participants will then be randomly allocated using a simple random sampling method into the 2 groups:

(i) facial candling treatment (Group A) or
(ii) control groups (Group B</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis:
The sample size is calculated using Power and Sample Size (PS) software 3.1.2 version. Since there is no previous finding of the effect of facial candling treatment on substance P, we chose the related result who have done study on substance P which is traditional Thai massage on lower back pain patients reported by Mackawan et al. The difference between the mean values of the intervention and control groups, and the standard deviation (post-massage) of substance P levels were used as parameters for sample size calculation. Previous study by Mackawan et. al had reported that the mean levels of substance P in the intervention group and control group are 50.43 pg/mL and 56.27 pg/mL, respectively (the difference in the mean values between the experimental and control groups is 5.84 pg/mL). Their findings also showed that the response within each subject group was normally distributed, with the highest recorded standard deviation being 8.3. The Type I error probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis is 0.05. A sample of 33 experimental subjects and 33 control subjects is therefore required to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal, with a probability (power) of 0.8.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatment of facial candling has been very popular especially in Malaysia. It is believed that traditional treatment helps in relieving allergic rhinitis. There is, however, a lack of scientific evidence to support the practice of traditional treatment and  the mechanism as to how facial candling treatment reduce allergic rhinitis. The aim of this study is to investigate the immediate effect of facial candling, substance P, inflammatory mediators among allergic rhinitis patients.</summary>
