    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether ceasing sitagliptin and switching to
      exenatide and metformin is non-inferior to adding exenatide to sitagliptin and metformin, in
      those patients with type 2 diabetes who are experiencing inadequate glycemic control with a
      combination of sitagliptin and metformin.</summary>
