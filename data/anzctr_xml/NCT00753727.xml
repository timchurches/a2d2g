  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Sunitinib malate
Treatment: other - Radiotherapy

Treatment: drugs: Sunitinib malate
Sunitinib dose 50 mg/day orally for 2 weeks prior to radiotherapy. Treatment Dose Levels during radiotherapy: Dose level 0: Sunitinib 50mg/day for 2 weeks prior to radiotherapy, followed by 25mg/day given concurrently with radiotherapy; Dose level 1: Sunitinib 50mg/day for 2 weeks prior to radiotherapy, followed by 37.5mg/day given concurrently with radiotherapy; Dose level -1: Sunitinib 37.5mg/day for 2 weeks prior to radiotherapy, followed by 37.5mg/day given concurrently with radiotherapy. Dose escalation/de-escalation: first 6 patients will be accrued at dose level 0. The dose levels at which subsequent patients will be accrued will be determined using a dose modification schedule.

Treatment: other: Radiotherapy
Preoperative radiotherapy consisting of external beam radiotherapy at a dose of 50.4 Gy given in 28 fractions, five days a week, over five weeks and 3 days to the planning target volume.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research is being done with the aim of developing a more effective treatment than
      standard radiotherapy and surgery alone. Although standard treatment is frequently
      successful, some patients do not respond well to this treatment. Low oxygen levels in
      tumours, which may be a particular problem with sarcomas, are thought to be one factor that
      contributes to failure of radiotherapy. Sunitinib is a new drug that is active against cells
      with low oxygen levels. The combination of sunitinib and radiotherapy has shown promising
      results in other cancers. The purpose of this study is to find out whether treatment with a
      new drug, sunitinib, can increase the effectiveness of radiotherapy at killing cancer cells;
      to test the safety of the combination of sunitinib and radiotherapy.</summary>
