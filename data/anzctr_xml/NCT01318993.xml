An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death; was life threatening; required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in disability/incapacity; was a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline (Week 0) in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP and DBP) Over Period - The SBP and DBP values were obtained as part of vital sign monitoring and measured after the participant was at rest in the supine position for at least 5 minutes. Baseline value was recorded at Week 0. Change from Baseline measurements in SBP and DBP were assessed at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 and 4 weeks post-treatment.

ECG parameters including the change from Baseline in the QTc interval values QTcF and QTcB were summarised. The QTcF is Fridericia's formula and defined as the QT interval/cubed root of the R-R interval. The QTcB is the Bazett's formula defined as the QT/squared root of the R-R interval. The number of participants with change from Baseline in the QTcF and QTcB intervals of &gt;30, 30 to &lt;60 and &gt;=60 milliseconds were assessed at Week 24, 48, 72, 108, and Week 112.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline (Week 0) in Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score Over 108 Weeks - The CDAI score was determined by interactive voice response relationship (IVRS) based on the combination of participant,investigator entries, standardized weight determination, and Hematocrit values received from the central laboratory. The Baseline CDAI score was recorded pre-dose on Week 0. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Remissions are defined as participants with CDAI score of &lt; 150 points. No imputation for missing data was performed. The assessment was based on questionnaire like number of liquid stool in past 7 days, abdominal pain, other symptoms, antidiarrheal use, abdominal mass, anemia, and body weight. The total score is summation of all individual sub-scores. CDAI scoring scale ranges from 0-500 and a score of 150 or below indicates remission and a score above 450 indicates extremely severe disease. A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants in Clinical Remission (CDAI Score Less Than 150) for All Participants, for Participants in Remission at Baseline (Week 0), and for Participants Not in Remission at Baseline Over 108 Weeks - The CDAI score was determined by interactive voice response relationship (IVRS) based on the combination of participant and investigator entries and standardized weight determination. Haematocrit values received from the central laboratory on the day of the visit were to be utilized for calculation of the CDAI scores. The Baseline (Week 0) CDAI score was defined as the last evaluation prior to or on the date the first dose of investigational product is taken. The CDAI score was measured over 108 weeks although it was planned to be measured till 112 weeks. Remissions are defined as subjects with CDAI score of &lt; 150 points. Percentages are based on the number of subjects with observed data. No imputation for missing data was performed. Combined data for participants with remission at Baseline and without remission at Baseline has been presented.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Response (CDAI Decrease of at Least 100 Points From Baseline ([Week 0] of Prior Induction Study) in the Sub-population of Non-responders at Study Entry Over 112 Weeks - The CDAI score was determined by interactive voice response relationship (IVRS) based on the combination of participant and investigator entries and standardized weight determination. Haematocrit values received from the central laboratory on the day of the visit were to be utilized for calculation of the CDAI scores. The Baseline (Week 0) CDAI score was defined as the last evaluation prior to or on the date the first dose of investigational product was taken. Remissions are defined as subjects with CDAI score of &lt; 150 points. Percentages are based on the number of subjects with observed data. No imputation for missing data was performed.</outcome>

    <summary>An open-label study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of GSK1605786A 500 mg twice
      daily over 108 weeks in adult subjects with Crohn's disease. Subjects completing previous
      GSK-sponsored studies with GSK1605786A or subjects who withdraw early from Study CCX114157
      (maintenance study of GSK1605786A) due to worsening of Crohn's disease requiring a treatment
      change may be eligible to participate. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of
      GSK1605786A, as assessed by recording of adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters,
      vital signs and electrocardiogram. Secondary objectives will include assessments of
      effectiveness of long-term treatment with GSK1605786A. Health outcomes assessments will
      include changes in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), SF-36v2, EQ-5D, Work and
      Productivity Activity Impairment-Crohn's Disease (WPAI-CD) and receipt of disability.</summary>
