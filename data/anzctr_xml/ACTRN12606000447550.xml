    <interventions>This is a double-blind, active-controlled, long-term study of a new experimental drug called darusentan. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety of darusentan (50, 100, or 300 mg qd) as compared to an active control (guanfacine 1 mg qd), administered orally. Subjects will be exposed to study drug for an estimated average of 1 year.</interventions>
