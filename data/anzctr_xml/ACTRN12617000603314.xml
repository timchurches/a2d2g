A N:q ratio of 15 to 20 participants per variable is an accepted sample size guide. The total sample size required for this study is 360 to 480 (assuming 14 HAPA constructs, 10 covariates). 
Data will be analysed using descriptive statistics to understand the study sample and confirmatory structural equation modelling to understand the relationships between, and relative importance of, parents attitudes and beliefs and childrens intake of unhealthy foods.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Globally children's intake of unhealthy foods and beverages is excessive, contributing to weight gain and risk of obesity. Parents attitudes and beliefs influencing food provision provide a promising new avenue for obesity prevention through reducing childrens intake of unhealthy foods and beverages. There is a need to understand the relative importance of different parental attitudes and beliefs in influencing their provision, starting with the home setting. The aim of this study is to understand the relationships between, and relative importance of, parents attitudes and beliefs and childrens intake of unhealthy foods and beverages. This aim will be achieved by an online cross-sectional survey of parents of 3-7 year olds to measure parental attitudes and beliefs influencing their provision of unhealthy foods. The data will be examined using Structural Equation Modelling analyses to determine the predictive ability of attitudes and beliefs on parents provision of unhealthy foods to 3-7 year old children. Findings from this study can then be used to develop evidence-based interventions to support parents to limit provision of unhealthy foods and beverages, hence improve energy balance and prevent obesity from an early age. </summary>
