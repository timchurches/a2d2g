  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment Group A - Heat Treatment - usual treatment to manage symptoms and heat treatment.  The participant will continue to have the same treatment they would have had if they were not in the trial and will be asked to put their hands and or feet in warm water for 20 minutes a day, 4 times a week, for 4 or 8 weeks.  An easy to use heat bath will be provided and the participant will be shown how to use the equipment by an experienced study nurse, who will contact them via video call.  
Treatment Group B - Massage Treatment - usual treatment to manage symptoms and massage treatment. The participant will continue to have the same treatment they would have had if they were not in the trial and will be asked to massage their hands and or feet using a massage ball for 5 minutes a day, 4 times a week, for 4 weeks. The participant will be provided with a small massage ball (approximately 10cm diameter) with raised finger-like protrusions to aid the massage and an experienced study nurse will show the participant how to use the ball via video call.
Treatment Group C - Heat and Massage Treatment - usual treatment to manage symptoms, heat treatment and massage treatment.  This treatment is for 4 weeks and includes usual treatment plus both heat treatment and massage treatment as outlined under Treatment A and B above.
The intervention education for all treatment arms may be done face to face by the study nurse if the participant is recruited within a clinic setting.  
Participants will be allocated to usual care or Treatment A for the first 4 weeks of the study.  
At the end of week 4, research staff will contact the participant via phone call to determine whether they have had a response to treatment.  
If the participant in the usual treatment group has not had a response to usual treatment at the end of 4 weeks, they will be re-allocated to either Treatment A or B for weeks 5 to 8.  
If the participant in the Treatment A group has not had a response to Treatment A at the end of 4 weeks, they will be re-allocated to Treatment B or C for weeks 5 to 8.  
If the participant has had a response to usual treatment or Treatment A in the first 4 weeks they will remain on the same treatment for weeks 5 to 8.  
Fidelity of the intervention will be assessed using the framework for behavioural interventions recommended by National Institutes of Health (NIH, US).
Intervention Fidelity Strategies 
Study Design    		Study design procedures have been designed to ensure that the study can adequately test its hypotheses in relation to underlying theory and clinical practices.
Training Providers	Standardized provider training includes procedures to ensure that interventionists have been satisfactorily trained to deliver the intervention to study participants. This will involve:
o	Provision of a study manual to all staff which includes:
o	Generic study related information: standard operating procedures, study overview, reporting/documentation guidelines, communication flowchart, rationale for the study treatment, treatment side effects 
o	Intervener specific information: Job description, intervention protocol, related literature, quality assurance and monitoring
o	Training program including didactic presentations, performance assessment and role play
o	Manualised intervention protocol
Delivery of Treatment	Treatment procedures will be monitored to improve delivery of intervention and comparison of conditions, and ensure that treatment is delivered as intended, through:
o	Bi monthly teleconferences
o	Quality assurance monitoring first five sessions observed by trial manager (trainer), and self and trainer assessment completed using a checklist; if performance is satisfactory at this point one session per month will be recorded and self and trainer assessment completed with feedback provided on performance.	
o	Omissions and/or protocol deviations with interveners reviewed on an individual basis.
o	Intervention checklist completed at the end of each intervention to allow protocol deviation tracking across interveners and conditions.
o	Minimising contamination between conditions by training interveners to address participant questions about randomisation and their assigned condition using non-biased explanations
Receipt of Treatment	Treatment receipt focuses on the participant and includes procedures to assure that the treatment was both received and understood. This will be achieved by:
o	Ensuring participants understand the information provided in intervention, by checking through use of active questions and behavioural observations
Enactment of Treatment Skills	Enactment of treatment skills includes processes to monitor and improve participant ability to perform treatment-related behavioural skills and cognitive strategies in relevant real-life settings as intended. This will be achieved by:
o	ensuring participants are able to demonstrate use of treatments through observing at least one practice session and recording observations in Intervention checklist at the end of each session
o	checking in with participants 3 times in the first week, then weekly until the end of the trial period

Intervention Adherence - participants will be asked to complete diaries to record  intervention sessions and standard care treatments.

    <statisticalmethods>The total sample size will be 612 participants.

Assuming the required minimum difference in proportions between the two groups is 20%, to achieve 80% power for a one-sided test and 95% level of confidence, the required minimum sample size at Stage 2 is 55 per non-responder group. As the intervention is undertaken by individuals at home, and study outcomes relate to each individuals health behaviours, we have estimated a minimal intra-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.01. The proportion of non-responders to the initial interventions is not known, so we estimate 70% non-response to heat therapy. Allowing 30% for attrition at 6 months, 10% for confounders, and an effect size of 1.2, working backwards from the required sample size of 55 per non-responder group at Stage 2, the estimated minimum total sample size for randomisation is 612 (306 per group). 
Data will be analysed using SPSSTM 23. Outcomes will be assessed on a priori hypotheses, with each endpoint being considered separately in the analysis. The primary outcome variable Y is the indicator of whether a participant is experiencing severe sensory symptoms (yes/no) measured at 0, 4 and 8 weeks; and 3 and 6 months, on the CIPN20 sensory symptom subscale. Analyses will be conducted for the total sample, but the analyses will also be repeated for upper and lower extremities, separately. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be generated to characterize the sample and for all measures. 
Primary hypothesis, H1: The impact of the two initial interventions in Stage 1will be assessed in a regression analysis of the main outcome Y, adjusting for covariates such as adherence, time since treatment, site, and baseline variables correlated with Y. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be reported. 
Secondary hypotheses, H2 and H3: Similarly, regression analyses adjusted for covariates will be conducted to assess the impact of the adaptive interventions at Stage 2, to determine: (1) for non-responders to initial Standard Care, the impact of the alternative interventions (A and B); and (2) for non-responders to initial Intervention A, the impact of the alternative interventions (B and C). 
Additional secondary hypotheses, H4 and H5: Similar to the above analyses at Stage 1 and Stage 2, logistic regression analyses will be conducted, but the outcome variables in each analysis will be the proportion of participants with (1) severe CIN motor symptoms; (2) high levels of depression; (3) high levels of anxiety; and (4) low quality of life. 
For all outcome variables, the overall change over time (0, 4 and 8 weeks, 3 and 6 months) between intervention groups and (time*group) interaction effects will be examined, with adjustment for covariates using generalised linear mixed models (GLMM). If there are missing data, analyses are based on the assumption that data are missing at random. GLMMs will allow the inclusion of all available data, including those participants who do not complete all assessments. Evaluation of the first-stage interventions requires pooling Y from the adaptive subgroups 1 to 3 and comparing the resulting average to the pooled Y from subgroups 4 to 6,  This analysis over 8 weeks assesses the difference between the Stage 1 interventions (Standard care vs heat therapy), averaging over the Stage 2 intervention options. There will be no imputation for missing data. Objective 2. To identify the best performing adaptive intervention embedded within the SMART design, we will order the embedded interventions in terms of the largest average reduction in CIN to the smallest reduction.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate effectiveness and cost effectiveness of heat therapy and/or massage in addition to standard care in people with chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or over and meet study definition of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy. 

Study details
Patients will be assigned on a 'chance' basis, (like flipping a coin) to receive standard care or an intervention of standard care and heat therapy treatment for four weeks. If after four weeks the intervention decreases CIN nervous system symptoms then the intervention will continue for another 4 weeks. If symptoms do not improve, then the patient will be assigned on a chance basis to receive an alternative intervention of standard care and heat therapy, standard care and massage or standard care, heat therapy and massage. The second intervention will then be received for four weeks.
Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy has become a significant health issue which can cause treatment delays and affect functional abilities and quality of life.  There are currently no pharmacological interventions that effectively prevent or manage CIN.</summary>
