  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will complete 5 lessons of an internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (iCBT) treatment, the Pain Course (Dear et al., 2013) focusing on the management of pain, anxiety, depression and disability. All 5 Lessons will be administered online (via the internet) and one lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with chronic pain, taking a further 20 minutes per summary. All participants will also receive weekly reminder emails and weekly phone calls by a clinical psychologist. The duration of the reminder emails and phone calls is expected to be 5-10 minutes per week. The duration of the program is 8 weeks. Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, during the treatment, post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment. These questionnaires at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-months follow up will take about 10 minutes to complete. The questionnaires administered during the treatment will take approximately 2 minutes to complete. The software presenting the iCBT treatment course will also record information to inform adherence to the intervention (e.g. lessons completed, download history of other treatment materials in the course, number of logins, and duration of logins).</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be patients receiving treatment for chronic pain at the Pain Management Unit at Prince of Wales Hospital. Patients will be informed of the study by an invitation letter and the Participant Information Sheet delivered in person or by mail by nursing staff unrelated to the study. Participants returning consent forms will be contacted by a Clinical Psychologist in person or by phone at a time convenient to the participant to administer the PHQ-9 and a brief telephone interview to confirm the program is suitable for applicants.</concealment>
