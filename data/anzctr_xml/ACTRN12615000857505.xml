  <interventions>
    <interventions>Manuka Honey with Cyclopower (Trademark) is a fine powder produced by combining (complexing) medical grade (MGO400+) Manuka Honey (45%) with alpha cyclodextrin (55%), a naturally occurring sugar molecule. The complexing process uses liquid honey and produces a fine powder which is presented in a hard shell capsule for oral administration.
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the prebiotic effect of (total dose of 1600 mg/day) Manuka Honey with CycloPower (Trademark) in healthy volunteers after oral administration for 21 days. Tolerability and safety data will also be reported.
The study will consist of 2 treatment periods (TP1 and TP2) of 3 weeks with an intervening washout period of 2 weeks. After successful screening, eligible subjects will be randomized (Day 0) to receive either the active treatment or matching placebo during TP1. After 2 weeks washout during which they will take no study treatments, subjects will then receive the other treatment during TP2. 
Participants will be asked to take two 400 mg Manuka Cyclopower chewable tablets with food, twice per day for 3 weeks. During the course of the study participants will be asked to provide faecal samples at the following time points; on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 of each treatment to evaluate faecal bacterial populations and immune markers. Blood samples will be obtained at the beginning and the end of each treatment to assess general metabolism and blood counts.
 Participants are required to return all unused tablets at the end of the study and note and report when they have missed doses either by text, phone call or at the time of tablet return.

    <concealment>All subjects being considered for the study must meet the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Deviation from
any entry criterion excludes a subject from enrolment into the study.
Each subject in the study is uniquely identified by a subject number.
When the subject has signed the informed consent form, the
investigator or his/her staff will assign the subject number. Informed consent must be obtained before any testing is performed to determine a subjectâ€™s eligibility. Any subjects who are screened but do not meet the entry criteria will be allocated a 900 series number. The first screen failure subject will be assigned the number 901,the second 902 etc.
Randomisation and groups selection occurs with the use of a computer software programme. Subjects and their specimens are only identifiable by the number that is then allocated to them - identifying data will be held in a locked cabinet at the New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research, Palmerston North.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculation for this study was performed on the basis of a previously published study (Gostner et al.,2006 ,British journal of Nutrition, 95, 40-50) to determine the required participant numbers, sample sizes. These researchers found significant differences in relative abundance for three (out of 14) types of bacteria. The power calculations with this data gave the number (20) of participants for 80% power (P=0.05) one tailed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the prebiotic effect of Manuka Honey with CycloPower (Trademark) in healthy volunteers after oral administration for 21 days. Prebiotics are defined as non-digestible substances that pass undigested through the upper  part of the gastrointestinal tract and stimulate the growth and/or activity of health promoting bacteria that colonize the large bowel.
The study is a  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over  study to evaluate the prebiotic effect of Manuka Honey with CycloPower (Trademark) capsules in healthy subjects. Eligible subjects will consume 1600 mg (2 capsules twice per day) of Manuka Honey with Cyclopower or a matching placebo with food. 
The study will consist of 2 treatment periods (TP1 and TP2) of 21 days with an intervening washout period of 14 days.
Following successful screening, eligible subjects will be randomized (Day 0) to receive either the active treatment or matching placebo during TP1. After 2 weeks washout, during which they will take no study treatment, subjects will receive the other treatment during TP2.
Subjects will be given sufficient supplies for 7 days of outpatient treatment after which (Days 7, 14, 21) subjects will return to the clinic for tolerability and dosing compliance assessments. Blood samples will be obtained at the beginning and the end of each treatment to assess general metabolism and blood counts.

Subjects will be provided with containers to collect faecal samples on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21 of each treatment  which should be returned to the clinic for analysis.
