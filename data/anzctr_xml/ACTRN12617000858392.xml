  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group participants will be enrolled for the first time in Folk dances from the Basque Country. The lessons will be taken in official schools. They will receive lessons in groups delivered by a licenced experienced dance professor that supervise and control each lesson during the intervention period.
The participants receive one dance lesson of 90 min per week for 32 weeks. 
The lessons are performed in stable groups of 12-14 participants per lesson leaded by the same professor. 
To monitor adherence a registry of attendance to dance lessons will be used. 
To analyse the intensity of dance lessons and obtain heart rate watches and heart rate sensors will be used every 10 classes. 
The participants will be encouraged to continue with their habitual routines, and regular activities including physical activities.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group are friends or family members from the intervention group (at baseline they should have: similar age, daily-life physical activity and same sex as intervenci√≥n group). They have ever been involved in a continuous activity related with dances (folk, social, salon...jazz, ball-dance) or exercise with musical accompaniment
After the baseline test, the control group will receive three hours of class over multiple sessions. An exercise physiology or physiyotherapist will be responsible of the lessons. During the first class (on the 1st intervention week) the participants will be taught on the minimum requirements of physical activity for health according to the WHO guide 2010. During the second session (on week 4) they will be given advise on exercise safety: footwear and clothing, hydration and nutrition, on the signs and symtoms to stop exercise and, safety under hot or cold weather conditions.
During the third class  (once the program has finished and results of the study analyzed) they will be informed on the effects of dance and folk dances from the basque Country. 
They will be advised to preserve their regular routines during the 32 weeks follow up  intervention period and also the year after the conclusion of intervention.</comparator>

      <outcome>Cognitive function - Trail Making Test A and B
Time to complete the Trail Making Test (TMT, part A and B) will be assessed. The TMT A and B is an executive functioning tests. Part A measures processing speed and involves participants connecting consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-2-3), and Part B is a measure of executive function and involves participants connecting alternating letters and numbers (e.g.,1-A-2-B). The difference in time between the two parts will be calculated to isolate the executive component of this test.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mobility Walking adaptability 
Gait adaptability will be registered with Gaitrite. The participant will be tested under different conditions while walking: habitual and maximum gait speed (temporal demand), steping over an obstacle (obstacle negociation), with horizontal head turns (postural transitions demands) a test adapted from the dynamic gait index.
Step and stride spatial (length, with) and temporal (time) and gait simetry parameters will be obtained to analyze intraindividual variability.</outcome>

      <outcome>The *Short Physical Performance Battery" (SPPB). The battery compromises functional performance: balance, mobility and strength test. The participants are required to keep balance for 10sc in different positions side by side, semitandem and tandem and the test will be perform for a maximum of 30 seconds. The time to complete a 4m walk test and to complete 5 sit-to-stand repetitions from a chair will be record.
Posturographic analysis will be obtained for balance test with Force Plates (Bertec). Gait analysis will be registered with gaitrite and sit to stand test will be registered with force Plates (Bertec)</outcome>

      <outcome>Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test (RAVLT). The test evaluates verbal learning and memory, including proactive inhibition, retroactive inhibition, retention, encoding versus retrieval, and subjective organisation. The test starts with a list of 15 words, which an examiner reads aloud at the rate of one per second. The participant's task is to repeat all the words he or she can remember, in any order. This procedure is carried out a total of five times. Then the examiner presents a second list of 15 words, allowing the participant only one attempt at recall. Immediately following this, the patient is asked to remember as many words as possible from the first list</outcome>

      <outcome>The quick screen is a multifactorial assessment tool that consists of the following measures: 
1) previous falls The participant is asked about the number of falls during the year previous, 
2) medication usage: the participant is asked about the number o medications and the use of medications that affect the nervous system like Sleeping tablet or anti-depressant  or      Major tranquilisers
3) Visual acuity is measured using a chart with low-contrast (10%) letters (similar to a Snellen scale). The client must be able to correctly identify all of the letters on each 
4) Sensation (Tactile sensitivity test involves the use of a pressure aesthesiometer placed on the lateral malleolus of the ankle of the dominant side) ,
5)lower limb strength (5 rep sit-to-stand), 
6). balance and co-ordination and requires to test the alternate step (8-repetitions)and the near tandem for 10sc.
The assessment allows for the identification of people who are at a high risk of falling, in addition to its ability to determine which specific factors contribute to that risk</outcome>

      <outcome>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) long form is a brief, 30-item questionnaire in which
participants are asked to respond by answering yes or no in reference to how they felt over the past week. The GDS may be used with healthy, medically ill and mild to moderately cognitively impaired older adults. It has been extensively used in community, acute and long-term care settings. Scores of 0-4 are considered normal, depending on
age, education, and complaints; 5-8 indicate mild depression; 9-11 indicate moderate depression; and 12-15 indicate severe depression </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>For continuous variables with skewed distributions, data will be transformed and analyses will be performed with the normalized data. Independent t-tests (for continuous data), Chi square or Mann Whitney tests (for categorical data or ordinal variables)  will be used to determine differences between the intervention and control groups at baseline. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the effect of the intervention on outcome measures at follow-up adjusting for baseline values. Possible dose-response relationships were explored using paired t-tests and Analysis of variance for repeated measures (ANOVA). The alpha level will be set at 5%. Analyses will be performed with SPSS (for Windows, IBM Corp)

Regarding the 6MWT the distance covered will be used while the participant maintain the same objective intensity of exercise (determined with whole blood lactate and heart rate) and subjective perceived fatigue (Borg Scale). To confirm the absolute perceived and physiologic absolute intensity some control variables will be obtained. 1) Whole blood lactate will be obtained from the ear lobe (only 0.3¬µl required) at the begining and at the end of the test. 2) Heart rate will be obtained with heart rate stopwatch and sensors (RS300X) Polar at the begining and at the end of the test. 3) Borg dyspnea and fatigue will be obtained at the begining and end of the test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current controlled study aim to compare whether 50-hours folk dancing from the Basque Country and physical activity walking will show differences in motor efficiency, intra-individual variability in high demanding functional and mobility test (i.e. CSRT, whyle walking, in the TU&amp;G, and TU&amp;G cognitive), fall risk, executive function and memory in older over the age of 60 who are cognitively intact with high physical performance levels. It was hypothesised that members of the folk dance group will acheive a higher physical and functional performance, executive function, beter memory, cognitive status and lower physiological fall risk, compared with the PA walking group. We expeculate that folk dance group will acheive also a higher intensity physical activity compared with the physically active group</summary>
