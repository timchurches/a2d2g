    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether 4 days cessation of treatment is sufficient to stop an episode of breakthrough bleeding (BTB) determined from a daily bleeding diary and verified by telephone and face to face interviews.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women requiring hormonal contraception who have consented to enter the study will complete a menstrual attitude questionnaire and undergo physical and gynaecological examination and routine haematological and biochemical tests before being randomly assigned to continuous ring or pill use. Women will maintain menstrual diaries for the 12 month study duration. If a bleeding/spotting episode excedes 4 days they will stop their method for 4 days and restart on the fifth day. Women will be contacted monthly to ensure compliance and will be seen at 2 months, 6 months and 12 months from randomisation for follow up At each visit the women will complete an acceptability questionnaire and a menstrual attitudes questionnaire at the final visit.</summary>
