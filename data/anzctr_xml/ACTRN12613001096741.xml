    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed with the assistance of the RMH Clinical Epidemiology and Health Service Evaluation Unit (EpiCentre). Outcomes will be determined by measuring changes in the relevant parameters for each patient, with the patient and control groups compared by 2 tailed t test for each parameter. As the variables measured are not likely to be independent, a Bonferroni correction will not be applied. 

Sample size: assuming a drop-out rate of 10%, to have an 80% chance of detecting a difference of 1 standard deviation of AFIRMM score improvement in the control group at 95% confidence (2-tailed), 38 patients would need to be enrolled in the study. A single standard deviation of the control group score has been selected as the minimal improvement likely to represent a clinical difference. 

The continuous variables described above will be summarized with standard descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, medians and ranges. Inferential analyses will be parametric except in the case of markedly non-normal distribution.

An alpha level of 0.05 will be used as a cut-off point for statistical significance, and all statistical tests will be 2 sided. Analysis will be intention-to-treat.
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of adverse events, which includes all serious adverse events, at each time point. Adverse events will be summarized by presenting for each treatment group the number and percentage of patients having any adverse event, having an adverse event in each body system and having each individual adverse event. Any other information collected (e.g. severity or relatedness to study medication) will be listed as appropriate.
