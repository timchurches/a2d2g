  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface Area and Volume of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 Using Caliper Measurements - Percent change from baseline in surface area and volume of the treated nodule was determined from hand-held caliper measurements of the length and width of the nodule. Percent change = 100*(Day 57 area [or volume] - baseline area [or volume])/baseline area [or volume]. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (decreased size) while a positive value represents worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 57</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Surface Area and Volume of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 Using Ultrasound - Percent change from baseline in surface area and volume of the treated nodule was determined from ultrasound measurements of the length, width, and depth of the nodule. Percent change = 100*(Day 57 area [or volume] - baseline area [or volume])/baseline area [or volume]. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (decreased size) while a positive value represents worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Consistency of the Treated Nodules at Day 57 - Investigators determined the consistency of the nodule through palpitation using a 5-point scale: 5 = hard (solid), 4 = firm throughout, 3 = moderate firmness, 2 = soft, and 1 = non-palpable. The change scores could range from +4 (greatest worsening in consistency) to -4 (greatest improvement in consistency); a negative change from baseline value reflects improvement from baseline (softening) while a positive value reflects worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change From Baseline in Hardness of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 - A durometer was used to assess nodule hardness on a scale of 0 (soft) to 100 (hard). Percent change = 100*(Day 57 hardness - baseline hardness)/baseline hardness. A negative value represents the improvement from baseline (softening) while a positive value represents worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Nodular Pain of the Treated Nodule at Day 57 - After the nodule was squeezed using a dynamometer, subjects were asked to rate the amount of pain they felt on an 11-point visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain or discomfort) to 10 (extreme pain or discomfort). A negative change from baseline value reflects improvement from baseline (less pain) while a positive value reflects worsening.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigator Global Assessment of Improvement With Treatment - Investigators were asked to determine the degree of improvement in the subject's treated nodule compared with screening on a 7-point scale: 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subject Satisfaction With Treatment - Subjects were asked to rate their satisfaction with treatment on a 5-point scale: 1 = very satisfied, 2 = quite satisfied, 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4 = quite dissatisfied, and 5 = very dissatisfied.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day 57</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Composite Responder Analysis - A composite responder is a subject who had an improved assessment [values of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved)] on the investigator global assessment and had a satisfied assessment [values of 1 (very satisfied) or 2 (quite satisfied)] on the subject assessment.</outcome>
