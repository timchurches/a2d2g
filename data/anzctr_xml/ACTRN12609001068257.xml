  <interventions>
    <interventions>The currently used device name is the KineSpring System.
The device is a permanent implant that is fixed
on the femoral and tibial components of the
knee. The implant is achieved in a single surgery (which should take approximately two hours)
and left permanently in place.
Each subject will undergo a surgical procedure to
implant a permanent knee support device that is
an alternative to traditional knee surgeries to
treat osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee</interventions>

      <outcome>Safety will be determined using the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, and
physical examination findings.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multi-center, prospective, open
label, safety/efficacy study enrolling up to 30 patients.
Safety and efficacy are the primary objectives
based on 
analysis of reported and observed adverse
events and the WOMAC validated OA questionnaire(pain component).  A series of validated subject-completed
questionnaires, a visual analogue scale for pain
and formal orthopaedic examination, will be
performed over the course of the 60 months at
the following intervals: baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6, 12, 24,
36, 48 and 60 months. X-ray and/or MRI data
will be collected pre-operatively and the following
post operative intervals 6 months, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months.</summary>
