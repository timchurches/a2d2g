    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - paricalcitol
Treatment: drugs - placebo

Experimental: Paricalcitol - Participants received paricalcitol capsules 2 µg once a day (two 1 µg paricalcitol capsules), for up to 48 weeks. Participants who completed the 48-week Treatment Period could continue in the Long-term Follow-up Period for an additional 18 months. Participants did not receive study drug during the Long-term Follow-up Period.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Participants received 2 placebo capsules once a day for up to 48 weeks. Participants who completed the 48-week Treatment Period could continue in the Long-term Follow-up Period for an additional 18 months. Participants did not receive study drug during the Long-term Follow-up Period.
