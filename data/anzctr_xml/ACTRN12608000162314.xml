    <interventions>Gamma 3 Trochanteric Nail:
The Gamma3 Short Intramedullary Nailing System was designed to facilitate minimally invasive surgery and reduce Operation  time down to a minimum by the aid of using new instrumentation and an optimized surgical technique. The nails have a proximal diameter of 15.5mm to help minimize the incision length required for minimally invasive surgery. The Gamma3 nail offers the same biomechanical strength and cutout resistance as the well established Trochanteric and Long Gamma Nails. The new lag screw shape has been improved in the area of the thread and the cutting flutes at the tip of the screw. The new design offers superior cutting behavior during lag screw insertion, providing low insertion torque. The new thread design offers grip in the cancellous bone of the femoral head and strong resistance against cut out. The 5mm distal locking screws are currently used in the Gamma-Ti and T2 intramedullary nailing systems.
The gamma nail system will remain in the patients femur permanently.This is a once off treatment</interventions>
    <comparator>Dynamic Hip Screw:
Compared to other hip implants, the Dynamic hip screw  is technically easy to insert. It is designed to transfer some of the load onto the bone, differentiating it from rigid implants that bear the entire load and are thus more in danger of breaking. The gliding mechanism of the dynamic hip screw to a large extent prevents the implant from perforating the acetabulum if the fracture zone slips under stress. The dynamic hip screw principle is therefore a load-sharing rather than a load-bearing internal fixation. Pertrochanteric and intertrochanteric fractures of the type 31-A according to the American society of internal fixation classification are the major indications for the Dynamic hip screw. In extremely unstable fractures, additional implants such as the Dynamic hip screw Trochanter Stabilizing Plate or the Dynamic hip screw Locking Device may be necessary. It is also possible to perform a corrective trochanteric osteotomy using the Dynamic hip screw. For the treatment of lateral fractures of the femoral neck and Pertrochanteric fractures, the Dynamic hip screw  is one of the most popular implants. This is also the case for Trochanteric fractures with subtrochanteric extension. These fractures are classified as trochanteric fractures and must be differentiated from purely subtrochanteric fractures with intact trochanteric zones.The dynamic hip screw will remain in the patient and is a once off treatment for intertrochanteric hip fracture.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study Rationale:
The current choice of treatment for intertrochanteric fracture is the Dynamic Hip Screw. Technical and mechanical failure of this device currently occurs in 6-18% of all cases. Better understanding, more validated data and the need for better treatment regarding intertrochanteric fracture is necessary. "Prospective studies comparing the trochanteric nail, with and without distal interlocking to the sliding/dynamic hip screw are warranted".
 
Study Aim:
The purpose of this prospective randomised study is to compare the intramedullary gamma nail to the dynamic hip screw in regards to functional outcome.

Specific Aims:
The aim of this study is to compare the results of the surgical intervention with parameters such as operative time, blood loss, operative complications and cost for each device.  In the post operative period the functional results of patients will be compared with initial mobilisation and discharge through to long term function and return to activities of daily living. The degree of fracture collapse will be recorded and compared to function.  Long term fracture union will also be assessed.</summary>
