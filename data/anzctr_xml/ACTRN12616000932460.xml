  <interventions>
    <interventions>(1) Individual PMS intervention: Three monthly 90-minute sessions of therapy and a 2-month booster session conducted by a registered clinical psychologist. Sessions were delivered face-to-face or via Sykpe videoconference.  This empirically supported (Hunter, Ussher et al. 2002b) one-to-one intervention uses a combination of narrative and cognitive-behavioural techniques to facilitate womens re-authoring of their experience of PMS, improve coping, and reduce distress  (Ussher, Hunter et al. 2002).  Topics covered are: Information about PMS; Taking care of yourself; Taking care of your needs; Taking care of your relationships; Taking care of your thinking.

(2) Couple-based Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) intervention: Three 90-minute sessions of brief couple-based PMS therapy, conducted on a monthly basis, and a 2-month booster session,  conducted by a registered clinical psychologist. Sessions were delivered face-to-face or via Sykpe videoconference.   The couple-based PMS therapy differs from the one-to-one PMS intervention on which it is based primarily in terms of modality (couple versus individual), and the addition of Couples Dialogue techniques (Hendrix 1990) to facilitate couple communication. This allows for the active involvement of the womans partner in understanding PMS, and in strategies of prevention and amelioration. 

In both conditions, adherence to the intervention program was achieved by following a structured and manualised program for the sessions.  A log of sessions was maintained by the administering psychologist and securely stored. The log recorded the date, attendees, session details and any field notes where relevant.   </interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control: Women in this condition completed evaluation measures at baseline and 5 months later, to mirror the pre-post evaluation of the treatment conditions. Following post-measures, wait-list participants received  the empirically supported self-help PMS intervention booklet developed by the project team (Ussher and Perz 2006)  with the option of attending a 90 minute group session led by the clinical psychologist who administered the intervention conditions to discuss the pack.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The quantitative items and scales in the pre, post and follow-up questionnaires were analysed with conventional SPSS statistical tools. Standard descriptive analyses were performed to establish incidence data on depression and anxiety, ratings of premenstrual distress, ratings of premenstrual coping, and relationship satisfaction.  Statistical significance testing of intervention efficacy was conducted with ANCOVAs assessing differences between groups across testing sessions. Further, as a test of clinical significance, variability of response to treatment within the sample was tested with the complementary statistical methods of Reliable Change Index and Regression-based z scores as recommended by Johnson, Dow, Lynch and Hermann (2006).
Minimum sample sizes of 20-30 women per group have been recommended for PMS research (Robinson and Garfinkel 1990). A target of 30 women in each group was deemed sufficient for the examination of differences in effect and mechanisms, between groups and allow for some natural attrition to occur.  No sample size calculations were performed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Premenstrual symptomatology is now widely recognised to be a major social and health problem, with epidemiological surveys estimating that up to 95% of women experience physical and psychological changes premenstrually (Mortola 1992). Up to 40% experience moderate distress, categorised by clinicians and researchers as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), and 13-19% experience severe distress and disruption to their lives, categorised as Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) (Halbreich, Borenstein et al. 2003). The costs of premenstrual distress, in terms of impact upon womens quality of life and economic functioning, are estimated to be considerable (Robinson and Swindle 2000). A range of PMS treatments have been developed, however, these have been directed solely at women with PMS, consisting of individual psychological therapy or medical intervention, and there have been no systematic evaluations of couple-based interventions for PMS. This negates research evidence that PMS is a relational issue, with premenstrual distress developing, and being positioned as PMS, within family relationships (Perz and Ussher 2006; Ussher 2006). Based within the University of Western Sydney, in partnership with FPA Health (Family Planning Association, NSW), the aims of this project were to draw on and augment an ongoing program of PMS research through: 
1.	Evaluating the relative efficacy of a brief couple-based PMS intervention, in comparison to an empirically supported one-to-one PMS intervention, and a wait-list control, within a randomised controlled trial, using the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative methods.
