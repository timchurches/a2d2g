  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hatha Yoga (postures and meditation).  Participants randomised to the experimental condition will engage in a 10-week yoga program delivered at their place of work (UWS Campbelltown Campus) three days per week for one hour per session.  Sessions will be group-based and will be led by an experienced yoga instructor from Yoga Synergy Pty Ltd (Sydney, Australia).  The program will involve teaching beginner students safely and progressively over 10 weeks, a yoga sequence that incorporates asanas (poses and postures), vinyasa (exercises),  pranayama (breathing control) and meditation. The sequence design will be aimed at developing strength, flexibility, cardiovascular fitness, increasing energy and the ability to deal with stress. All postures have a simple and a more challenging version so participants will be able to choose the level of difficulty that is appropriate to them on any given day.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart Rate Variability:  Evaluation of HRV will be completed in a quiet and temperature controlled room in accordance with procedures developed by the Task Force for Pacing and Electrophysiology.  Participants will be advised to abstain from caffeinated food and beverages on the day of their assessments; repeat assessments will be completed at the precisely the same time of day.   After 15 minutes of supine rest with a regular and calm breathing pattern, a continuous 10-minute ECG recording will be collected using an applanation tonometer interface with HRV software (Sphygmocor, AtCor Medical Pty, Sydney, Australia). From the electrocardiographic recording, the following statistical and geometric time domain indices will be calculated from RR intervals: standard deviation of the NN intervals, and the root mean square of the difference of successive R-R intervals, triangular index and the HRV index.  Frequency domain variables including total, high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) power and LF:HF ratio will be derived from spectral analysis of successive R-R intervals.  This technique separates the heart rate spectrum into its frequency components and provides quantitative estimates of sympathetic and vagal influences on the heart.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life:  The Medical Outcomes Trust Short-form 36 Health Status Questionnaire (SF36) Version 1.0 is a generic health status measure that assesses eight domains of quality of life.  This instrument demonstrates a high degree of internal consistency and construct validity, has been designed for self-administration, and has been shown to be sensitive enough to detect changes over time in response to a yoga intervention.  The survey will be self-administered in a quiet office at each timepoint.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Job satisfaction and general work-related stress: will be evaluated via global Job Descriptive Index and Job in General Scale, respectively.  Both scales have been validated for use in the general population, including office workers.  The survey will be self-administered in a quiet office at each timepoint.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>State and Trait Anxiety:  The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is a widely used and validated inventory that consists of two, twenty-item self-report scales for measuring state anxiety and trait anxiety as distinct and clearly defined psychological constructs in adults.  The survey will be self-administered in a quiet office at each timepoint.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:  Chronic work-related stress is a significant and independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by inactivity.  Heart rate variability (HRV) provides an estimate of parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic control, and can serve as a marker of stress.  Hatha yoga is a physically demanding and psychologically relaxing intervention that could mitigate work-related stress, however time constraints including work and family life may limit participation.  The purpose of the present study is to determine the effect of a 10-week, worksite yoga program delivered during office hours (i.e. lunch break) on resting HRV and related physical and psychological parameters in a sedentary office workers with limited to no experience with yoga.  
Methods and design:  This is a parallel-arm RCT that will compare the outcomes of participants assigned to the experimental treatment arm (yoga) with those assigned to a non-treatment control group.  The yoga intervention will be a progressive, beginners program, emphasize flowing physical postures (vinyasa) with an intention to improve psychological and physical markers of health status.  The primary outcome of this study is parasympathetic control of heart function as determined by analysis of HRV.  Secondary outcomes include measures of physical functioning and psychological health status, including anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction.  Measures will be collected prior to and following the intervention period, and at 6 months follow-up to determine the effect of withdrawal of the intervention.</summary>
