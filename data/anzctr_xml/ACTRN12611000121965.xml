  <interventions>
    <interventions>Internet-based insomnia treatment program (SHUTi). SHUTi is an automated self-help program consisting of a 6 week program conducted over a window of 9 weeks. Participation in the intervention involves approximately 1-2 hours per week. At five points during the study, participants will be asked to keep track of their sleep through a diary for a two week period. This will occur prior to initiation of the active intervention phase, immediately following active intervention phase, and also at 6-, 12- and18-month followups. This sleep diary takes about 5 minutes each day to complete and enter online. Participants will also be contacted to complete online questionnaires at baseline, after the intervention period (9 weeks), and then at 6, 12 and 18 months. The program is based on cognitive behaviour therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Internet-delivered control condition (HealthWatch). HealthWatch requires participants to complete online open ended questions that probe health and social issues. It consists of a six part program delivered over nine weeks. Participation in the intervention involves approximately 1-2 hours per week. It delivers an online package of educational material with information about general health risks.In this condition, participants will be asked to monitor their sleep, to read information about how to improve your general health, and then answer some questions that look at ways to change their lifestyle to improve health. It contains no specific mental health information.</comparator>
