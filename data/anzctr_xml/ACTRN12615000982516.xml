  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1  athletes under take screening tests looking at balance (Standing Excursion Balance test, single leg squat) and Landing technique (Drop Vertical Jump, hopping, box drop landing).  The control group receive no intervention or feedback,   and athletes continue with their normal training.

Arm 2  athletes under take the same screening tests, and are randomly allocated to the intervention group.  The intervention involves a neuromuscular warm up, to be conducted at the start of team trainings and games, instead of the usual team warm up.  The intervention exercises will take 15 minutes, equivalent to time typically allocated to team warm ups.  Athletes will be re assessed at 6 weeks and 6 months

WARM UP INCLUDES:
Jogging, side steps, dynamic stretching (3 mins)
Strength/activation exercises (e.g lunges, nordic lowers, single leg stability)   - 4 mins
Balance/Proprioception - double and single leg landing practice, in all directions.  Introduce light perturbations and landing with arms overhead.  (3 minutes)
Functional Agility: cutting movements, quick acceleration and deceleration, including unanticipated change in direction  (3 mins)

Sport Specific Movement patterns: 1 on 1 offence vs defence cutting, sidesteps.  2 minutes</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomisation will be in the form of cluster randomisation.  Teams will be recruited to participate in the study.  Athletes in each participating team will be provided with a patient information statement, and consent form.  Once players from the team have returned their consent forms, the team will be allocated randomly to control or intervention group via contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is off site at a central administration site (allocation concealment).   Teams in the control group will not be informed about the content of the intervention exercises to prevent contamination.</concealment>
    <sequence>Cluster randomisation of teams will occur via simple randomisation, using a computerised sequence generation.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Linear mixed models will be used to assess the effect of the intervention on athletic task biomechanics. Chi square tests will test for differences in injury rates between the two groups. Multivariable regression models will be used to indentify predictors of injury

The primary outcome measure will be the Landing Error Scoring System (LESS), which has been shown to be a valid and reliable clinical assessment tool for the biomechanics of jump landing (d. Padua, Marshall, &amp; Boling, 2009). 
A recent study by Padua et al (2015) found that injured participants scored 1.81 points higher on the LESS than uninjured subjects, which knee experts would consider to be a large, and clinically meaningful difference.  Standard deviations of the LESS assessment range between 1.68 and 2 ((d. Padua et al., 2009; D. A. Padua et al., 2015; Smith, Johnson, &amp; Shultz, 2012)

An apriori power analysis was conducted using a mean difference of 1.8, with a conservative SD of 2.0.  A T- test with two tails was performed, determining a total sample size for each group to be 19. 

Similar studies following teams in season have found subject drop outs of up to 25%.  To account for subject drop out, we would plan on recruiting 30 athletes for each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It has been suggested that faulty biomechanics contribute to the high rate of lower extremity injuries in basketball and netball. This project will involve a cluster randomized controlled trial that will investigate if a sports-specific injury prevention program results in changes in landing biomechanics among netball and basketball players.</summary>
