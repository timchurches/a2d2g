  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is = 60 years of age at the time of signing the ICF

          2. Subject has primary (ie, de novo) or secondary (progression of MDS or
             myeloproliferative neoplasms ([MPN], or therapy-related) AML according to WHO
             classification (Appendix B)

          3. Subject has received second- or third-line/regimen of AML therapy; note that, for
             subjects having AML secondary to prior higher risk [Intermediate-2 or High risk
             according to the International Prognostic Scoring System] MDS treated with a
             hypomethylating agent [eg, azacitidine or decitabine], the hypomethylating therapy can
             be counted as a line/regimen if there is disease progression to AML during or shortly
             [eg, within 60 days] after the hypomethylating therapy.)

          4. Subject has the following disease status:

               1. Refractory to or relapsed after second- or third-line/regimen of intensive
                  therapy for AML (eg, the "7 + 3" regimen):

                  at least 5% leukemic blasts in bone marrow (the minimum number of treatment
                  cycles of the intensive therapy is per the investigator's discretion); or

               2. Refractory to or relapsed after second- or third-line low-intensity AML therapy
                  (eg, LDAC, azacitidine or decitabine):

             at least 5% leukemic blasts in bone marrow after at least 2 treatment cycles

          5. Subject is eligible for and willing to receive the pre-selected CCR treatment option,
             according to the investigator's assessment (Note: Subjects with degenerative and toxic
             encephalopathies, especially after the use of methotrexate or treatment with ionizing
             radiation, should not receive cytarabine.)

             (Appendix D)

             only"PCR assay, Abbott RealTime IDH2) in samples of bone marrow aspirate and
             peripheral blood, and confirmed positive in bone marrow aspirate and/or peripheral
             blood. (Note: in the event that the central laboratory result is delayed and precludes
             acute clinical management of a subject who has confirmed IDH2 gene mutation by local
             evaluation, the subject may be eligible for randomization with approval by the Medical
             Monitor.)

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)

                  x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless considered due to leukemic organ
                  involvement, following review by the Medical Monitor; and

               -  Serum total bilirubin = 1.5 x ULN, unless considered due to Gilbert's syndrome
                  (eg, a gene mutation in UGT1A1) or leukemic organ involvement, following review
