  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects assigned to the intervention group will participate in an 8 week exercise program.  The program will comprise two supervised sessions each week, conducted by a registered physiotherapist, and an additional minimum of three unsupervised training sessions per week. 

Each supervised session will comprise of at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise in the form of a walking program, and a cycling program on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. The walking program will be prescribed at a walking speed equal to 80% of the average speed achieved during the 6MWT. The cycling program will be prescribed at = 60% of peak power achieved during the CPET. Progression of the intensity and duration of the programs aerobic components, both supervised and unsupervised, will be titrated to a Borg of 4-6 or a RPE of 14-16 depending on the symptom of exercise limitation.

Each supervised session will also comprise a strengthening program targeting the muscle groups identified as weak in the baseline strength testing. Strength training will be calculated based on 70% of a one-repetition maximum (1RM) as found at baseline. Progression of the strength training will involve increasing the weight by 5% of the 1RM each week.

The unsupervised training sessions will comprise of a walking program that involves a minimum of 30 minutes exercise for each of the sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care for the control group will comprise; (i) usual medications and, (ii) interacting with medical staff as required. For the purposes of this study, the usual  care group will also interact with the investigators once a week to complete scripted phone interview regarding daily physical activity. This will allow description of changes in daily physical activity in this group associated with spontaneous recovery and will assist to control for improvements in the intervention arm resulting purely from attention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak VO2 will be assessed via a gas analysis system during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). The CPET allows a detailed analysis of the cardiac and pulmonary responses to a progressive increase in power on a cycle ergometer. Blood lactate concentration during exercise will be measured in a small drop of blood obtained following a puncture of the finger tip using a lancet.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The patient will complete a CPET 1 week prior to commencing the intervention or control and 1 week after completing the intervention or control. The first CPET will be conducted within 4-6 weeks of discharge from an acute care facility.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knee extension, shoulder flexion, elbow flexion and grip strength will be measured. Isometric knee extensor strength will be measured using a fixed force plate that measures accurately up to1000N (Mecmesin BFG1000). Shoulder flexion and elbow flexion and extension will be measured using a hand held dynamometer. Grip strength will be measured by a JAMAR Adjustable Hand Dynamometer. Multiple measures will be made to account for improvements resulting from familiarisation. The highest within 5% of two other measures will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week prior to commencing the intervention or control and 1 week after completing the intervention or control.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Exercise capacity will be measured via the 6 minute walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT will be performed twice, separated by a 30 min rest period on a 30 m level course within the hospital. The protocol as established by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) will be adapted to include continuous monitoring of heart rate via a heart rate monitor and arterial oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week prior to commencing the intervention or control and 1 week after completing the intervention or control.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective assessment of physical activity in daily life will be performed using the SenseWear armband (Body Media, Inc., USA). It is non intrusive and will be worn on the right arm during the waking hours of 7 consecutive days. The SenseWear system has been demonstrated to yield valid and reliable measure of energy expenditure in both healthy and COPD populations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 week prior to commencing the intervention or control and 1 week after completing the intervention or control.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the lung as a result of the bodys response to a significant insult. The initial insult can occur within the lung or outside the lung. Acute Lung Injury is characterised by fluid which leaks into the lungs causing severe hypoxaemia. Patients diagnosed with ALI are critically ill and require an admission to intensive care. Preliminary data suggest that patients who survive ALI go on to experience marked limitations to everyday functioning and impaired quality of life (well being).  This research aims to evaluate a program of supervised training on the exercise capacity and physical activity of people who survive ALI.

We hypothesise that compared with usual care, a supervised high intensity exercise training program will be effective at improving exercise capacity and daily physical activity in ALI survivors</summary>
