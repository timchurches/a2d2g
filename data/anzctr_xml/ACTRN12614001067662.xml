  <interventions>
    <interventions>Trial a package of human and animal intervention strategies directly targeted at breaking the lifecycle of pork tapeworm (Taenia solium). The human package consists of Abendazole 400mg administered orally once daily for 3 consecutive days, offered to all eligible human participants (n~300) of this study site and repeated again at a six month interval. This dose regime was administered by a team of qualified medical personnel visiting each household individually to explain life cycle and reason for intervention, along with distribution of education materials, soap and water buckets in order to allow participants to make an informed decision regarding participation, and provide a post treatment faceal sample in a safe way. Response to antihelmintic treatment is measured by comparing pre and post treatment parasite burdens on a subset of the population through combination ELISA, microscopy and PCR techniques. Ongoing social research approaches have been measuring the change in Knowledge, attitudes and pratices (KAP) and response to the intervention.    </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of parasite burden (Taenia solium and other Soil Transmitted Helminths) compared to the baseline/pre-treatment prevalence data. Faecal samples are processed via microscopy, identification of T. solium antigens (ELISA) and genetic sequencing (PCR).  </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after the final human drug administration. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in Knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding a range of issues including latrine use, handwashing and pig control. This will be done via qualitative evaluation methodologies, for example outcome mapping and Focus Group Discussions. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To explore the risk factors for transmission and the socioeconomic impact of pig-associated zoonotic diseases in Lao PDR, developing recommendations for catch-all control measures that will impact multiple diseases, and thereby improve biosafety and limit disease transmission to the human population. In particular:

Develop and trial strategies to better define and manage the risk from zoonotic disease at pilot sites within each production-market chain

Trial a package of human and animal intervention strategies directly targeted at breaking the lifecycle of pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) - including administration of worm tablets to the total human population (n=300) of this study site
