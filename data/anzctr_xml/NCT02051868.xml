  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best overall response rate by 24 weeks post treatment - Best overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients achieving confirmed partial or complete responses as per RECIST v1.1 by 24 weeks post treatment start in the intention to treat population. Sensitivity analyse will also be performed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of conducting a multicentre, international study on squamous cell carcinoma of the anus and recruiting within a reasonable time frame. - The study will be conducted in approximately 50 international centres. This secondary endpoint will be measured by (i) the proportion of centres that successfully recruit at least one patient and (ii) overall recruitment rate. We anticipate and would be able to confirm feasibility if 80% of the centres fully engaged with the study. The aim would be to recruit 80 patients in 36 months (10 by month 6, 20 by month 12, 50 by month 24 and 80 by month 36).</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Toxicity - Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Toxicity will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 4 weeks post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival - This is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of confirmed clinical/radiological progression or death from any cause. Patients who are lost to follow-up, withdraw from follow-up or alive and progression free will be censored at the date of last follow-up.</outcome>
      <timepoint>PFS will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 12 months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival - This is calculated from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause. Patients, in whom no death is recorded, will be censored at the date they were last seen alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival will be analysed once all patients have been followed up for at least 12 months post treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease control rate - Disease control rate is defined as complete response, partial response or stable disease, and will be assessed in accordance with the RECIST criteria v1.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 and 24 weeks post treatment start</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best overall response rate of non-irradiated lesions - Best overall response of non-irradiated lesions is defined as the percentage of patients achieving confirmed partial response or complete response as per RECIST v1.1 of non-irradiated sites of disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks post treatment start</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anti-tumour activity and magnitude of tumour response - Anti-tumour activity and magnitude of response will be captured by waterfall plot analyses and indicate the percentage change in tumour size from baseline to the time of best response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life - Quality of Life will be evaluated using the EORTC QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. The functional and symptomatic scales and global health status from the QLQ C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be calculated as per EORTC and EuroQol guidelines, respectively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identification of potential tumour biomarker - Archived tumour tissue (if available) and blood sample will be taken at baseline with a repeat blood sample taken upon progression. Patient can enrol in an optional biomarker study where an additional tumour biopsy would be requested when they progress. The aim of this exploratory analysis is to evaluate the expression of tumour biomarkers in the study population and investigate the association of these with treatment outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anal cancer is a relatively uncommon disease and there is currently no standard chemotherapy
      treatment for patients with inoperable locally recurrent or metastatic disease. The aim of
      this phase II study is compare two well known and largely used chemotherapy regimens -
      Cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil vs Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel. The result of this study will
      set a standard of care for this disease and provide useful information for future Phase III
      trials.</summary>
