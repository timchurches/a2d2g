  <interventions>
    <interventions>We propose to determine whether Urocortin 2 (Ucn2) can inhibit sympathetic nerve activity (measured in the leg) in 8 healthy male volunteers and 8 males with stable heart failure. 
Participants will receive in a random order either Ucn2 (25 ug ) or matching placebo infusions over 60minutes on 2 separate occasions separated by 8 weeks. Each study day will occur on the third day of identical and constant salt controlled diets (Sodium 120mmol/day, Potassium 100mmol/day for 2 days prior to the infusion on Day 3.
On the morning of each study day, subjects will positioned in a lazy-boy reclined chair where they will remain for the duration of the study. Microneurography needles will be inserted in the right superficial peroneal nerve in the lower leg. Blood pressure and nerve activity recordings will be measured continuously and blood sampling will occur at 15 minute intervals from 30 minutes prior to infusion to 2 hours after.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>That Urocortin 2 will lower Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and calculated total peripheral resistance (CTPR) and increase Hear Rate (HR) and cardiac output. Continuous arterial pressure and heart rate will be obtained using the FINAPRES system, a photoplethysmographic device based on the volume-clamp technique. Stroke volume and therefore caridac output and CTPR can be derived from the arterial pulsewave for each heartbeat using the MODELFLOW method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Haemodynamic recordings will be collected continuously and analysed at 15 minute intervals from 30 minutes prior to the infusion to 2 hours afterwards.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Urocortin 2 will result in either no change or a decrease in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA). MSNA will be recorded by microneurography needles inserted in the right superficial peroneal nerve for postganlionic MSNA. The burst frequency and burst area will be analysed in 5min block.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Nerve activity will be recorded continuously and blood sampling will occur at 15 minute intervals from 30 minutes prior to infusion to 2 hours aftrewards. Nerve activity will be analysed in 5 minute blocks.</timepoint>

    <concealment>The sample size of 8 healthy and 8 stable heart failure participants in a crossover design is based on pragmatic rather than formal statistical criteria. This is a standard sample size for phase I/IIa studies of this type, seeking to affirm safety results from earlier studies and provide signals of potential efficacy.</concealment>
    <sequence>A cross-over design of UCN2 and placebo infusion in a random order. A randomisation scheme will be established in advance for both parts of this study. This randomisation will determine the sequence in which the two treatments are delivered to the participants. This randomisation scheme will be constructed in the manner of a balanced latin-Square design with the sequence allocation remaining blinded to the investigators.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death and significant burden on our health system. Existing drug treatments remain less than ideal. We need additional effective strategies for management of these patients. Reducing sympathetic nerve firing directed at the heart, which may exacerbate heart damage and cause sudden death, is desirable following heart attacks. A family of hormones, the urocortins (Ucn), have been proposed as novel therapeutic agents in this setting. We propose to determine whether Ucn can also inhibit sympathetic nerve activity (measured in the leg) in  8 healthy male volunteers and 8 males with stable heart failure. 
Participants will receive in a random order either Ucn2 (25 ug over 60 min) or matching placebo infusions on 2 separate occasions separated by 8 weeks. Each study day will occur on the fourth day of identical and constant salt controlled diets. On the morning of each study day, subjects will positioned in a lazy-boy reclined chair where they will remain for the duration of the study. Microneurography needles will be inserted in the right superficial peroneal nerve in the lower leg. Blood pressure will be measured continuously throughtout the infusion. Nerve activity recordings and blood sampling will occur at 5-15 minute intervals from 30 minutes prior to infusion for 2 hours
These studies should clarify the true therapeutic potential of Ucn in cardiovascular disease.</summary>
