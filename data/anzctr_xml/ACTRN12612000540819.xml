  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1: The effect of oral low dose prednisolone on arterial stiffness (assessed by pulse wave analysis from radial artery using Sphygmocor device), sympathetic nervous system activity ( assessed using a task force haemodynamic monitor), energy metabolism (using indirect calorimetry,assessing brown fat activity using FLIR T425 infrared camera)  and carbohydrate metabolism (by serial glucose, insulin and C peptide ), in patients aged more than 30years with inflammatory rheumatologic disease will be studied before and after a seven day course of oral prednisolone (mean dose of arm 2). The tests will be done before and 1 to 2.5hours after a mixed meal (10 Kcal/Kg) on the day studied (involves two visits, total duration of 5hours on study day).
Group 2: The effect of oral low dose prednisolone(4 to 10mg/day) on arterial stiffness, sympathetic nervous system activity, energy and carbohydrate metabolism in patients aged more than 30years with inflammatory rheumatologic disease on oral prednisolone for more than 6 months will be studied before and 1 to 2.5 hours after a mixed meal( 10Kcal/Kg). (involves single visit,total duration of 5hours on study day).</interventions>
    <comparator>The study include two designs:
Longitudinal study :Subects with inflammatory rheumatological disease who have not received prednisolone for more than 6 months (Group1) will be studied before and after seven day course of prednisolone (mean dose of Group2).
Cross-sectional study: Baseline data from Group 1 will be compared to that of matched subjects on 4-10mg/day of prednisolone for more than 6 months (Group 2) for inflammatory rhematologic disease</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Glucocorticoids are potent anti inflammatory agents that are used to treat a wide range of inflammatory and rheumatologic conditions. Most patients require a relatively low dose of glucocorticoid for disease control, with one study reporting a mean prednisolone dose of 8mg/day which is approximately 2 to 3 times the physiological glucocorticoid production. The purpose of this study is to investigate : 
whether typical therapeutic steroid doses increase the risk of a heart attack.
whether high blood sugars after a meal are related to risk of heart attack.
a novel mechanism by which steroids might increase fat mass through reducing brown fat activity.</summary>
