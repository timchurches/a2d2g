  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Life expectancy &gt;12 weeks.

          2. BMI is between 18 to 32 kg/m2

          3. Subjects whose advanced cancer has failed treatment or whose cancer has progressed
             following available standard therapy or for whom such therapy is not acceptable to the
             subject. Subjects whose tumor tissue local laboratory results are HER2 ISH positive or
             IHC3+ must have been previously treated with a HER2 targeting therapy (e.g.
             trastuzumab, in the country or region where such therapies are available and part of
             standard of care), or have failed SOC therapy. Subjects who have been previously
             treated with a HER2 targeting therapy such as trastuzumab or ado-trastuzumab emtansine
             are eligible.

          4. Disease measurability: Phase 1a: measureable or non-measureable disease; Phase 1b:
             disease must be measureable (per RECIST v1.1) (subjects with non-measureable disease
             are not eligible for Phase 1b).

          5. Histopathologic evidence of breast cancer based upon pathologist's report.

             ISH HER2 assay. Pre-screening for HER2 is allowed only for subjects with breast and
             gastric cancer, where applicable. Subjects with other types of cancer must have
             previously tested for HER2 status by HER2 IHC or ISH assay. 1) Phase 1a: ISH positive
             or IHC 2+ or 3+. 2) Phase 1b: Cohort 1: advanced breast cancer, ISH positive or IHC
             3+; Cohort 2: advanced breast cancer, ISH negative with IHC 2+; and Cohort 3: advanced
             gastric cancer, ISH positive or IHC 3+.

          7. Local pathology laboratory determination of HER2 status will be accepted, provided
             that the local laboratory is an accredited site for HER2 testing. In Phase 1b, if the
             local laboratory was not accredited at the time of testing, an adequate tumor tissue
             sample is required for central pathology laboratory HER2 testing. The tissue sample

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a 2-part, Phase 1 FIH study with Phase 1a designed to determine the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD)/recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) in subjects with metastatic cancers with a human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) test result that is in situ hybridization (ISH)
      positive (+) or immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or 2+, and Phase 1b designed to assess
      anticancer activity and safety in three expansion cohorts: two different advanced breast
      cancer expansion cohorts (namely, for tumors that test as HER2 ISH positive or IHC3+ and for
      tumors that test as HER2 ISH negative with IHC 2+), and one advanced gastric cancer expansion
      cohort (for tumors that test as HER2 ISH positive or IHC3+).</summary>
