  <interventions>
    <interventions>One hundred and forty two consecutive patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups, a periarticular infiltration group (Group A) and an intraarticular injection group (Group B). Both groups received the same infiltrate  a combination of 30mg ketorolac, 500mcg of adrenaline, and 300mg of ropivacaine, and normal saline. 

In Group A patients, the 150mL was infiltrated after implantation of the prosthesis, prior to insertion of the polyethylene liner. Of this, 50mL was infiltrated into the posterior capsule and intercondylar area; 50mL was infiltrated into the anterior capsule, the collateral ligaments and along the femur and tibia; and the remaining 50mL was infiltrated into subcutaneous tissue following closure of the capsule.

Group B patients had all of the 150ml injected intraarticularly after closure of the wound.

    <statisticalmethods>Data analysis Demographic variables for participants will be described as using mean and standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables or frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Trends over time in response variables will be analysed using standard regression models, and used to compare pre-treatment to the treatment period, but adjusting for the multiple assessments on each participant as a random effect (ANOVA for repeated measures). Data analysed by intention-to-treat basis. A sample size of 142 (71 participants in each group) would be sufficient for a power of 0.8, with an alpha level of 0.05 and expecting a medium effect size of 0.25.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common operation for knee arthritis.  Effective pain control is important in post-operative recovery and rehabilitation. Recent studies have shown that injections of a mixture of medications into the tissues around the knee at the time of surgery can decrease the amount of pain experienced after surgery, leading to improved rehabilitation and a shorter hospital stay. We would like to determine if pain is better controlled with injections into the tissues around the knee joint (periarticular), compared to injections into the joint itself (intraarticular) at the time of total knee replacement surgery.</summary>
