  <interventions>
    <interventions>This cross-sectional study will examine the association between exogenous insulin dose and inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelin-1 in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.  Measurement of markers of metabolic stress will be done as a single assessment at enrollment into the study. All biomarkers will be compared between patients into the first and third tertile of insulin doses. Mean levels of insulin dose/kg of body weight will be reported for each tertile. 
After completion of enrollment, participants will be divided into 3 equal groups based on ordered distribution of their insulin dose/kg of body weight  (1st tertile, 2nd tertile and 3rd tertile). Tertile is defined as any of the two points that divide an ordered distribution into three parts, each containing a third of the population.

    <statisticalmethods>Based on previous studies reporting hsCRP values in insulin treated type 2 diabetes,, eighty patients should be enrolled to have a 97.1% statistical power to detect a 0.5 mg/dl difference between groups with an alpha value of 5% for a 95% CI. 
Patients will be divided in 3 equal groups based on tertiles of insulin dose/kg of body weight (low, medium and high insulin dose). Mean values or proportions of clinical and standard biochemical parameters, as well as hsCRP, pentraxin 3 (PTX 3), nitrotyrosine and endothelin-1 will be compared between 1st and 3rd tertile using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests as appropriate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will examine the hypothesis that higher doses of insulin chronically administered to patients with type 2 diabetes are associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. The study is observational, no intervention will be made on insulin treatment before or during the study.</summary>
