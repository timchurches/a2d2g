  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cross-over trial of 2 weeks of snus (1g of tobacco which contains 5mg of nicotine) ad lib (the frequency of administration is left up to each individual to decide so that each person can tailor the dose to his or her individual nicotine addiction) placed under upper lip, 2 weeks of novel nicotine pouch (4mg nicotine in a sachet) ad lib placed under upper lip, and 2 weeks of nicotine gum (4mg nicotine). The washout period is the first week of each two week arm of the trial in the sense that we will discard the diary entries from the first week of each arm, and only analyse the diary entries of product use and cigarette smoking from the second week. This approach has been taken to help participants develop a routine of keeping a daily diary.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is the acceptibiliy of the products.  This is measured by the amount of product that subjects use each fortnight, and the Cigarette Evaluation Scale scores.  This outcome is measured at the end of each treatment fortnight.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The timepoin is that this outcome is measured at the end of each fortnight of products used.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in number of cigarettes smoked per day in the last week of each of the three treatment fortnights, compared tot he amount smoked in the lead-in week.  The amount smoked is recorded by self-report of diary cards.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint is that the reductioon in cigaettes smoked is measured as the amount smoked in the last week of each fortnight of treatment compared to the amount smoked in the lead-in week.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A secondary outcome will be the Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS) scores for each of the three products.  The scores of one product can be compared with the scores of the other products to see which products are most effective at inhibiting withdrawal symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MNWS scores are tested on the last day of each of the three treatment fortnights.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to test the acceptability of snus, compared to nicotine pouch (the pouch is like a sachet), compared to nicotine gum, and the degree to which each of these products reduces the number of cigarettes that people smoke. The hypothesis is that people will find snus and the nicotine pouch more acceptable than nicotine gum, and that the snus and the nicotine pouch will result in a larger reduction in number of cigarettes smoked per day than is acheived using nicotine gum. We have no hypothesis about the relative accepability or smoking reduction effectiveness of snus compared to nicotine pouch.</summary>
