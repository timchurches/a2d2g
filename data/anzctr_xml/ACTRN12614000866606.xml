  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an extended analysis of an earlier study, Chloride High Level of Resuscitation Infusion Delivered Evaluation (CHLORIDE), registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT 00885404. The study was conducted in the 22-bed multidisciplinary  ICU of the  Austin  Hospital, Heidelberg, Victoria. 

In the original prospective sequential study, the sequence consisted of a 6 month control period followed by a 6 month 'washout' period that included staff education and a 6 month intervention period. During the intervention period, ICU clinicians were not allowed to use chloride-rich fluids - 0.9% saline, Gelofusine, or Albumex 4 (4%  albumin) - in their routine practice. In replacement, they were encouraged to use existing lower chloride fluids - Hartmanns solution, Plasma-Lyte 148, and Albumex 20. However, chloride-rich  fluids were allowed under  exclusive and specific prescription  by an  ICU specialist  for  conditions which might be considered likely to benefit from their  use (e.g., hyponatremia,  cerebral  edema, marked hypochloremic alkalosis). 

Adherence to the intervention was ensured through close coordination with the Pharmacy Unit. The Unit strictly supplied only low-chloride intravenous fluids during the intervention period. The only high chloride solution bags available in the ICU during this period were stored in an ICU specialist's room, released after specific prescriptions described above. 

For this study, the chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid intervention had been maintained in the same ICU for the subsequent 6 months, extending the intervention period to 1 year. We now have a longer intervention period when the most common prescribers (ICU residents and fellows) had not received any specific training and simply rotated through the ICU when only low chloride fluids were available. </interventions>
    <comparator>During the first 6 month of the original study, the control period; ICU clinicians were free to use any intravenous fluids based on clinical preference. None of the clinicians was aware of the plan to conduct  a trial involving removal of chloride-rich  fluids from ICU practice. The fluids available included 0.9% saline, Gelofusine,  Albumex 4 (4%  albumin), Hartmanns  solution,  Plasma-Lyte 148, and Albumex 20 (20% albumin).

We now prolong the the control period to include the preceding 6 months; extending the control period to 1 year. This would not have affected the study protocol as the control arm was a standard intravenous practice period without clinician awareness.

    <statisticalmethods>We will perform baseline comparisons using Chi-square tests for equal proportion with results reported as numbers, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. We will present continuously normally distributed variables as means (95%CI) and compare using student t-tests. We will analyze acute kidney injury (defined by KDIGO) and the need for RRT using logistic regression and report the results as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. We will present time-to-event analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves and perform comparisons using log-rank tests.

We will perform multivariable logistic regression analysis on all outcomes, adjusting for the predefined covariates of sex, APACHE III score, diagnosis, operative status, and admission type (elective or emergency). 

We will perform further sensitivity analysis by comparing outcomes during each 6-month period of this extended study: the original control, the extended control, the original intervention and the extended intervention periods. We will  compare the incidence of KDIGO-defined AKI stages 2 and 3, and the need for RRT between these 4 groups also adjusting for the above variables. To further determine if the treatment effect was consistent across periods, we plan to fit interaction between treatment (intervention vs control) and period (original vs extended).

To reduce the chance of a type I error due to reporting multiple outcomes, we will use a two-sided P value of &lt;0.01 to indicate statistical significance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intravenous fluid therapy may influence outcomes in critically ill patients. Some of these outcomes have been linked to the contents of intravenous fluids, including colloid source and electrolyte compositions. The chloride content of intravenous fluids has recently emerged as an area of interest in terms of renal injury.

For example, a double-blind randomized controlled trial in healthy volunteers showed significantly better renal cortical tissue perfusion following a 2L infusion of a low-chloride fluid (Plasma-Lyte-Registered Trade Mark) compared with a high-chloride fluid (0.9% saline) (Chowdhury et al 2012). Similar effects were seen with the administration of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) in a low chloride solution compared to HES in saline (Chowdhury et al 2014). These studies suggest that excess chloride administration may modulate renal perfusion in man. However, the clinical implications of reducing chloride administration remain poorly understood. We previously reported the findings of a before-and-after study of restrictive vs. liberal intravenous chloride administration in a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU).  Although our study found a beneficial renal effect of restricting chloride administration, it was suggested that a Hawthorne effect induced by preparation and education for the before-and-after study may have accounted for the findings .

Accordingly, to mitigate the impact of such a putative Hawthorne effect, we extended the control and the intervention periods of our study from 6 months to 1 year to include a longer control period and an intervention period when the most common prescribers (ICU residents and fellows) had not received any specific training and simply rotated through the ICU when only low chloride fluids were available. We hypothesize that extending the study period will not affect our earlier finding of decreased incidence of acute kidney injury with chloride-restrictive intravenous fluid strategy compared with chloride-liberal strategy.</summary>
