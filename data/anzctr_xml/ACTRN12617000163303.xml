    <interventions>Exercise Intervention:
The Ex-Med Cancer exercise intervention will involve a 3-month, group-based, supervised exercise program delivered in community fitness centres/gyms in Victoria. Prior to commencing the program, each participant will receive a consultation and individual exercise session (~60 min) with an exercise physiologists (EP) in order to individualise the exercise prescription to their specific needs according to their cancer and general health history, physical abilities and personal preferences. A combination of aerobic (e.g. walking, jogging, cycling) and resistance (i.e. lifting weights) exercise will be undertaken 3 times per week. Specifically, the aerobic exercise component will include 20 to 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity cardiovascular exercise (~60-85% of estimated maximum heart rate) using a variety of modes such as walking or jogging on a treadmill, cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer. Participants will be encouraged to undertake additional home-based aerobic exercise with the goal of achieving a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity aerobic exercise each week. The resistance exercise component will involve 6-8 exercises that target the major upper and lower body muscle groups. Intensity will be manipulated from 6-12 repetition maximum (RM; i.e. the maximal weight that can be lifted 6 to 12 times which is equivalent to ~60-85% of 1RM) using 1-4 sets per exercise. Exercise prescription will be progressive and modified according to individual response. Exercise sessions will take approximately 60 minutes and will be supervised by an experienced EP.  Compliance and attendance (including the reason for any missed sessions) will be tracked throughout the program by the EP. At the completion of the 3-month supervised exercise intervention survivors will have an individual consultation with their EP (~60 min). The consultation will re-evaluate their personalised exercise prescription taking into account participants progress through the exercise sessions and develop a plan for long-term exercise behaviour.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of  Ex-Med Cancer, a community-based exercise medicine program designed to improve physical and psychosocial wellbeing in cancer survivors.   

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have completed cancer treatment (surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) within the previous one year (Note: participants are eligible if they are currently receiving/scheduled to receive hormone therapy).

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will complete a 12 week group-based, supervised exercise program delivered 3 times per week in community fitness centres/gyms in Victoria. Participants will receive an individualised exercise plan developed by an up-skilled  exercise physiologist. Exercise sessions will last approximately one hour and comprise of a combination of aerobic, strength and flexibility training. 

This trial will provide information on whether Ex-Med Cancer is an acceptable, efficacious and sustainable model of care that has the potential to be translated into cancer care.</summary>
