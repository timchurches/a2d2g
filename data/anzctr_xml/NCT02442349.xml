  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to RECIST 1.1 - Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions. ORR is the percentage of patients with at least 1 visit response of CR or PR (according to independent review) that was confirmed at least 4 weeks later, prior to progression or further anti-cancer therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from time of first dose until objective disease progression, for an average of approximately 12 months. Results are based on the data cut off of 04 March 2016 (about 18 weeks after LSFD).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease Control Rate (DCR) According to RECIST 1.1 - Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1) assessed by MRI or CT: Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; Partial Response (PR): &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of Target Lesions (compared to baseline) and no new lesions; Stable disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as a response nor sufficient growth to qualify as progression; Progressive Disease (PD): &gt;= 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs and an absolute increase in sum of diameters of &gt;=5mm (compared to the previous minimum sum) or progression of NTLs or a new lesion. DCR is the percentage of patients with best response of CR, PR or SD (according to independent review), prior to progression (PD) or further anti-cancer therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>RECIST tumour assessments every 6 weeks from time first dose until date of progression, for an average of approximately 12 months. Results are based on the data cut off of 04 March 2016 (about 18 weeks after LSFD).</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Aged at least 18 years. Patient from Asia Pacific will be enrolled only.

             radiotherapy.

          -  Radiological documentation of disease progression on the last treatment administered
             prior to enrolling in the study: following 1st line EGFR TKI treatment but who have
             not received further treatment OR following prior therapy with an EGFR TKI and a
             platinum-based doublet chemotherapy. Patients may have also received additional lines
             of treatment.

             L861Q).

          -  Patients must have central confirmation of tumour T790M mutation positive status from
             a biopsy sample taken after confirmation of disease progression on the most recent
             treatment regimen.

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status 0-1 with no deterioration over the
             previous 2 weeks and a minimum life expectancy of 12 weeks.

          -  At least one lesion, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the
             study screening period, that can be accurately measured at baseline as =10mm in the
             longest diameter (except lymph nodes which must have short axis =15mm) with
             computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is suitable for
             accurate repeated measurements.

             pregnancy test.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Treatment with an EGFR-TKI (eg, erlotinib, gefitinib, icotinib or afatinib) within 8
             days or approximately 5x half-life of study entry; any cytotoxic chemotherapy,
             investigational agents or other anticancer drugs within 14 days of study entry;
             previous treatment with AZD9291 or a 3rd generation EGFR TKIs; Major surgery within 4
             weeks of study entry; radiotherapy treatment to more than 30% of the bone marrow or
             with a wide field of radiation within 4 weeks of study entry; currently receiving
             treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4.

          -  Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy.

          -  Unstable spinal cord compression or brain metastases.

          -  Severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including uncontrolled hypertension and
             active bleeding diatheses or infection.

          -  Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases or bowel resection.

          -  Cardiac disease.

          -  Past medical history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
             disease, radiation pneumonitis which required steroid treatment, or any evidence of
