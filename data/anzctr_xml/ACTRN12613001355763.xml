  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) incidence is rising globally at a rate of 35% per year with patients having increased susceptibility to macrovascular complications and diabetic retinopathy a major microvascular complication of diabetes. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of disability and death, with diabetic retinopathy the leading cause of blindness and significant burden to the individual and society. Current treatments target elevated blood glucose, high blood lipids and blood pressure, however diabetic patients continue to have 2- to 4-fold greater risk of a heart attack (MI), hence the optimum treatment for minimising this complication during diabetes has not yet been established, and additional treatment strategies are urgently needed. 

Hormones of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) are key mediators of adverse complications in diabetes, with blockade of this system by medications known as angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are routinely used as therapy for diabetes; although there are mixed reports for their efficacy in diabetic retinopathy. We propose this variability is due to the action of aldosterone, another steroid hormone in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Aldosterone exerts adverse actions via activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), often referred to as aldosterone receptors. Our hypothesis is that adding a medication known as aldosterone receptor antagonist to standard treatment for T1D will delay or prevent
progression of complications of diabetes. Although this medication is used treat patients with heart failure and MI,
there are no clinical trials investigating this medication in T1D. 

The design is open label, 9 week duration, proof-of-concept
study to assess the efficacy of the selective "aldosterone receptor" antagonist, eplerenone in T1D. Twenty patients with T1D will be recruited from the Diabetes clinic. They will have baseline measures within the first week and then receive eplerenone for 12 weeks in addition to standard treatment. The same measures are repeated in each patient at the end of the treatment period; hence the proof-of-concept is baseline versus treatment for each person. The patients will return 7 days after completing the study for routine clinical visit. A separate group of 20 age matched, healthy volunteers will be recruited for comparing the same measures to establish prognostic markers. 

Our specific objectives are: 
1. Prevent and arrest the complications of diabetes on cardiac structure and function, including platelet activation and reactivity and endothelial dysfunction; 
2. Prevent progression to diabetic retinopathy; 
3. Improve metabolic control; 
4. Provide prognostic and predictive biomarkers for clinical
management.</summary>
