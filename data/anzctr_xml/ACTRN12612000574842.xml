  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well established that industrial trans fatty acids (TFA) are harmful to health however, little is known about the effects of the natural TFA found in dairy. Some like the FDA feel that all TFA is harmful and have recommended that intake be limited as much as possible.   An observational study by CVRU suggests that dairy TFAs may be harmful to cardiac health. Conversely a recent Harvard University observational cross sectional study observed that these isomers reduced insulin resistance. This interventional study is a randomised clinical study in 180 participants and assesses the effects of changing dairy intake on TFA, inflammatory markers, lipids, insulin resistance and anthropomorphic parameters.</summary>
