  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this project is to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the impact of high intensity pelvic floor muscle exercise training (PFMET), versus usual care and sham PFMET, in prostatectomy patients. Participants will receive 3 sets of PFMET (usual care) or 6 sets of PFMET (  6 sets fast and slow combination in functional positions), over 3 months.
1. The intervention for each group commences 4-6 weeks prior to prostatectomy and continues for 3 months post- prostatectomy
2. The Pelvic floor exercises consist of a number of sets completed/day with 6 sets to be completed each day with each set consisting of 10 x1 sec 'quick fibre' fast pelvic floor muscle contractions and 10 'slow fibre' holding contractions for 10 sec each, with a 10 sec rest and all sets to be performed in standing. A diary to record sets completed per day has been provided to each participant. The intervention will be taught one on one by a  physiotherapist skilled in pelvic floor rehabilitation and  a fortnightly review will ensure adherence to program, correct technique and ongoing assessment. The period of time for a crossover to take place is at 12 weeks post op for those in the usual care group who have not attained full continence..</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Participants will receive 3 sets/day  of PFMET (usual care) with only slow holds of 10sec endurance. in a supine position with each set consisting of 10 contractions/set. A physiotherapist will teach this pre-operatively one on one and a diary for participants to complete exercise targets has been provided.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of two different pelvic floor muscle exercise training (PFMET) methods on urinary function, erectile dysfunction and quality of life in prostatectomy patients. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and have prostate cancer about to be treated by radical prostatectomy. 

Study details
Participants will be allocated by chance to one of two exercise training programs which will complement usual components of continence management completed over a three months period. One group will receive the high intensity pelvic floor muscle exercise training (PFMET) and the other will receive sham PFMET. Other usual care components of management which both groups will receive include general continence, avoidance of caffeine and alcohol, and lifestyle modification advice. Measurement of urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and Quality of Life will be taken at completion of the intervention program.
This study may be beneficial to medical health care teams providing pre and post rehabilitation strategies for men undergoing surgery for prostate cancer. Both urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction are expected side affects for men from treatment and methods to improve these have limited evidence in research currently.</summary>
