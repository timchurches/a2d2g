  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Boomerang Effect program is a 2 year comprehensive program aimed at developing a range of skills that contribute to resilience and potentially contribute to mental health prevention. The 8 intervention modules are: 1. Positivity 2. Motivation and Best Self 3. Mindfulness 4. Emotion Management 5. Other resiliency skills 6. World Skills 7. Work ethic &amp; Organisation 8. Optimal Environment. The program is flexible and can be delivered as 1-2 longer classes per week or 3 to 5 shorter 10-20 min classes delivered in 'home room' or assembly. Teachers will be teaching the program. Key teachers at each school attend a one off 1 day face-to-face training program with Boomerang Effect developers. These key teachers provide train the trainer sessions for other teachers on staff at their schools.    </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will be a school with similar population demographics that will complete the standardised measures at the same time points as the intervention group. This comparison school will have the option to implement the program at a later date.
The comparison school will have their normal classes at the same time as the intervention school.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25 (CD-RISC 25); a brief and extensively cited measure of resilience.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Students &amp; Teachers will complete the CD-RISC 25 at the commencement and completion of each module and at the same time points for comparison school participants.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 1: Specific measures targeted to skills in each module e.g. for Module 1 Positivity, student participants will complete the Life Orientation Test- Revised (LOT-R) LOT-R and Positive Self Questionnaire (PSQ); measures of optimism/positivity and self-efficacy respectively.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the commencement and completion of each specific module and at the same time points for comparison school participants.
  
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 2: Teacher participants and comparison measures: Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), a reliable and brief measure of the 3 dimensions of work engagement- vigour, dedication and absorption.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the commencement and completion of each module and at the same time points for comparison school participants.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 3: Teacher participants and comparison measures: Teacher Sense of Efficacy Scale (TSES), a highly reliable measure assessing teacher efficacy in student engagement, instructional strategies and classroom management domains.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the commencement and completion of each module and at the same time points for comparison school participants.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Outcome 4: Teacher participants and comparison measures: Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), a reliable and valid tool measuring two core dimensions of burnout, exhaustion and disengagement.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis question will be: Do participants in the intervention groups show significantly more positive outcomes than participants in comparison groups?
For the quantitative pilot phase of the study, we will aim to recruit 250 student and 30 teacher participants as this is an average pilot study sample size. It will allow for trends to emerge and is adequate to assess statistical difference pre/post intervention modules. 
Differences between groups (intervention and comparison groups) and in individuals over time (e.g. Pre-test and post-test) will be examined in a variety of ways including repeated measures t-tests and analyses of co-variance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of a resiliency and well-being program (Boomerang Effect program), that is being taught to high schools students. The study also looks at the effects of the different skills that are taught such as positivity, motivation, mindfulness, emotional management and other resiliency skills. We expect that the students who are taught the skills will show improvements in their resiliency, well-being and a range of coping skills.</summary>
