    <interventions>In addition to normal training participants will receive following exercises:

Arm 1. 
NEURAC training - All exercises were conducted in closed kinematic chains on slings placed on the gym horizontal bar and ladders. The exercises were prepared to easily implement them in normal volleyball training. The order and description of exercises are as follows:
1.	Blocking exercises:
A) Starting position (SP): The player is lying face down, the upper limbs bent at the elbows, hands placed on slings, body is in one line. Movement: lifting the torso up (in line) with the movement of elbows straightening. At the beginning, the subjects are supported on their knees, and in the next training they supported on their toes.
B) SP: as Above. Movement: moving the upper limbs forward. As a modification, a sensorimotor pillow was introduced to the exercise, under the toes.
C) SP: The player is lying back, the upper limbs bent at the elbows, hands on slings, lower limbs based on the heels. Movement: lifting the torso up, straightening the elbows and lifting the upper limbs.

2.	Attack exercises: 
A) SP: The player is face down, his hands on slings, body in a straight line, supported on the toes. Movement: the practitioner raises up the trunk, raising a hand in front. 
B) SP: The player is kneeling straight (knees on a sensorimotor pillow), hands on slings, arms in internal rotation. Movement: sweeping work by attacking upper limb.

The exercises were carried out two times a week for eight weeks. Each exercise was performed in two series of eight repetitions. In each repetition, the subjects had to keep the ending position for three seconds. Between sets of exercises there was a five-minute break.. The exercises lasted about 20 minutes. The training was performed by professional trainer in small group. It was a supervised training. Register of attendance at sessions was conducted.

      <outcome>The Functional Movement Screen.
The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a collection of motor tests, wherein the proper execution of each of the individual tests requires the ability to perform a movement in three dimensions. The FMS evaluates the quality of the basic locomotor pattern, and any possible limitations or asymmetries in the movement patterns performed.

    <statisticalmethods>The necessary sample size was assessed based on preliminary results on 10 participants. Calculation of sample size was based on a alpha of 0.05, a statistical power of 0.80. Based on this calculation we aimed to recruit 40 patients for each treatment group. Due to that, necessary sample size should be more than 80 (control and experimental groups). Taking into account some problems with participants (potential injury, disease, refusal from experiment later in study) we decided to recruit about 50 patients for each group. 

Analysis of variance for repeated measurements.
The critical p level was set at 0,05.</statisticalmethods>
