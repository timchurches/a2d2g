  <interventions>
    <interventions>After approval from the treating anaesthetist and voluntary informed consent by the parent/guardian, the participants will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation to receive either the comparator formulation (n of 75) or the Chocolate-based tramadol oral Delivery System CDS tablet (n of 75) on a 1 mg/kg dose basis by mouth as prescribed by the treating anaesthetist. The comparator formulation is a 5 mg/ml tramadol oral liquid prepared by reconstituting the commercial 50 mg tramadol capsules in water as per recommendations issued at The Royal Childrens Hospital in Melbourne. The drug administration is just for the one administration timepoint (prior to surgery). No additional prescriptions of study medication will be given after this time point.

Compliance of taking the drug as well as a scale scored by the child and the parent on how much he/she likes/dislikes the sample will be recorded. 
If the child spits out the dose immediately, the treating anaesthetist will decide in line with current routine management, whether a second dose is required. If the second dose is recommended, the treating anaesthetist along with the parent/child will decide upon the same dosage form or the alternative form. 
The pharmacokinetic parameters of the chocolate-based tramadol tablet and the compounded tramadol compararot solution will be evaluated using a validated HPLC assay and a flexible blood sampling protocol.</interventions>

    <concealment>All patients will be recruited at the pre-anaesthetic review. Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria for the study will be enrolled and only after informed consent is given voluntarily by the parent/guardian and by the patient if appropriate.
The patients will be randomised by computer generated block randomisation. Following written informed consent, the participant will be assigned the next available Participant Number. The Participant Number will correspond to a numbered randomisation envelope. The randomisation is concealed in the closed opaque envelope and will only be opened by the  research team member at the time of enrolment. The participant number will be used to identify the patient for the duration of the study.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size
This pilot study will apply the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistical test to test our hypothesis. We estimate that, with the effect size d=0.5 and alpha=0.05, we will have 80% power to detect a difference with 67 children in each group (G * Power 3.1). Given that some children may drop out of this study, we will recruit 75 children in each group.
Palpability assessment
Taste data will be analysed using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test and 2-tailed unpaired t-test. The gender distribution and the participants willingness of taking the second dose will be analysed using 2-tailed Chi-square test. All statistical analyses will be performed with PRISM 6 for Mac (GraphPad software). A P value &lt;0.05 is considered statistically significant. 
Pharmacokinetic assessment
A simulation based method was used to determine the power to achieve adequate evidence of equivalent relative bioavailability. Specifically, 1,000 datasets of 150 patients each were simulated using literature values for tramadol with a blood sampling regimen based on that which was able to be obtained in a similar recent study of midazolam (average of 2.5 samples/ patient).
Each dataset was then analysed within NONMEM and the 90% CI for the ratio parameter obtained. Models for which this fell within the range of 0.80 to 1.25, in accordance with FDA and EMA guidance, were counted as successful. Given even a true ratio did not achieve a power of 80% (expected to be lower than that achieved with midazolam given tramadol has a longer half-life), simulations were repeated with the final sample between 2-4 hours after dose. With this additional sample, there was 80% power for true ratios between 0.94 and 1.06. Reducing the patient number to 100 with the same sampling schedule resulted in inadequate power.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a limited number of strong pain relieving medications available for children. All have their own advantages and dis-advantages. For example, anti-inflammatories, like ibuprofen, are unsuitable for those with a bleeding risk and can cause kidney damage. Morphine like drugs come with the risk of slowing breathing and a fear of diversion for illegal use.  Tramadol is a medicine that has been used safely for many years in both adults and children. Its advantage is that is has similar pain relieving power to morphine like drugs in the typical dose range, but because it works in a different way, it has much less ability to impair breathing. 
Its main disadvantage in children is that the drug itself tastes very bitter. In adults, this is overcome by presenting the medication in capsules, so the drug is not released until it reaches the stomach. While there are some 82 registered products in Australia containing tramadol, none of them are licenced for use in children. To provide a suitable dose to small child, the standard adult dose capsule must be broken open, the drug dissolved in water, and the correct proportion given.  This is cumbersome for parents, risks error in dosing and produces a horrible tasting solution that most children dislike.
There is one preparation available (although not licensed for use in children) of very concentrated oral drops, 1ml containing 100mg of drug, equal to 2 standard capsules. This is unsuitable for young children because the risk of overdose with such a concentrated solution is great, and has occurred with this formulation. 
 To make drugs more palatable to young children they are often dissolved in syrup, but this only masks the bitter taste to a degree and often involves adding artificial flavours and sweeteners. The pharmacy department at Princess Margaret hospital (PMH) in partnership with the Anaesthesiology, Pharmacology and Pharmacy Unit at the University of Western Australia has developed a novel chocolate sweet which can be used to mask the taste of bitter drugs. It has already been used successfully for other medications and found to be very acceptable to children. Using this delivery system has also given the ability to deliver a smaller defined dose, not previously available in Australia, which will allow easier and more reliable dosing in smaller children.  
This study plans to test the chocolate tramadol tablet against the current broken-open capsule method of delivering tramadol in patients following minor to moderate operations at Princess Margaret Hospital. We will compare how the new tablet is tolerated, absorbed and if it is an effective pain reliever.  Ultimately we hope to develop a new method to deliver tramadol so it can be more easily and safely be given to children.
