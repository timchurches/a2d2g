  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Histologicaly confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (gastroesophageal junction included).
Radical excision of the tumor: complete resection of (macroscopically) visible tumor, clear resection margins, no evidence of disease in the peritoneum or in other organs. Patients with limited infiltration of adjacent organs (lesser omentum, pancreas, mesocolon) will be eligible for the study provided that the (macroscopically) visible disease has been resected and the resection margins are clear.

Otherwise, 24h urine collection or Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is required).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares the efficacy of a docetaxel and platinum adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in patients with high-risk gastric cancer with that of the same chemotherapy plus radiotherapy.  

Patients with histologically proven, radically resected gastric cancer, stage &gt; T3 and/or N+ are randomised between 6 cycles of docetaxel with cisplatin (or carboplatin), both at 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (arm A) or the same treatment with radiotherapy (arm B) (45 Gy). The prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET/HGFR), Microtubule-associated-protein (MAP-Tau), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression  are also studied using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMA).</summary>
