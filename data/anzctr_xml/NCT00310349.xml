  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PneuMum is a randomised controlled trial that aims to find out if pneumococcal vaccination
      for Australian Indigenous mothers, in the last few months of pregnancy or at delivery, can
      prevent ear disease in infants. Mothers will receive the 23 valent pneumococcal
      polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) either: a) during the third trimester of pregnancy; b) soon
      after child birth; or c) seven months after child birth (control group). The adult
      diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTPa) will be used as the control
      vaccine for the birth dose.

      The study aims to recruit 210 Indigenous women aged 18-39 years who have an uncomplicated
      pregnancy. Following recruitment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      groups.

      Each mother and infant will be followed from pregnancy until the baby is seven months of age.
      Children will receive all of their routinely recommended vaccinations in accordance with the
      standard vaccination schedule.

      The primary outcome will be prevalence of ear infection at seven months of age, defined as
      middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane perforation or acute otitis media. Pneumatic
      otoscopy, video-otoscopy and tympanometry will be used in the ear examinations. The primary
      analyses will be a direct comparison of the proportion of infants in the control group who
      have nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine type pneumococci at seven months of age compared to
      infants in each of the other two groups and a similar comparison of the proportion with
      middle ear disease.</summary>
