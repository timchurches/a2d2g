  <interventions>
    <interventions>The variability of day to day measurements of forced oscillation technique (FOT) are being evaluated in children with asthma and compared to children without asthma. FOT measurements are made once daily during the five day study.

FOT is a tidal breathing test (performed during normal breathing) and is non-invasive. It takes 5 minutes. It is done at the asthma camp under supervision by someone trained in the technique</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Variability in FOT. Variability will be assessed by looking at the between-session changes (i.e. day to day change) expressed as the within subject standard deviation across the FOT outcomes.</outcome>
      <timepoint>across five days of measurement starting from the baseline measurement (first day of the study)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>relationship to asthma control and severity. These will be assessed based on the current recommendations of GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma). Questionnaire data. It has been developed specifically for this study based on components from other validated questionnaires (GINA, CAPS study).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>comparison of day to day variability between cohorts using parametric and non parametric statistical tests as applicable.
All subjects attending the asthma camp were recruited (approximately 20-25) and will therefore form the subject number - power calculation of sample size was not possible as this type of data has not been described before. Each subject provides 5 days worth of daily measurements</statisticalmethods>
