  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Low vitamin D levels in the blood are a common problem in the elderly. One of the main functions of vitamin D is to help absorb calcium to keep bones strong, but low vitamin D levels have been associated with muscle weakness and an increased risk of falls. Low vitamin D levels have also been linked to a number of neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinsons disease. Since the role of the nervous system is to send signals to the muscles to produce smooth and coordinated movements to maintain balance and prevent falling, it is possible that the increased risk of falling that has been associated with low vitamin D levels is related to its effects on the brain and nervous system. This study has been designed to investigate the effects of 3-months of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength, muscle power and function as well as neural activity in the brain and nervous system in older women with mild vitamin D deficiency. Women aged 60 years and over will be randomised to receive either 2000 IU of vitamin D supplementation daily or a matched placebo control. Women will undergo muscle strength and function tests as well as non-invasive neural testing prior to study commencement and after 3 months' supplementation.</summary>
