  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.	Enrolled mothers will be randomised to receive either placebo or 1000 IU/day or 2000 IU/day of vitamin D3.
2.	The infants of these mothers will be randomised to receive placebo, if their mother was randomised to placebo, 400 IU/day (if mothers dose was 1000 IU/day) or 800 IU/day of vitamin D3 (if mothers dose was 2000 IU/day).

Vitamin D supplementation and placebo will be an oral liquid medicine

Each enrolled pregnant woman will receive the study medicine from enrollment at apporximately 28 gestation until childbirth.  Each enrolled infant will receive the study medicine from birth until 6 months of age.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo is a thin vegetable oil (purified components of coconut and palm oil).  the placebo is given in the same dose and for the same duration and the study medicine, i.e. one drop per day for pregnant mothers from enrollment until childbirth and one drop per day for each infant from birth until 6 months of age</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the proportion of infants achieving a serum 25[OH]vitamin D concentration &gt; 75 nmol/L at 6 months of age.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each enrolled pregnant woman will have 2 blood samples obtained for measurement of 25[OH]vitamin D concentration. The first will be at booking (approx. 28 weeks) and the second at approx. 36 weeks gestation. 25[OH]vitamin D concentration will be measured on an umbilical cord blood sample collected at birth. 25[OH]vitamin D concentration will be measured on blood samples collected from the infant at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months of age.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of mothers and infants with hypercalcaemia at any measurement point.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Each enrolled pregnant woman will have 2 blood samples obtained for measurement of serum calcium concentration. The first will be at booking (approx. 28 weeks) and the second at approx 36 weeks gestation. Serum calcium concentration will be measured on an umbilical cord blood sample collected at birth. Serum calcium concentration will be measured on blood samples collected from the infant at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months of age.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is the proportion of mothers achieving a serum 25[OH]vitamin D concentration &gt; 75 nmol/L at 36 weeks gestation.</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>We will exclude pregnant mothers taking vitamin D supplementation that exceeds 200 IU/day &amp; those with a history of renal stones or hypercalcaemia or found to be hypercalcaemic at enrolment. We will also exclude any serious complication of pregnancy at the time of enrolment.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In New Zealand the Ministry of Health does not currently recommend vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy or infancy.  Vitamin D deficiency is common in New Zealand as are poor health outcomes associated with vitamin D deficiency. 

Aim: To determine the vitamin D dose in pregnancy and early life that safely and effectively increases serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration in infants.

Design: A double blind randomised placebo controlled trial of 2 different daily vitamin D doses in pregnancy and early infancy.

Outcomes: (1) Provide advice to the Ministry of Health as to the most appropriate vitamin D dose in pregnancy and infancy for New Zealand, and (2) to determine the most appropriate vitamin D dose in pregnancy and infancy for a proposed randomised clinical trial of vitamin D in pregnancy and infancy aimed at reducing infectious diseases in early childhood, and preventing asthma and allergic diseases</summary>
