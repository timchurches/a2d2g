    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Lovastatin 
Treatment: devices - placebo

Placebo Comparator: 2 - This is a prospective multi-centre randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study to determine the efficacy of Lovastatin  on visual spatial learning and/or attention abilities of children with NF1 aged between 8 and less than 16 years. In addition, the effect of Lovastatin  on secondary measures of executive function, visual spatial skills, behavior and quality of life will be assessed. Participants will be randomized to 16-weeks of treatment with Lovastatin  or a matched placebo.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The specific aim of this study is to determine whether Lovastatin  significantly improves
      visual spatial learning and/or sustained attention in children with NF1.

      Secondary Aims:

      To evaluate the effect of Lovastatin  on measures of executive function, behavior and
      quality of life in children with NF1 and cognitive deficits.

      To further evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of Lovastatin  in children with NF1 and
      cognitive deficits.

      Hypotheses

      It is hypothesized that Lovastatin  will improve the visual spatial memory and/or attention
      deficits in children with NF1. This is based on studies demonstrating that Lovastatin  has
      significantly improved impairments in visual spatial memory and attention in the NF1 murine
      model.

      It is further expected that Lovastatin  will be safe and well tolerated over a 16-week
      period.</summary>
