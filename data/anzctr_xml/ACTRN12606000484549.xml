    <interventions>None - as this was an observational study.
Subjects with the common cold were seen at 2 visits 14 days appart. Objective measures of the commom cold included; at Visit 1 a nasal aspirate for virus culturing; At Visits 1 and 2 nasal lavage was performed to collect samples for the IL-8 assay, At Visits 1 and 2 Acoustic rhinometry was performed to mearse Nasal Volume (NVol) and Minimum Cross-sectional Area (MCA).  Subjective symptoms of the common cold were collected at both visits and on a daily basis between visits, with subjects completing the Cold Study Unit Cold Symptom Questionnaire (CSUCSQ).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is likely that the host immune response causes at least some of the symptoms of coryza.  Several cytokines influencing immune cell activity are implicated in the common cold including IL-8.  A positive association between the level of IL-8 secretion and the severity of cold symptoms has been found previously.
There are no previous studies of IL-8 secretion and symptom severity in naturally acquired colds in adults, and this observational study was designed to investigate this.
Sixty subjects with symptoms of the common cold of less than 48 hours duration attended for two visits. At each visit subjective assessments, acoustic rhinometry and nasal lavage for IL-8 was performed. Virology samples were taken at Visit 1.  This was an observational study of natural coryza and no randomisation or intervention occurred.
IL-8 concentrations were elevated at onset.  There was a significant association between symptoms and IL-8 concentrations at onset (p=0.01).
These findings are consistent with the nasal cytokine response to virus infection causing the common cold syndrome.  Symptoms in the common cold corresponds significantly with an objective measure of the host immune response.</summary>
