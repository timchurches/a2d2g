  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The reason for increased cardiac mortality in panic disorder has not been precisely
      identified, but possibly is due to chronic activation of the cardiac stimulant (sympathetic)
      nerves, which may predispose the individual with panic disorder to disorders of cardiac
      rhythm and coronary artery spasm. The uniqueness of this study lies in its comprehensive
      evaluation of a psychobiological approach to the treatment of panic disorder using change in
      biological, behavioural and psychological variables as criteria for efficacy. 50 patients
      aged between 18 and 60 years will be recruited; both males and females. They will be treated
      with either cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or SSRI (selective serotonin re-uptake
      inhibitor) antidepressants or a combination of both.

      This project will firstly compare individuals with panic disorder who demonstrate abnormal
      brain transmitter (noradrenaline, serotonin) with those who demonstrate normal activity of
      these neurotransmitters, on interoceptive accuracy for changes in sympathetic nervous system
      arousal. It is predicted that individuals who demonstrate abnormal activity of these
      neurotransmitters will also demonstrate enhanced interoceptive ability to detect changes in
      arousal levels. Secondly, this project will evaluate the effects of a psychobiological
      treatment approach to panic disorder involving a combination of CBT and SSRI. This approach
      will be compared to the effects of both these interventions alone on a comprehensive array of
      measures related to panic disorder. It is predicted that the combined approach will be the
      most effective intervention on behavioural, psychological and biological variables, and
      cardiac risk. We will also be able to assess whether changes in panic disorder severity are
      associated with changes in interoceptive accuracy.</summary>
