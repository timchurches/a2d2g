  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Percent-predicted Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Week 52 - Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a standard pulmonary function test used to monitor disease progression in IPF. FVC was the volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration in the upright position, measured in litres. Predicted forced vital capacity is based on a formula using sex, age and height of a person, and is an estimate of healthy lung capacity. Percent of predicted FVC = (observed value)/(predicted value) * 100%.</outcome>

A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening situation (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a participant who received Tralokinumab. Treatment-emergent were events between administration of investigational product and Week 88 that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Clinical Global Impression of Change Scores - The CGI-C is a single, clinician completed, item designed to capture the clinicians overall impression of change in IPF severity from the baseline state at Screening.

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ) Total Score at Week 72 - The UCSD SOBQ is a 24-item questionnaire designed to capture patient-reported shortness of breath. Respondents were asked to rate their breathlessness during 21 activities of daily living using a 6-point scale (0 = not at all breathless, 5 = maximally breathless or too breathless to do this activity). In addition to the 21 activity items, the UCSD SOBQ includes 3 additional questions about limitations due to shortness of breath, fear of harm from overexertion, and fear of shortness of breath. The UCSD SOBQ was scored by summing responses across all 24 items to form a total score. Scores range from 0-120 with higher scores indicative of greater shortness of breath.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score at Week 72 - The SGRQ is a 50-item Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument developed to measure respiratory-related health status via 76 weighted responses. The SGRQ is divided into two parts. Part 1 asks respondents to consider the last 3 months and report on their respiratory symptoms using 5-point Likert scales. Part 2 asks respondents to consider their current state and respond to a series of dichotomous yes/no items related to their activities (activities that cause or were limited by breathlessness) and impacts (social functioning, psychological disturbances resulting from airways disease). Total scores and domain scores (symptoms, activities, and impact on daily life) were scored from 0-100, where lower scores indicate better health status.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease (EXACT IPF) Total Score Through Week 72 - The EXACT-IPF is a 14-item daily dairy used to capture the IPF related symptoms completed by the participants using an eDiary. The EXACT-IPF total score is the sum of all items ranged from 1 to 14. EXACT-IPF is an interval-level scale ranging from 0 to 100, where the higher scores indicate more severe condition. The EXACT-IPF used Likert scales (with 3 to 6 response options each) to capture participant reported IPF-related symptoms. The scores are the simple sum of item responses for each domain or single item.</outcome>

The questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 response options (no problem, some or moderate problems, and unable or extreme problems) that reflect increasing levels of difficulty. The questionnaire also includes a visual analog scale, where the participants were asked to rate their current health on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state.</outcome>
