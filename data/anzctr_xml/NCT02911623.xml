    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Shockwave Lithoplasty® System

Experimental: Lithoplasty Treatment - Patients in this group will receive treatment with the Shockwave Lithoplasty® System which uses lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified stenotic peripheral arteries.


Treatment: devices: Shockwave Lithoplasty® System
The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is a proprietary lithotripsy-enhanced balloon catheter that is designed to be delivered through the peripheral arterial system of the lower extremities to the site of calcified stenosis. Activating the lithotripsy within the device will generate pulsatile mechanical energy within the target treatment site, disrupt calcium within the lesion and allow subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low balloon pressure. The system consists of a balloon catheter with multiple integrated lithotripsy electrodes, and a generator.
