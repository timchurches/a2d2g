    <interventions>The study design is five-period crossover study (repeated measures design). Participants will be required to complete five trials of 3-minutes pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen in using a bag valve mask (BVM) (at 15l/min) and nasal cannula (NC) in all of the following conditions; BVM alone, BVM+NC at 0l/min, BVM+NC at 5l/min, BVM+NC at 10l/min, BVM+NC at 15l/min, At the end of each trial, oxygen will be measured by an expiratory breath into an oxygen analyser. There will be followed by a washout period of 2 minutes after which the ETO2 will be remeasured to ensure it is within 1% of the participants baseline.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Objectives 
A critical safety component of emergency anaesthesia is
 the avoidance of hypoxaemia during the apnoeic phase of a rapid sequence intubation. Preoxygenation with a bag valve mask (BVM) or anaesthetic circuit may be improved with supplemental oxygen by nasal cannulae (NC) if there is a mask leak. In addition, NC are recommended for apnoeic oxygenation after induction and may  be placed prior to preoxygenation
. 
However, the optimum NC flow rate for preoxygenation or  whether presence of NC itself creates a mask leak remains unclear. 
Methods 
We performed a randomized crossover study on healthy volunteers comparing BVM alone and BVM with NC flow rates of 0 (NC-0), 5 (NC-5), 10 (NC-10) and 15 (NC-15) litres per minute
. 
Our primary outcome was end tidal oxygen (ETO2) after 3-minutes preoxygenation.
