  <interventions>
    <interventions>This was a multi-centre retrospective analysis of the Australia and New Zealand experience with reduced intensity conditioning using Fludarabine and Melphalan. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (HSCT) were selected from the Australian Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. All eligible fludarabine melphalan (i.e. reduced intensity) conditioned HSCTs performed in the participating centres between January 1998 to December 2008 were to be included for evaluation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative procedure for a wide range of haematological malignancies, but the benefit of the graft versus malignancy effect is often offset by increased toxicity of graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infection. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens have become more commonly used over the last 10 years in HSCT in an attempt to provide the potential curative benefit of allografting to a wider patient population. Most published literature on RIC transplantation has concentrated on one disease and the relative benefit of a particular form of RIC conditioning in that disease setting. There have been few studies analyzing a commonly used regimen and assessing its benefit across several disease groups. Indeed, there is no consensus on the relative benefits of a certain RIC regimen even in myeloid or lymphoid malignancies as a general group of diseases. In this study, we retrospectively assess the relative benefits of FluMel RIC HSCT from 1998-2008, in a large cohort of patients with either lymphoid or myeloid malignancies.</summary>
