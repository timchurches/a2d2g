  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will receive a ten session group evidence based CBT psychological intervention for 75 minutes over two weeks.  In addition three treatment conditions will be randomly assigned.  The group work is undertaken in the mornings over this time and the individual treatment sessions would take place over the two weeks of the group program in the afternoon.

Arm 1.  Three individual 90 minute sessions utilising eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR).  EMDR is an evidence based psychological intervention for posttraumatic stress disorder.  EMDR asks the individual to focus on a distressing past event while engaging in another task (usually bilateral eye movements).  This dual processing enhances the individual's capacity to process the memory, resulting in decreased distress and more distance from the target memory.  The initial EMDR session would entail giving information on the intervention, establishing a safe place via imagery and identifying memories that would be targeting in subsequent session.  The second and third session would involve processing identified memories as per EMDR procedure.

Arm 2.  Three individual 90 minute sessions utilising Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).  CBT is an evidence based practice that is widely used in the treatment of psychological disorders.  CBT supports an individual to identify and alter unhelpful thoughts, feelings and behaviours.  Sessions would focus on assertive communication, looking at the individuals beliefs around assertiveness and supporting them to practice more assertive behaviour

Arm 3.  Treatment as usual/ Delayed treatment.  Participation in the group program with no additional individual sessions. however will be offered individual sessions following their six week follow up assessment.

All treatment sessions will be delivered by the researchers who are in their second year of their clinical masters and who are trained in both interventions.

The first cohort (2-4 participants) to be administered the assessments and intervention are treated as a trial and as such their data will not be included in the data analysis.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a planned sample size limited by the time schedule and group program that the participants are being recruited from.  Despite these limitations, it is estimated that a sample size of 20-30 can be obtained.  Although a larger sample size is desirable, studies looking at similar variables have reached significant conclusions with sample sizes from 16 to 21 participants (Hase et al., 2015; Hoffman et al., 2014 Schubert et al., 2016).

A Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to investigate effects of treatment (EMDR; CBT and TAU) over time (pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up).  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research has repeatedly identified that stressful life events and childhood adversities are associated with increased risk of psychological disorders.  For example, individuals who were maltreated as children are  approximately twice as likely to develop recurrent or persistent depression than individuals who had not experienced maltreatment.  Additional studies have also found a high association between childhood maltreatment and anxiety disorders.

Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence based psychological intervention utilised to treat symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  EMDR also has empirical support for treating comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety in individuals with PTSD. By targeting early adverse experiences, therapists can work with clients, with a primary diagnosis other than post-traumatic stress disorder, to significantly improve treatment outcomes.   Exploratory studies examining the impact of EMDR for clients experiencing depression and/or anxiety, indicate emerging evidence regarding the utility of these methods in improving treatment outcomes and decreasing relapse rates. However, studies in this area are scarce and the majority of studies identified have limitations including small sample sizes and lacking other key aspects of experimental design.  

The aim of this study is to build on the evidence to improve treatment outcomes for people with depression and anxiety.  All participants will be partaking in a two week, outpatient group CBT based intervention for depression and anxiety. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three treatment conditions, receiving either three 90 minute individual EMDR sessions; three 90 minute individual CBT sessions or treatment as usual (TAU)/delayed treatment.  Psychological symptoms will be measured prior to treatment, at the completion of treatment, and at six and twelve week follow up sessions.  The TAU group will be offered individual therapy following their six-week assessment.
It is proposed that the addition of a EMDR targeting adverse childhood experiences will increase positive outcomes of treatment post treatment and at follow up.</summary>
