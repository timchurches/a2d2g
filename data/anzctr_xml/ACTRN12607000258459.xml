  <interventions>
    <interventions>The training group will complete a standardized 3 month period of respiratory training using a threshold inspiratory muscle trainer.  Participants will train 3 times each day for 10 minutes each session. Training pressure will be set at a minimum target % of maximum inspiratory pressure.  Participants will be trained in the use of the device and will perform daily training.  Participants will be assessed every 2 weeks when training pressure will be adjusted accordingly to maintain the target pressure.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control patients will use a modified device that does not affect airway resistance or pressure.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate whether exercise training of respiratory muscles can slow the inevitable decline in respiratory function in patients with MND, and thereby improve quality of life.  The hypothesis is that respiratory training will result in maintentance or improvement of respiratory and functional outcomes in patients with MND.</summary>
