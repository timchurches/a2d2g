  <interventions>
    <interventions>Levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, Mirena 'Registered Trademark") is an intrauterine device that provides contraception for up to five years. It releases levonorgestrel over 5 years, at an initial dose of 20ug over 24 hours. It is usually inserted at least six weeks after delivery. Recent Australian contraception guidelines support its insertion at the time of caesarean section. This study is to investigate how many women choose to have LNG-IUS inserted at caesarean section when it is offered, as well as looking at the reasons that women choose to have the device inserted.
Women who are planning to have an elective caesarean section will have one or more consultations with a doctor to arrange and consent to caesarean section. The treating doctor will discuss LNG-IUS insertion at the time of caesarean, and will provide the women with written information about this. 
The women will be asked to consent to answer a few questions about their experience with and attitude to LNG-IUS regardless of whether they choose to have the LNG-IUS inserted at the time of caesarean section.
The device is designed to remain in place for five years, but can be removed earlier if the woman wishes. 
Women who have LNG-IUS inserted at the time of caesarean section will be followed up six weeks and one year after delivery.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Initiating long acting reversible contraception at the time of delivery has several advantages that include high patient motivation, convenience, access to trained professionals, no need for an outpatient insertion (which may be uncomfortable)
and immediate contraception prior to the resumption of ovulation(1, 2) . Levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (LNGIUS, Mirena, Bayer Healthcare), is an intrauterine long acting reversible contraceptive that provides contraception for 5 years(3).  In Australia its use almost always involves insertion through the vagina 6 weeks or more after childbirth (standard insertion). The 2016 Australian contraception guidelines rate immediate insertion of LNGIUS at delivery including caesarean section as category 1 (that is no restrictions placed on use) (4). Mwalwanda and Black (2013) note that, No studies have specifically examined the uptake rate, long term continuation rates, acceptability or effectiveness (of LNG-IUS in the immediate postpartum period) (2).
	
Intrauterine device (IUD) insertion has low rates of adverse events such as pain and infection, regardless of timing or route of insertion(1, 5). 

Expulsion rates following device insertion at the time of caesarean may be higher than following standard insertion but more research is required to quantify the risk. Expulsion of IUDs including LNG-IUS following standard insertion is reported to occur in approximately 1 in 20 women(2). Three studies have been examined expulsion rates of LNG-IUS inserted at caesarean section. Expulsion rates were 0%(6, 7) and 20% (8). 

IUDs including LNGIUS have nylon strings attached. The strings are useful because they can be seen or felt to check that the device is still present, and they can be pulled to remove the device when this is desired. When devices are inserted through the vagina into the uterus the strings are always visible in the vagina initially, and the chance of strings not being visible in the cervix at follow up visits is 5%(9). When IUDs are inserted at caesarean section the chance of the strings not being in the vagina at followup is 8%(10). 

Patient satisfaction with LNG-IUS insertion at caesarean section has been found to be high, and not different to standard insertion(7).

Continued use of LNGIUS inserted at caesarean for 12 months after delivery has been found to be higher than following standard insertion but this difference was not statistically significant (60.0% vs 40.9%, p=0.35)(8). 

LNG-IUS contains the hormone levonorgestrel, which is a progestogen. Studies of use of various types of progestogen containing contraceptives early in the neonatal period have not show a consistent adverse effect on breastfeeding initiation or continuation, or on neonatal outcomes such as growth and development(11). 

LNGIUS insertion at the time of caesarean section is associated with reduced postpartum bleeding compared with insertion of copper-containing IUD at caesarean section or no device insertion at caesarean section(12).

There is some evidence that the theoretical advantages of LNGIUS insertion at caesarean encourage higher patient uptake. Two studies of immediate LNGIUS insertion at the time of caesarean section compared to standard insertion showed that more women had the procedure done in the immediate insertion group (19/20 vs 18/22)(8) and 25/25 vs 19/23(7) . 

This trial aims to offer LNGIUS insertion at elective caesarean section. Uptake rate is the primary endpoint. Device expulsion, string visibility, patient satisfaction, continuing use and bleeding pattern will also be recorded.
