  <interventions>
    <interventions>PACE is a structured (Cognitive Behavioural) CBT pain intervention involving:
Week One - The child and one parent or guardian will attend a 7 hour group workshop at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH). Adults and children will participate in sessions in seperate rooms with up to 7 other participants and two staff members. Topics will include: The Neuroscience of Pain, Cognitive Strategies, Activity Management &amp; Exercise, School, Communication, Mindfulness, Sleep, Flare Up and Set Back Planning and Where to From Here?
Week 2 to 5 - The family will be allocated a "key-worker" who is either the program physiotherapist, occupational therapist or clinical psychologist. The child and their parent or guardian will have seperate, individualised weekly Telehealth support sessions of up to 30 minutes with their keyworker. These will include a video link similar to Skype. These sessions will reinforce topics and skills learnt in the workshop. The three program therapists will meet weekly to discuss the participant's progress and provide interdisciplinary support. Children who score over clinical thresholds on the Revised Children Anxiety and Depression Scale will be allocated a clinical psychologist as their keyworker.
Week 7 - the child and their parent/guardian will attend a 4 hour review at PMH
The treatment team will be led by a physiotherapist and included a Clinical Psychologist and Occupational Therapist. All treatment will have a strong Cognitive Behavioural framework and there will be strong "cross-linking" between disciplines.
The children will be asked to complete charts related to activity management, cognitive strategies and flare up and set back planning. These will be monitored in the Telehealth sessions. Parents will be monitored by verbal questioning with the emphasis on supporting skills aquisition.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Care will constitute individual face to face consultations of Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy and Clinical Psychology and will continue for as long as determined necessary by the individual therapists.</comparator>

    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following the completion of consent forms the participant will be given a research code and asked to complete the Functional Disability Index (FDI).
 
After completing the FDI the participant will be randomly allocated to either Group 1 (Standard Care) or Group 2 (PACE). It will be assumed that participants with similar degrees of physical function will have similar potential to respond clinically. Therefore, in order to ensure randomisation and obtain equivalent groups based on functional limitation, a matched allocation process will occur.  To be a match, the participant has to be within the same category of physical function as assessed by the score on the FDI. These categories are No/Minimal Disability category (6-12), Moderate Disability category (13â€“29) and Severe Disability category (30+). 

After the FDI assessment an independent person will draw a marble from a concealed bag containing 24 white marbles (indicating Group 1) and 24 coloured marbles (indicating Group 2). Once selected, the marble will not be replaced in the bag. This process will not occur if the participant constituted a match for a previously enrolled participant. If on enrolment the participant constitutes a match for a previously enrolled participant, they will be assigned to the group that does not include their match and the corresponding marble to their group allocation will be removed from the bag to maintain the probability.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Severe chronic pain affects up to 8% of adolescents, with many suffering from significant  emotional distress and physical disability. This often limits school  attendance and impacts on the family as a whole.

This pilot randomised controlled trial aims to evaluate an intervention designed  to help these families. The project tests an innovative service delivery model with interdisciplinary pain management being provided in face-to face workshops followed with Telehealth sessions delivered to the family home. The treatment team is led by a Physiotherapist and also includes an Occupational Therapist and Clinical Psychologist.
