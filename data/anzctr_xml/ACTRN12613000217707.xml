  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive behavioural therapy sessions will be conducted over 11 sessions on a weekly basis. Sessions include psychoeducation, gradual exposure, realistic thinking strategies, and other anxiety management activities. Activities are tailored to suit needs of those with brain injury.

The participant will meet one on one with a psychologist. Each session lasts 1 to 1.5 hours. </interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment group will be compared to a waitlist control group. Those in the waitlist group will be receiving treatment as usual, which varies from receiving no services to receiving a range of rehabilitation services. In this health context, it is likely that many participants in the waitlist control group will receive limited services for these difficulties. Those in waitlist control group will be offered the program at the completion of the 2 month follow-up assessment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We know that after an acquired brain injury (ABI), a number of adolescents experience increased levels of anxiety. So far, very little research has looked at the ways we can help young people with ABI overcome these difficulties and improve the way they are able to get along with others at school, home and in the community. 

Our aim is to trial a program for managing anxiety for adolescents with ABI. The program incorporates cognitive behaviour therapy which previous research has shown to be helpful for adolescents who do not have brain injury.  Components of the program have been especially adapted for young people who may have cognitive difficulties associated with TBI (e.g., memory impairments). This study aims to evaluate this adapted program for managing anxiety in a sample of young people who have had an ABI. 

The program aims to reduce anxiety and increase levels of participation in everyday activities of young people following ABI. If effective, the program used in this trial will be developed into a manual thereby allowing for applicability of the program in a range of therapeutic settings.
