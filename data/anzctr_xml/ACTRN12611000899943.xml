  <interventions>
    <interventions>Auricular acupressure (AA)
Shenmen (TF4, located at the bifurcation of the crura of antihelix), Endocrine (CO18, located at the bottom part of the incisura intertragica), and Internal Genitals (TF2, located at the middle point of the anterior portion of the triangular fossa) were selected as the auricular acupoints . Shenmen (TF4) functions to relieve anxiety. Endocrine (CO18) and Internal Genitals (TF2) improve functions of the endocrine system and regulate functions of the female reproductive system. After the above acupoints were sterilized with 75% alcohol, AA was performed by using acupressure seeds named Semen vaccariae. The seed was kept in place by a piece of opaque adhesive patch and fixed onto the acupoint selected. The subjects were asked to press the acupoints four times a day (08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00 h respectively) with 15 min each time by themselves. The strength should make the local auricle congestive, flushed, hot and ache. The AA was conducted on the two ears simultaneously. The AA treatment consisted of 6 days (from 12:00 h of the last day of TVOR to 20:00 h of the next day of ET).</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham AA
Triple Energizer (CO17, located in the cavum conchae), Stomach (CO4, located at the commissure of superior concha and inferio concha, just below the disappearance of the crus of the helix) and Large Intestine (CO7, located at the inner 1/3 of the crus of the helix, lying at the lower portion of the superior concha) were selected as the sham auricular acupoints. All the three acupoints have not been documented to relieve anxiety, improve functions of the endocrine system or regulate functions of the female reproductive system. All the manipulation and process were exactly the same as the AA group above.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The levels of state anxiety, preoperative anxiety (including anesthesia related anxiety and surgery related anxiety) and the need-for-information were rated with  State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety and Information Scale (APAIS)</outcome>
