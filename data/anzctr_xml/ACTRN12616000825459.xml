  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a single session of chiropractic care for the intervention group. The session will take approximately ten minutes. The entire spine and both sacroiliac joints will be assessed for vertebral subluxation, and adjusted where deemed necessary, by a registered chiropractor. The clinical indicators that will be used to assess the function of the spine prior to and after each chiropractic adjustment session include assessing for tenderness to palpation of the relevant joints, manually palpating for restricted intersegmental range of motion, assessing for palpable asymmetric intervertebral muscle tension, and any abnormal or blocked joint play and end-feel of the joints. All of these biomechanical characteristics are used by the chiropractors as clinical indicators of vertebral subluxations. All of the spinal adjustments carried out in this study will be high-velocity, low-amplitude thrusts to the spine or pelvic joints. These are standard adjustment techniques used by chiropractors. The mechanical properties of this intervention has been investigated; and although the actual force applied to the subject's spine depends on the chiropractor, the patient, and the spinal location of the adjustment, the general shape of the force-time history of spinal adjustments is very consistent and the duration of the thrust is always less than 200 milliseconds. The high velocity type of adjustments chosen specifically because previous research has shown that reflex electromyographic activation observed after adjustments only occurred after high velocity, low amplitude adjustments (as compared with lower velocity mobilizations). This adjustment technique has also been previously used in studies that have investigated the neurophysiological effects of chiropractic care. Within 30 minutes of receiving the intervention the participant will be reassessed using the same outcome measurement procedures. The participants will then be reassessed after a 7 day washout period with the alternate intervention applied between pre/post assessments. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control is a single session. The subjects head and/or spine will be moved in ways that include passive and active movements, similar to what is done by the chiropractor that provide actual chiropractic care during the experimental intervention. Thus this control intervention involves the subject being moved into the adjustment setup positions similar to how the chiropractor would normally setup a subject prior to applying the thrust to the spine to achieve the adjustment. No spinal adjustments will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is intended to act as a sham treatment session as well as to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that would occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a subject/patient for an adjustment.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A further outcome is Brain Source Identification (EEG):
Brain sources of SEPs recorded n the scalp reflective upstream activation of brain activity in different centres. Brain sources are identified by inverse modelling of the evoked brain activity. </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>15-20 participants will be recruited to participate in each of these studies. Participants will be inpatients or outpatients at Shifa International Hospital, in Islamabad or Railway Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. To be eligible to participate volunteers must have suffered from a stroke at least 8 weeks prior to their involvement in the trial and have some ongoing neurological deficit. For study 2 they must have some ongoing neurological deficit but this deficit may not be in the lower limb. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.  It is estimated that worldwide 17 million people per year suffer from a significant stroke with 5 million of those people experiencing long term physical disability following the stroke. The long term impaired nervous system function that accompanies many strokes means millions of stroke survivors around the world are reliant on care-givers to assist them with rudimentary activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and toileting. The burden of care is immense and has a significant impact on modern society.
Numerous rehabilitative approaches have been shown to promote motor recovery after a stroke, but advanced strategies are constantly being developed and tested in an attempt to improve long term outcomes for stroke survivors. One possible intervention that may improve post-stroke motor recovery, but has to date not been adequately tested, is chiropractic care. 

Over the past two decades numerous research studies have shown that chiropractic care can significantly influence central neural function. Studies have shown changes in somatosensory processing, sensorimotor integration and motor control following as little as a single session of chiropractic adjustments. Sensorimotor integration is the ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to integrate sensory information from different body parts and formulate appropriate motor outputs to muscles. Effective sensorimotor integration is essential when learning new motor skills, or recovering from an injury. Another essential component for accurately movement, learning new motor skills, and/or recovering from an injury is the accuracy of internal representation of our body map, or body schema. It is essential for your brain to be accurately aware of the location of our limbs and core body in 3D space. The spine is linked biomechanically and neurologically to the limbs and yet, we know very little about how altered sensory feedback from the spine affects limb sensorimotor integration and motor performance. However, there is emerging evidence that altered spinal sensory input can alter central neural processing, possibly by impacting the brains inner body schema. There is also emerging evidence that improving spinal function with chiropractic care can rapidly alter central neural function in a variety of ways, and that these changes outlast the altered changes of input, i.e. that they are neural plastic changes. Neural plasticity is the name given by neuroscientists to any lasting change in structure or function within the CNS due to alterations in sensory input, basically the brains ability to learn and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The addition of chiropractic care to the treatment program for a variety of central nervous system disorders, such as stroke victims, may have a profound impact on these peoples ability to heal and recover central neural function. </summary>
