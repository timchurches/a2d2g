      <outcome>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Baseline, Month 1, 3 and 6 - FACIT-Fatigue scale is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</outcome>

Except sleep adequacy, optimal sleep and quantity, higher scores=greater impairment. Scores are transformed (actual raw score minus lowest possible score divided by possible raw score range* 100); total score range: 0 to 100; higher score = greater intensity of attribute.</outcome>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a comparative study of CP 690,550, Humira (adalimumab) and placebo on background
      methotrexate in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The study is intended to provide evidence
      of the efficacy and safety of CP 690,550 when dosed 5 mg and 10 mg twice a day on background
      methotrexate in adult patients with moderate to severe Rheumatoid Arthritis. It is intended
      to confirm the benefits of CP-690,550 in improving signs and symptoms and physical function
      that were observed in Rheumatoid Arthritis. An active comparator, adalimumab, is also
      included.</summary>
