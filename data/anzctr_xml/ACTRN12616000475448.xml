  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention arm consists of a high intensity progressive resistance training program. Participants attend two 30-minute exercise sessions per week. Each sessions is conducted in groups of up to 6 participants and supervised by either a physiotherapist or exercise physiologist. The high intensity exercise program consists of four compound exercises (deadlift, overhead press, jumping chin ups and back squat) for 5 sets of 5 repetitions (&gt;85% 1 repetition maximum). Compliance and weight lifted is monitored via training manuals which each participants completes at the end of each session. </interventions>
    <comparator>A low load, home-based unsupervised exercise program will serve as a positive control. Controls will undertake two 30-minute sessions per week for a period of 8-months. Light resistance exercises such as sit to stands, single leg balance, lunges and forward raise will be performed with 1-3 kg dumbbells, 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions along with balance training. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be undertaken using SPSS statistical software (Version 21; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).  Descriptive statistics will be generated for subject characteristics, biometrics, and all dependent measures.  A per protocol and intention to treat analyses will be adopted with repeated measures ANOVA to test our hypotheses.  All statistical analyses will be conducted using a P-value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance.

Based on a previous similar high intensity resistance training intervention trial in postmenopausal women, to achieve 80% power to detect between-group differences of 2.7% with a standard deviation of 4.5% for femoral neck BMD and 3.5% with a standard deviation of 3.6% for lumbar spine, a total of 68 and 52 participants are required.  We recruited one-hundred and one postmenopausal women to account for 20% drop out and account for an accelerated bone loss in the control group in the aforementioned study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bone responds to mechanical stimuli, with the greatest response from high loads being applied quickly. High loads have remain unexamined in postemenopausal women with low bone mass due to the perceived risk of injury. The LIFTMOR trial was developed to see if the loads required to obtain the a greater bone response are both safe and effective in postmenopausal women with low to very low bone mass. </summary>
