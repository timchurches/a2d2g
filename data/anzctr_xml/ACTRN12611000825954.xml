  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised treatment with CPAP. CPAP will be delivered primarily via a nasal mask, although other mask types will be tried as needed to ensure a comfortable fit and good interface with the patient. CPAP pressure will be provided using a variable pressure S8 Autoset device (ResMed) set to deliver a pressure between 4-16 cmH2O. Participants will be encouraged to wear the CPAP every time they sleep and use of CPAP will commence at randomisation and continue through to delivery day.
CPAP will be commensed as soon as possible after randomisation. The exact day they start CPAP will vary from patient to patient but will be within 2 weeks of randomisation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure control and anti-hypertensive medication requirement. Blood pressure will be measured  using an automated syphygomanometer to help with blinding of the measurement. All women will be seated for at least 10 minutes and have their feet resting comfortably on the floor. BP measurements will be routinely taken from the left arm. Patients need for anti-hypertensive management will be asssessed separately by obstetric medicine specialists who are blinded to the study and will make their own assessments. Anti-hypertensive medication will be prescribed following a standardised protocol based on current best practice.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Every 2 weeks throughout the pregnancy and also at 32 weeks gestation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following pregnancy related complications will be recorded as adverse pregnancy outcomes: Pre-term delivery (delivery before 37/40 gestation), perinatal death, pre-eclampsia, foetal growth restriction (based on local growth charts), and initial Apgar score of less than or equal to 7. This information is routinely collected and will be obtained from the obstetric notes.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>This study will investigate the feasibility of the concept that using different wake and sleep pressures will improve participant comfort while not negatively affecting therapy delivery. Once feasibility is confirmed, comparative studies with statistical analyses may be performed to measure the efficacy of the concept. 

All participants whom undergo some treatment on the FPH bi-level PAP device will be analysed. If the investigators are able to accurately use the PSG signal to apply awake and asleep bi-level PAP to a participant using the RICON device; and secondly, using the number of breaths triggered by the device or other relevant metrics, create an algorithm capable of allowing the RICON device to automatically deliver asleep or awake bi-level PAP dependant on the state of the participant, the study will be considered a pass.

Based on the outcome of a small feasibility study in a similar patient population by Poyares et al showing an increase in BP in standard care group versus a reduction in the CPAP treated group, where the mean BP measurements at 32 weeks were 127 versus 118 (baseline standard deviation 2.5 and 2.4 respectively), 30 patients in each group will have greater than 90% statistical power to detect a difference between CPAP and standard care groups at 0.05 significant level. In addition, it is reported in the same study that the CPAP group has a mean methyldopa (anti-hypertensive) dose of 750mg vs. 2000mg in the standard care group. Assuming a standard deviation of 750mg and 200mg in the two groups respectively, a sample size of 30 in each group will provide 89% statistical power to detect a difference in the mean use of anti-hypertensive medications. The sample size estimation of 45 in each randomised arm also provides adequate power for a subgroup analysis for participants with AHI greater than 5 and AHI less than 5 if AHI is identified to be a potential confounder assuming approximately 1/3 of the snoring pregnant women will have AHI greater than 5. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A number of observational studies have demonstrated that snoring in pregnancy is associated with the development of pregnancy hypertension and its associated pregnancy complications. It is known that upper airway dimensions narrow during pregnancy and this will lead to increased airway closure resulting in snoring. Snoring is associated with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) which is a condition strongly linked with the development of systemic hypertension. OSA related hypertension improves on treamtent with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). One small trial (16 patients) suggests that CPAP may be of benefit in snoring women with pregnancy hypertension.
This is a large randomised trial to assess whether CPAP treatment can improve blood pressure control and therefore pregnancy outcomes in hypertensive pregnant women who snore.</summary>
