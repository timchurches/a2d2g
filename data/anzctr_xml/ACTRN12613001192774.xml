  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend the University of South Australia on one occassion, for approximately 45 minutes, and have their weight and height measured, complete the questionnaire and provide a spot urine sample 

A questionnaire based on the one used by Grimes et al 2009 will be used to determine in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: 
- The knowledge of the health risks associated with dietary intake 
- Ability to interpret the nutrition information on Australian food labels
- The frequency of use of nutrition labelling on food products
- The influence nutrition panels have on shopping behaviour
Urinary electrolyte excretion will be measured using a single random spot urine sample. The association between excretion and reported dietary intake of sodium and potassium (using a food frequency questionnaire) will be investigated. In addition, the correlation between the questionnaire responses and excretion will be examined. 
Body mass index will be derived from weight and height measured on one occasion and glycated hemoglobin A1c will be self-reported by the participants or obtained by accessing medical records. The relationship between questionnaire responses and BMI and HbA1c will be investigated.
