  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The GAP study is a research study which looks to compare a combination heart medicine called the "polypill" with existing treatments. The polypill has 4 different types of medicine in the one tablet. It contains aspirin, a cholesterol lowering medicine and two blood pressure lowering medicines. All four medicines have been available in Australia for a long time; the only difference is that they have been put into one tablet rather than four separate tablets. We think that this will make it easier for clients to take their medicine every day. We also think that by making these medicines easier to take it will be better at lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels than taking many different tablets. This has not been proven and that is why we are conducting this important research to see if this is true.

There is a merge of this trial with the Kanyini Polypill trial (of identical protocol and study design) into one trial to be renamed as 'Kanyini Guidelines Adherence with the Polypill (GAP)' trial under the ACTRN 12608000583347.</summary>
