  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sentinel biopsy alone with axillary clearance if sentinel node is not identified or sentinel node is positive for cancer. Sentinel node biopsy is a new surgical procedure. A sentinel node biopsy means surgery to remove the sentinel lymph node or nodes. There can be more than one sentinel node. The sentinel node is the first lymph node that breast cancer cells may spread to outside the breast.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sentinel node biopsy with immediate standard axillary clearance. Standard axillary clearance- It involves the removal of most of the lymph nodes or glands in the armpit of the affected side and a pathologist looking for any cancer cells which may have spread from the breast cancer.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Sentinel Node versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) trial was the first, large, Australasian prospective assessment of the risk of lymphoedema after surgery for early breast cancer. The trial compared sentinel node biopsy of selected lymph nodes with clearance of axillary nodes in women with tumours smaller than 3 cm. Short-term results showed that arm swelling was less in the group having only sentinel node biopsy. Both treatment groups had  moderate limitations in arm movement over the first 6 months, which then recovered to near normal levels. The results showed that for women with small tumours, sentinel node biopsy was a viable alternative to axillary clearance. The patients are being followed up so that long-term effects can be measured. Outcomes at 3 years will shortly be published.
In  SNAC 2, the investigators are recruiting women with large or multiple tumours in a more extensive trial with similar questions, which will allow any differences in subgroups of women to be analysed.
