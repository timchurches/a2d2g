    <interventions>Observational study: Patients presenting to Emergency Departments with symptoms suggestive of Acute Coronary Syndrome are assessed for possible Type I Acute Myocardial Infarction
A retrospective analysis of previously collected data.  Patients were participating in studies designed to assess the effectiveness of methodologies and biochemistry to rule-out and rule-in acute myocardial infarction.  
The MI3 tool is a an algorithm developed from Age, Sex, serial troponin measurements, and the time between the troponin measurements.  It is designed to provide clinicians with an indication of the likelihood of an acute myocardial infarction.  It was applied only retrospectively on the validation cohort.

Derivation Cohorts
 BACC (Hamburg):  July 2013 to December 2014
 HighSTEACS (Edinburgh): NCT01852123 June 2013 to January 2014
Machine learning was used to derive the MI3 tool to predict events as recorded in the medical records (and previous studies).

Validation cohorts
UTROPIA (Minneapolis)
APACE (Basal): April 2006 to June 2013
ADAPT-Brisbane (Brisbane):  ACTRN12611001069943 November 2007 to February 2011
IMPACT (Brisbane): February 2011 to March 2014
ADAPT-Christchurch (Christchurch):  ACTRN12611001069943 November 2007 to February 2011
TIMIRCT (Christchurch): ACTRN12610000766011 October 2010 to July 2012
EDACSRCT (Christchurch): ACTRN12613000745741 June 2013 to July 2014

The MI3 tool was applied in the validation cohort to assess its ability to predict outcomes recorded in medical records/previous studies.

    <statisticalmethods>A multi-centre international diagnostic biomarker development and validation study using a secondary analysis of data prospectively collected from multiple cohorts.

The overall project objective:
To develop and validate an assessment algorithm that allows:
1.	The early rule in of AMI for as many patients was possible with a low false positive rate.
2.	The early rule out of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for a large proportion of patients with a very low false negative rate

The overall aims are:
1.	To derive and validate the Myocardial Ischaemic Injury Index (MI3) for identification of patients with acute myocardial infarction amongst patients being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome.

2.	To derive and validate Index Value thresholds for optimal (i) rule-out and (ii) rule-in of acute myocardial infarction with the MI3 algorithm for rapid assessment of patients being investigated for possible acute coronary syndrome.

DERIVATION
The Boosted Decision Trees (also called Additive Logistic Model) is to be applied to a derivation cohort using initial hsTnI value,  hsTnI change rate, gender, age, subjects MI status.
Thresholds with 95% confidence intervals of the resulting index value (IV) will be derived using bootstrapping methods for (i) sensitivity &gt;=99.0%, (ii) NPV&gt;=99.5%, (iii) Specificity &gt;=90.0%, (iv) PPV&gt;=75%.

VALIDATION
In a separate cohort the sensitivity, NPV, specificity, PPV will be calculated at the IV thresholds identified in the development cohort.  

No formal power calculation for sample size was done.
