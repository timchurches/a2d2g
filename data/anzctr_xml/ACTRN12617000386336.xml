  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be undertaking 6 x 1 hour simulator sessions (held two times per week for 3 weeks). The intervention involves being seated in the simulator and completing training protocols focussing on areas identified as requiring driver rehabilitation including physical control of the vehicle, observation skills, vehicle positioning, speed control and planning and judgement based on the errors from the On Road assessment conducted with the occupational therapists. A protocol will be used during the training sessions; training involves following a set route that is graded in terms of performance demands and driving tasks. These tasks and scenarios encountered on the simulator will be graded in terms of environmental complexity from no or low traffic areas to increased density and visually complex environments. Each route will be directed by an occupational therapist experienced in using the simulator and this therapist will also provide teaching, instruction and feedback about performance. Cueing (such as keep to the left)  and feedback provided to participants will be reduced as performance on simulator tasks of participants improve.  Intervention adherence will be assessed by the occupational therapist, and strategies will include information provided regarding the direct relevance of training to deficits identified on the on road assessment.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will participate in a series of driving lessons which is currently the "usual" driving rehabilitation approach. Six times 1 hour driving lessons will be completed 2 times per week over 3 weeks with a  driving instructor. The driving instructor will be experienced in working with people with neurological conditions and will be provided with the same handover as the simulator group about the driving errors and areas for driving rehabilitation. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A minimum of 16 participants (8 per group) is required to achieve 80% power (with an alpha of 0.05) to detect change in on-road scores; based on previously collected data about on road assessment scores for individuals requiring lessons and those who successfully regained their drivers license. 
Using an alpha of 0.05, multiple t-tests will be completed to determine signficant differences between each group's outcome measures at follow up assessment s. Fisher's Exact analysis will be used to determine significant differences in the pass rate and On Road Assessment scores between the groups. </statisticalmethods>
