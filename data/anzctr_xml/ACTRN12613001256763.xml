  <interventions>
    <interventions>Farmers, farm workers and farm contractors who are exposed to organophosphate pesticides.

By measuring the activity of the enzyme cholinesterase, exposure to organophosphates can be identified. We are particularly interested in working with farmers (male and female) who are currently farming, working with agricultural chemicals. Enzyme activity will be monitored every 2-3 weeks over a 12 week period.
 
Each participant will receive a health check during the first visit including:
Measurements:  Height, weight, waist and hip circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, pulse rate. 
Capillary blood sample :  Collected using a finger prick, will test for : Fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and cholinesterase levels .  
Health  and Chemical usage survey:  Chemical use  and well being questionnaire
</interventions>
    <comparator>Individuals that do not live and/or work on a farm and are self reported not routinely exposed to organophosphate pesticides

Blood cholinesterase activity is measured using a fingerprick test (measured by Test-mate ChE Cholinesterase tester system Model 400, and AChE Assay kit Erythrocyte Cholinesterase) to establish a baseline reading (this will need to be repeated three times if organophosphate exposure has taken place). This test is applied to all individuals in the study.

Chemical use is also recorded for all individuals.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>All data will be managed and analysed within the statistical program SPSS. SPSS is a statistical package widely used in quantitative social science research and is suitable for multivariate analysis.  
Data will be analysed using repeated measures (subjects as own controls) within the General Linear Model.  Correlation coefficients between pesticide exposure and metabolic variables will be calculated using Pearsons and Spearmans correlation as appropriate. P values will be considered statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims:  To develop the methodology for point of care (POC) testing to determine the level of exposure to organophosphates (OPs) by western Victorian farmers. Significance: This methodology will test for cholinesterase activity (enzyme that is inhibited by organophosphates) and provide the basis for future research work by identifying the potential chemical exposure pathways of individuals most at risk in farming communities. 

Expected Outcomes: The study will provide a validated methodology for cholinesterase activity measurement in farmers and the integration of this testing in farmer health checks. Importantly, it will highlight insecticide contact as a risk for farmers, leading to further research to quantify pesticide exposure both on the farm and in the home of farming families.
