  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to First Confirmed Worsening on the Adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Scale - Confirmed worsening in CIDP was measured by the adjusted INCAT Disability Scale. The adjusted INCAT disability scale measures arm disability and leg disability. For arm disability the scale ranges from 0 (no upper limb problems) to 5 (inability to use either arm for any purposeful movement). The leg disability scale ranges from 0 (walking not affected) to 5 (restricted to wheelchair, unable to stand and walk a few steps with help). The total adjusted INCAT disability score is calculated by the sum of the arm and leg disability scores where the total score ranges from 0 to 10. A confirmed worsening was defined as an increase by 1 or more points on the adjusted INCAT disability scale from the value at baseline.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline for Grip Strength, Dominant Hand - Grip strength measurements were done using a vigorimeter. With this device, the pressure in the bulb exercised by the participant was registered on a manometer via a rubber junction tube. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands were tested. A negative change from baseline indicates deterioration.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline for Rasch-Built Linearly Weighted Overall Disability Scale (R-ODS) - This questionnaire was constructed using the patients' perception of their ability to perform daily and social activities. The questionnaire comprises 24 items ranging from ability to read a book or newspaper (as the easiest item to accomplish) to ability to run (most difficult item to accomplish). The obtained raw summed score was translated subsequently to a convenient centile metric score ranging from 0 (most severe disability) to 100 (no disability at all). A higher score indicated a better health status. A negative change from baseline indicates deterioration.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria

          -  written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed

          -  The diagnosis of CIDP will use the definition of the EFNS/PNS Task Force First
             Revision. Patients must either have a clinical diagnosis of CIDP fulfilling the
             clinical inclusion criteria for typical CIDP or one of the following atypical forms of
             CIDP: pure motor, or asymmetrical (MADSAM [Lewis-Sumner syndrome]), or IgA or IgG (not
             IgM) MGUS paraprotein associated.

          -  All patients must also fulfill the clinical exclusion criteria and the definite
             electrodiagnostic criteria of the EFNS/PNS Task Force First Revision.

          -  disability defined by an INCAT Disability Scale score of 1-9 or, if INCAT score is 0,
             a documented history of disability sufficient to require treatment within the past 2
             years following reduction or interruption of CIDP treatment

          -  receiving IVIg treatment (minimal dose equivalent to 0.4 g/kg every 4 weeks for a
             minimum of 12 weeks) or corticosteroids (minimal dose equivalent to prednisone 10
             mg/day) treatment prior to the screening visit

          -  history of documented clinically meaningful deterioration confirmed by clinical
             examination during therapy or upon interruption or reduction of therapy within 18
             months prior to Screening

          -  stable CIDP symptoms for the 6 weeks before randomization</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion Criteria

          -  other chronic demyelinating neuropathies, including: Distal Acquired Demyelinating
             Symmetric Neuropathy (DADS) Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN) pure sensory CIDP
             hematopoietic malignancy except for MGUS

          -  conditions in which the pathogenesis of the neuropathy may be different from CIDP such
             as: Lyme disease, POEMS syndrome, osteosclerotic myeloma, Castleman's disease

          -  treatment with plasma exchange within 2 months of randomization,
             immunosuppressive/chemotherapeutic medications: azathioprine, cyclophosphamide,
             cyclosporine, mycophenolate, etanercept, methotrexate tacrolimus or other
             immunosuppressive drugs within 6 months of randomization or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             later), Rituximab in the 2 years prior to randomization (patients that have received
             rituximab between 1 and 2 years should have B-cell levels within normal range), other
             cytotoxic immunosuppressive medications with sustained effects (including
             mitoxantrone, alemtuzumab, cladribine) at any time, hematopoietic stem cell
             transplantation at any time</exclusivecriteria>
