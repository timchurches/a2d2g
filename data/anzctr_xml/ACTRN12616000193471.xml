    <statisticalmethods>Independent two-sample T test, Chi-squared and Logistic Regression Analysis .  A difference of 1 on the overall scar scale was deemed to be statistically significant however this may not be clinically significant. A 10% difference in the secondary analysis looking at the proportion of good overall scars was subsequently used to assess clinical significance. We anticipate a 10% attrition rate. No formal sample size calculation was performed. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate if whether using the Deckled incision improves post-operative scars compared to the standard straight line incision in people undergoing surgery for skin lesions. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and are scheduled to undergo any plastic surgery procedure involving excision of skin lesions. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups in an equal ratio. Participants will not be aware of the group/treatment they have been allocated to receive. For patients with multiple lesions, because each lesion is randomised, they may have both the "Deckled" incision or straight line incision performed. This study will help determine if Deckled incision has superior scar outcomes compared to the straight line incision approach.</summary>
