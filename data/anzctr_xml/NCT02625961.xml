    <summary>In this study, participants with high risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)
      unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) therapy and who are considered ineligible for
      or have refused to undergo radical cystectomy, will receive pembrolizumab therapy. The
      primary study hypothesis is that treatment with pembrolizumab will result in a clinically
      meaningful response.</summary>
