  <interventions>
    <interventions>Novel Transforming Powder Dressing, Altrazeal (TM), is a dressing type that comes in powder form, which is immediately applied onto the thigh after split skin graft had been harvested. It is then dressed with secondary dressings including gauze and mefix. All dressings are left intact for at least 2 weeks until reviewed in outpatient clinic. It is a once-only dressing which will not require a repeat application unless the initial dressings comes off prematurely as a result of significant haematoma. </interventions>
    <comparator>Calcium Sodium Alginate, Kaltostat (TM), is a is a dressing type that comes in a broad sheet form, which is immediately applied onto the thigh after split skin graft had been harvested. It is then dressed with secondary dressings including gauze and mefix. All dressings are left intact for at least 2 weeks until reviewed in outpatient clinic. It is a once-only dressing which will not require a repeat application unless the initial dressings comes off prematurely as a result of significant haematoma. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients experience of pain arising from donor sites from postoperative day 2 - 5, and day 14 using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of wound healing at the donor site dressed with Novel Transforming Powder, Altrazeal (TM) and Calcium Sodium Alginate, Kaltostat (TM), measured by the proportion (percentage) of healed wound out of the total DSW surface upon assessment on postoperative day 14.

      <timepoint>Postoperative day 14.</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be adults (aged 18 years or older) undergoing split skin grafting at Dandenong Hospital.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>60 patients who require split skin grafting of lower limbs at Dandenong Hospital for any cause, leaving DSW of more than or equal to 10cm2, will be recruited. At the time of recruitment, patients will be randomised into allocation group by using opaque sequentially numbered and sealed envelopes. </concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated list of random treatment allocations will be used to assign patients to treatment in a 1:1 ratio of Novel Transforming Novel Transforming Powder Dressing, Altrazeal (TM) to Calcium Sodium Alginate Dressing, Kaltostat (TM). Stata software version 12 will be used to generate random treatment allocations. Upon recruitment of participants, an assigned person independent of the study, will carry out the randomization whilst consenting for the operation itself. The operating surgeon will then be notified of the type of dressing for the donor site prior to time out.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores is the main efficacy end point. A sample size of 30 patients per group would have an 87% power to detect a difference of 2 points on average VAS pain scores (assuming a conservative standard deviation of 2.5 of VAS pain scores) between treatment arms with a two-sided p value of 0.05. Change in pain scores between treatment arms will be assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance. A two-sided p value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
All data will be de-identified and stored in a locked cabinet or a password-protected computer at the Department of Plastic Surgery, Dandenong Hospital. 
Data will be analysed using STATA 12. Univariate analysis will be conducted using student t-tests, chi-square test for equal proportion or non-parametric tests where appropriate.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is:
1. To determine whether Novel Transforming Powder, Altrazeal (TM) dressing will consistently reduce patients experience of pain compared with Calcium Sodium Alginate, Kaltostat (TM).
2. To determine if there is a difference in rate of healing of the donor site between Novel Transforming Powder, Altrazeal (TM) and Calcium Sodium Alginate, Kaltostat (TM).
3. To compare Novel Transforming Powder, Altrazeal (TM) and Calcium Sodium Alginate, Kaltostat (TM) dressings in terms of cost-effectiveness, wound infection rate and cosmetic outcome. </summary>
