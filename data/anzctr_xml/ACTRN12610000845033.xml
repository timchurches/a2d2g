Methotrexate, Vinblastine and Adriamycin were administered as intravenous bolus infusions immediately followed by intravenous infusion of cisplatin over 60 min.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare survival time from randomization to death from any cause between the two intensified treatment groups (MVAC vs Gemcitabine/Cisplatin).</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 years after study initiation. This assessement will be done using clinical data records</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the TTP (Time To Progression) between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>Evaluation of disease will be performed every 6 cycles of chemotherapy with computed tomographies (CTs) and bone scan/magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) if indicated. Intermediate evaluation will be performed only in case of clinical deterioration and signs of progression.  After treatment completion, patients will be evaluated every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 4 months for the next 2 years and every 6 months thereafter for up to 6 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the RR (Response Rate) between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>The evaluation of response will be performed every 6 cycles of chemotherapy using the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the toxicity profile between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>Complete Blood Count, biochemistry, electrocardiogram (ECG) and triplex will be performed before initiation of treatment. Toxicity is assessed by laboratory evaluation of hematology and biochemistry, ECG etc after each cycle (triplex will be performed only in case of need). Complete toxicity evaluation will be performed at the end of treatment  (1 month after the last administration of the drug)</timepoint>
