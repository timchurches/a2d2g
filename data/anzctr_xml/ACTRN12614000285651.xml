  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two parts to this trial. Both parts will follow the exact same methods protocol, however the populations studied will be slightly different. Part 1 will look at a healthy adult population  (i.e. no headache diagnosis) with a no previous needling exposure (acupuncture or dry needling). Part 2 will look at a healthy adult population, and who have had needling previously. Each part will recruit 50 participants. 

Participants will be randomly allocated to either receive a single dry needling needle or a sham needle (toothpick) in the back of their neck. 

Dry needling will be applied by a qualified physiotherapist. A single-use sterile needle (50mm long with 0.25-0.30mm gauge) will be inserted superficially only (5-10mm) into a muscle in the back of the neck. The needle will remain in position for 10-15 seconds and needle will not be manipulated within this time. 

Participants will then be asked whether they think they had the needle or the sham needle. 

The total appointment time for each participant will be around 10 minutes. Participants need only present for the study on this one occasion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo: the sham needling will follow the exact same protocol as the true needling however the toothpick will not pierce the skin (instead the therapist will hold the toothpick in place to mimic a needle).  

The sham needle will involve a toothpick within a plastic guide tube. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether participants can identify if they had the needle or the sham needle. This will be assessed by asking the question: "Do you think you had the needle or the sham?".</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Qualitative information about why the participant thought they had the needle or sham needle, and a description of what they felt. Two questions will be asked to obtain this information. Question 1: "You thought you had the needle/sham. Why do you think you had the needle/sham?". Question 2: "Can you briefly describe what you felt?". </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculations were based on data from a study investigating acupuncture versus sham acupuncture (toothpick). They found that after the intervention:

4/25 participants who had the sham, identified that they'd had the sham.
2/25 participants who had the needle, identified that they'd had the sham.

Sample sizes were calculated for using this data, for within and between study comparisons (i.e. the amount of subjects required to compare Parts 1 and 2 of this study, plus a previous pilot study, was calculated by a statistician). The sample size is 50 in each part of the study (100 total; 25 in each group) calculated with a power of 0.8 at significance level p&lt;0.05.

Data will be entered using Microsoft Excel. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse the data, including proportions. Qualitative data analysis will be used to synthesise the data obtained from the two open ended questions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this project is to validate a sham dry needling protocol in the cervical spine for healthy adults, for future applications to headache. To build on results to be established from a small pilot study investigating the efficacy of a sham protocol in healthy needling-naive subjects, two randomised controlled trials are proposed to strengthen the methodology of the future research. This will be achieved through determining whether a toothpick is an effective sham to use as a placebo treatment for dry needling in healthy subjects, and to investigate the influence, if any, of previous exposure to needling therapy.

There is no consensus in the existing literature regarding an appropriate sham to acupuncture or dry needling. Historically, needles have been inserted either away from the area of pain or acupuncture point or inserted superficially (a shorter distance than that hypothesised to be required for therapeutic benefit). More recent studies suggest that both of these approaches trigger a physiological response that may confound the treatment effect of the dry needling itself. Other studies investigating more conservative sham approaches for acupuncture have focused on areas away from the neck, which, due to variation in tactile acuity may not be transferable, and no studies have investigated sham protocols specifically for dry needling (as compared to acupuncture).</summary>
