  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard Paediatric sized nasal prongs (Fisher-Paykel) as used throughout Starship Hospital , Auckland , will be applied to the patient after induction of anaesthesia.

They are single use devices and will be applied to all patients in the study to ensure blinding is maintained.

The group randomised to receive oxygen through the prongs will have these devices connected to a cylinder oxygen supply providing a flow of 5L/min , giving an fractional inspired oxygen concentration of 35%.

These will remain in place until intubation has been confirmed through the use of end-tidal-carbon dioxide monitoring and then removed.</interventions>

    <concealment>Recruited to the study when booked for High Res CT as inclusion/exclusion criteria allows. 
A randomisation procedure has been performed and sequentially numbered study packs prepared containing all the information including details of the intervention (which remains concealed from the anaesthetist and is given to an assistant). This divides the 40 patients into two groups:
Treatment arm A: Receives nasal oxygen during intubation
Treatment arm B: Does not receive nasal oxygen during intubation
To ensure allocation concealment all patients will have nasal prongs placed and an assistant will connect the prongs to either oxygen or will leave the connector open to air. This is out of sight of the anaesthetist so ensuring concealment.
</concealment>
    <sequence>Dr John Thomson, Senior Research Fellow , University of Auckland has performed the randomisation procedure using GraphPad Software (Registered trademark), Inc, La Jolla, California, USA .

The results of this have been given to an assistant who prepares numbered envelopes which are to be given to the anaesthesia assistant when undertaking the study.

    <statisticalmethods>Power Analysis:
We are planning a study with 20 experimental subjects and 20 control subjects.  In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 2.  We will be able to detect a true difference in the mean response of experimental and control subjects of -2.105 or 2.105 with probability (power) 0.9.   The Type I error probability associated with this test of the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal is 0.05.
Statistical Analysis:
Differences in mean times in hypoxia will be tested using 2-sided t-tests. We will also carry out regressions using generalised linear models to control for potential confounders including sex and age.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Avoiding hypoxia through the administration of oxygen is a fundamental part of safe anaesthesia. Giving oxygen before induction (pre-oxygenation) , during ventilation with a mask and then following intubation is standard practice throughout the world. Oxygen levels are then maintained throughout the remainder of the anaesthetic and during the recovery period until the patient is conscious and capable of breathing spontaneously on air.
When induction of a general anaesthetic occurs, the placement of an endotracheal tube is often required to maintain a safe and secure airway throughout the anaesthetic. Traditionally, this procedure is performed by direct laryngoscopy using a laryngoscope , which allows the anaesthetist to visualise the airway and place the endotracheal tube into the correct part of the airway.. Direct laryngoscopy normally occurs without the administration of supplementary oxygen. Hypoxia is avoided by preoxygenation and de-nitrogenation of the lungs prior to this process. A skilled anaesthetist is then required to complete this procedure before the patient experiences hypoxia. 
Despite these steps to prevent hypoxia, brief periods do occasionally occur during intubation although these are rapidly corrected by the anaesthetist using 100% oxygen following successful intubation. Some patient groups are at risk of hypoxia for a number of reasons and children are one of these due to smaller reserves of oxygen in the lungs. Disease processes and difficulty establishing a secure intubated airway (e.g. multiple attempts required ) can add to the risk of hypoxia in this group.
The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of nasal oxygen throughout direct laryngoscopy and intubation in children. By administering nasal oxygen (which avoids interference with the anaesthetist's view of the airway) we hope to avoid hypoxic events. This has potential benefits for children during resuscitation, intensive care, anaesthesia and emergency medicine.

This study is a prospective , randomised control trial with the following null hypothesis:

There is no statistical difference in the incidence, duration and severity of hypoxia (SpO2 &lt; 94%) following direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation between those children administered nasal oxygen and those not receiving nasal oxygen

 The patients will be closely monitored for signs of hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry. Continual bispectral index monitoring will also be used to monitor for awareness.
