  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All patients aged 18yrs or more with demonstrated chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) (either on CT or MRI or both) that is considered by the admitting neurosurgical team to be the cause of the patient's presenting symptoms and/or signs, and to be amenable to neurosurgical management will be considered suitable for study.  All patients with diabetes mellitus will be discussed with an endocrinologist prior to commencing corticosteroid (CS).</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Children less than 18yrs will be excluded because the nature of CSDH in this group is entirely different to that observed in adults.  Pregnant women will be excluded because CS can cause congenital malformations.  Patients with a history of psychosis will be excluded because CS can provoke relapses. </exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>This is a double-blind study with patients receiving identical matching capsules of either dexamethasone or placebo. The interventions are sealed in sequentially numbered identical containers according to the allocation sequence. To ensure allocation concealment, the contents (powders) of the capsules will also be identical in texture, odor and colour. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Corticosteroids (CS) are anti inflammatory agents and are frequently used in neurosurgical and neurological
practice: they are a routine adjunct to surgery in patients with brain tumours worldwide.

Several clinical studies have also demonstrated the utility and safety of CS as an alternative to surgery with CSDH: however, most studies have merely compared CS as medical versus surgical management. Only one study has directly compared the effects of CS as an adjunct to surgery: although a null effect was observed, the surgery alone group consisted of only 13 subjects; and the study was not randomised.

We propose to perform the first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical study of surgery for CSDH with and without corticosteroids as an adjunct. We aim to see whether surgery plus CS might reduce operative recurrences, in-patient stay and mortality.
