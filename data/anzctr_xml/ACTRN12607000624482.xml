  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are anaesthetised and a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) postitioned in the upper airway.  A bronchoscope is passed through the LMA into the tracheobronchial tree.  A catheter containing a fibre-optic probe is passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope until it is visible beyond the tip of the bronchoscope in a selected airway.  Rotation of the probe within the catheter produces a cross sectional image of the airway in much the same as a radar display. Airway cross sectional area measurements are made while simultaneously increasing airway pressures via the anaesthetic circuit.  The slope of the pressure vs cross sectional area plot is a measure of the compliance of the airway at that particular site.  This process is repeated a number of times in small and large airways of the tracheo-bronchial tree.</interventions>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Compliance measurements of airway sizes ranging from small (3-4mm) to large (trachea).  Comparisons between diseased and normal airways.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparisons of large airway compliance in healthy and abnormal lungs and their relationship to bronchomalacia and sputum retention.  Compliance curves will be constructed by plotting the relationship between cross sectional area (as measured using OCT) and pressure (which will be applied via the anaesthetic circuit).  The curves will be described in terms of absolute compliance (slope of the curve) and by applying the data to a mathematical exponential equation to derive the shape factor (Colebatch shape factor K).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a new diagnostic laser that has been developed at the University of Western Australia.  The device is an imaging tool that can make various measurements of the inside of the lungs to help improve our understanding of the lungs in health and disease.  Current lung function tests give us information about the lungs as a whole but do not tell us about specific regions within the lungs. Most lung disorders affect different parts of the lungs and to different degrees.  Many of these changes are related to the varying degrees of stiffness within the air tubes, but at present doctors dont have adequate tools to measure this airway property. 
We have developed an optical imaging technique that we think may provide a way to measure these properties.  The system has been developed by two research groups, the West Australian Sleep Disorders Research Institute at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and the Optical and Biomedical Engineering Laboratory at the University of Western Australia.  We have had encouraging results using this device in the upper airway (throat) of awake, sleeping and anaesthetised volunteers and have started using it in patients with windpipe cancers to improve their care.  We would now like to use the system to make measurements of airway stiffness which we think will help understand lung diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.</summary>
