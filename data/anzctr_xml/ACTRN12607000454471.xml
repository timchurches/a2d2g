  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the reliability of a new computer-based test to measure visual acuity in the peripheral visual field (the ability to see fine detail using side vision) and contrast sensitivity (the ability to discriminate between areas of differing brightness). We hypothesise that peripheral visual function - both visual acuity and conatrst sensitivity can be reliably measured using a computer-based test.</summary>
