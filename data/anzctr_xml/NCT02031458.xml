      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Objective Response (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version (v) 1.1 as Assessed by Independent Review Facility (IRF) - ORR was the percentage of participants whose confirmed best overall response was either a Partial Response (PR) or a Complete Response (CR) based upon the IRF assessment per RECIST v1.1. CR: disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to less than (&lt;) 10 millimeters (mm); PR:greater than (&gt;) or equal to (=) 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline in sum of diameters of target lesions, non-progressive disease (PD) non-target lesions and no new lesions. Results were reported by line of therapy and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression Subgroup (tumor cell [TC]3 [TC3] or tumor-infiltrating immune cell [IC] 3 [IC3], TC3 or IC2/3, TC2/3 or IC2/3).</outcome>

    <summary>This multicenter, single-arm study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Atezolizumab in
      participants with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC). Participants will receive Atezolizumab 1200 milligrams (mg) intravenously every 3
      weeks as long as participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the
      investigator, that is , in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration
      attributed to disease progression.</summary>
