    <studytitle>A prospective, single-group, open label, bilateral daily wear clinical trial to investigate microbial contamination of three contact lens cases (Sauflon i-clean [registered] antibacterial case, Sauflon silver barrel case and Sauflon regular flat case), and correlations between Demodex, ocular discomfort and ocular measures in contact lens wearers, when used in conjunction with marketed PureVision [trademark] contact lenses and Synergi multipurpose solution</studytitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, bilateral, open-label, randomised clinical trial with participants wearing commercially available PureVision [Trade mark] contact lenses in conjunction with an Synergi contact lens care solution and i-clean [registered] contact lens case, over a 3 month period on a daily wear basis.
All participants will use the same product types. There are visits at 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months from initial lens fitting. Contact lens cases will be collected at the 1 month and 3 months visits for analysis.
This study will have a of minimum of 40 participants.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical control. The study to which we will be comparing this study (one study within 'Prospective, open label, multi-block study of currently marketed 'contact lenses' and 'lens care solutions' to evaluate eye and product performance in both experienced &amp; new contact lens wearers'- investigator J. Diec) used the same lens type and similar visit schedule as the current study. The differences are the type of lens case and solution used. In the historical control a regular lens case was used. The method of analysis of cases will be as per historical control</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess microbial contamination of i-clean antibacterial contact lens storage cases when used in conjunction with PureVision lenses and Synergi multipurpose solution during daily wear. 
Used contact lens storage cases will be collected during and at the end of the clinical trial and transferred to the Brien Holden Vision Institute microbiology laboratory. Swab samples will be taken from inner surfaces of lens cases for routine microbiology isolation and identification. Contamination rate of used cases will be then determined based on data from microbiological analysis</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 month and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if the presence of Demodex correlates with discomfort and ocular measurements in a normal contact lens wearing population. 
Eye lashes removed from participants will be fixed on a slide, and the presence of Demodex will be determined following microscopic examination</outcome>
      <timepoint>baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess microbial contamination of Sauflon silver barrel cases and Sauflon regular barrel cases after one month of wear</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 month of wear each, after 4 months and 5 months of contact lens wear</timepoint>

-Have ocular health findings considered to be normal and which would not prevent the participant from safely wearing contact lenses;
-Has vision correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses ;
-Be experienced or may be inexperienced at wearing contact lenses;</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;
-Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis. Conditions such as systemic hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;
-An active corneal infection or any active ocular disease that would affect wearing of contact lenses;
-Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication up to 12 weeks prior to and during the trial;
-Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participants ocular health/physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or risk providing a false positive. 
N.B. Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an as needed basis, provided they are not used prophylactically during the trial;  
-Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial;
-Previous corneal refractive surgery;
-Contraindications to contact lens wear;
-Currently enrolled in another clinical trial;
-Be pregnant*  

The Investigator may, at his/her discretion, exclude anyone else who they believe may not be able to fulfil the study requirements, or if it is believed to be in the participants best interests.

* Formal testing of pregnancy is not required. A participants verbal report is sufficient.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to assess microbial contamination of antibacterial contact lens cases when used in conjunction with marketed contact lenses worn on a daily wear and monthly replacement schedule and to compare the results to a historical control.
Hypothesis: antibacterial lens cases will have less contamination inside the lens storage case than a regular lens case</summary>
