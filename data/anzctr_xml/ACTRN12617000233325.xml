  <interventions>
    <interventions>An oropharyngeal swab will be collected from South Australian first year university students during orientation week in 2017 and repeated 3 months later. 

PorA nucleic acid testing (NAT) for Neisseria species will be conducted on each pharyngeal swab and used to estimate the carriage prevalence of all serogroups of N. meningitidis. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the carriage prevalence of all serogroups of N. meningitidis in South Australian first year university students. 

PCR screening for the presence of specific N. meningitidis DNA (using PorA) will be conducted on all oropharyngeal swabs. Further molecular analysis will be used to determine which serogroup has been detected (A,B,C,W,Y). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Visit one during orientation week (20th to 24th of February 2017) and visit two 3 months later.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the measure of agreement between N. meningitidis PCR positive oropharyngeal samples frozen at 6, 16, and 48 hours post collection.

Aliquots from each N. meningitidis PCR positive sample will be frozen at different time intervals (6, 16, 48 hours) to compare the detection of specific meningococcal DNA (using PorA) on each sample following freezing and thawing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During orientation week (20th to 24th of February 2017).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the change in carriage prevalence of all serogroups of N. meningitidis in South Australian first year university students from the start of university to 3 months later. 

PCR screening for the presence of specific N. meningitidis DNA (using PorA) will be conducted on all oropharyngeal swabs at visit one (orientation week) and visit two 3 months later. Further molecular analysis will be used to determine which serogroup has been detected (A,B,C,W,Y). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Visit one during orientation week (20th to 24th of February 2017) and visit two 3 months later. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the difference in N. meningitidis carriage density by conducting quantitative PCR testing (qPCR) of oropharyngeal samples frozen at 6, 16, and 48 hours post collection. 

Aliquots from each N. meningitidis positive sample will be frozen at different time intervals (6, 16, 48 hours) to compare growth of Neisseria species. Quantitative PCR will be applied for estimation of the density of carriage of the Neisseria species. </outcome>
      <timepoint>During orientation week (20th to 24th of February 2017)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Estimate the difference between N. meningitidis culture positive samples frozen at 6, 16, and 48 hours post collection.

Aliquots from each N. meningitidis PCR positive sample will be frozen at different time intervals (6, 16, 48 hours) to compare growth of Neisseria species. Skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) broth is to be streaked on Neisseria selective agar (GC agar) only and incubated overnight in CO2 at 35 o C. Plates are to be read at day 2 and day 4 specifically for Neisseria species and final report at day 4. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint of all serogroups is dichotomous and classified as either carriage, or no pharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis. Descriptive statistics will report percentages, means with standard deviations, median, and/or range (as appropriate) Categorical outcomes will be described using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Cohen's Kappa statistic will be used to measure agreement between different laboratory freezing times and PCR positive tests. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our pilot study will establish baseline carriage prevalence in approximately 500 first year university students. The findings will assist in a more refined estimation of sample size required for a cross sectional study of first year university students to be conducted in 2018 and 2019. It will also be used to validate study processes including delayed freezing of samples. </summary>
