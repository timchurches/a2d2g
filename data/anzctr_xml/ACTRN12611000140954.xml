  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will employ a four-way repeated measures crossover design. All participants will encounter each breakfast type ,breakfast cereals,high fibre, moderate, moderate-low and low fibre.once for each of the four intervention periods.They will be administered to measure their effect on satiety over a 4 hour period across the morning  and energy intake at mid-morning .The study will be conducted in the same children in 2 consecutive weekly periods covering 2 of the test interventions per week. The interventions will be randomised such that each child may be equally likely to receive any one of the 4 interventions on any of the 4 testing occasions.The participants will follow their habitual diet for the period between the four test interventions.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect a very high fibre cereal  to a low fibre breakfast cereal on subjective measures of  fullness and appetite two and four hours after breakfast and ad libitum intake two hours after breakfast.This will be measured over a 4 hour period using a computer programme involving a series of visual analogue scales .</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four dietary conditions will be administered to measure their effect on satiety over a 4 hour period across 4 seperate mornings.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective is to compare the effect of a very high fibre cereal to a low fibre  breakfast cereal on subjective measures of mood  two and four hours after breakfast and ad libitum intake two hours after breakfast.Questionnaires will be used to assess the subjective measures of mood.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four dietary conditions will be administered to measure their effect on satiety over a 4 hour period across 4 seperate mornings.</timepoint>
