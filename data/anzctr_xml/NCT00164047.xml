  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary endpoint is hospital length of stay (LOS), defined from the start of surgery until actual hospital discharge. Patients transferred to another hospital will be tracked until final discharge to home (or other final destination). LOS is likely</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints will be detected by a research assistant who will be masked to Group identity, using chart review up to 30 days postoperatively; confirmation of each will be sought by an independent member of the Endpoint Committee:</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to investigate the effectiveness and safety of nitrous oxide (N2O) in anaesthesia.

      Hypothesis In patients undergoing anaesthesia for major surgery, avoidance of N2O will reduce
      hospital length of stay when compared with otherwise identically managed surgical patients
      receiving N2O as a component of their anaesthesia.</summary>
