    <interventions>Brief name: Dog-Walking, Health and the Human-Dog Bond

A cross-over design will be employed where each participant will undergo 4 conditions across 4 different days, in a randomised sequence, namely: 
1) walk with their dog
2) walk without their dog
3) interact with their dog whilst remaining physically inactive e.g. vocal communication, stroking, eye contact
4) spend time on their own whilst remaining physically inactive 

The researcher should aim to book all 4 visits for each participant at approximately the same time of day. Time of day variation between participants will be accepted. 

The participant must lie at rest on their couch or similar in the supine position for 10 minutes, with no access to smartphone or other electronic devices and no communication with other household members. 

The participant and their dog (when necessary) must then complete the allocated condition for 15 minutes. The participant should wear the Polar V800 strap and watch throughout this period. 

For condition 1, participants must walk with their dog at their average pace on a route familiar to both owner and dog. The researcher will accompany and observe the participant throughout each condition to ensure intervention fidelity. During the walk, the researcher must record a milestone around the half-way point of the walk. The researcher must also record the distance walked using the Strava V3 app. The route must avoid the dogs preferential urination spot (e.g. tree, lamppost in the backyard or outside the house) by walking around the area at a 10m radius. Neither the owner nor dog should interact with other humans or dogs during the walk. The exact length of the walk (min) should be documented upon the participants return home. 

For condition 2, participants must walk in a similar pattern and pace to condition 1. This requires the participant to include interruptions or pauses they would normally experience when walking with their dog. The participant should aim to reach the designated milestone at a similar time to condition 1. The owner should not interact with other humans or dogs during the walk or use smartphone devices. The exact length of the walk (min) should be documented upon the participants return home.

Upon completion of each condition, the participant must then lie supine for an additional 10 minutes. 

A washout period of at least 24 hours will be employed following each condition.

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in human oxytocin concentrations (measured using saliva samples)</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each condition, saliva samples will be collected following a 10-minute supine period directly before and after the condition (i.e. saliva samples will be collected directly before the start of a condition and 10 minutes after the completion of the condition).

There is a 24-hour washout period between conditions.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Changes in the human-dog bond (as measured by MDORS scores)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MDORS questionnaire will be administered immediately upon the researcher's arrival during the first visit.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in human autonomic nervous activity (as measured by changes in heart rate variability)</outcome>
      <timepoint>For each condition, HRV will be assessed during a 10-minute supine period before the basal salivary sample is collected and during a 10-minute supine period after the second salivary sample is collected.

There is a 24-hour washout period between conditions.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associate MDORS scores with the intensity of the acute oxytocin response in humans (measured using saliva samples)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The MDORS questionnaire will be administered immediately upon the researcher's arrival during the first visit.. 

The MDORS score will be calculated prior to the first condition. The difference between basal and post-stimuli oxytocin concentrations in humans, following conditions 1 and 3, will be calculated and used to indicate the intensity of the acute oxytocin response. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Associate changes in HRV (measured using Polar V800 monitors) with the strength of the oxytocin response in humans (measured using saliva samples).

</outcome>
      <timepoint>The difference between basal and post-stimuli oxytocin concentrations in humans, following conditions 1 and 3, will be calculated and used to indicate the intensity of the acute oxytocin response. 

HRV will then be derived from the RR interval, as measured by the Polar V800 monitors. For each condition, HRV will be assessed during a 10-minute supine period before the basal salivary sample is collected and during a 10-minute supine period after the second salivary sample is collected.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>To investigate if dog-walking and/or human-animal interactions have a significant impact on the oxytocin concentration and HRV response, multiple two-way repeated measures ANOVA could be employed. In each test, either the oxytocin concentration or HRV response would be considered the dependent variable and the condition (dog-walking, walking without a dog, human-animal interaction or no-animal interaction) and time (baseline, post-condition) considered dependent variables. 

To determine if changes in oxytocin concentration are associated with changes in HRV following dog-walking and human-dog interactions, a linear regression analysis will be run on either the true values or standardised values (e.g. % chance in concentration/response) however this will depend on the data.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this research is to investigate the oxytocin response to owner-led dog-walking and human-dog interactions, in both humans and dogs, and to examine if variations in this response are influenced by the chronic strength of the human-dog bond. Secondly, this study aims to examine changes in human autonomic nervous system activity as a result of dog-walking and human-dog interactions, and to associate with any variations in the oxytocin response.</summary>
