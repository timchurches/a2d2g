  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be a nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic. A structured face-to-face interview of 1 hour with the survivorship cancer nurse coordninator will discuss and assess participant self-reported: informational and practical issues and concerns; depression, anxiety, stress; coping; and patient empowerment. The first clinic will occur at 3 months after treatment completion. A survivorship care plan will be completed with the participant and include the main potential late effects of treatment and the health care provider that will assess and follow up on these. It will record the participants 3 main health concerns and 3 health goals. The treatment summary will be completed prior to the clinic and the information verified and explained to the participant at this first interview. According to the needs identified by the participant, a tailored resource pack of information and community support details will be targeted towards their main concerns and health goals. The participant will attend the survivorship clinic 3 and 6 months after the first clinic (baseline). It will involve discussion of  any further self-reported issues or concerns and the already identified concerns and health goals. This may take up to an hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control  usual care. The control group will continue usual follow-up care with their haematologist. They will have the same instruments administered to them at baseline, time 1(3 months) and 2 (6 months) after baseline. At time 1 and 2 the instruments will be sent to the control group along with a reply paid envelope for sending them back. If questionnaires are not returned the participant/s will be contacted by telephone after 2 weeks to encourage return. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A consecutive sample of 60 participants will be recruited, 30 to each study group. As a pilot RCT, a sample size calculation is not required. 30 participants in each group will ensure an adequate measure of variability that will enable the generation of sample sizes for future large scale RCTs with this participant group.
To undertake a test-retest reliability measure on the SF-SUNS (Short Form Survivor Unmet Needs Survey) will require a sample size of 40 participants. This will involve administering the SF-SUNS instrument on two consecutive occasions no more than five days apart.
Ten participants will be selected for qualitative interviews after their six-month nurse-led haematology survivorship clinic visit. The number of GPs sent a survivorship care plan treatment summary and evaluation will be a maximum of 30 to reflect the intervention group numbers.
Data Analysis for quantitative data will use univariate and multivariate statistical techniques with SPSS data analysis software. Descriptive statistics will be used for demographic variables. Two-tailed analysis significance level is set at 0.05 for all tests. Differences between intervention and control groups and between baseline measurements and at each time point will use one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] for normal distribution and repeated measures ANOVA to analyse the entire series of measurements at each time point. Confidence intervals will reflect the contrast between groups. Test-retest reliability of SF-SUNS instrument will use an intra-class correlation random effect model.
Qualitative data will be analysed using QSR NVivo qualitative analysis software. Content analysis will identify common themes and patterns within interview data and the open-ended questions on GP evaluation form.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to develop and test a nurse-led model of survivorship care for lymphoma survivors. 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are over 18 years, have completed first line chemotherapy treatment for new Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma or second line curative intent autologous transplant and have no evidence of lymphoma on PET scan.
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will continue to receive usual follow-up care with their haematologist. Participants in the other group will take part in an evidenced-based survivorship clinic that will provide tailored care to meet the informational and practical needs of lymphoma cancer patients who have completed active treatment. The nurse-led lymphoma survivorship clinic intervention will involve three 1 hour face-to-face structured interviews that will occur over a 6 month period. These will involve discussion and delivery of a survivorship care plan, treatment summary and resource pack. 
Participants in both groups will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires at baseline, 3 months and 6 months in order to evaluate unmet informational and practical needs, depression, anxiety, stress, coping and self-empowerment. The findings from this study will add to a limited body of knowledge in this cancer survivor group and make a significant contribution to the planning and delivery of survivorship care.</summary>
