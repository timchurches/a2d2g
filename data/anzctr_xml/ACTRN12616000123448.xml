  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma nitrite concentration: 
Three mL of blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein by a certified technician. Samples will be snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 degrees Celsius. 2 blood draws will be required, one before and one 2.5 hours after treatment.

Within 30 minutes of defrosting, all NO metabolite concentrations will be measured by chemiluminescence using Ionics/Sievers nitric oxide analyser.</outcome>
      <timepoint> Two and a half hours after beetroot juice consumption</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oral Microbiome Profiling:

A tongue swab will be collected via the use of a sterile cotton swab will be rotated over the anterior dorsal tongue surface from left to right.

Clinical specimens will undergo routine microbiological analyses using a series of aerobic and anaerobic culture media. Bacteria from single colonies will be used for MALDI-TOF analysis to profile proteins within the bacteria and allow for identification of specific types of bacteria.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Specimen will be collected before supplementation as we hypothesise that the already established oral microbiome of an individual will affect the conversion of the supplemented nitrate (in the form of beetroot juice) to plasma nitrite.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Brachial Artery Blood Pressure: Blood pressure readings will be taken in accordance to the World Health Organisations STEP wise approach for measuring blood pressure with a stethoscope and sphygmanometer by a practiced technician. The participant will be asked to be seated for 15 minutes. 3 blood pressure measurements will be taken and the participant will rest 3 minutes in between each measurement. The second and third measurements will be averaged to obtain the participants blood pressure reading.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two and a half hours after beetroot juice consumption</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for this project has been set at 75 participants.

We do not have preliminary data or a previous model to base this study on which makes sample size requirements difficult. This study is a pilot study that will provide effect size data to help in the design of a confirmatory study.

The sample size for this study has been chosen in consideration of the practical and financial limitations associated with the project. As a research group however we feel 75 subjects will likely be the maximum number we would like to recruit to inform future research funding applications, studies and generate an interesting publication.

We hope to obtain a heterogeneous population to help establish variance and confirm future confirmation studies.

Investigations in the human microbiome usually require many more subjects than 75 although it is difficult to get an accurate estimation for this as often they are actually characterising the microbiome.  For example the NIH Human Microbiome Project to define normal bacterial makeup of the human body used data from 200 members of the Human Microbiome Project Consortium from nearly 80 universities and scientific institutions to report on 5 years of research.  In addition the Human Oral Microbiome Database includes 1691 taxa in 13 phyla.

It is in keeping all of these factors in mind, that we believe 75 participants is an appropriate sample size for this pilot study.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study seeks to expand on previous research, which found that the consumption inorganic nitrate can significantly lower blood pressure (BP) via increasing the availability of nitric oxide (NO) within the circulation. Nitrate supplementation increases NO in a two-step process 1) Nitrate to nitrite and 2) Nitrite to NO.  Step one is highly dependent on oral bacteria to facilitate the reduction of nitrate to nitrite within the saliva. However, the magnitude of this conversion appears to vary from person to person and even potentially from day to day in the same individual. This variability is not completely understood but appears to be facilitated by the amount and make-up of oral bacteria in the mouth., As a result, the primary aim of this study is to determine the relationship between the type and amount of oral bacteria and the concentration of nitrite in the plasma following a high inorganic nitrate beverage (beetroot Juice). Observing the relationship between the change in plasma nitrite concentration and the change in brachial artery blood pressure following a high inorganic nitrate beverage (beetroot Juice) is a secondary aim of the study.
 
Participants will complete only one testing visit. Upon arrival, baseline data collection will include blood pressure, a saliva sample (to identify particular markers on the cells and pH of the oral cavity which may influence bacteria in the mouth), tongue swab (to identify the present oral bacteria) and a blood draw (for resting plasma nitrate and nitrite levels) will be taken. Participants will then be asked to consume a beverage high in inorganic nitrate (beetroot juice). Two and a half hours following supplementation participants will undergo repeat testing measures including another blood draw and BP. 

To our knowledge, no other trial has used this particular model when examining the role of oral bacteria in inorganic nitrate to nitrite conversion and therefore the current study is a pilot study to help inform us of sample size requirements in a heterogeneous population and whether particular bacterial species are more or less relevant.
 
For patients with cardiovascular disease, nitrate supplementation provides a potential alternative source of NO, which we know they often cannot produce the same as healthy subjects do. The results of this study may contribute to our understanding of this process that could be used as an intervention for blood pressure in the future.</summary>
