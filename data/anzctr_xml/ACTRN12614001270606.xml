    <concealment>Selected participants after initial screening with blood pressure will be randomized into two separate groups , using a computer programe for randomization (one group goes with plums juice and other group goes with placebo plum juice). The placebo and plum juice will be packed in unlabeled opaque bottles to maintain double blinding and this juice will be given to participants on their visit. </concealment>
    <sequence>Once the potential participants were recruited after initial screening, the patient data will be entered in to computer for creating a randomization of participants in to 2 groups.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Male and Female participants (n=70)  between the ages of 18-65 who are overweight with a BMI of greater than 25 or a waist circumference &gt;94cm (male), &gt;80cm (female), systolic blood pressure 130-150 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 85-100 mmHg will be recruited for this study. The sample size was determined by statistical power analysis (two tailed t-test at the 5% significance level for the power of 90%) of expected differences in the major measured variable of experiment i.e. systolic blood pressure (Brocel et al 2010). Twenty five participants in each group are required for significant differences in outcome measures. However due to the high dropout rate in human trials the maximum number of participants to be recruited is 35 in each group</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Metabolic syndrome is characterised by a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors, including central obesity, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (low HDL cholesterol, high triglyceride levels &amp; LDL cholesterol) and elevated plasma glucose levels. Individuals with metabolic syndrome have central obesity and at least one other risk factor to be clinical diagnosed with the syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is an emerging clinical challenge and imperative public health issue. 
Subjects with metabolic syndrome have a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. 
Prunus salicina, Queen Garnet plum (QGP), is a fruit that was naturally bred to have a high anthocyanin and antioxidant content, in a Queensland Government agriculture initiative. Queen Garnet plums showed anti-obesigenic properties. Studies in laboratory animals have shown that treatment with Queen Garnet plum juice improved the unhealthy blood lipid profile caused by a high-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. 
The primary object for this study is to monitor blood pressure changes with Queen Garnet plum juice. Blood pressure is measured by using an automatic sphygmomanometer for 12 weeks of duration.
