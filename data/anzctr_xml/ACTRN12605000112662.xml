  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine the effects of tight blood pressure control in Maori and Pacific patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by diabetic renal disease. It is already a well known that keeping blood pressure below 130/80 will delay the progression of renal disease caused by diabetes. However many patients do not achieve this level of blood pressure control. 65 people who meet the inclusion criteria will be allocated to either conventional treatment (general practitioner and specialist clinics) or community care (general practitioner, specialist clinics and a community health care worker). The community health care worker will be of the same ethnicity as the patient and will visit the person at home or their place of employment on a monthly basis. At these visits blood pressure will be measured and under the supervision of research doctor blood pressure medication will be adjusted if need be. This trial will involve 65 patients in the Central Auckland and West Auckland areas.</summary>
