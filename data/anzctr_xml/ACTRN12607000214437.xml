    <interventions>This study is comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with warfarin for the prevention of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism in subjects with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Those subjects assigned to rivaroxaban will receive rivaroxaban 20 mg orally once daily, plus warfarin placebo titrated to a sham International Normalised Ratio. Subjects with moderate renal impairment at screening (defined as calculated creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min inclusive) will receive a dose adaptation to rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily. 
The duration of the treatment period for a given subject will depend on the time required to accrue the required number of adjudicated primary efficacy endpoint events. As a result, the time on study drug will vary from subject to subject, however the expected maximum duration of the study is 32 months, but may extend to 4 years.</interventions>

      <outcome>Primary efficacy outcome is the composite of stroke and non-central nervous system systemic embolism.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at the first occurrence from time of randomisation, then every 4 weeks to the end of follow-up period. That is an expected maximum of 32 months, but may extend to 4 years.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Individual components of the composite primary outcome; vascular death; myocardial infarctiion; disabling stroke; and all-cause mortality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at the first occurrence from time of randomisation, then every 4 weeks to the end of follow-up period. That is an expected maximum of 32 months, but may extend to 4 years.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the efficacy and safety of 20 mg once daily rivaroxaban in preventing thromboembolic events in subjects with atrial fibrillation not related to mitral valve stenosis. Subjects with moderate renal impairment at screening (defined as calculated creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 ml/min inclusive) will receive a dose adaptation to rivaroxaban 15 mg once daily.</summary>
