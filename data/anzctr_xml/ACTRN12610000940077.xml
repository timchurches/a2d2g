    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical cure, as judged by an infectious diseases physician. Clinical cure is defined as resolution of fever for more than 48 hours, resolution of all clinical signs of infection, no longer receving any antibiotic treatment for the index infection, and at least one negative blood culutre after the cessation of all antibiotics.</outcome>

      <outcome>All-cause mortality as determined from hospital discharge data. If the patient is discharged from hospital prior to 28 days post randomisation, they or their general practitioner will be contacted to determine their vital status.</outcome>

New renal impairment is defined as serum creatinine&gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal if it was &lt;=1.25 upper limit of normal at trial entry; WHO Grade 2 or higher liver toxicity is defined as one or both of alanine transaminase or gamma glutaryl tranferase of &gt;2.6 times the upper limit of normal</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>MRSA bacteraemia has a mortality of 30-40%, exceeding that of sensitive Staphylococcus aureus primarily due to the shortcomings of vancomycin, the standard therapy for MRSA bacteraemia. Whilst several new antibiotics have become available for MRSA, none have been shown to be superior to vancomycin. Although MRSA is by definition resistant to oxacillin, multiple in-vitro and animal studies have demonstrated synergy of vancomycin with beta-lactams (including oxacillin) against MRSA and hetro-resistant vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA). This study aims to answer the following question: In hospitalised adults with MRSA bacteraemia, does combination therapy with vancomycin and flucloxacillin lead to a shorter time to clearance of bacteraemia than vancomycin alone?</summary>
