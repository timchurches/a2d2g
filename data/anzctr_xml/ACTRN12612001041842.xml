  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two active intervention arms and a watchful waiting control arm.

Arm 1, A structured neurocognitive learning programme (Attention Process Training [APT II], aimed at improving underlying cognitive deficit. This intervention focuses on restoring the specific cognitive function, attention.

Arm 2, A systematic teaching of strategies to compensate for the functional impact of cognitive deficits (Compensatory Strategy Training [CST]).This treatment intervention helps patients adapt to the presence of deficits, rather than trying to treat the underlying deficit.

Both active interventions consists of 2-hour small group sessions per week for 6 weeks, with a trained therapist.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients in the watchful waiting control arm will be given current standard medical care.  Standard medical care for this population is follow-up with their treating doctor as per follow-up and monitoring guidelines.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate two cognitive rehabilitation programs in breast cancer survivors with perceived cognitive dysfunction after chemotherapy. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above who has had definitive surgery for invasive early breast cancer within the last 5 years and were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. You should have completed at least 3 cycles of chemotherapy and be experiencing cognitive changes. 

Trial details 
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of three groups. Participants in one group will undergo a structured neurocognitive learning programme (Attention Process Training [APT]) in small groups across 6 weeks for 2 hours per week. Participants in the second group will undergo a systematic teaching of strategies to compensate for the functional impact of cognitive deficit (Compensatory Strategy Training [CST]). Again, this rehabilitation program will be conducted in small 2 hour group sessions over a 6 week period. Participants in the third group will receive standard treatment. Participants will complete questionnaires and cognitive tests at baseline, 4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post intervention in order to determine the efficacy of the two different cognitive rehabilitation programs.</summary>
