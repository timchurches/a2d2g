    <interventions>Study of 30 babies aged 6-12 weeks age, randomised to either sleep in a commercially available hammock ( yet to be determined) or a standard type bassinete for 1 daytime nap ( approx 1-3 hours). Babies will have limited sleep studies recorded using Sandman Pocket Express (2008).  Sleep studies will be analysed for sleep state, mean oxygen saturation, desatuartion events and respiratory events.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is now evidence that some young babies are at particular of risk of low oxygen levels in any position where their head is bent forward on to the chest. At this age the babys jaw is still very mobile, and any pressure on the jaw forces it backwards, narrowing and potentially blocking the upper airway. We have previously studied this effect when babies are restrained in car seats.

Baby hammocks are widely used because the gentle rocking helps the baby to sleep. However, their design tends to flex the baby forward, suggesting that these hammocks could potentially cause falls in baby blood oxygen levels. 

This research will study babies during a daytime sleep in a safe monitored environment. They will either sleep in a cot or a hammock. This will help to determine if sleeping in a hammock causes breathing problems for babies compared to sleeping in a cot. It will provide valuable information on the safety of baby hammocks.</summary>
