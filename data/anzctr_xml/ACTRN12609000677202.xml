  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pharmacists will provide counselling to patients at monthly intervals for five months and liaise with general practitioners to improve medications management, medication adherence and lifestyle management. General practitioners (GPs) will be informed of patient's involvement in research, provided with a written copy of the the pharmacy treatment plan, and asked for comment. They will also be informed verbally or in writing of any recommended chages to patient medication.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change to risk of cardiovascular disease (as per New Zealand risk calculations)</outcome>
      <timepoint>At six months from the baseline timepoint for each individual patient</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change to individual cardiovascular risk factors. Blood pressure, lipid profile, random blood glucose, waist, hip and body mass index (BMI) will be measured using point of care testing equipment. Depression will be self-reported by administration of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES D ) 10 item survey scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At six months from the baseline timepoint for each individual patient</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change to patient health behaviour. Issues around medication adherence, physical activity, smoking, nutrition, weight management, quality of life and alcohol consumption will be measured using survey instruments administered by researchers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At six months from the baseline timepoint for each individual patient</timepoint>
