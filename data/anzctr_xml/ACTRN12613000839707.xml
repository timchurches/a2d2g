  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Caries incidence as measured by the proportion of children who developed new dentine caries lesions during the follow-up period. Dental caries assessment was performed by two trained Pediatric Dentists.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At two years after baseline caries assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Caries increment as measured by subtracting the number of decayed, filled and extracted tooth surfaces at baseline from the number of decayed, filled and extracted tooth surfaces at the end of the follow-up.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>At two years after baseline caries assessment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and acceptability of the intervention as measured by the number of children/caretakers with complaints regarding the intervention (e.g., children: burning sensation in the mouth, nausea, altered taste, allergies or avoided smiling because of the yellowish color of the teeth after varnish application; caretakers: felt bothered by the yellowish color of the child's teeth after varnish application). In order to assess the safety and acceptability of the intervention parents were interviewed by telephone after the first varnish application.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At seven to ten days after the first varnish application.</timepoint>

The absolute and relative risk reductions and the caries prevented fractions (with their 95% Confidence Intervals) were calculated using a statistical software. The Student T Test was used to compare the caries increment in the test and control groups after 2 years of follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this two-year randomized placebo-controlled trial was to assess whether the application of Fluoride varnish in preschool children at six-months intervals decreases the number of new caries lesions in their primary dentition. We also investigated whether this procedure is safe and well-accepted by the children themselves and their caretakers. At the beginning of the study, two hundred 1 to 4-year old children were allocated to the test (Fluoride varnish) or control (Placebo varnish) groups. The participants, their caretakers, examining dentists and the clinical staff did not know to each group each child was allocated. After the first varnish application, 183 children's caretakers were interviewed by telephone in order to know if they or their children had any complaints regarding the varnish application. Two years later, 181 children showed-up for dental examination (89 in the test group and 92 in the placebo group).</summary>
