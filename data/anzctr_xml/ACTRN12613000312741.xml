    <interventions> The patients who satisfy the inclusion criteria and accept the new type of operation will be divided to the experimental group.The foreign bodies in the entrance of esophagus of the patients will be extracted by self-retained laryngoscope(8587 A, P and KK) and rigid endoscopy(0 degree or 30 degrees Karl Storz Hopkin 8713 AA and BA).The operation will be taken as soon as possible after the routine examinations are done and  the approximate duration of the surgical procedure will be about 30 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients who reject the new type of operation will be divided to the control group.The foreign bodies in the entrance of esophagus of the patients will be extracted by direct laryngoscopy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Foreign bodies in the entrance of esophagus, especially for those small Sharp-pointed objects embedded in submucosa are formidable clinical emergency. Currently, flexible endoscopy is usually use for objects lodged below this area. Rigid esophagoscopy or direct laryngoscopy are alternative surgical methods, but neither of them could smooth the crimping mucosa and expose the area completely, nor combine with an rigid endoscopy expediently. Improvements in surgical methods are therefore necessary for foreign bodies at this area.Self-retained laryngoscope combine with rigid endoscopy are common used in laryngeal lesion treatment. Self-retained Karl Storz laryngoscope(8587 A, P and KK )have a long lip which can support the cricoid lamina,  and expose the entrance of esophagus,completely, then 0 degree or 30 degrees  Karl Storz Hopkins rigid endoscopy (8713 AA and BA) are used to check the area carefully. Small Foreign bodies even the sharp-pointed objects embedded in submucosa will be found easily. </summary>
