  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be consented to be included into the study.  The patient will undergo total knee replacement surgery and receive a Saiph Total Knee Replacement which is a cemented implant that evolved from the successful Freeman-Samuelson principles.  The operation will take approximately 1.5 hours and will be performed by the consultant orthopaedic surgeon with experience of implanting the Saiph Knee.  The Saiph Knee is a TGA approved product and is used by many orthopaedic surgeons in Australia and New Zealand.  



</interventions>
    <comparator>The results will be compared to patient outcomes of the Saiph Knee when performed by the surgeon design team performed from November 2011 to December 2014.  The control data was obtained in a clinical study, and the results will be published prior to the end of the current study.  This study was performed under ethics approval at St Vincent's Hospital Sydney (Trial No 12/254) and The Avenue Hospital Melbourne (Trial No 144).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, international multi-centre clinical study. The study will enrol a minimum of 1000 patients over a 36 month recruitment period between approximately 25 surgeons at 30 centres in Australia and New Zealand.
The objectives of the study are:
* To evaluate the clinical outcomes of the Saiph Total Knee Replacement and ensure that it performs as intended.
* To compare the results of this study to the optimal clinical results of the design surgeons to ensure their results can be reproduced.

The Saiph Total Knee Replacement (TKR) is intended for use as a primary total knee replacement device consisting of a femoral, tibial, tibial bearing and optional patellar component. The Saiph TKR is CE marked, TGA approved and has a rebate code on the Prostheses List.

Clinical evaluations: Standard, functional parameters such as range of motion will be assessed preoperatively, and postoperatively at 6 weeks and at 6/12 months. Further clinical evaluations at 2 years and 5 years will be collected only for those patients that return to clinic for this review.

Patient outcome assessments: The KOOS (Full Version), Oxford Knee Score (OKS), EQ5D and UCLA Activity Scale will be assessed preoperatively, and postoperatively at 6/12 months, 2 years and 5 years.

Radiographic evaluations: Anterior and lateral X-rays will be analysed preoperatively, immediately postoperatively and at standard of care time points thereafter.</summary>
