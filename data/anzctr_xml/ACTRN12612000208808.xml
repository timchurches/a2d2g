  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study was to evaluate teleconsultation´s efficacy for hearing aid (HA) fittings. 50 hearing impaired individuals with age ranging from 39 to 88 years and ISO mean of audiometric thresholds between 30 and 68,7 dBHL participated in this study. The participants were divided in two groups by means of randomized stratification: control group or active group (n=25), submitted to face to face procedures and experimental or intervention group(n=25), submitted to synchronous teleconsultation with interactive video and remote application control. Following the consultations, an evaluator, blinded regarding the groups, performed the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT-Brazil). Nearly a month following the consultations, this evaluator analyzed the daily time of HA use (datalogging) and administered the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA). In order to evaluate the teleconsultations efficacy, the following elements were analyzed and compared to face to face procedures:
- the time for hearing aid programming, for real ear measurements and for the orientation
- the total time of the face to face and teleconsultations procedures
- the results of real ear measurements
- the HINT results
- the IOI-HA results
- the datalogging analyses
The difference between the face to face and the teleconsultation procedures was that in the second one, the procedures for hearing aid programming, real ear measurements and orientation were conducted by means the remote control of the devices. The Polycom PVX version 8.0.2 software was used to make the remote control and for the videoconferencing. The audiologist whit experience in the procedures for hearing aid fitting was 300 meters away from the test environment. The procedures were facilitated by a graduate student or professional without experience in the hearing aid fitting. The facilitator followed the procedures and informed the audiologist about problems that could happen during the teleconsultation.
Just after the face to face and teleconsultation procedures, an evaluator, blinded regarging to the procedures, carried out the HINT test. After a month of the procedures, the blinded evaluator asses the IOI-HA questionnaire and the hearing aids datalogging.
It was just one session for one hour and a half for both groups.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Teleconsultations have similar outcomes when are compared with the face to face consultations in audiology. In this study, the duration of each procedure (hearing aid programming, real ear measures and couseling about hearing aid management) and the overall time, the real ear measures, the spech perception results, the questionnaire results were compared in the control group and the intervention group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The first consultation was performed just after randomization and included the hearing aid programming, real ear measures, counseling about hearing aid management and the speech perception assessment. After a month, the datalogging was analized and the IOI-HA (international Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids) was applied.</timepoint>

    <summary>Purpose: To evaluate teleconsultation´s efficacy for hearing aid (HA) fittings. Methods: 50 hearing impaired individuals with age ranging from 39 to 88 years and ISO mean of audiometric thresholds between 30 and 68,7 dBHL participated in this study. The participants were divided in two groups by means of randomized stratification: control group (n=25), submitted to face to face procedures and experimental (n=25), submitted to synchronous teleconsultation with interactive video and remote application control. Following the consultations, an evaluator, blinded regarding the groups, performed the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT-Brazil). Nearly a month following the consultations, this evaluator analyzed the daily time of HA use (datalogging) and administered the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA).  Results: A greater time for the programming and verification and a smaller time for HA orientation were observed for the experimental group. No difference was found between the groups for the total consultation time in minutes. The real ear measures matching to targets were similar for the both groups. No significant difference was observed between the groups for the HINT results (Speech Reception Thresholds in silence as well as the signal to noise ratio), the daily amount HA use in hours and the IOI-HA scores. Conclusion: Teleconsultation is efficacious for HA programming, verification and fitting when face to face services are not available.</summary>
