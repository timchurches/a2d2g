  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to first clinically significant exacerbation - Clinically significant exacerbations will be defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalisation and/or emergency department (ED) visits</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 52 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ratio to baseline in blood eosinophil count - Blood eosinophil counts will be recorded as part of the standard haematological assessments at Baseline (Week 0), weeks 12, 24, 36 and 52 in Part C</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (Week 0) and up to Week 52</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to a decrease in asthma control, defined as an increase from baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) score of &gt;= 0.5 units - The ACQ-5 is a five-item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of subject' asthma control that can be quickly and easily completed by the subject. The five questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, and shortness of breath, wheeze). The response options for all these questions consist of a zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. ACQ score will be collected at Baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48 and 56.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>-  Informed Consent: Prior to commencing any study related activities, subjects must be
             able and willing to provide written informed consent, and an assent for subjects under
             18 years of age, at Visit 0 (or Visit 1 if these Visits are conducted on the same
             day).

          -  MEA115666 or 201312 Study Participation: Participation (through the Follow Up/Exit
             Visit or Early Withdrawal) in either study with documented evidence of at least 6
             months of continuous mepolizumab treatment prior to Visit 1. Continuous treatment with
             mepolizumab is defined as no more than 2 consecutive missed doses (no treatment gaps
             of more than 12 weeks [84 days] between any two doses).

          -  Current Anti-Asthma Therapy: Asthma is currently being treated with a controller
             medication and the subject has been on a controller medication for the past 12 weeks.
             Subjects will be expected to continue controller therapy for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Male or Eligible Female Subjects: A female is eligible to enter and participate in the
             study if she is of: Non-child bearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of
             becoming pregnant, including any female who is post-menopausal or surgically sterile).
             Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented hysterectomy and/or
             bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. Post-menopausal females are defined as being
             amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g., age
             appropriate, &gt; 45 years, in the absence of hormone replacement therapy.

        OR Child bearing potential, has a negative pregnancy test at screening, and agrees to
        acceptable contraceptive methods approved in their local country, when used consistently
        and correctly (i.e., in accordance with the approved product label and the instructions of
        the physician) for the duration of the study and for 4 months after the last study drug
        administration.

        A urine pregnancy test is required of all females of child-bearing potential at each
        scheduled study visit prior to the injection of study treatment, and at the Exit Visit,
        Early Withdrawal (EW) or Discontinuation of IP Visit.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary objective of the study is to evaluate whether patients with severe eosinophilic
      asthma who have received long-term treatment with mepolizumab (at least 3 years) need to
      maintain treatment with mepolizumab to continue to receive benefit. Subjects who participated
      in the open-label studies MEA115666 or 201312 with at least 6 months of treatment with
      mepolizumab prior to Visit 1 and who have no more than 2 consecutive missed doses of
      mepolizumab treatment will be eligible to participate in this study. This study will be
      conducted in 4 parts in approximately 300 subjects. Part A will be Variable Open-Label Run-in
      (for subjects with less than 3 years of mepolizumab treatment). Once the required 3 year
      exposure is reached, subjects will enter Part B- Fixed Open-Label Run-In (4 weeks to 8
      weeks). During Part A and B subjects will be administered Open-label mepolizumab (100
      milligram [mg] Subcutaneous [SC]) every 4 weeks. Part C will be the randomized double-blinded
      part. Upon completion of Part B, eligible subjects will be randomized to mepolizumab (100 mg
      SC) every 4 weeks or placebo administered SC every 4 weeks for 52 weeks.

      Subjects discontinuing investigational product (IP) due to a clinically significant asthma
      exacerbation will then enter optional Part D of the study. During Part D, subjects receive
      open-label mepolizumab in addition to their standard of care therapy for the remainder of the
      study, through Part D up to 52-weeks post-randomization. An Exit Visit will be conducted 52
      weeks after randomization in order to assess subject's efficacy parameters, immunogenicity
      status, and to conduct additional safety assessments. Eligible subjects will participate in
      the study ranging from 56 to192 weeks, depending on the duration of Part A (0 to 132 weeks)
      and Part B (4 to 8 weeks).</summary>
