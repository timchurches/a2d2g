  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention, called the Essence program, is undertaken by participants over six weeks  i.e. one 90 minute session per week for six weeks.

The Essence program is a mindfulness and lifestyle course developed and delivered by Dr Craig Hassed from Monash University. Essence stands for Education, Stress management, Spirituality (meaning), Exercise, Nutrition, Connectedness (social support) and Environment.

The short course will explore the potential role each of these elements has in managing Parkinsons and improving quality of life. The program will introduce participants to simple strategies that can help them to live well with Parkinsons disease and they will be encouraged, but not pressured, to apply aspects of the Essence model that are most relevant to their own lives. 

Sessions will be run in groups of 20-30, and will be held in metropolitan Melbourne.</interventions>
    <comparator>This pilot study is a prospective mixed-methods before and after study using a no treatment wait list control. The second group will effectively act as the pseudo control group. The second group will also receive the intervention but at a later stage i.e. ten weeks after recruitment and after group one has completed the intervention.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the impact on patients of a 6 week mindfulness and Essence based lifestyle program with community living adults with disability congruent with stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr staging) Parkinsons Disease. 
Quantitative study aims. To determine whether:
1.	Participation in a 6 week mindfulness and Essence based lifestyle program improves PD disease related function in patients with disability consistent with stage 2 Parkinsons disease?

2.	In these patients, does the Essence program influence patient a) health beliefs; b) mental and emotional health; c) health locus of control? 
Qualitative study aims. To better understand:
3.	What are the experiences of patients with PD  attending the mindfulness based intervention?
4.	Beliefs about disease management before and after the program?
5.	How attitudes towards their health efficacy evolve over the course of the program?
6.	What aspects of the program were most valuable and meaningful?
7.	How people engaged with the program?</summary>
