Other interventions - Sunlight and calcium
Other interventions - control

Active Comparator: Group A, Sunlight - Participants in this arm are required to sit in the sun most days of the week for 15 minutes

Active Comparator: Group B, sunlight and calcium - Participants in this group receive sunlight and a calcium supplement

No Intervention: Group C - Control group


Other interventions: Sunlight
Subjects in the intervention groups will be asked to undergo exposure of approximately 15% of their body (ie the face, hands and arms) usually between 9.30am - 10am daily during the year, 5 days per week.

Other interventions: Sunlight and calcium
Subjects in the intervention groups will be asked to undergo exposure of approximately 15% of their body (ie the face, hands and arms) usually between 9.30am - 10am daily during the year, 5 days per week. In the calcium and sunlight arm, calcium supplements (Caltrate, 600mg elemental calcium, Whitehall) will be administered to the whole group via the Blister/ Webster packs.

Other interventions: control
Subjects in the control group will be provided with a brochure about vitamin D deficiency and how to treat it. They will receive their usual routine care and nutrition.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will determine the effect of a public health strategy (ie. increased sun
      light exposure and increased calcium intake) to reduce falls in older people in residential
      care using a randomised trial. The primary hypothesis of the trial is that increased
      appropriate sun light exposure will reduce falls, improve 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) levels
      and lower parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Secondary hypotheses are that the intervention
      will reduce accelerated bone turnover, reduce fractures, improve motor function and improve
      mood.</summary>
