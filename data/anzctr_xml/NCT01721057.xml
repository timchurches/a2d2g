      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving American College of Rheumatology 20% Improvement (ACR20) - ACR20 Responder Index is a composite of clinical, laboratory, and functional measures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). "ACR20 Responder" is a participant who has at least 20% improvement in both tender and swollen joint counts and in at least 3 of the following 5 criteria: Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using visual analog scale (VAS), Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI), pain due to arthritis, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Participants with missing responses and participants who discontinue study or drug or are rescued before analysis timepoint are deemed non-responders.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score - The HAQ-DI questionnaire assesses the participant's self-perception on the degree of difficulty (0 [without any difficulty], 1 [with some difficulty], 2 [with much difficulty], and 3 [unable to do])when dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and performing other daily activities. Scores for each functional area were averaged to calculate the HAQ-DI score, which ranged from 0 (no disability) to 3 (worst disability). A decrease in HAQ-DI score indicated an improvement in the participant's condition.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Disease Activity Score Based on a 28-Joint Count and High-sensitivity C-reactive Protein (DAS28-hsCRP) - Disease Activity Score (DAS) modified to include 28 joint count (DAS28) consisted of composite score of following variables: tender joint count (TJC28), swollen joint count (SJC28), C-reactive protein (CRP) (milligrams per liter), and Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using visual analog scale (VAS) (participant global VAS). DAS28 was calculated using following formula: DAS28-CRP=0.56*square root (sqrt)(TJC28)+0.28*sqrt(SJC28)+0.36*natural log(CRP+1)+0.014*Patient's Global VAS+0.96. Scores ranged 1.0-9.4, where lower scores indicated less disease activity.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) =3.3 - SDAI is a tool for measurement of disease activity in RA that integrates TJC28, SJC28, acute phase response using C-reactive protein (milligrams per liter), Participant's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using VAS centimeters (cm), and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity using VAS (cm). The SDAI is calculated by summing the values of the 5 components. Lower scores indicated less disease activity. An index-based definition of remission occurs with an SDAI score =3.3.</outcome>

      <outcome>Mean Duration of Morning Joint Stiffness(MJS) in the Prior 7 Days as Collected in Electronic Daily Diaries - Participants reported the duration of their morning joint stiffness (MJS) in hours and minutes into daily electronic diaries. If MJS duration was longer than 12 hours (720 minutes), it was truncated to 720 minutes for statistical presentations and analyses. The average value across the 7 days preceding each visit is calculated. A decrease in duration of MJS indicated an improvement in the participant's condition.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Mental Component Score (MCS), Physical Component Score (PCS) of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey Version 2 Acute (SF-36v2 Acute) - The SF-36 is a health-related survey that assesses participant's quality of life and consists of 36 questions covering 8 health domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems and emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality, and 2 component scores (mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]). MCS consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales. PCS consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales. Each domain is scored by summing the individual items and transforming the scores into a 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating better health status or functioning.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Scores - European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized measure of health status of the participant. One component consists of a descriptive system of the respondent's health comprised of the following 5 participant-reported dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The responses are used to derive the health state index scores using the United Kingdom (UK) algorithm, with scores ranging from -0.594 to 1, and the United States (US) algorithm, with scores ranging from -0.109 to 1. A higher score indicates better health state.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Scores (Self-Perceived Health) - A second component of the EQ-5D-5L is a self-perceived health score which is assessed using a VAS that ranges from 0 to 100 millimeter (mm), where 0 indicates the worst health you can imagine and 100 indicates the best health you can imagine.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI-RA) Scores - The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Rheumatoid Arthritis (WPAI-RA) questionnaire was developed to measure the effect of general health and symptom severity on work productivity and regular activities in the 7 days prior to the visit. It contains 6 items covering overall work productivity (health), overall work productivity (symptom), impairment of regular activities (health), and impairment of regular activities (symptom). Scores are calculated as impairment percentages. The WPAI-RA yields four types of scores: Absenteeism (work time missed), Presenteeism (impairment at work), Work productivity loss (overall work impairment), and Activity impairment.</outcome>
