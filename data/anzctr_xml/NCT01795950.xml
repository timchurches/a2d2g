             individuals with localized, non-metastatic basal cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ
             carcinoma of the cervix, or prostate cancer who are not currently or expected to
             undergo radiation therapy, chemotherapy and/or surgical intervention, or to initiate
             hormonal treatment during the study

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the safety of PLX-PAD to treat pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH). PLX-PAD is a cell-based product made of allogeneic
      Mesenchymal-like Adherent Stromal Cells (ASCs), derived from human full-term placentas
      following an elective caesarean section. This year-long study will evaluate the safety of
      three different dose levels of PLX-PAD, each given as a single intravenous infusion. This
      study will also evaluate effects that PLX-PAD may have on PAH, such as changes in the ability
      to exercise and on other tests used to measure the disease severity.</summary>
