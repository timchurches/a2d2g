  <interventions>
    <interventions>Haemodiafiltration
Haemodiafiltration differs from conventional haemodialysis in employing convection as well as diffusion principles to remove solutes and excess water.
Participants will receive their routine haemodialysis hours and sessions (as prescribed by their treating nephrologist) with haemodiafiltration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Haemodialysis with High-flux membranes
Standard haemodialysis relies on diffusion of solutes and water across a semi-permeable membrane down a gradiant. High-flux membranes with greater permeability for higher molecular weight molecules have been developed to enhance solute clearance and are increasingly employed.
Participants will receive their routine haemodialysis hours and sessions (as prescribed by their treating nephrologist) with standard haemodialysis using high-flux membranes.</comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety as measured by:
a) Time to access failure, defined as thrombosis or fistula requiring revision
b) Number of discrete episodes of access failure, defined as above.
c) Episodes of septicaemia defined as blood culture positive septic episode with no defined focal source.
d) Difference in survival between the two groups</outcome>
      <timepoint>Continuous from baseline to 48 months after commencement of treatment. Survival will also be measured access to site Australia and New Zealand Dialyis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) data at 60 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Durability of the intervention (whether the patient remains on the assigned intervention)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured directly at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after randomisation and at 60 months by site access to ANZDATA data.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life outcomes
Analyses will be performed in participants with sufficient language skills to self-complete a written questionnaire and will include:
a) Change in quality of life from baseline months as measured by the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-SF1.3) instrument 
b) Change in quality of life from baseline  as measured by the EurolQol (EQ-5D) instrument</outcome>
      <timepoint>6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months after randomisation</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The reduction in quality of life and illness burden experienced by people with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) is exacerbated by the condition of uraemic neuropathy. Uraemic neuropathy affects between 60 and 100% of people with ESKD and can lead to loss of function as well as discomfort or pain. It is progressive with no specific cures or methods of retarding progression other than transplantation.
The FINESSE study will compare the effect of haemodiafiltration and standard haemodialysis with high-flux membranes on the development and progression of uraemic neuropathy.</summary>
