  <interventions>
    <interventions>Continuous positive airway pressure treatment (CPAP); a one session group cognitive behavioural therapy intervention to promote CPAP acceptance and adherence, duration approximately 1 hour; and a 1 hour social reciprocity control treatment to assess if time spent with individuals increases CPAP acceptance and adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>Social Reciprocity  this control is designed to determine the influence of social support on CPAP acceptance and adherence. During the social reciprocity session participants will be shown a video on sleep and healthy lifestyle and information on how to contact local CPAP support groups will be provided. Tea and coffee will be served to participants after the video and there will be an opportunity to talk with other participants.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants recruited from sleep clinics at the Royal Prince Alfred and Royal North Shore Hospitals, individuals who have been diagnosed with OSA following polysomnography and who have elected to undergo CPAP treatment will be invited to take part in the present study.
Consenting participants were randomised to in hospital CPAP titration or home autoCPAP titration. Allocation was concealed using sealed opaque envelopes which were opened following participant consent and prior to treatment as usual session.
Following treatment as usual for CPAP participants were randomised to CBT or Social Reciprocity (SR). Sealed opaque envelopes containing treatment allocation were opened following completion of treatment as usual.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder which is commonly treated with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Up to 50% of individuals either do not take their CPAP treatments home or are not using them at 6 months. Preliminary data from CPAP patients found significantly increased uptake and usage &gt;4hours each night with a Cognitive behavioural therapy CBT) intervention. Our aim is to compare TAU with the addition of a CBT intervention to TAU with the addition of Social Reciprocity to determine the effectiveness of CBT in improving CPAP treatment acceptance and adherence in OSA sufferers</summary>
