  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants are older adults who are undergoing standard care total hip and knee replacement. They will be assessed  on three occasions: approx 2 weeks pre-surgery, 2 weeks post-surgery, 6 months post-surgery. They will be assessed on their cognitive function(baseline and 2nd follow-up only), depression, anxiety, quality of life, pain and cognitive reserve (baseline only).</interventions>
    <comparator>Patient scores will be compared with those of healthy controls at all follow-up assessments. Healthy controls will consist of spouses, close friends or siblings of the patients, so will be similar with regard to age, SES and education. They cannot have undergone invasive surgery within the previous 6 months, or during the current study. They will be assessed along the same time frame as the patients.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive dysfunction: determined through a significant decline in performance on a battery of neuropsychological tests. This decline has to be independent from any time-related confounds, and will be determined through standardised regression-based methodology.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to examine the incidence of cognitive and affective problems after joint replacement surgery. These outcomes will also be placed into context of post-surgical pain and quality of life. The potential moderating role of cognitive reserve will also be assessed. 
The specific aims of the study are to:
a)	Define the incidence of short- and long-term cognitive dysfunction, depression and anxiety following joint replacement surgery.
b)	Determine the potential moderating role of reserve on these poorer outcomes.
c)	Identify the predictors of these poorer outcomes, with specific reference to quality of life, pain, and chronic medical conditions
