             swollen joints (66 joint count) and at least eight tender joints (68 joint count) at
             Screening and Baseline (Day 1), and either an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of
             &gt; 28 mm/hour OR a CRP level &gt; 1.0 mg/dL (normal: &lt; 0.4 mg/dL) at Screening. Patients
             must have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional DMARD therapy
             including at least one TNF inhibitor.

          3. Positive for RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies.

          4. Current treatment for RA on an outpatient basis:

               1. Must be currently receiving and tolerating oral or parenteral MTX therapy at a
                  dose of 15-25 mg per week (dose may be as low as 10 mg per week if the patient is
                  unable to tolerate a higher dose) for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to Day
                  1. The dose should be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 until Week 24.
                  After Week 24 the administration route can be changed at the investigator's
                  discretion.

                  local practice) or equivalent during the entire study (mandatory co-medication
                  for MTX treatment).

               3. Biologic agents and DMARDs (other than MTX) must be withdrawn at least 2 weeks
                  prior to Day 1, except azathioprine and etanercept which must be withdrawn at
                  least 4 weeks prior to Day 1; abatacept, adalimumab, anakinra, certolizumab,
                  infliximab, and golimumab at least 8 weeks prior to Day 1; tocilizumab at least

               5. If receiving current treatment with oral corticosteroids (other than
                  intra-articular or parenteral), the dose must not exceed 10 mg/day prednisolone
                  or equivalent. During the 4 weeks prior to Baseline (Day 1) the dose must remain
                  stable.

               6. Intra-articular and parenteral corticosteroids are not permitted within 6 weeks
                  prior to Baseline Day 1 or throughout the trial, with the exception of IV
                  administration of 100 mg methylprednisolone 30 to 60 minutes prior to each
                  infusion as this is part of the trial procedures.

               7. Any concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be stable for
                  at least 2 weeks prior to Day 1.

               8. Patients may be taking oral hydroxychloroquine provided that the dose is not
                  greater than 400 mg/day or chloroquine provided that the dose is not greater than
                  250 mg/day. These doses must have been stable for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to
                  Day 1. The hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment will need to be continued
                  at a stable dose with the same formulation until the end of the trial.

          5. For participants of reproductive potential (males and females), use of a reliable
             means of contraception (e.g., hormonal contraceptive, patch, intrauterine device,
             physical barrier) has to be used throughout trial participation. Females of
             child-bearing potential must also agree to use an acceptable method of contraception
             for 12 months following completion or discontinuation from the trial.</inclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The primary objectives of this trial are (1) To show PK (Pharmacokinetic) similarity of BI
      695500 to rituximab. (2)To establish statistical equivalence of efficacy of BI 695500 and
      rituximab, in patients with moderately to severely active RA (Rheumatoid Arthritis), based on
      the change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) score measured at 24 weeks compared to
      Baseline and the American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response rate at Week 24.</summary>
