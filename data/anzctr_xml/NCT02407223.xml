    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Group 1: Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Group 2: Ustekinumab 45 mg
Treatment: drugs - Group 3: Ustekinumab 90 mg

Placebo Comparator: Group 1: Placebo - Participants will receive placebo subcutaneously (SC) at Weeks 0, 4, 16, and 20. At Week 24, all participants (except those who early escaped) will crossover to receive ustekinumab 45 or 90 milligram (mg) SC at Weeks 24 and 28 followed by every 12 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 16, participants in placebo group with &lt; 10% improvement from baseline in both total back pain and morning stiffness measures at Week 12 and 16 will enter early escape to receive ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg at Weeks 16, 20, and 28 followed by every 12 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at both Week 40 and 52 will be re-randomized to receive placebo or ustekinumab every 12 weeks up to Week 88. At Week 52, participants who did not achieve inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at Week 40 or 52 will continue with ustekinumab every 12 weeks up to Week 88. NOTE: Intervention Description should have no more than 800 characters.

Experimental: Group 2: Ustekinumab 45 milligram (mg) - Participants will receive ustekinumab 45 mg subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every 12 weeks through Week 52. At Weeks 20 and 24, participants will receive placebo subcutaneously to maintain the blind. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at both Week 40 and Week 52 will be re-randomized to receive either placebo or ustekinumab 45 mg every 12 weeks in a blinded fashion. At Week 52, participants who did not achieve inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at Week 40 or Week 52 will continue receiving ustekinumab 45 mg every 12 weeks through Week 88.

Experimental: Group 3: Ustekinumab 90 mg - Participants will receive ustekinumab 90 mg subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4, followed by every four weeks through Week 52. At Weeks 20 and 24, participants will receive placebo subcutaneously to maintain the blind. At Week 52, participants who achieved inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at both Week 40 and Week 52 will receive either placebo or ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks in a blinded fashion. At Week 52, participants who did not achieve inactive disease by ASDAS (ESR) &lt;1.3 at Week 40 or Week 52 will continue receiving ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks through Week 88.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) 20 Score at Week 24 - The ASAS measures symptomatic improvement in Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) participants in 4 domains: participant global assessment of disease activity, pain, function, inflammation. ASAS 20 = 20 percent (%) improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;= 10 units on a 0-10 scale (0=no disease activity; 10=high disease activity) for &gt;= 3 domains, and no worsening in remaining domain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving ASAS 40 at Weeks 24 - The ASAS 40 = 40% improvement from baseline and an absolute change &gt;= 20 units on a 0-10 scale (0=no disease activity, 10=high disease activity) for &gt;= 3 domains, and no worsening in remaining domain.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 50 Response - The BASDAI is participant assessment of discomfort, pain and fatigue measured using a 10 centimeter Visual Analog Scale (VAS); range: 0=none to 10=very severe. BASDAI 50 response is defined as at least a 50 percent (%) improvement (decrease) from baseline to observation in the BASDAI score. Baseline score minus score at observation divided by Baseline score * 100 should be &gt;=50%.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participant Who Achieve ASDAS (CRP) Inactive Disease (&lt;1.3) at Week 24 - The ASDAS-CRP was derived from back pain, duration of morning stiffness, patient global score and peripheral pain/swelling. The scores were categorized as follows : inactive disease(&lt; 1.3), moderate (1.3 - &lt; 2.1), high (2.1 - 3.5) and very high disease activity ( &gt; 3.5).</outcome>
