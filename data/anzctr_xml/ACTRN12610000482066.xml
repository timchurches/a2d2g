  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a multi-centre randomised controlled double-blind trial evaluating the effectiveness of one agent unlicensed for this indication versus placebo with best supportive care (BSC) rescue in both arms, in improving the management of refractory nausea in patients with advanced cancer. 
The interventions will be administered in a 3-step escalated dosing schedule over 72 hours. Treatment period is 3x24 hour periods. The daily dosing schedule is fixed. All syringes will be identical and prepared by the pharmacists according to the randomisation schedule. Treatment allocation will not be disclosed to study staff, treating clinicians or investigators. The last dose must be given at least 6 hours prior to each response assessment. All doses will be administered subcutaneously or intravenously. 
The mode of administration will be determined by the clinician based on patient characteristics. BSC rescue therapy will be available in both arms over the 72 hours. BSC is defined as any Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) approved antiemetic or combination of PBS approved antiemetics at any dose or route thought appropriate by the investigator, given as required (prn) for nausea control. Each patient will have access to laxatives according to the practice of the treating clinician.

Arm1 Levomepromazine (methotrimeprazine, Nozinan Registered Trademark (R)). 3.125mg-9.375mg per 24 hours delivered subcutaneously or intravenously in multiples of 3.125mg/2ml. Treatment period: 3 X 24 hours. Day 1= single dose at 0 hours (3.125mg) Day 2 (after 24 hours) = twice daily (6.25mg/24hours) Day 3 (after 48 hours) = 3 times per day (9.375mg/24 hours). Patients will be followed up for a maximum of 4 weeks after the primary endpoint for ongoing nausea control and safety. </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2 Normal saline 2ml - 6ml will be administered in multiples of 2ml subcutaneously or intravenously with BSC rescue as required. Treatment period = 3 X 24 hours. Day 1= single dose at 0 hours (2ml), Day 2 (after 24 hours) = twice daily (4ml/24 hours), Day 3 (after 48 hours) = 3 times per day (6ml/24 hours).</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients under the care or shared care of the palliative care team and all potential participants attending clinic will be screened by the study nurse for their suitability to enter the study in consultation with the treating clinician and nursing staff. The study nurse will ask the clinician in charge for permission to approach potentially eligible participants. This referral will be recorded within both the Case Report Form (CRF) and the participant clinical file. After checking with the clinical team to make sure the person meets the broad criteria for consideration of eligibility, that the person has given explicit permission to be seen by a researcher, and is well enough to be approached,the study nurse will introduce themself to the person and explain the study. If participants are suitable for entry and prepared to consent to the study, they will undergo baseline assessments and assessment of eligibility criteria. 

The central registry will supply the schedule tables to the dispensing pharmacy for allocation. Following changes to the protocol, the randomisation schedules supplied to sites will continue to be used. However, when an allocation to the ondansetron arm is drawn, this will be put aside and a new allocation selected until one of the included arms (levomepromazine or placebo) is drawn. The pharmacy manual reflects the Protocol changes and revised randomisation allocation. 

Pharmacy will be contacted whenever a person is to commence study 2 to warn them of a potential participant. The randomisation request will take the form of the prescription of the study medicines. The site clinical trials pharmacist will prepare the study drugs for the patient according to the allocation determined in the supplied schedule (as per the revised allocation method), and label the intervention providing the details as described above. The allocation will be recorded on the schedule along with the date of allocation, the signature of the pharmacist preparing the syringe and the patient ID number. Participant randomisation will be registered with the coordinating site. PaCCSC has a Standard Operating Procedure for Randomisation, this procedure is to be followed. In summary, the procedure outlines that on randomisation of a patient, the site pharmacy is to fax a notification to the coordinating site. This notice will be monitored alongside the patient eligibility as entered onto the on-line data base from the eligibility CRF. The allocation will be recorded on the schedule along with the date of allocation, the signature of the pharmacist preparing the syringe and the patient ID number.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation schedules have been developed for each site using random number tables, generated at an independent centre (central registry). Originally, treatment for each patient was allocated according to a block randomisation schedule held by the central registry in a 1:1:1 ratio. Block randomisation within centre will ensure even allocation to each code in each site. 
Removal of one arm of the study has necessitated a revision to the allocation process, as described in the previous section, effectively producing a 1:1 ratio. Any new schedules generated by the central registry for additional sites will be in a 1:1 ratio.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be done on an intention-to-treat basis. Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be generated from the patients demographic and clinical characteristics. The null hypothesis will be tested initially, using chi-square tests of differences in response rates between treatments. The success of randomisation will be considered; a preliminary analysis of differences between treatment groups will be carried out using chi-square tests to ensure comparability of covariates and factors, including centres. With respect to these baseline variables, any statistically significant differences will be controlled for in the main analyses, using logistic regression to fit the binary outcome of response to treatment, although based on data from our previous study we anticipate that the associated centre effect is negligible with respect to individuals nausea trajectories (the primary outcomes). 

Regression modelling of the incidence of refractive nausea and of nausea scores over time, and the impact of the intervention on these trends, will be undertaken implementing a generalised estimating equations approach to (i) adjust for confounding variables including centres, and (ii) to ensure that individuals with missing data over time may be included as far as their data permit. An independent working correlations matrix will be assumed initially (and conservatively), although it is plausible that an exchangeable correlations matrix will be appropriate in this context, and produce models of better fit, which will be established. Multiple linear regression models will be fitted to the continuously-scaled nausea score variable and binary logistic regression models for the dichotomous outcome of refractory nausea. The primary outcomes of interest are based on a priori hypotheses, with each endpoint being considered separately in the analysis.  Results will be expressed as prevalence rates, adjusted mean changes or adjusted odds ratios, with associated 95% confidence intervals. 

Allowing for 50% attrition, it is anticipated that 272 participants, (136 per treatment arm), will be randomized to achieve a sample size of 68 participants per arm. It is expected some patients will follow on from Study 1, but the majority will be de novo patients. This sample size is adequate to detect a statistically significant difference in response rates between study arms with 85% power, assuming a simple random sampling scheme and a Type 1 error of 5% (two-tailed). The sample size is also sufficient for adjusted multivariable analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In some cases, nausea remains refractory to treatment despite multiple lines of treatment, often in combination. This is a randomised controlled double-blind trial evaluating the effectiveness of one drug (levomepromazine) against placebo with rescue antiemetics (BSC) in both arms in patients with nausea that has been demonstrated to be refractory to standard guideline driven targeted antiemetic therapy or single agent therapy with haloperidol. This test drug has not yet been rigorously evaluated in this setting and does not yet have a registered indication for use in palliative care. The hypothesis to be tested is that for cancer patients with nausea not related to anticancer treatment, there is no difference in response at 72 hours to levomepromazine versus a placebo with rescue antiemetics. Response to treatment is defined as a minimum two point improvement from baseline and end score &lt;3 on an 11 point (0-10) numeric rating scale for average nausea in the previous 24 hours, measured 72 hours after treatment. </summary>
