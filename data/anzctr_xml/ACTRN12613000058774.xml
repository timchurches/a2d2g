  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mitotane dose adjustment based on plasma level of mitotane and metabolites, to achieve ideal mitotane plasma level (14-20 mg/L) as quickly as possible, and minimise adverse impact of overdosing. (Mitotane is administered orally daily in single or divided doses, starting at 1 or 2 g/day,and the dose required is highly variable and unpredictable). Treatment duration is at the discretion of the treating clinician.</interventions>

- we will correlate mitotane and metabolite pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with phenotypic factors, including age, gender and body mass index. We anticipate that age, gender and body mass index will partly correlate with PK.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To provide a precise mitotane therapeutic drug monitoring process that rapidly achieves trough levels in the range 14-20mg/L, by frequent, informed dose escalation.

    <statisticalmethods>Simple statistical tests (chi square, Pearson correlation, etc) will be used to determine the relationship between mitotane and metabolite levels and toxicity, and confirm the published relationship with response.

To identify factors that account for variability in mitotane kinetics, mitotane and metabolite pharmacokinetic parameters will be correlated with phenotypic factors, including age, gender and body mass index. A PD model for toxicity will be derived using independent variables of dose, plasma level and patient characteristics. WinNonLin, Statistica or similar non-linear modeling software will be used.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mitotane is the only systemic treatment available for advanced adrenocortical cancer and is toxic, with variable pharmacokinetics (variable drug metabolism between patients). This study aims to achieve ideal plasma levels of the drug quickly by adjustment of the dose based on plasma level, and maintain the plasma level within the ideal range by regular blood level monitoring and dose adjustment. We also aim to study factors that contribute to variability between patients in their metabolism of the drug, and confirm a relationship between drug level and anticancer effect. As a consequence of this study we aim to provide a high quality therapeutic drug monitoring service for clinicians and patients with this disease in Australia.</summary>
