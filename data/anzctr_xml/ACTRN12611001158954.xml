  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of a tailored exercise program in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a man with prostate cancer with diagnosed bone metastases.

Trial details.
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. One group will undergo supervised exercise training. This involves resistance, aerobic (stationary cycling) and flexibility exercises, three times per week over a period of 3 months and then will be monitored (without training) for a further 3 months. The other group will be assigned to no treatment for the first 3 months. After this time participants in this group will commence the exercise program for the next 3 months.

Participants will complete some tests of physical function and questionnaires about fatigue, pain and physical activity levels, and have their body composition measured at these time points. It is thought that the exercise program will be safe and will improve physical function when compared to no training.</summary>
