  <interventions>
    <interventions>The comparison of two dressings in current use - Group 1 -a biosynthetic silicone and nylon fabric bound with porcine collagen (Biobrane) will be dressed with biobrane and acticoat (as per the standard practise) . Dressings will be changed once per week for two weeks at which point a decision will be made regarding the need for grafting (as per the standard practise); Group 2 will have a nano-crystalline silver antimicrobial barrier dressing (Acticoat). This dressing will also be chnaged once per week for two weeks at which point a decision will be made as to whether skin grafting is necessary (as per the standard practise)</interventions>
    <comparator>In this study there will not be a group which does not receive treatement as patients will all have burns that require some form of treatment or dressing. Therefore the control group is active, ie biobrane group will be compared to acticoat group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of wound depth will be an objective measure using a laser doppler scanner. The outcome measure of rate of epitheliasation ie wound healing unfortunatley does remain the clinician's subjective assessment and has been a limiting step for research in this field. Experience is highly relevant for a reliable assessment [1]  therefore all burns inlcuded in the study will be assessed by either the Burns Fellow or Burns Staff Specialist. Then correlation of the subjective evaluation of two observers will also be used to imporve the reliability of the assessment. We may also use a Evaporimeter (pending acquisition of the machine) , a device that measures the healing endpoint based on the regeneration of the water loss barrier. This is a simple non invasive way of objectively measuring healing endpoint and has been shown to be an accurate tool [2].

Prior to entry into the study, written consent will be obtained by all patients or their guardians. After consent has been obtained, participants will be randomised into two groups. Group one will be dressed with Biobrane and acticoat and Group two will be dressed with acticoat alone. allocation will be concealed by randomisation by computer .

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will randomise all patients with 5-15% mid dermal burns attending the BPTC for first review with LDI confirmation of a mid-dermal burn into two groups; Group 1 will have Biobrane and Acticoat dressings to burn wounds and group 2 will have the regularly used acticoat dressings alone, in the conventional manner.  Burns will undergo standard ward hydrodebridement or OT hydrodebridement (if necessary for analgesia). Biobrane will be secured with hypafix on the ward or rarely, if necessary in OT with staples. Both groups will then be reviewed at regular dressing changes according to the usual practise at CHW for whichever Acticoat is used. Biobrane will be removed at D14 and decision on healing made then clinically and with a Vapourometer. Scar outcome and need for grafting will be assessed as well as cost effectiveness, healing time and amount of pain at dressing changes.  We feel that this study may improve clinical care by providing evidence to support the use of Biobrane and the benefits to its use will in the long term outweigh the extra costs involved.</summary>
