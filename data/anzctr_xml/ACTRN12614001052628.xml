  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI) is believed to represent a transition period between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease. People with a-MCI experience problems with their memory without it impacting on their daily functioning. As a-MCI represents a stage prior to irreversible neurodegeneration, it is important from a therapeutic perspective that neural changes occurring in a-MCI are determined in order to see if there remains potential for response to treatment. 

Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to re-organize its function in response to the environment. One aspect of this is known as long-term potentiation (LTP), which is imperative in learning and memory. LTP-like plasticity can be induced through brain stimulation techniques including transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Application of tDCS through a gentle electrical current can increase brain activity as measured through electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioural outcomes. When transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is applied in combination with EEG, the cortical excitability of the stimulated and surrounding brain regions can be determined. This provides information about the LTP-like plasticity that is present. Together with cognitive performance, this information can help to determine the changes occurring in a-MCI compared to younger and older adults, and the relationships between plasticity and cognition.

The aim of our study is to investigate whether LTP can be induced in a-MCI and if there are differences in LTP-like plasticity compared to younger and older healthy adults, and the relationship of plasticity to cognitive performance.
