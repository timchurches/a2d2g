  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to develop a greater understanding of amphetamine withdrawal and whether medication, such as modafinil, is effective in the management of amphetamine withdrawal in an inpatient setting. Participants will be randomised to a single morning dose of modafinil or matching placebo. Participants will receive medication for seven days (tapering doses from 200mg to 100mg). The two treatment groups will be compared for their symptoms of amphetamine withdrawal, including symptoms of depression and sleep disturbance, neuro-cognitive function, as well as any potential side effects from the medication. Other outcome measures will include retention in treatment and monitoring the rate of relapse to amphetamine use post withdrawal. This information will then inform guidelines for withdrawal management, including psychosocial and medical aspects. The protocol will be distilled for a clinical audience and include principles and practice, practice guidelines and recommendations for implementation</summary>
