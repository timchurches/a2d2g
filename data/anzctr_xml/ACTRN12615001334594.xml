  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study, the exposure is acquisition of brain images using fMRI. 
Sacral nerve stimulator is a pacemaker like device implanted in the buttock and connected to leads that are placed in the S3 or S4 foramina percutaneously. 
fMRI involves acquisition of images whilst providing a visceral stimulus i.e. rectal balloon distension. This is performed at baseline and 6 weeks post device implantation.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sacral Nerve Stimulation(SNS) has revolutionised the management of urinary and faecal incontinence over the past 20 years. SNS is now embraced worldwide as a first line treatment for patients with urinary and faecal incontinence in whom conservative measures have failed. However, despite extensive experience with the stimulator and research in the field, its mechanism(s) of action remains elusive. Recently it has been suggested that SNS works by changing the way the brain functions by 'restarting' its normal function, akin to 'restarting a computer'. In this study we aim to lend scientific support for this hypothesis by investigating the impact of SNS on brain function using functional MRI (fMRI). </summary>
