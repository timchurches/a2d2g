  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will investigate the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatments following surgical removal of part or whole of one lung, its purpose being to assess whether patients require physiotherapy treatment after their surgery, specifically considering: 
a. Whether physiotherapy is effective in reducing postoperative lung complications  
b. Whether physiotherapy is effective in preventing postoperative shoulder problems  
c. How the above impact upon length of hospital stay, quality of life and ability to perform everyday activities.
This will be investigated by undertaking a trial in which patients will be allocated to either:
a. A group receiving supervision of postoperative breathing and shoulder/trunk exercises
b. A group receiving a physiotherapy information sheet but no physiotherapy supervision of postoperative breathing and shoulder/trunk exercises
Measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy treatments will be:
a. Incidence of lung complications
b. Shoulder complications (including shoulder movement, muscle strength and level of function in daily activities)
c. Quality of life questionnaire
d. Length of stay
 All patients will be given a preoperative physiotherapy exercise and advice sheet. Treatment group patients will be seen by a physiotherapist daily during their postoperative stay and  respiratory and musculoskeletal interventions administered/supervised. They will be given an individualised exercise sheet upon discharge.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group patients will receive no physiotherapy but recieve usual care from nursing and medical staff and encourge to perform exercises from their preoperative sheet. All  patients will be assessed pre operatively, daily whilst  inpatients, at discharge from hospital and and 1/12 and 3/12 post hospital discharge</comparator>
