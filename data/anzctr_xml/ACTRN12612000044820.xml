  <interventions>
    <interventions>This audit will examine the pain experienced by children following the most common procedures performed at Princess Margaret Hospital under general anaesthesia. We have selected the 36 common groups of procedures and are recruiting 50 patients in each group. The surgical groups include Ear, Nose and Throat, Urology, Orthopaedic, Gastro-Intestinal, Dental and miscellaneous general surgery. 
The audit involves a telephone follow up interview after informed verbal consent has been obtained. The audit questions include questions on issues regarding pain management, post operative nausea, vomiting and pain frequency and treatment and parental rating of overall treatment. The parents will be contacted a few days after surgery and then followed up until they return to normal activity.</interventions>
