The treatment adminstered is Ranibizumab (Lucentis) intravitreal injection, 0.5 mg/0.5 ml administered monthly for 3 months then monthly as required judged by the medical officer for up to 12 months.
Subtenons Triamcinalone injection(Kenacort-A 40) 40 mg/1 ml will be administered immediately after the first dose of Ranibizumab,then not more than 4 monthly as required there after, for up to 12 months as judged by the medical officer.</interventions>
    <comparator>All patients will be treated with intravitreal Ranibizumab injection (Lucentis) 0.5mg/0.05ml each month for 3 months.
At baseline all subjects will be randomised to receive subtenons triamcinalone 40mg/1ml or a sham subtenons injection of normal saline at time of diagnosis, immediately following Ranibizumab injection,on a 4 monthly as required, basis thereafter.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate a treatment regimen of variable-dosing ranibizumab and regular subtenons triamcinalone (STTA) for exudative age related macular degeneration. Our aim is to reduce the number of intravitreal injections required with the same or better visual outcome as currently accepted treatment regimens.</summary>
