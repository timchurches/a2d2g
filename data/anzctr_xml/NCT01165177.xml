  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this observer-blind study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals' candidate Herpes Zoster (HZ) vaccine in adults aged = 50
      years.

      Two studies [ZOSTER-006 (NCT01165177) and ZOSTER-022 (NCT01165229)] are being conducted
      concurrently to evaluate efficacy of GSK1437173A vaccine. A pooled analysis of data from both
      studies combined will be conducted contingent on each study achieving its objectives. The
      protocol posting of study ZOSTER-022 also deals with the outcome measures related to the
      pooled analysis.</summary>
