  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1)an immediate treatment group, or; 2) a delayed waitlist control group (beginning 9 weeks after the immediate treatment group begin.  Participants will receive access to an 8 week internet-based treatment program.All participants will have at least mild symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7 total score &gt;7). All participants will complete 5 lessons of Internet based treatment about management of symptoms of anxiety and stress. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to complete. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with anxiety, taking a further 20 minutes per week. All participants will also receive automatic emails and brief weekly (&lt;10minutes week) supportive telephone calls from a clinical psychologist. 

Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-treatment, post-treatment, at 3-months post-treatment.  These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete. The treatment materials are based on the Wellbeing Program, which teaches evidence-based cognitive behavioural skills.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to explore whether a clinician-guided treatment program can help to reduce anxiety symptoms in a population of mature adults (aged 60-75), when administered over the internet. A secondary purpose is to determine how acceptable people find this form of treatment. The study will inform how services can best improve future treatment programs for mature adults with anxiety.</summary>
