    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Type, frequency, severity and relationship of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events to pomalidomide - An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject's health, including laboratory test values, regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) should be considered an AE</outcome>

Pulmonary function tests will be assessed at multiple time points by a central vendor throughout the study. Spirometry assessments will include the following parameters: - FVC: Volume of air that can forcibly be blown out after full inspiration - Forced expiratory volume (FEV)1: Maximum volume of air that can forcibly be blown out in the first second during the FVC maneuver, measured in liters (will only be assessed at Screening)</outcome>

      <outcome>Change from Baseline (Week 0) of the modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) at Week 52 - Improvement in skin thickening is associated with improved survival and may be useful as a surrogate measurement in clinical studies. The mRSS is an assessment tool which is used to evaluate the extent and severity of the skin thickening associated with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). Seventeen body areas are evaluated on a 4-point scale (0 [normal], 1 [mild], 2 [moderate], or 3 [severe]). The total score, which is the sum of the 17 individual body assessments, can range from 0 to 51.</outcome>

Individual scales include, Reflux, Distention/Bloating, Fecal Soilage, Diarrhea, Social functioning, Emotional well-being and Constipation. The items are scored on a 0 to 3 range, where 0 indicates better health and 3 indicates worse health (except for Questions 15 and 31 which are scored as 0 (better health) or 1 (worse health). In addition to the 7 scale scores, scores from 6 of the 7 scales (excluding constipation) can be combined to form a total GIT score.

The TDI is an evaluative instrument that includes specific criteria for each of three components to measure changes from a baseline state. At baseline, dyspnea is rated using five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired) for each category to form a baseline score (0 - 12). During the transition period, the TDI assesses changes in dyspnea using seven grades ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). The ratings for each of the three categories are then added to form a total transition focal score (range, -9 to +9).</outcome>
