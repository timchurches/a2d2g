  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Canakinumab 150 mg
Treatment: drugs - Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to canakinumab
Treatment: drugs - Placebo to triamcinolone acetonide

Experimental: Canakinumab 150 mg - Patients received 1 subcutaneous (sc) injection of canakinumab 150 mg and 1 intramuscular (im) injection of placebo to triamcinolone acetonide on Day 1. Patients could receive re-dose of study drug on demand upon occurrence of new flares, but re-dosing could not occur until 14 days had elapsed after previous dose. Patients completing 12 weeks core study were allowed to continue treatment in another 12-week extension for any new gout flare on demand with same treatment as assigned in core study.
After completing the first extension, patients were offered to enter second extension study, whereby all patients were treated open-label "on demand" with canakinumab 150 mg sc upon new flare for 1 year for a total duration of 18 months following randomization in core study. Patients completing first 12 weeks extension study were allowed to continue to be treated in another single-arm, open-label 48 weeks extension when all patients from both treatment arms received canakinumab on demand

Active Comparator: Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg - Patients received 1 intramuscular (im) injection of triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg and 1 subcutaneous (sc) injection of placebo to canakinumab on Day 1. Patients could receive a re-dose of study drug on demand upon the occurrence of new flares, but re-dosing could not occur until 14 days had elapsed after the previous dose. Patients completing the 12 weeks core study were allowed to continue to be treated in another 12 weeks extension study for any new gout flare on demand with the same treatment as assigned in the core study.
Patients under this arm who agreed to continue to 2nd extension period of 12 months, were switched to canakinumab 150 mg sc for any new gout flare during this period Triamcinolone acetonide was not to be administered in the 48-week session.


Treatment: drugs: Canakinumab 150 mg
Canakinumab 150 mg was supplied in 6 mL glass vials each containing nominally 150 mg canakinumab (plus 20% overfill).

Treatment: drugs: Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg
Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg was supplied as a suspension.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to canakinumab
Placebo to canakinumab was supplied in 6 mL glass vials containing placebo powder as a lyophilized cake.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo to triamcinolone acetonide
Placebo triamcinolone acetonide was supplied as a lipid emulsion similar in appearance to triamcinolone acetonide.

      <outcome>SF36 Physical Function Score at Week 12 - The SF-36 measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life (QoL). This 36-item survey has 8 subscales that can be aggregated into physical- and mental-component summary scores. Scores are standardized with the use of norm-based methods based on an assessment of the general U.S. population free of chronic conditions. Scores range from 1-100 with a mean=50 and a standard deviation=10. A higher score indicates less impact on QoL. A negative change score indicates improvement. An ANCOVA model was used with treatment group and baseline SF-36 physical function subscore as covariates.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the 12-week core study was to demonstrate that canakinumab given upon acute
      gout flares relieves the signs and symptoms and prevents recurrence of gout flares in
      patients with frequent flares of gout for whom non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      and/ or colchicine are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective. The efficacy of
      canakinumab was compared to the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide.

      The purpose of the first 12-week extension study was to collect additional safety,
      tolerability and efficacy data in patients who have completed the core study CACZ885H2356.

      The purpose of the second 48 week open-label extension study was to collect additional
      long-term safety and tolerability data in patients who have completed the first extension
      study CACZ885H2356E1.</summary>
