  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This single dose, randomized, open-label, 6 sequence, 3-period, crossover study will evaluate
      the relative bioavailability of danoprevir and ritonavir in healthy volunteers. In Part 1,
      subjects will be randomized to receive single oral doses of one of three tablet formulations
      of danoprevir plus the reference ritonavir formulation, with an at least 7-day washout
      between periods. In Part 2, subjects will be randomized to receive single oral doses of one
      of three tablet formulations of ritonavir plus the reference formulation of danoprevir, with
      at least a 7-day washout betwen periods. The anticipated time on study is up to 30 days.</summary>
