  <interventions>
    <interventions>A protocol guided strategy for administering bolus fluid utilising stroke volume variation to limit fluid administration to those likely to be fluid responsive. 
Once the patient returns to the ICU following cardiac surgery, bedside staff - nursing and medical - will utilise a protocol to guide fluid administration. If the clinician suspects the patient to have a known or suspected inadequate cardiac output (i.e. the cardiac index is &lt; 2.5L/min/m2; poor perfusion;poor urine output) and the stroke volume variation (SVV) is &gt;13 then they will be instructed to administer a fluid bolus of 250mls of crystalloid or colloid as determined by the treating clinician. If the SVV is &lt;13 then the treating clinician should consider using vasopressors to maintain or improve cardiac output. Type of vasopressor and dose will be determined by the treating clinician. The protocol will continue until the patient is desedated and extubated or they reach 24 hours post-operative if still mechanically ventilated. Deviations from the protocol will be collected by the research nurses at each site.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants receive fluid administration as determined by the bedside clinician.
Standard fluid administration postoperatively in the ICU - fluid boluses administered by the treating clinician based on blood pressure, central venous pressure etc. These boluses are usually 250 - 500mls per bolus and depend on the treating clinician.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were based on findings from our pilot study in which there was a median difference in ICU hours between treatment and intervention arms that was greater than 20 hours. Based on an observed standard deviation of 56, with 590 participants this study will have a 90% power (2 sided p-value=0.05) to detect a 15 hour difference and an 80% power (2 sided p-value=0.05) to detect a 13 hour difference in ICU hours. Differences of this magnitude are both conservative in comparison to what we have previously observed and clinically relevant as they will enable participants to be discharged from the ICU on or before the morning of the second post-operative day, enabling a new participant to be admitted on that day and thus resolving a principal barrier to increasing cardiac surgical participant throughput. By recruiting a total of 700 participants, we further allow for inflation due to one interim analysis,  a 3% drop-out rate and 15% for potential non-normality in ICU LOS.
All data will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle. Data will be tested for normality prior to analysis. Between-group comparisons for continuous data will be performed by means of Students t or Mann-Whitney U tests - as appropriate - or for categorical data with the chi-square test. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance. Data will be entered into an electronic database at the study site and extracted into SAS version 9.4 for analysis. Subgroup analysis will be undertaken by type of surgery and centre.
One blinded interim analysis will be conducted when fifty percent of participants have been enrolled and subsequently discharged from the ICU. This data will be made available to the DSMB for the purposes of safety assessment. 
A formal statistical analysis plan will be published prior to the final analysis.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in New Zealand and a significant burden on the health system economically and socially. High cancellation rates for cardiac surgery are a significant issue in New Zealand due to lack of access to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds. This is an NZ health delivery issue and major concern for participants, clinicians and policy makers. 
Cardiac surgical participants are frequently treated with fluid in the ICU to prevent development of organ dysfunction. However fluid administration may also have deleterious effects including an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. We have demonstrated previously that a strategy designed to avoid unnecessary fluid administration significantly reduces fluid loading and ICU length of stay. This randomised controlled trial aims to determine if a protocolised strategy avoiding unnecessary fluid administration reduces ICU length of stay, overcoming a major bottleneck to effective delivery of cardiac surgery in NZ, and improves participant-centred outcomes.  </summary>
