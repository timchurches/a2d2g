  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two spinal ultrasound workshops were conducted and supervised 1 week apart by 2 experienced spinal ultrasonographers. They had 3 months of intensive supervised training by the principle investigator (4 years experience in performing and teaching novices spinal ultrasound) prior to commencement of the study. Each workshop comprised of an explicit teaching intervention (20 minutes), practice period (40 minutes) and videorecorded assessment period(20 minutes).
Explicit teaching intervention:Prior to initiating the study we developed and trialed a standardized explicit 10-step training programme called the 10 easy steps of performing spinal ultrasound based on the technique described by Carvalho et al. and modifying it to avoid some of the problems commonly encountered while learning the skill, as defined by Margarido et al. Standardized explicit (didactic) spinal ultrasound training method was taught explicitly for 20 minutes via a didactic sequential step-by-step approach.This included a 10 minute narrated PowerPoint presentation and a 10 minute demonstration of the 10 easy steps of performing spinal ultrasound.</interventions>

Each workshop comprised of an implicit teaching intervention (20 minutes), practice period (40 minutes) and videorecorded assessment period(20 minutes). 
Implicit teaching intervention: Prior to study commencement we developed a 20 minute implicit training programme of spinal ultrasound similar to the technique described by Carvalho J et al. and Margarido et al. The teaching method was finalized after consensus by the investigators, and were trailed on two trainees who did not participate in the study.The implicit teaching method taught the technique practically without verbally referring to the 10-steps.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Global Rating Scale (GRS) score:GRS consisted of a 5-point scale that used seven-item behavioural descriptors (maximum score 40), and focused on the measuring the overall performance of the trainee rather than the specifics of the manual tasks. The GRS was chosen as it has been previously validated for objectively evaluating different anaesthesia skills.</outcome>

      <outcome>Task specific checklist(TCL) score: The TCL consisted of 10 prespecified items which were rated on a scale of 0-2 (where 0=task not performed, 1=poorly performed and 2=well performed) (maximum score 20). This secondary outcome objectively measured the specifics of performing the manual spinal ultrasound tasks.</outcome>

      <outcome>Image quality (IQ) score: The ultrasound images in the transverse median plane were scored on a scale of 1-5, where 1= poor visibility and all structures not identifiable, 2= all structures reasonably identifiable, 3= all structures satisfactorily identifiable, 4= good visibility of all important structures, 5= very good visibility of all important structures.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background
Spinal ultrasound has great potential as a teaching tool for epidural insertion; however it is currently underutilized.

Purpose
The purpose of the study was to test the efficacy of a standardized training programme of spinal ultrasound and to determine the optimal teaching method.

Methods
The study was conducted as a prospective, assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial as part of 2 standardized workshops 1 week apart at a single centre in Australia during December 2010. For each workshop the anaesthesiologists (novices in performing the spinal ultrasound technique) were randomized according to a computer-generated random table, into 2 teaching groups to receive standardized training via either an explicit (didactic) 10-step or an implicit (interactive) learning method. Allocation concealment achieved with opaque sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. This was followed by a practice session and assessment of specific ultrasound tasks on pregnant volunteers. They were individually videorecorded for assessment, and subsequently rated by two experienced international blinded assessors from a using a global rating scale (GRS) and checklist. Saved lumbar intervertebral images were also rated. Main outcome measure: GRS score. Secondary outcome measures: Task specific checklist and image quality scores. ICCs were calculated to assess agreement between reviewers.</summary>
