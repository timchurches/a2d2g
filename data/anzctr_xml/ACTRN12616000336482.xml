    <interventions>Mechanical percussion therapy post extracorporeal shockwave lithotripst (ESWL) for lower pole kidney stones vs observation alone.

ESWL will be performed under general anaesthesia as per standard practice.  Details of treatment such as number of shocks, intensity, and any difficulties or immediate complications will be recorded.  Following ESWL participants will be randomly allocated to perform percussion therapy or control group.

For the percussion therapy participants will need to place themself in an inverted position.  You may do this with an inclined surface or by leaning over a piece of furniture with some pillows to support your upper body.  A friend or family member will be required to assist with the percussion, with an open hand, the person assisting  should strike the back over the kidney which had the stone treated.  The amount of force required is similar to that of a firm massage.  The strike should be firm enough that the participant can feel a vibration through your body, though not so firm that it causes pain or bruising.  

Following a 5-10min training with the urology nurse and provision of written information treatments are to commence 1 week after ESWL and be performed for approx 10minutes, 5days per week.  Treatments will continue for three months. Participants will be provided with a questionaire to record the treatments performed and details.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants post ESWL for lower pole stones treated with observation alone.  Those participants in the control group who still have persistent stone after three months will be offered crossover to the treatment group, with follow up as per the original treatment group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Stone free status as assessed by plain X-ray kidney/ureter/bladder (KUB). This will be reviewed by a blinded, independent reviewer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three months following final ESWL session.  For those in the crossover group, final timepoint will be three months from commencement percussion therapy.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Complication rates - complications of ESWL include haematuria (common), infection, renal or ureteric obstruction (Steinstrasse), perinephric haematoma, retained stone fragments.  These will be assessed by interview with completion proforma at each 4 week review, which includes an x-ray KUB.

There are no known complications of percussion therapy other than mild discomfort.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Complications will be assessed at each four week review following ESWL. For those in the crossover group, complications will continued to be assessed at each four week review until three months from the commencement of percussion therapy.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size requirement was calculated using free access online calculator, using estimates of previous studies.  Using an estimated stone-free rate of 50% in MPI group, 20% in observation group (ie 30% difference) with type I error of 0.05 and type II error of 0.2, estimated sample size was 32 in each arm (64 total).  Allowing further 10% for withdrawal gives a total sample size of 70 (35 in each group)

Analysis will be performed with intention-to-treat principle.  Analysis will be performed using the commercially available statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) program.  Chi-square analysis will be used to compare stone-free rates.  Multiple regression analysis will be used to analyse and adjust for any confounders.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to compare manual percussion and inversion therapy with observation alone to see if this therapy does improve the rate of stone clearance.

To date there have only been two randomised trials to assess mechanical percussion and inversion therapy. Although both these studies show promising results, pooling data has some problems as the treatment methodology was also different in each study, with one study enrolling participants immediately and the other enrolling only those with persisting stone at three months.  Also in both of these studies, treatment was given in the clinic and administered by staff.  

Many institutions do not have such resources, therefore the aim of this study is to see if the previous results could be replicated with percussion therapy administered in the home setting.
