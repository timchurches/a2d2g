  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In six communities we will seek out households where someone who has a history of respiratory
      problems. For the first winter we will measure temperature and humidity of the house and
      health of occupants. We will insulate half the houses and the next winter compare them with
      the uninsulated houses to see if warmer houses improve health.</summary>
