  <interventions>
    <interventions>Privigen, i.e. liquid human Immunoglobulin preparation (10% w/v), will be administered intravenously in two doses. The first dose will be given within 12 hours of acute traumatic cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury. The second dose will be administered the following day. Each dose will be calculated to 1g/kg of the patient's body weight.</interventions>
    <comparator>A control group will be assembled from de-identified patient records for baseline data, which will be extracted from existing databases at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Control patients would have been admitted to and received their care from the Princess Alexandra Hospital between January 2012 and July 2019. Control subjects will have received standard clinical care without IVIg treatment, and they will be matched as closely as possible to participants in the treatment arm in terms of age, sex, mode and type of spinal cord injury at the outset. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To obtain exploratory data on the efficacy of IVIg infusion in patients with acute traumatic spinal cord injury. The functional outcome will be assessed via:

a) ASIA examinations (standard neurological assessment tool) to assess neurological (sensory and motor) impairment at set intervals post-accident
b) SCIM (Spinal Cord Independence Measure) questionnaires, which assess both function and independence.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The severity and level of neurological impairment for each study participant will be assessed upon admission, and then again at day 1, 3, 7, 21, 42 post-injury and at patient discharge (~12 months post-injury) from the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To monitor patient safety during and following IVIg infusion in individuals with acute traumatic spinal cord injury. Complications will be reviewed, assessed and managed as clinically indicated. The research team will record adverse events (complications) and report any Serious Adverse Events to the Metro South HREC and other authorised parties as stipulated in the Clinical Trial Agreement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Complications will be monitored, recorded and reported on in a contemporaneous method throughout the participants inpatient stay at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the feasibility of initiating IVIg treatment in SCI patients within 12 hours of their accident. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Potential barriers to initiating IVIg treatment within 12 hours of injury / upon admission to the Princess Alexandra Hospital, e.g. due to complications, hospital delays, etc. that could see a patient missing out on acceptance into the study and/or treatment being terminated will be documented and reported upon.   </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the pharmacokinetics of IVIg in SCI patients</outcome>
      <timepoint>We will measure immunoglobulin levels and other biomarkers of injury / inflammation in the blood of study participants via serum assay upon admission, and then again at 1, 3, 7, 21, 42 days post-injury plus on patient discharge.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our extensive pre-clinical studies have indicated that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy is highly beneficial and significantly improves the neurological recovery if administered during the acute phase of SCI. As IVIg is already in clinical use as an immunomodulatory treatment for a variety of other disorders (incl. neurological conditions) and has a good safety profile, we now wish to explore the feasibility of treating human patients that have suffered either a cervical or thoracic spinal cord injury with IVIg. 

The specific aims of our Phase 1 study are as follows:
1) To test the feasibility of delivering IVIg within 12 hours of acute traumatic SCI.
2) To obtain data on the safety of IVIg in SCI using registry data for comparison.
3) To study the pharmacokinetics of IVIg in SCI
4) To relate the pharmacology of IVIg in SCI to safety and outcome measures
5) To obtain exploratory pilot data on the effect of IVIg treatment on the neurological outcome. 

Blood samples will be used for assessment of biomarkers of injury (e.g. cytokines) and studies on the pharmacological properties (e.g. half-life) of IVIg in the context of SCI. Serious adverse events will be recorded and compared to registry data / untreated patients to explore a possible (though unexpected) relationship with IVIg treatment. Suitable controls will be identified based on age, gender, nature and level of injury. De-identified data on the functional outcome of these individuals will also be used to obtain exploratory pilot data on therapeutic efficacy of IVIg. 

All participants will be followed for up to a year after their injury at set intervals, using physical examination to accurately determine motor and sensory recovery and questionnaires which would indicate functionality and social and emotional states.</summary>
