  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adults with a primary diagnosis of Schizophrenia are given a single dose (24 International Units) of oxytocin nasal spray or an identical placebo in a crossover design with one-week washout period. Participants receive the nasal spray, wait 45 minutes and complete experimental tasks. Participants return one week later to receive the nasal spray again, wait 45 minutes and complete the same experimental tasks. On both occasions participants are observed for a period of 1.5 hours while they complete social cognition tasks.  These tasks include emotion recognition (Reading the mind in the eyes (RMET) and the Penn Emotion Recognition Test (PERT)), eye-tracking when viewing human faces, and assessing comprehension of potential threats when viewing videos of social events. The entire trial is completed within these two experimental testing sessions.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo nasal spray is a solution containing all of the ingredients used in the OT nasal spray except the active OT. It is administered 45 minutes before participants complete experimental cognition tasks. The placebo is administered in exactly the same manner as the OT spray. All participants receive 24 International Units.</comparator>
