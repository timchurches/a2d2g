  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Pilot dose duration-response study conducted in healthy volunteers with no health condition or problem studied.

This pilot study is being conducted in healthy volunteers who are not being treated for the conditions that Eumovate cream is indicated for. 

Eumovate cream is indicated for the short term (up to 7 days) treatment of the milder form of eczema, dermatitis and other steroid responsive skin conditions which do not require the use of a more active topical corticosteroid in children and adults.

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multiple dose study where each participant attends a single treatment session and receives Eumovate cream (clobetasone butyrate 0.5 mg/g (0.05% w/w)) at various dose durations. The intervention for this trial is the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) of Eumovate Cream (clobetasone butyrate 0.5 mg/g (0.05% w/w)).

Subjects will be healthy subjects who have shown a vasoconstriction response to a single dose of Eumovate cream. There will be 12 sites in total (6 on each arm) where 4 sites will be treated with the cream and 2 will be untreated control sites.  The 8 treated sites (4 on each arm) will have 10 mg of cream applied at various dose-durations at 6, 4, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25 hours prior to cream removal.  The cream is then removed from all sites and the Chromameter measurements for the pharmacodynamic responses of the topical corticosteroid will be carried out at 0, 2, 4, 6, 19 and 24 hours following removal.

Subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in this study. Pre and post study laboratory tests will be performed along with an ECG and medical evaluation. A follow up visit will also be completed to assess for safety.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Treatment duration will be randomly allocated for each site and each subject.

No blinding of the Eumovate cream as there is only one formulation used for this study.

Allocation is not concealed</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant will be identified by a 3 digit screening number which is determined by the order in which the participants give consent, ie the 1st participant to give consent is allocated 001. and a 2 digit subject number which is determined by simple randomisation using a computer generated true random number generator at www.random.org. The screening number will be issued once the participant has given written consent to participate in the study and the two digit subject number will be issued after acceptance into the study.

The Randomization Scheme is computer generated by Zenith and as such, treatment sequences were randomly assigned to each subject number</sequence>
