  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The site inclusion criteria are:

          -  Predominantly dialyses adults (=18 years old) receiving maintenance haemodialysis

          -  Rates of withdrawal within the first two years of commencing dialysis for social
             reasons have been less than 15% for the 2 years prior to recruitment and are not
             expected to increase above 15%

          -  Has a minimum of 10 dialysis recipients at time of randomisation

          -  Utilises a default dialysate sodium concentration at the time of recruitment (a
             substantial majority of dialysis sessions are conducted with the default dialysate
             sodium concentration)

          -  Is a self-contained unit (i.e. unit patients do not regularly rotate through another
             unit. Brief trips by patients to a parent or other unit do not exclude a site)

          -  Willing to accept randomisation to either intervention (as determined by nominated
             Director of Unit)

          -  Is not a home dialysis training or support unit. [Sites that include both
             in-center/satellite dialysis patients and home patients may participate but the study
             procedures and assessments will only be conducted in the incenter/satellite component
             of the site].

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This global study will assess the effect of randomising dialysis sites to one of two default
      dialysate sodium concentrations in current practice, 140mmol/l and 137mmol/l, on major
      cardiovascular events and death in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis.</summary>
