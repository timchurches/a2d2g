    <concealment>Information regarding the study will be distributed throughout hospital wards, cancer care centres, media and the researchers website.  Potential participants will be given an information booklet, and invited to a recuitment seminar where all protocols are explained.  Once participants give written consent and obtain consent from their doctor they will be scheduled for baseline assessment and then randomly allocated by a computer randomisation program to one of the 4 groups.
The intervention will use a single blind protocol as participants can not be blinded to their treatment allocation.  Research assistants will be blinded to the study group, and results until completion of the study.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study assesses the efficacy of exercise versus a complementary therapy on the physical and psychosocial well-being of people who have undergone treatment for haematological malignancies. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are undergoing or due to complete  treatment for non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's Lymphoma (HL) or Myeloma. 

Participants will be randomly divided into 3 groups. The groups will undertake 12 weeks of either exercise, Bowen therapy (a hands-on technique to enhance healing and relieve pain), or 'Wait-listed' supportive care. Participants will be assessed at 0 weeks (pre-), 12 weeks (mid), 24 weeks (post), and there will be the option of a 12 month follow-up. The study aims to measure key physiological and psychosocial outcomes following treatment including quality of life (QoL), anxiety, depression, fatigue, body composition, aerobic fitness and strength.</summary>
