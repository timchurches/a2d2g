  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-centre, open-label, 96 week study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      extent and duration of improvement in HIV-1 infected subjects with antiretroviral induced
      facial lipoatrophy, randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive immediate or deferred deep
      subcutaneous injections of poly-L-lactic acid (PLA). Subjects will receive 4 treatments of
      PLA approximately every 2nd week, either at trial entry or following a delay period of 24
      weeks.</summary>
