    <concealment>The Triage Nurse in the emergency department will ask all patients with isolated limb injury for a 0-10 pain rating in the usual way. When the rating is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 7 and the patient appears otherwise eligible, the Triage Nurse will inform the SRO who will assess the patient for eligibility as soon as possible and will obtain informed consent where eligibility is confirmed. 

Study recruitment officers will include Emergency Physicians, medical students, pharmacists and other trained doctors working in the ED. They will recruit the convenience sample of patients that meet the inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria. 

We will endeavor to flag potential participants using our electronic triage and patient tracking system in concert with the Triage Nurse. This will alert clinicians to potential subjects and also help us retrospectively determine numbers of potential subjects not approached for trial consideration given various constraints of the ED setting.

If the SRO, for whatever reason, believes that study recruitment will be delayed for more than fifteen minutes, then the SRO will tell the Triage Nurse that timely recruitment is not going to be possible and that nurse initiated analgesia should be instituted as per protocol. 

On obtaining informed consent, the SRO/treating doctor will order the study medication on a standard hospital medication chart. The prescribing doctor will need to write on the "Once only medication" section (front of the drug chart labeled with the patients URN and name).
"Trial medication, study number XXX:   paracetamol 500mg ii
                                                            ibuprofen 200mg ii
one of codeine 30mg ii / oxycodone 5mg ii / thiamine 100mg ii"
The nurses &amp; others involved in the trial are then legally able to sign out the trial packs and/or administer the medication to the patient from this drug order.

Drug packs will be pre-packaged in the hospital pharmacy and numbered sequentially. Treatment arms will be randomised in blocks of 18 packs. Neither the Study recruitment officer nor the patient will know which drugs have been administered.

To ensure this style of prescribing is adhered to &amp; uniform across sites, we will purchase a stamp with the template for the medication order on it. The SRO or ED nurse will obtain the labeled study drug container from the drug safe and the identically numbered Study Kit from the drug room. The container will be labelled 'study drug'. The container will be an opaque plastic container and the contents cannot be seen from the outside.

The SRO will complete the initial sections of the Case Report Form (CRF) and obtain the first (Time 0) VAS rating.  

The patient will be given the study medication and a cup of water and will be asked to take the study medications without looking at the tablets and out of view of the SRO. The SRO will ensure the obtaining of the follow up VAS ratings at Time 0+15min, 0+30min, 0+45min, 0+60 min and 0+90min. The need for additional analgesia (‘rescue medication’) will be assessed at each time point. To assess the need for rescue analgesia, patients will be asked if their pain is much better, a little better, much the same, a little worse, or much worse, and their answer will be documented.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Very little information exists on the effectiveness of oral pain-relieving medication administered acutely to adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with moderate pain. As a result, the most effective combination of pain-relievers for acute pain is unknown. Studies in children in the emergency setting have suggested that a number of pain reliever combinations may be equally as effective for the treatment of moderate pain. Similar studies have not been replicated in adults.
Southern Health (SH) Emergency Medicine has an established guideline for the management of patients presenting to the Emergency Department with pain. The triage Nurse may administer one of a number of combinations of pain relieving medications provided certain clinical requirements are met. However, the guideline for pain relief when a patient has moderate pain (pain score &gt;3 and &lt;8), is not clear, suggesting the administration of a number of pain relief alternatives. These include; paracetamol with oxycodone and Ibuprofen, or alternatively Panadeine Forte-Registered Trademark (R) (paracetamol &amp; codeine phosphate) with or without ibuprofen. It is not clear from past research whether or not one combination is superior. Additionally, the ease of nursing accessibility varies with oxycodone and Panadeine Forte(R) due to the different drug schedule of each pain reliever. Oxycodone is an S8 drug, requiring a higher degree of security and accountability to dispense. This has implications for nursing time to retrieve and give the drug to patients. Anecdotally, there is a perception by some emergency nursing staff that it may be easier or quicker to administer Panadeine Forte(R) compared to oxycodone. Some studies done in other settings suggest that oxycodone with paracetamol may be a more effective pain reliever for acute pain than Panadeine Forte(R), but data is conflicting and despite numerous systematic reviews of both pain relievers the differences may be small in patients with moderate pain. In the initial management of moderate pain at triage, the small benefit oxycodone+paracetamol confers over Panadeine Forte (R) may be offset by the added time it takes to deliver the former agent to the patient and the subsequent time of onset of pain relief.
Our study intends to compare three widely accepted combinations of analgesics for treatment of moderate pain in adults who present to the ED following acute limb injury. Firstly, paracetamol 1g with ibuprofen 400mg will be compared to 2) Codeine Phosphate 60 mg with paracetamol 1g and ibuprofen 400mg and, 3) Oxycodone (Endone (R)) 10 mg with paracetamol 1g and ibuprofen 400mg. All of these drugs are currently included in some combination in the current Southern Health Emergency Medicine nurse-initiated pain guideline for management of moderate pain. 
The study will be carried out in all three Southern Health EDs. Subjects will be given one of three randomly assigned and unknown combinations of the drugs. Their pain scores will be determined at regular intervals for 90 minutes. There will be regular monitoring for side effects and for the need for additional painkillers. We aim to recruit 216 subjects. Equal relief of pain with all the regimens may improve delivery of pain relief in the ED by reducing the need to access S8 medications in moderate pain, thus reducing time to delivery of effective analgesia. If the oxycodone arm is found to provide superior analgesia the current guideline could be amended to simplify the currently recommended treatment options. Alternatively if it is found the arm without opioid analgesia is equivalent  the routine use of codeine and oxycodone for moderate pain will be reviewed.</summary>
