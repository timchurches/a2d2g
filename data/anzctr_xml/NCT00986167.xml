    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Quetiapine XR

Experimental: Quetiapine XR - The study population will be patients admitted to the acute psychiatry inpatient wards of St Vincent's or the Alfred and determined by a Psychiatrist to be experiencing a psychotic illness (including mania with psychotic features and drug-induced psychosis) and acting in an aggressive manner (determined by a score of at least 1 on the OAS).


Treatment: drugs: Quetiapine XR
The daily dose of oral Quetiapine XR at the start of therapy is 300 mg on Day 1, 600 mg on Day 2 and up to 800 mg after Day 2. The dose will be adjusted within the usual effective dose range of 400 to 800 mg/day, depending on the clinical response and tolerability of the individual patient.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multi-site study examining the use of Quetiapine XR for psychotic aggression
      in an acute psychiatric setting. The study aims to demonstrate that management with
      Quetiapine XR significantly reduces aggressive behaviour in acute patients with psychosis,
      significantly reduces psychotic symptoms and decreases the requirement for sedation using
      benzodiazepines.</summary>
