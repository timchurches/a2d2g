  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of imatinib (1 x 600 mg) on one occasion, the innovator formulation of imatinib (formulation 1) (1 x 400 mg and 2 x 100 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of imatinib (formulation 2) (1 x 400 mg and 2 x 100 mg) on one occasion with each dose seperated by a two week washout period. The intervention for this trial is the test formulation of imatinib.

No water is allowed for 1 hour prior to dosing until 1 hour after dosing (except for the water consumed with the dose). 

Participants are required not to eat for 10 hours prior to receiving breakfast. Subjects will be provided with a standardised high fat breakfast which they must start eating 30 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects are required to fast for approximately 4 hours after receiving each dose. Bathroom visits will be supervised to ensure no unauthorised water or food intake and for personal safety. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Site for 10 hours prior to dosing to ensure compliance.

Standard meals will be consumed at the Clinical Site with no additional food intake allowed. Alcohol breath testing will be performed upon each participant reporting to the Clinical Site 10 hours prior to dosing.

Pre and post study laboratory tests will be completed to assess the health of participants along with HIV, Hepatitis and drugs of abuse testing. 

Each dose will be taken orally with 240 ml of water at ambient temperature. Medication must be swallowed whole and a mouth check will be conducted to ensure the medication has been taken as directed.</interventions>
    <comparator>Single dose, crossover study design whereby each participant receives the test formulation of imatinib (1 x 600 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of imatinib (formulation 1) (1 x 400 mg and 2 x 100 mg) on one occasion and the innovator formulation of imatinib (formulation 2) (1 x 400 mg and 2 x 100 mg) on one occasion  with each dose seperated by a two week washout period.  The difference between the two innovator formulations is the country of origin of each one.  The comparator/control for this trial is the innovator formulations of imatinib.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the bioavailability of imatinib (as summarised by Cmax and AUC) for the formulation. All plasma samples will be assayed for imatinib using one fully validated LC/MS/MS method. Validation will be conducted to comply with EU and FDA guidelines.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to maximum peak concentration (Tmax) will be determined by plasma sample analysis. Tmax will be the time where the maximum concentration occurred in the sample points.</outcome>
