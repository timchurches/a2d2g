  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aims and Hypotheses:

      This randomised placebo controlled study will test the hypothesis that Recombinant Activated
      Factor VII (rVIIa) will improve haemostasis after an inadequate response to conventional
      therapy in complex cardiac surgery.

      Major bleeding is still of concern in complex cardiac surgery. It has been shown to be
      associated with poorer patient outcome and results in the consumption of resources (hospital
      costs, manpower and blood bank reserves). This study has the potential to provide evidence
      that rVIIa can reduce transfusion requirements and improve patient outcome in a problematic
      aspect of complicated cardiac surgery.

      The objective is to conduct a multi-centre randomised placebo controlled study that has been
      designed to scientifically evaluate the treatment of post bypass coagulopathy in the
      association with complex cardiac surgery. The trial design is based on clinical practice that
      has evolved over 2 years at the Austin Hospital during which 38 patients have received open
      label administration of rVIIa. There is currently no published RCT in this area and there is
      no TGA approval for the use of rVIIa for this indication.</summary>
