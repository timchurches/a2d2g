  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study intervention will be the introduction of an 'adequate analgesia' target into clinical practice for a period of 6 months. In this study, 'adequate analgesia' is defined as that providing a decrease in the patient's triage pain score of at least 2 points and to a level that is less than 4 points (scale 0-10). Emergency Department staff will use this definition as a target to guide the management of their patient's pain. Any treatment used (including drug, dose, mode of administration, etc.) will be at the discretion of the treating clinician.</interventions>
    <comparator>The participating emergency departments will be randomised to a cluster that will introduce the study intervention and a cluster that does not. The cluster that does not introduce the intervention will provide patients with standard pain management. Standard pain management will serve as the control. Standard pain management is any treatment used (including drug, dose, mode of administration, etc.) at the discretion of the treating clinician.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The participating emergency departments will be randomised to an intervention cluster or a control cluster. Randomisation will be undertaken at the central administration site using computer generated numbers. Each site will then be advised by mail of their allocation and management will be 'open' (not blinded). For the first 3 months, the emergency departments will provide pain management for their patients that is consistent with their allocation. That is, either striving for the 'adequate analgesia' target or standard pain management. Individual patients will not be randomised.

At the end of 3 months, the emergency departments that were providing standard care will introduce the study intervention for the next 3 months. The original interventioncluster will continue with the study intervention.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>It is well known that pain management in emergency departments (EDs) could often be improved. A recent study demonstrated that the provision of 'adequate analgesia' (defined as a reduction in the patient's triage pain score of at least 2 and to a level &lt;4 [0-10 scale]) is significantly associated with a high level of patient satisfaction with their pain management. The study concluded that this definition of 'adequate analgesia' could be used as a clinical target for ED staff to aim for. However, this study was only able to demonstrate an association between the provision of 'adequate analgesia' and patient satisfaction. Despite this, the strength of the association is very strong and the 'adequate analgesia' target is about to be rolled out into ED clinical practice. The proposed study aims to take advantage of this proposed roll out by determining if the use of the 'adequate analgesia' target (the intervention) will result in improved patient satisfaction.</summary>
