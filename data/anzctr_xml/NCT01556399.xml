  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Tissue Sampling

Duodenal adenomas - Patients who consent to participate in this study will have a small sample of their adenoma and normal tissue sent for molecular testing.


Other interventions: Tissue Sampling
A small sample of the duodenal adenoma will be obtained for molecular testing. The remaining adenoma will be sent for regular histological testing.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Significant differences in molecular abnormalities. - The aim of this project is to look for statistically significant differences in molecular abnormalities from the three known genetic pathways, between the two different morphological types, granular and non-granular, to potentially demonstrate that these different polyps form via different genetic pathways.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Specimens will be stored and used for up to 15 years</timepoint>
