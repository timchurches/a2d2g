    <interventions>This is a crossover trial. Participants will consume 3 marshmallows, 3 times per day (9 marshmallows in total) for 5 days and complete another 5 days with a marshmallow free diet. There will be a 2 day washout period. </interventions>

      <outcome>Mean daily stoma output as measured in millilitres per day and recorded by participants on record sheets provided.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome will be measured at 2 time points. Measurements will be self recorded by patients on a record sheet provided which will be sent back to researchers in reply paid envelopes after the 5 days of intervention and again after the 5 days of control. </timepoint>

      <outcome>Mean frequency of stoma bag changes per day.

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculation: The mean output from an established ileostomy is 465ml (S.D 219). We regard a clinically relevant reduction in output to be 150ml.
For an alpha level of 0.05 and beta of 0.1, we would require 23 patients (calculated for paired samples). Calculation done using Medcalc (R) software. 
We will aim to recruit 40 patients to account for drop out. 

Student t-test will be used for statistical analysis.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>	The aim of the trial is to find out whether eating marshmallows helps to reduce the stoma output in people with an ileostomy. Eating marshmallows to reduce stoma output is widely documented on online websites and blogs as well as in the recommendations given by stoma-care therapists. However, there is no evidence to support these recommendations.
We will invite people that have had an ileostomy for at least 3 months, are medically stable, with no relevant dietary restrictions and over 18 years of age to take part in the trial.

We will use a repeated measures design with random crossover between a 5 day study period and 5 day control period with a 2 day wash out in between.  

Primary outcome: to determine the efficacy of marshmallow intake in reducing stoma output in patients with ileostomies.
	Hypotheses:
	a) Marshmallow in take will reduce daily stoma output volumes
	b) Marshmallow intake will reduce the frequency of daily stoma bag empties and changes
