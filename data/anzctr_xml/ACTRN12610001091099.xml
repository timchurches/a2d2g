    <interventions>Constraint Induced intervention protocol with the three fundamentals of the technique apliedone on one with a physiotherapist. These include 1) repetitive, task oriented training of the more impaired Upper Extremity for three hours a day for 10 consecutive weekdays; 2) applying a transfer package of adherence-enhancing behavioral methods designed to transfer gains made in clinical setting to the patientÂ´s real-world environment ; and 3) constraining the patient to use the more impaired Upper Extremity during walking hours over de course of treatment, sometimes by restraining the less impaired UE
'They were assessed using the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and Wolf Motor Funtion Test (WMFT). The evaluator administered standardized assessments before the participant constraint-induced training (pretest), after constraint-induced training (posttest), and 1, 3 and 6 months posttraining (follow-ups).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Constraint induced movement therapy is a family of techniques that have been implemented to increase function in stroke patients. In Brazil there are already some published studies with the technique and although all studies showing positive results of TCI, the variability of these results is large. The aims of the study is to compare the results of the intervention protocol complete with the effects obtained in studies conducted in Brazil. The patients with chronic stroke underwent two weeks of treatment with three components of the technique for three hours a day. They were assessed using the Motor Activity Log (MAL) and Wolf Motor Funtion Test (WMFT). The evaluator administered standardized assessments before the participant constraint-induced training (pretest), after constraint-induced training (posttest), and 1, 3 and 6 months posttraining (follow-ups).</summary>
