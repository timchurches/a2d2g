    <inclusivecriteria>Patients must be = 1 and = 21 years of age.

        Diagnosis

          1. Patients with AML must have =5% blasts (by morphology) in the bone marrow.

          2. Patients with ALL must have an M2 or M3 marrow (=5% blasts by morphology).

          3. Patients may have disease in the central nervous system (CNS) or other sites of
             extramedullary disease. No cranial irradiation is allowed during the protocol therapy.

          4. Patients with secondary AML are eligible.

          5. Patients with Down syndrome and DNA fragility syndromes (such as Fanconi anemia, Bloom
             syndrome) are excluded.

        Karnofsky &gt; 50% for patients &gt; 16 years of age and Lansky &gt; 50% for patients = 16 years of
        age.

        Patients must have fully recovered from the acute toxic effects of all prior chemotherapy,
        immunotherapy, or radiotherapy prior to entering this study.

        Myelosuppressive chemotherapy - the eligibility criteria is different between phase I and
        expansion phase

          1. Phase I

               -  Any patient with AML in 1st or greater relapse, OR

          3. Cytoreduction with hydroxyurea can be initiated and continued for up to 24 hours prior
             to the start of azacytidine. It is recommended to use hydroxyurea in patients with
