  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve the delivery of C2u text messages to participants in addition to standard practice. The content of the C2u text messages are based on antenatal and postnatal care, focusing on health behaviours (maternal nutrition and weight; physical activity; alcohol, tobacco, drugs, medication consumption; immunisation reminders; appointment reminders), mental health and wellbeing, communication, bonding and attachment, infant feeding, preparing for parenthood/ becoming a parent, and circle of security. 

The intervention will commence at 16 weeks' gestation, with a duration period of around 12 months. The intervention will cease once the infant is six months of age. 

For the first 12 weeks of the intervention, the participant will be sent two text messages a week. This will be reduced to one text message a week, after the first 12 weeks, and until birth. After birth, the participant will be sent two text messages a week for the first 12 weeks. This will be reduced to one text message for the remaining weeks of the intervention.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard practice of care 

Standard practice of care is defined as routine antenatal midwifery and obstetric care and postnatal appointment scheduling, abiding by the Queensland Health's Pregnancy Health Record and Personal Health Record.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Two sample situations were considered based on the presence or absence of intervention. It was hypothesized that the mean or proportion of the main outcomes of interests would be different among the participating mothers and fathers belonging to the intervention and control arms, after the antenatal (at T2) and early life interventions (T4). 
For sample size calculation, it was assumed 5% level of significance and 80% power. Further, it was assumed 1:1 ratio for the number of participating mothers and fathers in intervention and control arms. STATA version 8 was used for sample size calculations. 
Non-response and loss to follow up together (after enrollment) were expected to be 30% at T2 and 50% at T4, as compared to the enrolled numbers at T1, among the participating mothers and fathers belonging to the control arm. This rate is expected to be less among the intervention arm participants. But, it was assumed the same rate of non-response among the participants of both the arms in order to be on the safe side. Also targeting the same number of enrollments in both the arms was easier in terms of randomization.   

SPSS will be used to evaluate and analyse the data gathered. A statistical analysis will be performed to compare control and intervention groups for: 
- Data Collection 1 and 2 (pre and post antenatal group)
- Data Collection 3 and 4 (pre and post postnatal group)
- Data Collection 1 and 4 (pre and post of the entire group of participants). 

To ensure both control and intervention groups will be comparable at baseline, a number of statistical analyses will be performed. In order to assess differences between control and intervention groups in variables measured at a categorical level, Chi square tests will be used. 

To ensure that parental attachment, maternal confidence, infant feeding intentions/practices, and health behaviours are comparable at baseline across intervention and control groups, Independent samples t-tests will be performed. 

Mann-whitney U test will be used in the case of non-normally distributed data.

Pearson and Spearman correlation tests will be performed to look at the correlations between parental attachment , and/or maternal confidence, and/or infant feeding intentions/practices, and health behaviours.

Independent samples t-test and Mann Whitney U tests will be used to examine the mean differences in parental attachment , and/or maternal confidence, and/or infant feeding intentions/practices, and health behaviours across independent variables. 

ANOVA will be used to observe the mean differences between various demographics and parental attachment , and/or maternal confidence, and/or infant feeding intentions/practices, and health behaviours scores. 

Furthermore, a Kruskal-Wallis test will be perfomed to determine significant differences between parental attachment, and/or maternal confidence, and variable demographics scores. Mann-Whitney U tests will be undertaken to determine where the significant differences occurred. 

Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to examine mean differences between parental attachment pre and post of the intervention (DC1 and DC2; DC3 and DC4; DC1 and DC4) and maternal confidence pre and post of the intervention (DC3 and DC4) in both the control and intervention groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy of an infant and family health and wellbeing short-term message service (SMS) intervention in supporting expectant and new parents both birthing at partnered Queensland Hospitals.  The intervention period will be for 48 weeks from recruitment date and involves the provision of relevant and timely information on positive parenting strategies, attachment and health behaviours and support networks via an SMS program.  Participants will be recruited in the antenatal period via antenatal clinics in partnered hospitals in late 2015 (600 intervention; 600 control). 

This study will follow a mixed methods design involving qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The researchers aim to measure the effectiveness of the project by following a mixed methods design. Study procedures will involve face-to-face and web-based surveys pre-intervention and web based and telephone surveys for the last three data collection points in the evaluation, including post-intervention. Focus group interviews with a selection of participants post project intervention.

This trial follows on from the Connecting2u (C2u) pilot project conducted with families delivering at Logan Hospital between March and October 2014 which indicated the effectiveness of text messages in supporting parental confidence. Phase Two includes the dissemination of text messages in the antenatal period as research has indicated the importance of early intervention before birth in regards to health and wellbeing of the parents and child.   </summary>
