  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three interventions.arms
(1) Attention Bias Modification (ABM): Attention Bias Modification is a 15 minute experimental manipulation of attentional bias. It is computer-administered and based on the dot-probe paradigm and implicitly trains participants to attend to non-painful stimuli (words) by changing contingencies. 
(2) Attention Training Technique (ATT): ATT is an explicit training technique where participants listen to a sound array with the instruction to pay attention directly to one sound or another, switch attention and divide attention. The intervention is explicit and also takes about 15 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be a placebo that will use the same sound array as ATT (above) but will inform participants that the aim is to relax by listening to the sound array with no other instruction. </comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Threshold: The time taken to report pain after the participant has inserted their arm in a cold tank of water (5 degrees celcius). Timed with a stopwatch.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a single session trial. Participants do the cold pressor on one occasion at the end of the study and this is when the outcome is measured. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain: We will ask pain to be recorded on a Visual Analogue Scale (0 - 10) at threshold, 30 seconds later and at tolerance. An average will be used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a single session trial. Participants do the cold pressor on one occasion at the end of the study and it is during this task when the outcome is measured. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hesitance: The time taken (recorded by stopwatch) from when the person is given the instruction to place their hands in the cold pressor until when their arm is fully submerged. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a single session trial. Participants do the cold pressor on one occasion at the end of the study and this is when the outcome is measured. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tolerance: The time that participants can keep their arm in the cold pressor (maximum 4 minutes, timed with a stopwatch). </outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a single session trial. Participants do the cold pressor on one occasion at the end of the study and this is when the outcome is measured. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Distress: Participant rating of subjective Unit of Distress (0 - 10) at the end of the cold pressor task. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This is a single session trial. Participants do the cold pressor on one occasion at the end of the study and this is when the outcome is measured. </timepoint>

We will also exclude participants with Reynauld's phenomena or a  history of chronic pain. 	</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares two interventions that aim to modify attention (Attention Training Technique: ATT and Attention Bias Modification: ABM) with a placebo. The aim of the study is to determine the relative efficacy of the explicit training (ATT) compared to the implicit training (ABM) in terms of their impact on pain and to examine the likely mechanisms of treatment by assessing changes in attentional control (targeted by ATT) and attentional bias (targeted by ABM).</summary>
