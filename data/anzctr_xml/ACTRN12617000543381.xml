  <interventions>
    <interventions>Textured insoles constructed from 3.2mm poron (Poron 4000, Algeos Ltd., VIC, Australia), covered with 100% PVC material which has raised pyramidal nodules (Techno PVC covering, Black Tech, Algeos Ltd., VIC, Australia). To reduce the risk of ulceration, the textured zone will extend from the heel to just posterior to the metatarsal heads (foot region most prone to ulcers). Participants will be instructed to wear the textured insoles, in their own shoes, as much as possible over the 4-week intervention period. Participants will be followed for 4-weeks with insole-wear diaries to determine the number of hours insoles are worn. All participants will receive emergency contact details for a local podiatrist, who will provide advice and podiatry care for participants, as required.</interventions>
    <comparator>Smooth, control insoles will be constructed from 3.2mm poron (no PVC top cover) (Poron 4000, Algeos Ltd., VIC, Australia), and thus have a flat surface with no indentations. Participants will be instructed to wear the smooth control insoles, in their own shoes, as much as possible over the 4-week intervention period. Participants will be followed for 4-weeks with insole-wear diaries to determine the number of hours insoles are worn. All participants will receive emergency contact details for a local podiatrist, who will provide advice and podiatry care for participants, as required.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be randomised to either the textured insole or smooth (control) insole group (in a 1:1 ratio). The concealed randomisation schedule will be managed by an independent offsite investigator, and revealed to a clinician who is only responsible for issuing the insoles. All other Chief Investigators and Research Assistants will be blinded to group allocation. Participants will be instructed not to divulge their allocation. Following Baseline Assessment, the Principal Investigator and Research Assistant will leave the gait laboratory to ensure blinding to the insole condition. The clinician will then fit the participant with their allocated insole, and provide advice regarding: frequency of wear; completion of insole wear diaries and; contact details for a local podiatrist. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size was calculated for our primary outcome measure of centre of pressure velocity, using data from Kalron et al. (2015), who reported between-condition differences (shoes only and shoes + textured insole) that equated to an effect size of 0.72. Based on these data, 32 participants per group will provide sufficient power to detect differences in balance of a similar magnitude (a=0.05, beta=0.20). We will allow for a 10% attrition rate over the 4 week intervention period, and recruit 35 participants per group (control group and intervention group).

All analyses will be conducted in a blinded manner, on an intention-to-treat basis. Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 24 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL 60606, USA). Data will be examined for normality and homogeneity of variance. To establish any differences between the intervention and control groups in balance, gait, physical activity, foot sensation and proprioception measures, self-reported foot heath and falls over the intervention period, a repeated measures mixed models approach will be undertaken using data at baseline and 4-weeks. Non-parametric tests will be used where data is not normally distributed or violates the assumption of sphericity. Participant characteristics (e.g. age, gender) will be included as covariates. Multiple regression modelling will be used to determine any relationships between foot sensation and proprioception, balance and gait.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people with diabetes experience problems with their balance and walking, which can make day to day activities difficult and increase the chance of sustaining a fall. Nerve damage (a common complication of diabetes) can severely disrupt the quality of the signals transmitted from the feet to the brain, which provide vital cues about the ground we stand on and the relative position of our body above, to help people remain upright. Novel footwear devices are emerging as an attractive treatment option to help alleviate balance and walking problems and reduce the risk of falling in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage). Textured shoe insoles (comprising raised nodules) are designed to enhance the signals from foot skin receptors, which is important for good balance. This randomized controlled trial will be the first to explore whether use of different shoe insole surfaces (over 4-weeks) can improve balance and walking performance in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. We will also investigate whether any alterations in balance or walking are associated with underlying changes in the amount of remaining feeling in participants feet (measures of foot sensation and foot position awareness). Additionally, we will explore whether wearing different shoe insole surfaces lead to improvements in physical activity levels or measures of self-reported foot heath and falls in adults with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This study will bring new perspective to our understanding of the therapeutic role of footwear interventions, as a means to address deficient postural control in adults with neuropathic changes at the feet. The findings will be used to inform the development of new rehabilitative approaches that will help advance clinical guidelines and policy, and reduce the escalating personal, societal and economic burden of falls in people with diabetes.  </summary>
