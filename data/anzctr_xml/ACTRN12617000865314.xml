  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgical intervention. Half the participants will have surgical intervention for their recurrent rectal cancer. These patients will be followed up for five years or until death. On top of the surgery, they may receive chemotherapy and/or radiation. The decision to receive surgical intervention is made by the patient and their treating doctor, and is not a result of enrolling in this study (i.e. enrolment in this study results in no change to care because this is not a randomized controlled trial).</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-surgical intervention. Half the participants will not have surgical intervention for their recurrent rectal cancer. These patients will be followed up for five years or until death. On top of not having surgery, they may receive chemotherapy and/or radiation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality adjusted life years will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionniare.	This questionnaire briefly measures 5 domains of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety/depression. There are five answers to choose from for each question: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems. If all five questions are answered as no problems the quality component will be a perfect one whereas if all questions are answered as unable to/extreme problems the quality component will be below zero. In addition to the 5 questions, there is a visual analogue scale (ranging from 0 = the worst health you can imagine to 100 = the best health you can imagine) which people can mark with an X where they think their health status is.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up is for 5 years post diagnosis of recurrent rectal cancer. The timepoints are baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life is measured using Short Form 12 which contains twelve questions and produces scores for physical and mental components.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow up is for 5 years post diagnosis of recurrent rectal cancer. The timepoints are baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Survival over 5 years will be measured. Cancer specific and general survival will be examined.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the Quality of life and Quality adjusted life years of surgical versus non-surgical Recurrent Rectal Cancer patients.

Who is it for?

You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have an isolated locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of the rectum or recto-sigmoid being considered for radical resection with or without perioperative chemoradiation.

Study details
If you choose to take part in this research, you will be asked to allow the investigators to access your disease related health information and will also be asked to complete questionnaires numerous times over five years. You will be asked about your demographics and quality of life at baseline; you will be asked about your quality of life at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months, 48 months, and 60 months. Conversely, if you choose not to take part in the study, the care provided to you will not be changed or prejudiced due to this decision; this is a purely voluntary study. There is no reimbursement for time or expenses.


This study will provide important information about both the quality and quantity of the lifespan after diagnosis of Recurrent Rectal Cancer band thus could potentially assist in future treatment decisions.</summary>
