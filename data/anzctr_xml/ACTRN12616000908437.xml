    <interventions>Molecular screening for actionable biomarkers to be used to guide therapy.
Hospital archival tumour tissue will be collected for molecular screening after participant consent and assessment of suitability for the study.

The Garvan Institute of Medical Research will coordinate the molecular screening from archival tumour tissue. The core assays will be based on a genomic sequencing panel to cover a broad range of potentially actionable or biologically important cancer genes, with subsequent bioinformatics analysis. Patient tumour samples will also be assessed for biomarkers using relevant assays such as immunohistochemistry.

Molecular screening results will be reviewed by a Molecular Tumour Board. Options for treatment as a result of the screening will fall into 3 categories:

1. A MoST program clinical trial
2.A clinical trial outside of the program
3. Other treatments outside of the MoST program at the discretion of the participant's clinician

All participants, including those with no actionable biomarkers, will be informed of the results of the screening of their tumour tissue through their clinician. </interventions>

    <designfeatures>This framework protocol provides a structure to screen patients for actionable molecular biomarkers to guide treatment. 

Patients will be eligible for treatment in substudies based on the expression of actionable mutations or other molecular biomarkers in their tumours. For some treatments, where predictive biomarkers are not well characterised or thresholds are unknown, a post-hoc analysis will be performed to identify biomarkers.


</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size
1000 patients will be recruited for screening to identify actionable mutations and eligibility for enrolment into MoST substudies. 

The sample set of 1000 was chosen to allow for finding one of around 300 mutations (at various frequencies) and allow for the treatment of 192 patients on 12 individual substudies.

This protocol provides a framework to conduct molecular screening of patients and the development and implementation of multiple, parallel, early-phase, signal-seeking substudy trials. It is planned that 12 substudy modules will be opened during the first 4 years of the study. Each substudy will enrol 16 patients. A primarily descriptive analysis will be used to evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, utility and costs of the framework protocol, with data about the development and conduct of each substudy contributing to this analysis. Data about unsuccessful substudies (ie trial concepts that do not progress to a substudy within the MoST program) will also be collected to inform the evaluation of the framework.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to screen patients with advanced cancer and unmet clinical needs for actionable biomarkers to be used to guide therapy. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years and older, with pathologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic solid cancer of any cell type or an earlier diagnosis of a poor prognosis cancer and have received all standard anticancer therapy. 
Study details: A small part of your tumour tissue, which was collected from a previous biopsy or surgery, will be used to identify a biomarker by doing a laboratory analysis (molecular screening). The screening includes genetic panel testing, which means looking for changes in a subset of genes (DNA) in your tumour tissue and other laboratory assays. You will be asked to provide information about your and your familys health background, to donate a blood sample and complete some questionnaires. 
Results from molecular screening will be returned to all participants. These results may have implications for your treatment if a suitable biomarker is found.</summary>
