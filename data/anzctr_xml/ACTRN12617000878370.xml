  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy for sleep and fatigue (CBT-SF): CBT-SF will consist of 8 one hour sessions conducted weekly, focused on reducing and preventing sleep disturbance and fatigue. Sleep is addressed in sessions 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 and fatigue in sessions 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8. Session 1 will include psycho-education about post-TBI sleep disturbance and fatigue, including how poor sleep habits relate to fatigue. Self monitoring of daily activities and subjective fatigue levels will be initiated to encourage understanding of the link between activity levels and fatigue. Participants will be encouraged to engage in regular cardiovascular exercise as a form of behavioural activation. In session 2, the self-monitoring diary will be reviewed to encourage participants to regulate their activity schedule to balance rest and activity and sleep hygiene practices promoted. Traditional CBTi elements including stimulus control and sleep restriction are introduced, monitored through sleep diaries and reinforced in subsequent sessions.  Sessions 3 and 4 will focus on gradually increasing or decreasing activity levels depending on goals. Cognitive therapy is used to address maladaptive thoughts underpinning behaviours that reinforce fatigue and disturbed sleep patterns. Session 5 will provide sleep education, including sleep need, sleep stages, circadian rhythms, homeostatic pressure, model of insomnia and include detailed discussion of sleep restriction, stimulus control and sleep hygiene recommendations and how these can be implemented for the participant. Adherence to new bedtime schedules and better sleep practices is reviewed at subsequent sessions. Cognitive interventions for insomnia (cognitive restructuring, imagery and visualisation) and behavioural interventions for insomnia (stimulus control, sleep restriction, constructive worry sheet and progressive muscle relaxation) will be addressed in Session 6. In Session 7 the focus will be on practical strategies to manage information overload and minimize physical and mental fatigue. The last session will promote long-term gains by reviewing therapeutic techniques, troubleshooting lingering concerns and establishing relapse prevention plans. The intervention has been manualized to ensure consistency of approach.
Participants will continue whatever medical, psychological or rehabilitative interventions they are otherwise receiving. The therapy will be individual and carried out face-to-face by Clinical Psychologists/Neuropsychologists with experience in CBT and understanding of TBI. They will be supervised by a psychologist expert in CBTi (Moira Junge). Treatment fidelity and adherence to protocol will be assessed by audio taping all sessions; a random sample of 10% of sessions will be rated by an independent assessor expert in CBT.</interventions>
    <comparator>Health information control condition (INFO): Controls will receive 8 weekly one-hour sessions providing information about brain injury, healthy lifestyle, sleep and fatigue. This will control for non-specific therapy factors and the focus on sleep and fatigue in the active intervention. Topics will include education about brain injury, fatigue, sleep, exercise, diet, alcohol, drugs, cognitive difficulties after TBI and recovery from TBI, with no guided practice or feedback. Activity pacing, sleep restriction and stimulus control principles will be strictly avoided.
Participants will continue whatever medical, psychological or rehabilitative interventions they are otherwise receiving.
The therapy will be carried out by Clinical Psychologists/Neuropsychologists with understanding of TBI and the therapy will be manualised for consistency. It will be conducted face-to-face in the same number of individual sessions as the active treatment.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleepiness and fatigue are frequent debilitating problems following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Medications have not provided long-term solutions for these symptoms and there is little research into psychological treatments. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a well-established treatment for insomnia and chronic fatigue in those without a brain injury. The Monash-Epworth Rehabilitation Research Centre is conducting a world first study to investigate whether CBT can be effectively adapted to reduce symptoms of fatigue and sleep disturbance after TBI. A randomised controlled trial is used to compare participants receiving 8 sessions of CBT with another group of participants receiving 8 sessions of health education for issues specifically related to TBI.</summary>
