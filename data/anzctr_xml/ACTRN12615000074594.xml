  <interventions>
    <interventions>The following formulations and dosage strengths of EMA401 Sodium Salt (EMA401-Na) will be administered orally as a single-dose to each subject in random order across three dosing periods;

300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) EMA401 tablet formulation.
100 mg (two 50 mg tablets) EMA401 tablet formulation.
300 mg (three 100 mg capsules) EMA401 capsule formulation.
 
On Days 1, 3 and 5, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with EMA401 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets), 100 mg (two 50 mg tablets), or 300 mg (three 100 mg capsules) and receive their dose of study medication. All subjects will receive all doses/formulations throughout the study in random order. There will be a minimum 48 hour wash-out between each treatment period. Subjects will be required to be in the fasted state, having no food or drink (apart from water) for the preceding 8 hours on each dosing day. Subjects will be allowed to drink water up to 1 hour prior to study medication administration. 

There will be no dosing on Day 2, 4, and 6,  however subjects are expected to remain confined to the unit and following procedures will be performed/documented.

Subjects will undergo an exit assessment on Day 7/Early Termination following collection of the 48 hour post-dose pharmacokinetic plasma sample following the last dosing occasion (Day 5).</interventions>
    <comparator>To compare the relative exposure of a 300 mg dose in a tablet form to a 300 mg dose in a capsule form. The study design also allows an assessment of exposure and dose proportionality between 100 mg and 300 mg tablet doses.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the comparative plasma pharmacokinetics of EMA401 after a single oral dose of capsule and tablet formulations of EMA401-Na.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>In the first dosing period, blood samples for PK analysis will be taken from each subject at pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-dose.  The 48 hour post Day 1 dose sample will also act as the pre-dose Day 3 sample and then the same post-dose sampling schedule will be followed.  The same approach and sampling schedule will be followed for the third and final dose on Day 5.  Therefore, 46 blood samples will be collected from each subject; 1 pre-dose sample on Day 1 and 15 post-dose samples in each period. 

The following plasma PK parameters will be determined, as data permit: Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax); Time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax); Area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 to the last timepoint (AUC0t); Area under the plasma concentration curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0 ); Half-life (t 1/2).

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose proportionality of the 100 mg tablet dose (2 x 50 mg tablets) with the 300 mg tablet dose (2 x 150 mg tablets).

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The inter-subject variability in plasma pharmacokinetics of EMA401 after a single oral dose of capsule or tablet formulations of EMA401 Na.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Individual plasma concentrations and blood collection times will be listed by subject.  Summaries of concentration data by treatment will include mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation at each scheduled collection time. 

Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters for each subject will be calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin 6.3 or later.  Values reported as below the limit of quantitation will be assumed to be 0 ng/mL for the calculations.  The following parameters will be calculated; Maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed concentration (Tmax), area under plasma concentration time curve from 0 hours to the time of the last measurable concentration above the lower limit of quantitation (AUC0t), area under plasma concentration time curve from 0 hours to infinity (AUC0-8), the percent of the AUC0-8 value that was extrapolated from AUC0-t (%AUCextrap), the terminal elimination rate constant (kel; also termed lambda-z by WinNonlin),
the terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2), dose-normalised Cmax (NCmax), dose-normalised AUC0-t (NAUC0-t), dose-normalised AUC0-8 (NAUC0-8).
 
For each drug treatment, descriptive statistics will be calculated for each parameter except %AUCextrap.  The statistics will include mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean (except for Tmax), median, minimum, maximum, and number of observations. 
Log-transformed Cmax, AUC0t, and AUC08 will each be fit by a mixed model ANOVA with factors for treatment sequence, period, and treatment (fixed effects) and subject within treatment sequence (random effect). The treatment contrast of 300 mg dose tablet versus 300 mg dose capsule will be evaluated. Treatment mean differences and 90% confidence intervals for each difference will be estimated. Treatment mean differences and confidence intervals of the log transformed PK parameters will be back-transformed and expressed as percent relative bioavailability ratios. A similar approach for a treatment contrast of 100 mg dose tablet versus 300 mg dose tablet will be conducted using NCmax, NAUC0t, and NAUC08.

Safety Analyses
All clinical safety and tolerability data will be listed for each subject. Treatment-emergent adverse events, following the first investigational product dosing, will be listed and summarised by treatment. All AEs reported in this study will be coded using MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities). Relationship to study medication will be classified as related (probably related and possibly related) and unrelated (not related). Severity will be classified as mild, moderate and severe. Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation will be summarised by body system and preferred term.

Vital sign and ECG parameters will be summarised by treatment.  Laboratory values will be listed, along with comments as to clinical significance for values outside the laboratorys normal ranges.

A sample size of 15 healthy male subjects has been chosen as a reasonable sample size for an estimate of the relative bioavailability of EMA401 when 3 different dosage forms of EMA401-Na are each given orally as a single oral dose in a fasted state.
