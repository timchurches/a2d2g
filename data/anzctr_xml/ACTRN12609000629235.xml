    <healthcondition>The effect of GnRH analog injections on healthy males, as a sports doping agent.</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomised to one of two groups.
Group 1 will receive daily subcutaneous injections  of Lucrin 1mg for 4 days in week 1 (days 1 to 4) and again for 4 days in week 3 (days 15 to 18).
Group 2 will also receive daily subcutaneous injections  of Lucirn 1mg for 4 days in week 1 (days 1 to 4) and again for 4 days in week 3 (days 15 to 18) as well as an intramuscular injection of nandrolone decanoate on day 12 (200mg) and day 17 (100mg).
Blood an urine samples will be collected each morning (except at weekends) from day 1 to day 24.
The overall duration of treatment is 24 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>The group receiveing nandrolone will be compared with the the non nadrolone group. The baseline blood and urine samples from each participant will be compared with subsequent samples from the same participant.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the hormonal effects of the administration of GnRH analog (Leuprolide) through the  measurement of serum and urine luteinising hormone (LH) and testosterone (T) and urine testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio.</outcome>
      <timepoint>A single blood and urine sample will be collected from each participant at baseline and each morning on days 1 to 5, 8 to 12, 15 to 19 and 22 to 24.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish methods of detecting the use of illicit hormones (GnRH analogs) by elite athletes for sports doping.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All blood and urine samples collected during the study period will be analysed at the completion of the study.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sports anti-doping study. The aim of this study is to see what effect injections of a synthetic hormone called a GnRH analog have on testosterone levels as measured in blood and urine samples. GnRH analogs are banned in elite sports as they are considered to enhance an athletes performance by increasing the body's production of testosterone. In this study blood and urine samples will be collected from healthy male volunteers before and after several injections of Lucrin (GnRH anaolg). Half of the volunteers (8) will  be randomly assigned to also receive 2 injections of a drug called nandrolone decanoate.  It is thought that nandrolone and GnRH analogs may be used in combination for ilicit sports doping.</summary>
