  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - dactinomycin
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - etoposide
Treatment: drugs - ifosfamide
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Treatment: surgery - Conventional Surgery
Other interventions - MESNA (mercaptoethane sulfonate)
Other interventions - Filgrastim

Experimental: Chemotherapy plus possible surgery - Comprised of patients with disease lesions that are initially unresectable, or resected but with resulting grossly positive margins. All patients receive vincristine sulfate, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC), and mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNA). Depending on response, patients may receive ifosfamide and etoposide (IE). Filgrastim may also be given, as needed. In addition to Chemotherapy, patients may receive Conventional Surgery.
(See Interventions section for drug dosage and administration details.)

Experimental: Surgery only - Comprised of patients with initially resectable disease lesions. All patients undergo Conventional Surgery. Those with a result of clear or microscopically positive margins remain on study in this arm, for observation with no further intervention.


Other interventions: dactinomycin
Given Slow intravenous (IV) push over 1-5 minutes, dose &lt; 1yr 0.025 mg/kg &gt; or = 1 yr 0.045 mg/kg (max dose 2.5 mg) on days 1,22,43 and 64

Treatment: drugs: cyclophosphamide
Given IV over 60 minutes, dose 25 mg/kg on days 1,22,43 and 64.

Treatment: drugs: etoposide
Given IV over 1 hour, dose 3.3 mg/kg in normal saline (NS) 10 cc/kg (or to equal 0.4 mg/mL concentration) on days 1-5 of IE cycle.

Treatment: drugs: ifosfamide
Given IV over 1 hour, dose 60mg/kg in D5 1/4 NS 10 cc/kg IV on days 1-5 of IE Cycle

Treatment: drugs: vincristine sulfate
Given IV Push over 1 minute, dose 0.05 mg/kg (max dose 2 mg) on days 1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57 and 64

Treatment: surgery: Conventional Surgery
Applied only when lesion is resectable. Surgery is the primary means of local control in this study and reasonable attempts at achieving clear margins with an "envelope" of normal tissue should be undertaken at the initial and/or subsequent resections.

Other interventions: MESNA (mercaptoethane sulfonate)
Given orally. Oral daily MESNA dose is equal to at least 60% of the daily cyclophosphamide dose.

Other interventions: Filgrastim
Given IV - Only use filgrastim if chemotherapy has been delayed or modified for hematologic toxicity, or if patient experiences a significant life-threatening toxicity due to bone marrow suppression

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Failure-free Survival (FFS) in "Chemotherapy Plus Possible Surgery" Arm - Failure is defined as the occurrence of one of the following: disease progression, defined as at least a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions; relapse (defined with same criteria as for disease progression) after response; or death as a first event. Data will be summarized as number of eligible patients in each of the following categories at the time of data cutoff for analyses of 5-year FFS: 1)Failed; 2)Failure-free through 5 years of follow-up; 3)Failure-free until data cutoff (if less than 5 years of follow-up); 4)Withdrew from study; 5)Lost to follow-up. NOTE: Reported data are through March 2008 (see Caveats section).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving combination chemotherapy before surgery may
      shrink the tumor so that it can be removed. Giving combination chemotherapy after surgery may
      kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well surgery and/or combination chemotherapy
      work in treating children with fibrosarcoma.</summary>
