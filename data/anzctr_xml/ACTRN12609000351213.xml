Thereafter, self-adminstration of one vitamin D3 tablet (Calciferol D Forte) 50 000IU by patients on first day of every month for 23 months.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose sufficiency : At 12 and 24 months, most treated patients achieve a serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OH D) of 80nmol/l and the average serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OH D) for treated patients is  &gt;75nmol/l. 

Assays and diagnostic tests will be performed at timepoints  to measure serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OH D) level.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, 4, 12 and 24 months post-randomisation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dose compliance: On average, patients take &gt;80% of prescribed monthly dose.

The study team willl confirm compliance to treatment by contacting study patients at interim periods during the treatment phase and also during 4 monthly follow-up visits. Additionally, patients will be asked to keep a diary to record their use of the study drug. These diaries will be reviewed on a 4 monthly basis at follow-up visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline visit plus every 4 months for 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety:

i) Calcium - Over the course of the study, the mean serum calcium concentration in each patient is &lt;2.75mmol/l (11mg/dl).

There is no increase in the prevalence of hypercalcaemia relative to the baseline prevalence.

Over the course of the study, the mean  urinary calcium to creatinine ratio in each patient is &lt;1.0 (when calcium and creatinine are measured in nmol).

There is no increase in the prevalence of hypercalciuria relative to the baseline prevalence.

ii) Renal - Over the course of the study, the decrease in average estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is no more than 20%.

At the end of the study, the average estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is no more than 20% less in vitamin D treated patients than in placebo treated patients. 

iii) Renal calculi - During the course of the study, no more than two episodes of renal calculus occuring in vitamin D treated patients.

Assays and diagnostic tests would be performed to measure (i)-(iii). These include:
- Renal and liver function tests (including estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and urine calcium/creatinine ratio)
- Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25OH D) levels
- Serum corrected calcium levels</outcome>
      <timepoint>i) Calcium - Baseline visit plus every 4 months for 2 years

ii) Renal - Baseline visit plus every second study visit (i.e. at 8, 16 and 24 months)

iii) Renal Calculi - Baseline visit plus every 4 months for 2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation rate: 60% of patients who are both eligible and invited agree to participate.

Participation rate will be monitored and reported as the proportion of subjects eligible and invited agree to participate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the end of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression free survival.

Monitoring for recurrence will continue as per standard practice of the monitoring institute and also during the 4 monthly follow-up visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline visit plus every 4 months for 2 years</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high dose vitamin D therapy in patients who have primary melanoma which has been treated and are at high risk of recurrence. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 to 79 years and have been diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma. Study details: Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive vitamin D3 tablets monthly for 24 months, whilst participants in the other group will receive a placebo (sugar pill). Participants will be followed-up for 24 months, in order to determine dose sufficiency, compliance, safety and progression free survival. </summary>
