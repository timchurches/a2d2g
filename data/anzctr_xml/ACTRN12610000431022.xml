  <interventions>
    <interventions>Forty obese women were selected and divided in two groups in a 2-arm parallel trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 30 g of native banana starch (NBS) by day dissolved in 240 ml of water or metformin 850 mg/day. Each subject attended the laboratory on three occasions, once before any intervention, again following 4 weeks of intervention and the last at the end of the experimentation after 8 weeks of treatments. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was carried out before any intervention and after 8 weeks of experimentation. After 12 h fasting a 75g OGTT was performed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Blood samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after oral glucose for measuring glucose and insulin.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Subjects with obesity have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The key mechanism unifying obesity and diabetes is insulin resistance. Lifestyle changes have been recognised to be fundamental to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease among obese people. In a previous investigation we have demonstrated that native banana starch (NBS) supplementation reduces body weight and insulin resistance in a group of obese diabetics. In the present study our aim is to investigate the effects of NBS when compared to metformin  on a group of obese women at a high risk of chronic diseases. Metformin is known to possess an important insulin-sensitizing antidiabetic action.</summary>
