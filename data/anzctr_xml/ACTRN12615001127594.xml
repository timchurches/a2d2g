    <comparator>The control is the provision of a meal low in protein. The meal contains 30grams of carbohydrate, 5g protein and &lt; 10g of fat.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical experience and reports from families of children with type 1 diabetes has long suggested that meals high in protein and/or fat cause an increase in blood glucose levels after eating.  Increased blood glucose levels, including after consumption of food, is well-known to add to long term health complications in type 1 diabetes.   Current type 1 diabetes management guidelines recommend adjusting insulin doses for food based on the amount of carbohydrate to be eaten at each meal.  However, there has been an increase in evidence, including that from a recent study by our study group, to suggest that other nutrients such as fat and protein should be considered when calculating pre meal insulin. High levels of protein and/or fat in a meal cause a larger than expected rise in blood glucose levels after eating and these high blood glucose levels persist, suggesting the need for extra insulin.

This research project will compare the insulin required to maintain blood glucose levels at a constant level when consuming two meals, one high in protein and the other low in protein.  This will be determined by looking at the difference in intra venous insulin requirements after both meals. IV insulin will be given to participants to maintain blood glucose levels at a constant level whilst they are eating the meal and in the 5 hours following.  Fifteen participants will consume both a high protein and a low protein meal, at least one week apart.  The different insulin amounts needed to maintain blood glucose levels after each test meal will provide accurate calculation of the expected increase in insulin requirements on consumption of a high protein meal.

This study will provide important information in the management of type 1 diabetes in both adults and children.  This information will be used immediately in our day to day management of patients and will guide the development of clinical guidelines to minimize the rise in blood glucose levels after eating.
