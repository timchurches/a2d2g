  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of direct oral amoxicillin challenge of low risk hospital inpatients - patients will be clinically monitored for one hour after their dose of amoxicillin. Clinical outcomes which will be monitored for include rash, change in blood pressure (measured with sphygmomanometer) or heart rate (pulse oximeter), breathing difficulties or wheeze, facial swelling, and any other symptoms patient's report. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Patient's will only be monitored for an hour after the dose. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>feasibility of penicillin allergy testing in the acute hospital inpatient setting - this will be monitored in terms of ease of recruiting patients, and administering test amoxicillin doses during a patient's general medical admission, without obstructing their normal care. The outcome will be assessed by means of interviews with medical staff.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Penicillin allergy is reported by between 10 and 20% of hospital inpatients, However, fewer than 10% of these patients have allergy confirmed on formal testing. Being labelled as penicillin allergic carries a substantial burden. There is increased length of stay, cost, and adverse outcomes associated with penicillin allergy, a need for alternative antimicrobial agents, and potential for treatment failure and readmission. Accordingly, the recent Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) antimicrobial stewardship guidelines recommend reviewing patients antibiotic allergy status as an integral stewardship intervention. 
An immediate hypersensitivity or IgE mediated reaction is normally excluded by skin testing, followed by an oral challenge, as recommended by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA). Skin testing requires: (i) specific reagents, some of which are in short supply, and (ii) expertise and manpower to execute, and is thus not always feasible in a busy hospital setting. Skin tests are positive in between 0.8% and 4% and of patients.  Of patients with a negative skin test given an oral challenge, only 0.8% to 1.5% of patients experience reactions, typically cutaneous rather than anaphylactic.  
 
A recent study challenged 328 low risk penicillin allergic outpatients with a single dose of oral amoxicillin, without  prior skin testing. There were only 5 (1.5%) cutaneous reactions, with no episodes of anaphylaxis. There have been no studies assessing direct oral challenge of hospital inpatients, but successful approaches utilising skin testing to determine allergy status in hospital inpatients. 
Based on this data and the low rate of 'true' allergy in the form of immediate hypersensitivity amongst reportedly penicillin allergic patients, we feel that it should be feasible to administer an oral challenge to carefully selected low risk hospital inpatients. The ASCIA guidelines suggest that in cases where the clinical history does not suggest an IgE mediated allergy, skin testing is not required, and a direct oral challenge may be given. This will enable a more proactive, real time stewardship intervention than skin testing, which is often delayed to the outpatient setting.  </summary>
