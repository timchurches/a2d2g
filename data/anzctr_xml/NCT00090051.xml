    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) - Progression-free survival as assessed by the IRC was defined as the time between randomization and the date of first documented disease progression, relapse after response, or death from any cause, whichever came first. Patients without a PFS event were censored at their last tumor assessment date.</outcome>
