    <studytitle>Whanau Pakari: a multidisciplinary intervention for child and adolescent obesity.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In children and adolescents with a body mass index (BMI) of &gt;99th percentile, do those who are assessed as "ready for change", and receive a multi-disciplinary intervention programme improve their BMI, physical activity, dietary behaviour, and attitude towards healthy eating more than those "ready for change" who receive current standard of care?</scientifictitle>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a lack of clinical research looking at interventions for child and adolescent obesity with long-term follow-up, especially in New Zealand.  This study aims to improve local obesity services for 5-16 year olds in the Taranaki region, and assess whether the devised intervention programme shows benefits in those participants that are assessed as ready to make healthy lifestyle changes.  The intervention programme involves physical activity, dietary education, and psychology input.  It will run for one year, but follow-up will be for two years.  The benefits that are hoped to be found are improvement in health measures such as body mass index, weight, physical fitness and activity, improved diet, and improved attitude to making healthy lifestyle choices.  It is important that this service is assessed through a trial to ensure the intervention is better than current standard of care, and to ensure long-term funding for the service.</summary>
