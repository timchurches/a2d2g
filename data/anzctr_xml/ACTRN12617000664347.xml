    <interventions>The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine give twice daily for three days according to the recommended weight bands as follows: 1 tablet (20/120 mg) to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. The total target dose ranges are 5-24 mg/kg bw of artemether and 29-144 mg/kg bw of lumefantrine.
All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker and will be taken with fatty food e.g. milk. The patient will be given artemether+lumefantrine and will be followed up for 28 days.</interventions>

Extracted total nucleic acid from day 0 filter paper blood spots will be subjected to nested PCR for the detection of K13 gene. Subsequently, PCR products will be further subjected to DNA sequencing using BigDye terminator chemistry. DNA sequences will be assembled and mutations will be verified by inspection of both forward and reverse strands using BioEdit software version 7. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>As the treatment failure rate to Artemether-Lumefantrine in the area is &lt;5%, 5% has been chosen. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study. 
A Microsoft excel database provided by WHO will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis. In addition to the reasons for withdrawal listed in section 3.8, patients will be considered withdrawn from the analysis if the PCR results are unclassifiable or if the results of PCR indicate that the failure is due to reinfection with P. falciparum or P. vivax.
The final analysis will include:
1.	a description of all patients screened and the distribution of reasons for non-inclusion in the study;
2.	a description of all the patients included in the study;
3.	the proportion of adverse events and serious adverse events in all the patients included in the study;
4.	the proportion of patients lost to follow-up or withdrawn, with 95% confidence intervals and a list of reasons for withdrawal;
5.	the cumulative incidence of success and failure rates at day 28, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected; and
6.	the proportion of early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response at day 28, with 95% confidence intervals, PCR-uncorrected and PCR-corrected.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy of Artemether-Lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gurney Health Centre, Alotau, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea. 
Purpose: Ongoing therapeutic efficacy surveillance of current first line antimalarial treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. 
Objective: To assess the current efficacy and safety of Artemether-Lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.
Study Sites: Gurney Health Centre, Alotau, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea 
Study Period: April to December 2017.
Study Design: One arm prospective study.
Patient population: Febrile patients aged between minimum 6 months and maximum 60 years, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Within the defined age group, no particular age will be exempted. Both male and female will be recruited; however, pregnant women will be excluded from the study. 
Sample Size: Target number of patients to be recruited is 88. 
Treatment(s) and follow-up: Artemether-Lumefantrine is available as a fixed-dose formulation with dispersible or standard tablets containing 20 mg of artemether and 120 mg of lumefantrine. The recommended treatment is a 6-dose regimen over a 3-day period. The treatment dosage ranges from 1.4-4 mg/kg of artemether and 10-16 mg/kg of lumefantrine. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy. All artemether-lumefantrine are to be taken with fatty food.  
Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events
Optional exploratory endpoints: The polymorphism of molecular markers for arteamisinin resistance (K13) and  piperaquine resistance (plasmepsin-2).
