    <interventions>This study will use a pre-post design to explore the possibility of an effect of berry juice on the severity of acne/eczema. The juice will be a Canadian-produced juice containing red raspberry, blueberry, blackberry, boysenberry, cranberry, blackcurrant, elderberry, fucoidan, bladderwrack, ulva, fructose, and potassium sorbate. Enrolled patients will be given a 2 week washout period prior to beginning their course of berry juice in order to ensure previous acne/eczema medications are absent from the body. A baseline measure will be taken. Patients will be then be provided with a 6 week course of berry juice. They will drink 3oz of juice daily. At the end of the 6 weeks, severity of acne/eczema will be measured.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A significant body of research has been dedicated to addressing the antioxidant activity associated with consuming berries and other foods.  Studies have purported the anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial activity of these berries and foods.  Multi-berry juices have emerged trying to combine concentrated amounts of various berries in attempt to maximize the antioxidant properties.

Traditionally, berries and multi-berry drinks have been used as home remedies to improve such conditions as skin rashes and bowel disorders.   However, there are only a small number of studies that address the clinical benefits of multi-berry drinks and even a smaller number of studies specifically addressing skin and bowel disorders.

More and more patients are trying these antioxidant beverages.  How do primary care physicians make sense of the research so that they can provide recommendations to these patients?</summary>
