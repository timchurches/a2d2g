  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether vitamin B supplementation can reduce the incidence of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage) in patients diagnosed with cancer. 

Who is it for?
You can join this study if you have been recently diagnosed with cancer for which you have been prescribed chemotherapy treatment with the drug paclitaxel, vincristine or oxaliplatin.

Trial details
Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group will take 2 capsules of vitamin B complex daily 1 week before chemotherapy treatment for 9 months. The other group will be given 2 capsules of a placebo (sugar capsule) to take daily for 9 months. 

Patients will be assessed at three timepoints over the study duration to evaluate neuropathy, quality of life, pain, and levels of vitamin B in the blood.</summary>
