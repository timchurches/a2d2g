Active Comparator: Physiotherapy - 

No Intervention: Control - Women allocated to the Control group will only receive, by post, the same Lifestyle Advice Sheet as the intervention group.


Other interventions: Pelvic Floor Muscle training
Women allocated to the intervention group will have five appointments with a specialist women's health physiotherapist (intervention physiotherapist) over 16 weeks who will prescribe a daily exercise programme and provide a Lifestyle Advice Sheet (focusing on weight loss, constipation, avoidance of heavy lifting, coughing and high-impact exercise) and relevant tailored advice (phase 1).
Thereafter women in the intervention group will be offered Pilates-based classes, including PFMT, as maintenance (phase 2). Classes will be led by a physiotherapist who has undertaken Pilates training and will take place in six week blocks; each woman will be offered two six week blocks over a year. An exercise DVD will be provided for home use. Each woman will be offered a one-to-one review physiotherapy appointment at one and two years after randomisation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pelvic organ prolapse is a problem experienced by women where a bulge comes down in the
      vagina, and may even drop down outside the vagina. The bulge in the vagina is caused by other
      organs moving down from their normal position in the pelvis and pushing into the vagina. This
      is a very common problem and many women who have given birth will have a very mild bulge
      which does not cause them symptoms. Women can however experience a variety of pelvic,
      bladder, bowel and sexual symptoms which impact on daily life. No research studies have
      properly examined whether or not exercises can prevent prolapse. This study aims to explore
      whether exercises taught by a physiotherapist can prevent women developing a prolapse which
      requires them to have treatment.</summary>
