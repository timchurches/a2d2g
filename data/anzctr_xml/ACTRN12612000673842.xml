  <interventions>
    <interventions>Students in school years 11 to 13 were recruited from 11 secondary schools in the Otago region during school terms 1 and 2 of 2011. Participants completed a single administration of a web-based questionnaire collecting information on demographics, food choice, physical activity and correlates of food choice, physical activity and physical fitness. The questionnaire was designed to be completed in one class period.  Data on height, weight, waist circumference and body composition by bioimpedance also collected during the same class period. The following single physical fitness measurements are also taken in a subset of participants: shuttle run, sit and reach test and abdominal curl ups. These were taken during a separate class period either on the same day as the questionnaire was completed (in the majority of cases), or within a week of questionnaire completion.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research has shown that whilst poor diet, a lack of physical activity and poor physical fitness are all associated with excess weight in adolescents, there is a lack of data from studies that investigate all of these factors combined. Therefore we collected information on diet and physical activity and correlates of these in 1000 15 to 18 year old school students in Dunedin during term 1 of 2011. Data on physical fitness was also collected in a subset of participants.  The findings from this study may allow us to develop interventions in adolescents to promote sustainable obesity-preventing lifestyles.</summary>
