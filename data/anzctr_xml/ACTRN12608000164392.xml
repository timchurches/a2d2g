  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves 12 50-minute sessions and includes: education about headaches and depression; relaxation training; scheduling pleasant activities; social skills training; training to challenge dysfunctional thoughts and underlying beliefs; problem solving training; identifying and managing headache triggers; training in pain management techniques; lifestyle management; and relapse prevention training.</interventions>
    <comparator>Routine primary care - participants in this group will be case managed by their GPs as they would in the absence of the study, with small variations. No attempt will be made to restrict GPs in terms of prescribed medication but records of prescribed medication will be maintained.</comparator>

After individuals have consented to taking part in the study and been assessed as meeting the eligibility criteria for the study, they will be referred to an Associate Investigator for allocation to the treatment conditions. This Associate Investigator will not meet any of the participants or have any information about them, as his role will be restricted to the allocation to treatment conditions and subsequent statistical analysis of data.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated sequence will be used following the CONSORT guidelines. A stratified randomisation procedure will be used to allocate subjects to the two conditions, with stratification based on diagnosis (migraine versus tension-type headache).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Numerous studies have demonstrated comorbidity between migraine and tension-type headache on the one hand, and depression on the other. It is not clear whether this reflects a causal relationship between headaches and depression or common predispositional factors. Presence of depression is a negative prognostic indicator for behavioral treatment of headaches. Despite the recognised comorbidity, there is limited research literature evaluating interventions designed for comorbid headaches and depression. Sixty six participants (49 female, 17 male) suffering from migraine and/or tension-type headache and major depressive disorder were randomly allocated to a Cognitive Behavior Therapy program, or a control group (Routine Primary Care). The treatment program involved 12 weekly 50-minute sessions administered by clinical psychologists. Participants in the treatment and control groups significantly differed from baseline to post-treatment on measures of headaches, depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Improvements achieved with treatment were maintained at four month follow-up. Changes in headaches and depression were not significantly correlated suggesting that the relationship between them may not be causal. Comorbid anxiety disorders were not a predictor of response to treatment, and the only significant predictor was gender (men improved more than women). The new integrated treatment program appears promising and worthy of further investigation.</summary>
