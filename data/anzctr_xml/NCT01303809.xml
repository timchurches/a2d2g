Active Comparator: ERAS - The perioperative management of the patients in this arm will be according to a fast-track protocol designed by the investigators. The preoperative component of this program is the same as routine practice. Intraoperative and postoperative components which are different to routine practice are as described in the intervention section. This protocol is based on current literature regarding Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS).

No Intervention: non ERAS - The perioperative management of patients in this arm will be according to routine practice currently implemented at our institution.


Other interventions: Enhanced Recovery After Surgey for Sleeve Gastrectomy
Intraoperative:
Pre-op carbohydrate loading
No pre-op GIK while NBM
Pre-medication
Dexamethasone 4mg as antiemetic, IV Paracetamol (first dose) Parecoxib 40mg
Ondansetron regularly for first 48 hours and Cyclizine, Droperidol or Scopaderm as rescue antiemetics
Fluid restriction
Standardised method of anaesthesia
Give 40ml 0.5% bupivacaine with adrenaline administered prior to placement of laparoscopic port sites
10ml 0.75% ropivacaine diluted to 50ml with 0.9% normal saline solution administered to surgical site prior to procedure
Postoperative:
Rescue PCA for up to 12 hours. Oxynorm 5mg for rescue pain. Oxycontin 20mg bd/prn postoperatively
Maintenance IV fluids (60ml/hr plasmalyte to be stopped 0800 day 1 post op). Clear oral fluids 2 hours post op. Bariatric free oral fluids morning of day 1
Post operative oxygenation
Incentive spirometry
Drains (e.g. IDC) removed in recovery
Full mobilisation 4-8 hours post op)
Early Follow up

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The investigators wish to standardise and optimise perioperative care for consecutive
      patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for weight loss. The investigators will
      compare patients under a standardised perioperative care program to patients who undergo
      routine perioperative in our hospital and determine whether patients who had optimised
      perioperative care went home earlier and had fewer complications.</summary>
