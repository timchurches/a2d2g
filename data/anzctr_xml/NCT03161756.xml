    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Denosumab
Treatment: drugs - Nivolumab
Treatment: drugs - Ipilimumab

Active Comparator: Arm A - Patients in Arm A will receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks for 4 doses and denosumab 120 mg subcutaneously (SC) D1, D8, D15, D29 (induction phase). Thereafter, nivolumab 480 mg IV (maintenance phase) and denosumab 120 mg SC every 4 weeks for a total of 24 months.

Active Comparator: Arm B - Patients in Arm B will receive ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg combined with nivolumab at 1 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 4 doses with denosumab 120 mg SC given D1, D8, D15, D29, D57 (induction phase). This will be followed by nivolumab 480 mg IV (maintenance phase) and denosumab 120 mg SC ever 4 weeks for a total of 24 months.


Treatment: drugs: Denosumab
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin type 2 (IgG2) antibody that binds with high affinity and specificity to RANK ligand (RANKL) and neutralises the activity of human RANKL, similar to the action of endogenous osteoprotegerin (OPG). Denosumab binding prevents the activation of RANK and inhibits the formation, activation, and survival of osteoclasts. As a consequence, bone resorption and cancer-induced bone destruction are reduced.

Treatment: drugs: Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a human monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed death-1 (PD-1) cluster of differentiation 279 (CD279) cell surface membrane receptor. Nivolumab inhibits the interaction of PD-1 with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, resulting in enhanced T-cell proliferation and interferon-gamma (IFN-?) release in vitro.

Treatment: drugs: Ipilimumab
Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin specific for human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which is expressed on a subset of activated T cells. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody(mAb) that binds to CTLA-4 and blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands, cluster of differentiation antigen 80 / cluster of differentiation antigen 86 (CD80 / CD86). Blockade of CTLA-4 has been shown to augment T-cell activation and proliferation, including the activation and proliferation of tumor-infiltrating T-effector cells.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this project is to test the addition of a new treatment called denosumab to
      standard immunotherapies for patients with metastatic melanoma. Denosumab has been used for
      many years to help treat cancers such as prostate cancer and breast cancer, but it is not
      currently used in melanoma. We hope the addition of denosumab to current melanoma therapies
      will make these treatments work better without adding to the side effects.

      Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or over and
      have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread).

      Study details: Nivolumab and ipilimumab are approved treatments for advanced melanoma in
      Australia and overseas. Patients with metastatic melanoma, who are not enrolled in a study,
      are commonly prescribed nivolumab alone or the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab as
      standard care. However, there is limited information on the effectiveness and safety of these
      treatments in combination with denosumab. Recent melanoma research in animal models has shown
      that denosumab can make immunotherapies such as ipilimumab and nivolumab work better. Because
      denosumab has been used in patients with breast and prostate cancer for a long time and is
      safe, we now want to test the benefits and safety of adding denosumab to immunotherapies in
      this study.</summary>
