  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ketamine. During 4-week RCT and 4-week open label extension phase with 1 month break between the two phases, A follow up is scheduled 1 month after the end of RCT where participants will be further screened for eligibility (as per RCT criteria) to enter the open label phase with the only difference being that participants are not blinded to the drug administered.

Ketamine (concentration 100mg/mL) will be administered via subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 4 weeks in each phase. Dosage will range 0.25-0.5 mL depending on body weight.

Weight	 Dosage
42-50 kg	 0.25 mL
51-70 kg	 0.3 mL
71-90 kg	 0.4 mL
equal to or greater than 91 kg	 0.5 mL

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine if a course of ketamine is an effective therapy for depression. The study will also determine if repeated ketamine doses: 1) are safe, tolerable and feasible in outpatient settings; 2) provide sustained antidepressant benefits; 3) improve anxiety, suicidal ideation and health related quality of life; 4) are a cost effective treatment. 200 participants will be recruited across 6 sites in Australia (Black Dog Institute, Sydney; Brain and Mind Centre, Sydney; Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre, Melbourne; South Eastern Private Hospital, Noble Park; University of Adelaide; Adelaide and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital; Perth) and 1 in New Zealand (Dunedin, Otago). The study is a randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to receive repeated doses of ketamine or a comparator treatment. For all participants, a follow-up assessment after finishing the randomised controlled phase will assess eligibility for an open label extension phase. All participants will be followed up after exiting the trial to assess treatment effects.</summary>
