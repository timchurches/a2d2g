  <interventions>
    <interventions>One informal one-to-one discussion of 15 - 20 minutes, between the researcher and pregnant women at 20 or fewer weeks gestation, covering lifestyle and diet, in which the benefits of eating fish, especially oily fish, were emphasised. The interviewees were all attending antenatal clinic at a UK hospital for the first time in that pregnancy and had no apparent complications of this pregnancy to date. The intervention was in addition to the standard antenatal care offerd by the hospital clinic.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The hospital files of pregnant women who were to make their first visit to the antenatal clinic at the hospital were checked by the researcher, and all eligible women were given information and consent forms by the antenatal clinic receptionists upon registration at the clinic reception desk. The researcher then approached these women individually and asked if they would take part in the study, if necessary reading the letter to them or providing further explanation. Women who did not wish to participate were thanked for reading the letter and were not made to feel uncomfortable about their refusal. Those who signed the consent forms were given a numbered, opaque envelope to open that contained a letter informing them that they were, or were not to be interviewed. Consent forms were noted with ‘intervention’ or ‘control’ and the number of the envelope, and were filed in the patients’ hospital notes. 

Women allocated to the control group were thanked for their participation and assured that their baby’s birth details would be of importance to the study. The researcher explained to intervention group women that she would be talking to them about pregnancy and that she would find them after their ultrasound scans, while they were waiting to see the doctor. Women randomised to the intervention group were duly identified and collected from the waiting area of the antenatal clinic following ultrasound scans but before seeing the consultant.</concealment>
    <sequence>Women agreeing to participate were randomised either to standard antenatal care plus a discussion or to standard antenatal care only. Letters allocating women to either intervention (I) or control (C) groups were placed in opaque sealed envelopes by someone unconnected with the trial. The envelopes were numbered consecutively in accordance with lists of randomly created blocks of 5, using the throw of a die, producing allocation sequences such as ICICI or IICIC.  The 3:2 randomisation was chosen to maximise the researchers' time for interviewing in clinic.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research findings  indicate that pregnant women should increase their intake of oily fish before, during and after pregnancy and that they should breastfeed. Despite this advice, no direct evidence exists that increased oily fish intake during pregnancy is beneficial to birth outcomes. In addition the possible effectiveness of personalised dietary advice given to women antenatally has been little-investigated. The nutritional advice approach differs from that of fish oil supplementation as eating fish is a dietary choice and oily fish may have effects differing from those of supplementation because of the many nutrients present in addition to omega-3 fatty acids. 

In an study carried out at Whipps Cross Hospital by Dr Michel Odent a single discussion session was held at or before 20 weeks gestation, at which stage of pregnancy, the brain growth spurt and rapid endothelial growth begin, that focused on an increased intake of oily fish and a reduced intake of trans-fatty acids. Trends to greater birthweight, head circumference, body length and to a lower incidence of low birthweight were observed. Thus the effect of giving advice to pregnant women to increase intake of oily fish was sufficiently positive to indicate the value of further study. Controlled prospective studies exploring the effect of encouraging consumption of oily fish and a reduction in the intake of trans-fatty acids have not been carried out. 

The benefits of improving maternal nutrition before and during pregnancy and throughout lactation are many. The health of the baby is dependent on maternal nutrition and there is evidence to suggest that small birth size is a major contributor to the cause of adult disease, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, type II diabetes and renal disease.  Treating and caring for people with coronary heart disease costs Britain about £7billion each year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and the cost of caring for patients with type II diabetes is estimated by Diabetes UK to be £3.5billion annually.  There are clear public health benefits in reducing the incidence of low birthweight and consequently the prevalence of these debilitating and costly diseases.
It is hypothesised that a one-to-one informal discussion with pregnant women before 20 weeks gestation, emphasising the benefits to mother and fetus of oily fish consumption, will result in improved birth outcomes.</summary>
