  <interventions>
    <interventions>BrainHQ developed by PositScience Corporation, which  is a neuroplasticity based computerised cognitive training programme designed to enhance and restore auditory perceptual and working memory processes,  will be used for cognitive training in the intervention group (40 participants).  The neuroscience informed approach facilitates training induced neuroplasticity through neuro-adaptive drill and practice exercises which are engaging, rewarding and uses a hierarchical approach to exercise structures. 

Selected participants in the  intervention group will  engage in 40 hours of cognitive training at the rate of one hour daily, four to five times weekly,  over a period of 8-10 weeks using the Posit Science BrainHQ programme. Laptops and internet connection with access to BrainHQ will be provided for the duration of the study and participants can do the cognitive training at their residence.  Once participants engage in  40 hours of BrainHQ training they will be considered as having completed training.
Project Officer/s (PO) who are  qualified occupational therapists or mental health nurses or clinical psychologists and who have experience with cognitive training will be recruited for  the purpose of this research project. The PO will assist participants to familiarise with the BrainHQ programme, set up the training package and problem solve any issues for the first 3 sessions face to face.  Subsequently the PO will provide telephone support (and face to face support, if required) 2- 3 times a week for the duration of the training. The PO will have access to the participants progress and amount of training carried out as an administrator of the BrainHQ.  PO will contact the participant to discuss progress, encourage participation, and resolve any training issues. If any clinical concern is observed by the PO or raised by the participant it will be brought to the attention of the treating team. Participant or the treating psychiatrist  can take a decision to withdraw the participant from the cognitive training  at any stage.  
For this study we will be recruiting only  people with schizophrenia who are involved in the   Individual Placement and Support (IPS) Programme. Participants in both the intervention and control group will be enrolled in the IPS. IPS  is an evidence based  model of providing vocational rehabilitation that integrates mental health services and employment services.   It has been demonstrated through evidence around the world that IPS services are obtaining better outcomes for mental health consumers in employment rates, time to commencement of first job and number of hours worked. The IPS approach has eight key principals - focus on competitive employment, integration of employment specialists with mental health treatment teams, zero exclusion, individualised job search based on consumer preferences, rapid job search, benefits counselling, systematic job development and time unlimited and individualised support. In Western Australia,  in the past few years,  many public mental health services have entered into partnership with Disability Employment Providers to establish IPS Programmes as part  of clinical services for people with severe mental illness.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22. Between groups differences for continuously distributed variables will be assessed using independent samples t-test.  Ordinal and nominal data will be treated using non-parametric procedures. p values less than 0.05 will be considered as significant. 

Power calculations
Power calculations were  conducted using GPower (version 3.1.9.2). Since our study involves multiple outcome measures we have modelled various scenarios in order to find out the optimal total sample size which will provide a reasonable balance of power and expected effect sizes. . Modelling has taken into account two parameters: total sample size (from 40 to 80 with equal groups) and effect size (% difference between groups in range from 15% to 40%). For example, with the total size of 60 (30 subjects in each group) 30-35% observed difference in employment rate will have enough statistical power. If effect size (% difference) is expected to be lower (e.g., 25%), then 40 subjects in each group is a minimum to attain the required statistical power greater than 70%.     

  
We expect the difference in number of days employed to be 25-30% between the groups. On the basis of this modelling, we conclude that our study should involve a minimum of 80 subjects, ideally 40 in each group. This total sample size will survive a slight subjects attrition during study life. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite improvements in treatments and psychosocial interventions, workforce participation by people with psychotic illness remains low.  In Australia, nearly 90% of people with psychotic illnesses receive income through government benefits and less than one third participate in paid employment. Unemployment rates for people with psychotic illness are five times greater than those in the general population. Work is highly valued and has many beneficial effects for people with schizophrenia.  Some studies suggest that stability of work may reduce psychiatric hospitalisation.  Increased productivity and reduction in hospitalisation has potential to reduce healthcare costs associated with these conditions.  
Individual Placement and Support programmes have been shown to improve job placement, hours worked and job retention for people with severe mental illnesses, however a significant proportion of those accessing this intervention still do not achieve employment.  IPS services were established at various South and North Metropolitan Health  sites though partnerships with DES providers since 2013.  
Cognitive and functional deficits are prevalent among people with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia and robust links between cognitive deficits (CD) and poor community functioning have been consistently demonstrated.  Recently, neuroplasticity based cognitive training (CT) has shown promising results in people with schizophrenia. However, the effectiveness of CT to improve employment outcomes among these people has not been well researched.  It is unclear whether CT would lead to improved occupational functioning and employment outcomes when offered as adjunctive therapy to IPS participation.  
We plan to evaluate whether delivering IPS and CT programmes in an integrated manner will further improve cognition, work and other functional outcomes over a one year period in people with schizophrenia.  Further, we will ascertain whether these improvements translate into reduced need for psychiatric hospitalisation.
We aim to recruit 80 adult patients with schizophrenia who are involved with the IPS programmes at 4 metropolitan sites for the study: Bentley Health Service; Peel and Rockingham Kwinana Mental Health Service; Osborne Community Mental Health Service and Swan Community Mental Health Service. Participants will be randomly allocated to 2 groups; one group will receive IPS service without CT and the second group will receive IPS and 40 hours of computer based CT using BrainHQ software. Socio-demographic data, clinical and work history, symptoms (psychotic, negative, depressive and anxiety), cognition and community functioning will be evaluated at baseline, after CT (or 8-10 weeks for the non-CT group) and 12 months after interventions in both groups. Similarly, occupational outcomes such as number of competitive jobs obtained, days worked and pay rates and healthcare expenses such as number and days of psychiatric hospitalisation in the 12 month period will be assessed in both groups. Between groups differences for continuously distributed variables will be assessed using independent samples t-test or analysis of covariance. Ordinal and nominal data will be treated using non-parametric procedures. 
The health economist involved with this study will calculate governmental cost savings by calculating expenses and savings through reduced psychiatric hospitalisation and extrapolating these figures to patients with schizophrenia cared for by WA Health. Productivity gains will also be calculated separately. If we find that integrating CT and IPS have promising benefits, we plan to embark on a study with larger sample size and longer follow up periods accessing national funding sources and advocate for the implementation of these programmes into evidence based clinical practice for people with schizophrenia.
