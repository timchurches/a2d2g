  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eleven female breast cancer survivors (age = 41  62 years old) who had completed chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy treatment performed Resistance Band Exercise (RBE) for strength training and Aerobic Zumba Dance (AZD) for cardiovascular training for six weeks. Participants took part in RBE (eight exercises for chest, arms, legs, back and abdominal) three times a week for 30 minutes per session and AZD 60 minutes once a week per session. Both RBE and AZD were conducted in a group. RBE is conducted by exercise physiologist including me and AZD is conducted by a dance instructor. Pre and post measurement on VO2 (ml/kg/min), knee and shoulder peak torque (N-m) and BIA including BMI, Skeletal Muscle Mass (SMM), percent body fat (PBF) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were measured.  </interventions>

Statistical significance levels for all comparisons was set a priori of alpha=0.05. Paired sample-test was used to analyse pre and post mean difference with 95% CI for outcome changes. Health and fitness levels were determined based on VO2 peak values index for Astrand protocol. VO2 peak values index for healthy sedentary individuals are = &gt;37ml/kg/min.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Abstract
Purpose: To examine the effects of short term resistance band exercise (RBE) with aerobic Zumba dance (AZD) on breast cancer survivors health and fitness recovery after completion of their adjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy.
Methods: Eleven female breast cancer survivors (age = 41  62 years old) who had completed chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy treatment performed RBE for strength training and AZD for cardiovascular training for six weeks. Participants took part in RBE (eight exercises for chest, arms, legs, back and abdominal) three times a week and AZD 60 minutes once a week. Pre and post measurement on VO2 (ml/kg/min), knee and shoulder peak torque (N-m) and BIA including BMI, Skeletal Muscle Mass (SMM), percent body fat (PBF) and waist to hip ratio (WHR) were measured.  
Results: Improvements were found in VO2peak = 9.9 +/- 17.6% (p &gt; 0.05), SMM = 2 +/- 7.54% (p &gt; 0.05), BMI reduced 0.49 +/- 1.1 points (p &gt; 0.05), PBF reduced 1.8 +/- 5.22% (p &gt; 0.05) and WHR reduced 0.1 point ratio, lower body (Knee) peak N-m showed improvements in both extension 3.67 +/- 14.04%  (p &gt; 0.05) and flexion 3.63 +/- 2.22% (p &gt; 0.05) and upper body (Shoulder) peak N-m showed no improvements in external and internal rotation.
Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that six weeks of AZD programme can improve health and fitness recovery in breast cancer survivors. RBE can be used initially for reconditioning upper and lower body strength. 
Practical Implication: AZD and RBE can improve recovery in lower body strength and cardiovascular health and fitness. However, longer training is needed to improve upper body strength, especially involving the shoulder, in breast cancer survivors.
