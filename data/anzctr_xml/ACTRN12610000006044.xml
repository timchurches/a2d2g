  <interventions>
    <interventions>Single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy:
All operations were performed under general anaesthesia in the supine position with the operating surgeon on the patients left side. The sub-umbilical incision 20 mm in size was made by open technique. SILS (trademark) Port (Covidien) was inserted then. The SILS (trademark) Port is a flexible laparoscopic port that can accommodate up to three instruments through a single incision. The abdominal cavity was insufflated to a pneumoperitoneum of 12mmHg, and a 30 degrees laparoscope was then inserted.  The patients were placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position, with the right side elevated. Instruments were then inserted through the rest of two 5 mm channels. The principal of surgery is same as the conventional 4-ports approach. Calots triangle was retracted under the help of two slings of sutures over the fundus and Hartmans pouch. The cystic artery was dissected and transected after bipolar diathermy coagulation. The cystic duct was dissected and transected after endo-clips or endo-tie control. The gallbladder was dissected from gallbladder bed. The specimen was placed inside the retrieval bag and removed through the sub-umbilical port.
Approximate duration 1 hour</interventions>
    <comparator>Four ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy:
All operations were performed under general anaesthesia in the supine position with the operating surgeon on the patients left side. The sub-umbilical incision 10 mm in size was made by open technique. Trocar was inserted. The abdominal cavity was insufflated to a pneumoperitoneum of 12mmHg, and a 30 degrees laparoscope was then inserted. The patients were placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position, with the right side elevated. Under direct vision, three 5-mm trocars were then placed in the right subcostal region along anterior axillary, midclavicular lines and sub-xiphoid region. Two graspers were passed through the two lateral ports to retract the fundus and Hartmanns pouch of the gall bladder. Instruments of matching calibre were used for the dissection around the Carlots triangle to expose both the cystic duct and cystic artery from the sub-xiphoid port. The cystic artery was dissected and transected after bipolar diathermy coagulation. The cystic duct was dissected and transected after endo-clips or endo-tie control. The gallbladder was dissected from gallbladder bed. The specimen was placed inside the retrieval bag and removed through the sub-umbilical port.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to compare the clinical outcome of single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus conventional four ports laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with gallbaldder stones or polyps.
Hypothesis: single port laparoscopic cholecystectomy has advantage of decreased scarring, decreased incisional pain, shorter hospitalization and faster functional recovery.</summary>
