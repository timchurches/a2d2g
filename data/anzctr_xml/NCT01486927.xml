Experimental: Recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) - 


Other interventions: rVIII-SingleChain
In Part 1 of the study, subjects received a single intravenous infusion of 50 IU/kg recombinant, single-chain coagulation factor VIII (rVIII-SingleChain) preceded by a 4-day washout period. In Parts 2 and 3 of the study, subjects received repeat injections of rVIII-SingleChain either as an on-demand or prophylaxis regimen at a dose and frequency determined by their study doctor. Subjects participating in the Part 3 PK analyses received a single infusion of 50 IU/kg rVIII-SingleChain and a repeat dose of the same strength of rVIII-SingleChain after 3 to 6 months. Subjects from Parts 2 and 3 participating in the surgical substudy received an individualized dose regimen of rVIII-SingleChain, based on the type of surgery and the clinical status of the subject.

Other interventions: Octocog alfa
In Part 1 of the study, subjects received a single intravenous infusion of 50 IU/kg of octocog alfa preceded by a 4-day washout period. Octocog alfa is the international nonproprietary name (INN) for recombinant human coagulation factor VIII.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Success - The investigator rated the efficacy of the treatment based on a 4-point rating scale "excellent, good, moderate or poor/no response". Efficacy ratings of "excellent" or "good" were considered treatment success for this end point; the percentage of bleeding events with a rating of excellent or good and the 95% confidence interval are presented. The denominator includes all treated bleeding events. The 95% confidence interval is based on a model to account for within-subject correlation.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment Success During the Peri-operative Surgical Sub-study - Subjects received rVIII-SingleChain before and during surgery based on the type of surgery and the clinical status of the subject.

Efficacy ratings of "excellent" or "good" were considered treatment success for this end point. The rate of success, defined as the percentage of surgeries with a rating of excellent or good for hemostatic efficacy on the surgical treatment scale is presented for the Surgical Population, based on the total number of surgeries (N=16) as denominator.</outcome>
