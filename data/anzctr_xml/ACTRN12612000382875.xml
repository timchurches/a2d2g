    <interventions>This study will evaluate the Physical Activity 4 Every1 (PA4E1) program - a multi-component physical activity intervention which aims to prevent the decline in moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) physical activity among students attending secondary schools in low-income communities. 
The program will provide students with an opportunity to increase their knowledge, skills and attitudes toward physical activity. The PA4E1 program was developed in reference to Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory and will target the following mediators of behaviour change: self-efficacy, social support, personal regulation of health behaviour, environmental perceptions, outcome expectations and expectancies.  The  intervention will be delivered within consenting intervention schools, with support from an in-school physical activity consultant. Based on the evidence from descriptive and experimental research the intervention will comprise the following components:

Formal Curriculum	
1. Implementation of teaching strategies to maximise student activity levels within physical education (PE) classes. Regular pedometer-based PE lessons and curriculum material will be introduced to assist students meet the recommended 50% of PE class time in MVPA. 
2. Implementation of annual individual physical activity plans in Health and Physical Education (HPE) that include: fitness assessments; long and short term personal goals for improving or maintaining regular physical activity; specific actions and timelines to achieve those goals; methods to be used to record actions and assess progress; and rewards for achieving goals. 
3. Modification of school policies that encourage low-active students to be more physically active. The policies within each intervention school will be reviewed with the aim of establishing policies that enhance physical activity, and modifying existing policies that may be inhibiting policies. 
4. Implementation of enhanced sports programs for all students. All students will be scheduled to participate in age appropriate 10 week programs during sport while they are in Years 7, 8 or 9. The sports programs will be based on Program X (for girls) and PALs (for boys), both of which have been shown to be efficacious. The programs include; health-related fitness activities, pedometers for self-monitoring, lunch-time activities (PALs only), information for parents, e-mail support (Program X only) and interactive seminars.  
5. Implementation of daily accessible evidence based PA programs for boys and girls during school breaks including increasing the availability of facilities and equipment. 

Partnerships and Services
6. Implementation of weekly accessible after-school PA programs through linkages with community sporting groups or fitness industry.
7. Parent engagement: A number of strategies will be employed to encourage parents to; increase their childrens physical activity, be active with their children at home and in the community. Regular information will be sent to parents via existing schools newsletters and newly developed program newsletters to support the activities occurring within the school.

The overall duration in which these interventions will be applied is 1.5 school years.</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait list control. Students in the control group will receive standard treatment (i.e. regular school sport program and health and physical education curriculum) during the intervention period. Following the intervention period, the control schools will receive an evaluation report along with the materials and equipment required to self deliver the intervention strategies at their own pace.</comparator>

    <concealment>Secondary schools within the study region that meet the following criteria will be considered eligible: Government and Catholic schools; classified as being disadvantaged by the SEIFA Index of Relative Socio-Economic Advantage/Disadvantage; have between 120-200 Year 7 students (in order to provide adequate sample size); within a 2.5 hour radius of the study team; and are not participating in other major physical activity or health intervention studies will be included in the sampling frame. Ten secondary schools that meet this criteria will be invited to participate in the study. A random number function in Microsoft Excel will be used to determine the order in which eligible secondary schools are approached to participate in the study. A letter inviting schools to be involved in the project and detailing all levels of involvement by all parties will be sent to schools.  Approximately two weeks after the invitation letter is sent to the school, School Principals will be contacted by phone by a member of the research team and invited to participate in the study. A face-to-face meeting will be requested with both the Principal and the Head PE teacher to outline the requirements of the study and gain consent. Parents, students and PE staff will then be provided with information and consent letters.
Following baseline data collection, the school, parents and students will receive a letter from the study team outlining if the school will form part of the intervention or control group.
Randomization of the secondary schools will be undertaken by a statistician, not involved in contacting schools or in the study delivery and will occur after baseline data collection to reduce participation bias from students, teachers and researchers.</concealment>
