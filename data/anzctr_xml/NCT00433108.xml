  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, parallel design trial of two doses of mitoquinone
      mesylate (MitoQ) and of placebo in patients with chronic Hepatitis C.

      MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that rapidly permeates the lipid bilayer and
      accumulates within mitochondria in organs such as liver, brain, heart, skeletal muscle. There
      is strong evidence for increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage leading to
      apoptosis via caspase activation. Several studies have shown that MitoQ protects cells from
      apoptosis by acting as a caspase inhibitor and may be effective in reducing cell damage in
      liver disease.

      It is hypothesised that administration of MitoQ will lower raised ALT seen in patients with
      chronic Hepatitis C compared with placebo. Approximately 36 patients who have been
      unresponsive or not suitable for interferon-based therapy will be enrolled at one centre.
      Treatment duration will be 28 days with 28 days post-treatment follow-up.</summary>
