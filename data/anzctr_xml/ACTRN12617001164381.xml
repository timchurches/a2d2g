  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diabetic foot cellulitis will be confirmed histologically through tissue biopsy/debridement (group 1 = 25). Serum procalcitonin levels will be determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked fluorescent assay and will be compared with the histology report as a diagnostic marker at onset of the study and at week 6 and 12 to monitor response to the usual care. Subjects will receive the treatment fortnightly comprising the following as usual care: After debridement,  atraumatic dressing and nonadherent absorbent pad will be applied. Antibiotics will be administered based on microscopy, culture, and sensitivity results following deep wound swab and blood cultures. No additional treatment will be offered apart from the usual care. </interventions>

These conditions include hepatic, respiratory or cardiac failures, aplastic anemia, scleroderma and malignancy, treatment with immunosuppressive agents or steroids, myocardial infarcts, stroke, major surgery within 6 months of the study, or usage of tobacco
5.	Ulcer of a non-diabetic pathophysiology (e.g., rheumatoid, radiation-related, and vasculitis-related ulcers, calciphylaxis or dystrophic calcinosis cutis)
6.	Active malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma as well as  subjects with cancerous or pre-cancerous lesions in the ulcer area

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will be performed using the SAS 9.4 statistical package. Differences between the two groups will be tested using parametric or nonparametric methods according to the specific indications. Differences between the laboratory levels of the two groups at baseline will be measured using the Wilcoxon rank sum test in median. Data will be presented as mean +/standard deviation. In addition, analysis of variance for repeated measurements will be performed to test the timing effect of the studied parameters in the follow-up of the patients. The same analysis will be used to examine for differences during follow-up between patients with diabetic foot cellulitis and diabetic foot osteomyelitis. The GreenhouseGeisser adjustment will be used when the sphericity assumptions are not fulfilled. P values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

Cost effectiveness of procalcitonin test will be expressed as an Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which will be calculated as incremental costs divided by incremental effects. The results will be presented in cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Furthermore, prospective cost savings from use of procalcitonin monitoring foot ulcer healing of the 2 conditions will be conducted using a one-way sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of findings in net savings.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetic foot bone infection (osteomyelitis) is among the most common causes of leg amputation and prolonged hospitalization among Australians. Early and prompt diagnosis and treatment of osteomyelitis is crucial to reducing hospital admissions and limb amputations. Currently the tests that are used to confirm osteomyelitis are either costly (MRI, bone scan), not readily available at the time of immediate need (MRI) or ineffective (x-ray) in differentiating foot osteomyelitis from soft tissue foot infections (cellulitis). To date no simple laboratory test shown to reliably differentiate the 2 common form of diabetic foot infections cellulitis and osteomyelitis. 

Procalcitonin, a cheap, simple blood test for detecting and monitoring infections in other conditions is thought to be a useful test for diabetic foot infections. Blood level of procalcitonin has been reported to be markedly elevated in bone infections and lower levels in cellulitis. This study is designed to determine the role of procalcitonin in correctly distinguishing diabetic foot cellulitis from osteomyelitis and to assess levels that will be used to monitor response to treatment of both conditions.
