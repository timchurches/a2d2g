    <interventions>The intervention will consist of daily therapy for 25 minutes using the Nintendo Wii Fit. The Nintendo Wii Fit is a video game that is connected to the TV. It is an exercise game consisting of activities using a wireless pointer and balance board. It is designed to be a fun new way to exercise and includes activities that are designed to improve strength, balance and fitness. Activities include strength, balance and yoga activities and games such as 'tightrope walking'. The treating physiotherapist will prescribe and implement Wii Fit activities that are appropriate for the patient.Intervention will be provided for 1 month or until discharge from the Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEM).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive 25 minutes of traditional therapy daily. Traditional therapy may include practise of mobility, transfers and balance exercises and will be administered one-to-one by a physiotherapist.Intervention will be provided for 1 month or until discharge from the Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEM).</comparator>
