    <interventions>The intervention group will be given a health broker for the duration of the episode of otitis media (up to a maximum of 4 weeks). The health broker will act as a liaison between the health care providers and the family of the child with otitis media. The health broker will facilitate the family's adherence to the care plan for otitis media by: regular contact as required (e.g., weekly), assisting with travel, assisting with care arrangements for other children, assisting with purchasing antibiotics, assisting with appointment keeping</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard care over the trial period of 4 weeks. There are six Aboriginal Medical Services across NSW which are participating in the trial and start dates will be staggered but in each centre the children will be recruited over 4 weeks and the health broker will be involved for 4 weeks. At the end of the 4 week period of the trial the control group will be offered the health broker but this data will not be part of the intervention analysis.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adherence to the primary health care practitioner's written care plan for that episode of otitis media. This will be analysed in terms of adherence to antibiotic therapy and adherence to keeping planned appointments</outcome>
      <timepoint>The antibiotic adherence will be measured at the end of the planned antibiotic course. The appointment keeping will be measured at 1 month (retrospectively)</timepoint>

    <concealment>Families presenting to participating Aboriginal Medical Services or referred from their medical practitioners will be invited to enrol in SEARCH.  Once written consent has been obtained a SEARCH research assistant will contact the George Institute by phone. A pro-forma questionnaire will be completed over the phone in the presence of the family member. The George Institute will randomise the family to either the health broker or control group. The research assistant will record this information in the SEARCH database and inform the family. If the family is allocated to the health broker group the research assistant will inform the health broker as well. The Research assistant have been instructed not to discuss allocation with anyone other than the family member and health broker (for health broker allocations)</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The question is whether a health broker being involved in the care of a child with otitis media can improve the care of that child. This will be measured by seeing whether children with access to a health broker follow the doctor's care plan more closely than children without a health broker</summary>
