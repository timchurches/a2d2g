    <interventions>Administration of eribulin mesylate at a dose of 1.4 mg/m2 as an IV bolus infusion over 2-5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle, where the duration of each cycle is 21 days.

Leiomyosarcoma. 2. Documented evidence of advanced adipocytic or leiomyosarcoma, incurable by surgery and/or radiotherapy. 3. Subjects should have received at least two standard systemic regimens for advanced soft tissue sarcoma one of which must have included an anthracycline (unless contraindicated). 4. Radiographic evidence of disease progression within the 6 months prior to randomization. 5. Presence of measurable disease. 6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, performance status of 0, 1 or 2. 7. Adequate renal function. 8. Adequate bone marrow function. 9. Adequate liver function. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>1.

Subjects who have not recovered from acute toxicities as a result of prior anti-cancer therapy to =/&lt; Grade 1. 3. Subjects that have previously been treated with dacarbazine or participated in a study with eribulin. 4. Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTCAE Grade 2. 5.

    <sequence>The randomisation list was created prospectively using a bespoke computer program to create permuted blocks of a pre-defined size to ensure balance of subjects between the 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1.  The randomisation was stratified according to region, histology sub-type, and number of prior chemotherapy regimens, with separate lists being created for each strata combination.</sequence>
