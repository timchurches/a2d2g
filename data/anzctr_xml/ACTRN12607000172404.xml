  <interventions>
    <interventions>This trial will be a dose escalation of a single dose of clofazimine administered in a fixed volume of lipiodol. In eligible patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, a single injection of clofazimine in lipiodol (PI-166) will be administered via the hepatic artery. During the dose escalation phase, cohort size will be one patient. If a drug related toxicity is observed the cohort size will be expanded to 3 patients. The starting dose of clofazimine will be 3mg escalating to dose levels of 6, 10, 18, 30, 50, 75, 98, 120, 150 mg. Patients will be assessed for safety and tolerability for 4 weeks post the injection or until adverse events are resolved. The pharmacokinetics of clofazimine will also be assessed during this time. If the first dose of clofazimine in lipiodol injection is well tolerated patients may receive upto 3 additional doses at the same dose level, at intervals not less than 6 weeks between doses.</interventions>

      <outcome>1. to assess safety and tolerability of intrahepatic arterial injection of clofazimine in lipiodol injection. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be assessed for side effects related to the study treatment ( vital signs, full blood count, biochemistry etc) on day 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. On day 28 patients will undergo a CT scan/angiogram to assess the extent of the primary malignant disease and presence of metastatic disease following the study treatment based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria.</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. To assess the pharmacokinetics of clofazimine in lipiodol injection administered via intrahepatic arterial injection. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood will be drawn for pharmacokinetic studies at the following time points: immediately before the study drug is administered , at 1 and 4 hours and day 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 post study drug administration.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hepatocellualr carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal disease with few effective treatment options. It has been established that clofazimine can control the growth of HCC cell lines in vitro and in pre clinical animal models. This study aims to treat patients with unresectable primary HCC with escalating doses of clofazimine delivered in Lipiodol and administered via the hepatic artery under computerised tomography (CT) guidance. The maximum tolerated dose will be established using cohorts of one to six patients. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed in eligible patients. Each cycle of treatment will be 28 days in length and patients may receive up to 4 additional treatments if the study treatment is well tolerated. This study commenced recruitment in January 2003 and is currently recruiting patients into the final dose level cohort.</summary>
