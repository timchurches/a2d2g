Palbociclib will be administered continuously until documented disease progression,  intolerable toxicity or withdrawal for another reason.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary end point is disease control defined as a composite of: 
1.	Objective tumour response rate (OTRR), based on complete and partial responses using cancer specific response criteria; and/or 
2.	Time to progressive disease exceeds the documented time to progressive disease on the last treatment prior to substudy entry by at least 1.3 times (TTP2/TTP1 &gt; 1.3).

* Or exceeds 6 months if TTP1 is not evaluable. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>CT scans for disease evaluation will take place every 8 weeks until progression. 

Where disease evaluation is not based on CT scans alternative validated guidelines, such as Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria will be employed. 

Where radiological progression cannot be assessed, evidence for clinical progression will be documented.  These data will be collected from patient questionnaires or clinical reports to supplement the primary outcome. Health related quality of life during treatment will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 tool or the Brief Pain Inventory for patients with symptomatic disease as appropriate. 

Questionnaires will be administered at baseline and then every 4 weeks until progression.

Duration of the study is estimated at 2 years</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and tolerability of treatment (rates of adverse events) assessed according to CTC AE version 4.03.

Some, but not all, common expected adverse events include: tiredness, low white blood cells, nausea and/or vomiting, anaemia, diarrhoea or constipation. The patient information sheet will contain this information.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Male or female patients, aged 18 years and older, with pathologically confirmed advanced and/or metastatic solid cancer of any histologic type or an earlier diagnosis of a poor prognosis cancer; 
2. Received and failed all standard anticancer therapy (where standard therapy exists) or have documented unsuitability for any further standard anticancer therapy  with the exception of current therapy patient is receiving.

4. Willing and potentially able to comply with study requirements, including treatment, timing and/or nature of required assessments; It is the intention to screen patients who are in principle wishing to take part in a MoST substudy if they are found to have an appropriate tumour biomarker and are still eligible for enrolment at the time of the treatment phase;
5. Signed, written informed consent to participation in the molecular screening
Additional criteria for treatment on MoST substudy 1:
6. Subjects with tumours carrying somatic mutations in the Rb-pathway including amplification or activating mutations in CCND1, CCND2, CCND3 or CDK4, or loss of function mutations in CDKN2A;

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. Suitable for standard therapy or accepted standard care, if the patient has not been previously treated;
2. Specific comorbidities or conditions (e.g. psychiatric) or concomitant medications which may contraindicate participation and/or interact with the investigational product(s);
3. Other co-morbidities or conditions that may compromise assessment of key outcomes or in the opinion of the clinician, limit the ability of the patient to comply with the protocol; 
4. For non central nervous system (CNS) cancers, patients with symptomatic CNS involvement of his/her cancer, unless the subject has stable neurological function without evidence of CNS progression within 12 weeks prior to study entry and does not require treatment with enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants or steroids (within 4 weeks prior to substudy inclusion and during substudy participation); 
5. Administration of any non-oncologic investigational treatment within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to receiving the first dose of study treatment; 
6. History of another malignancy within 2 years prior to registration. Patients with a past history of adequately treated carcinoma-in-situ, basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder are eligible; 
7. Pregnancy, lactation, or inadequate contraception. Women must be post-menopausal, infertile, or use a reliable means of contraception. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to registration. Men must have been surgically sterilised or use a barrier method of contraception (double barrier, if required).
Additional criteria for treatment on MoST substudy 1:
8. Subjects with breast cancer, mantle cell lymphoma, myeloma, or germ cell tumours;
9. Patients with steroid-responsive tumours must be on a stable dose of dexamethasone for a minimum of 14 days prior to registration
10. Contraindications to palbociclib, including known hypersensitivity to any of the components of palbociclib;
11. Prior treatment with a CDK inhibitor.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a substudy of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program, which is registered on ANZCTR with ID ACTRN12616000908437. This substudy will evaluate the activity of palbociclib in patients with advanced cancers and tumours with mutations in components of the Rb-pathway. 
Who is it for? All participants in this study must have completed screening as part of the Cancer Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program (ACTRN12616000908437), and been identified as having tumours carrying somatic mutations in the Rb-pathway including amplification or activating mutations in CCND1, CCND2, CCND3 or CDK4, or loss of function mutations in CDKN2A. They must also be able to swallow capsules. 
Study details All participants in this study will take the drug, palbociclib, orally once daily at a dose of 125mg/day for days 1-21, every 28 day cycle (3 weeks on, 1 week off). Treatment will continue until progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. All participants will undergo assessments at 8 weekly intervals or as clinically indicated in order to evaluate tumour response, safety and tolerability of treatment, health related quality of life during treatment, and overall survival. 

We cannot guarantee that patients will receive any benefits from this study. This study is being carried out to improve the way we treat cancer patients who may have limited treatment options available to them. It is hoped that palbociclib will be well tolerated and will improve outcomes for future patients, however, there may be no clear benefit from participation in this study.</summary>
