  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this trial is to investigate adipose tissue function in women with and
      without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in young women.
      The pathogenesis behind PCOS is complex and only partly understood, and deeper mechanistic
      insight is needed. Insulin resistance is a central feature of PCOS, and recent studies have
      suggested that this is linked to aberrant adipose tissue function. Exercise training has been
      found to improve the symptoms in PCOS, but we need more knowledge about why. While processes
      involved in skeletal muscle oxidative remodeling are well described, it is to a large extent
      unknown whether the oxidative capacity of human adipose tissue is modified by endurance
      training. The women included in this study will be matched (for body mass index, body weight,
      and age) to participants in another study. This will enable the investigators to do a
      comparison between cases (women with PCOS) and controls (women without PCOS) at baseline, and
      to assess the responses to exercise training in adipose tissue.</summary>
