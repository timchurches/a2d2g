  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to see if the two sterile water injection technique is as effective as the standard four injection technique in relieving lower back
pain during labour and birth. If the difference in pain relief between the two techniques, thirty minutes after injection(s) is no greater or less than 1 centimeter on the VAS, the trial will have proven it's hypothesis</summary>
