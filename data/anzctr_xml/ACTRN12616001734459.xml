  <interventions>
    <interventions>After routine surgery instead of emptying bladder and sending patient to ward for trial of void, we will fill bladder with 200ml normal saline (called infusion method) and perform trial of void in recovery. 
The intervention takes place once the entire surgical procedure is finished. The last part of the procedure is cystoscopy. After the bladder is emptied via the cystoscope, 200ml of normal saline with by infused back into bladder (infusion method).</interventions>
    <comparator>the control group is women who undergo the standard auto-fill trial of void method.  This means that the women have their bladders emptied at the end of the procedure via cystoscopy and undergo their trial of void on the ward.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is discharge home from the recovery area. The primary outcome is not the actual time taken to pass trial of void. It is whether the women are discharged home from recovery so we want to know what percentage go home from recovery with each method of trial of void. We want to establish if the infusion method will result in a higher proportion of women going home from recovery.
Patients who initially fail their trial of void in the 2 hours  may go on to pass it on the ward within 24 hours (most do). If they continued to fail their trial of void, they are either sent home with an indwelling catheter or they are taught to self catheterise (more common). Catherisation is continued until bladder function normalises.
For discharge from recover to be achieved the woman must have successfully passed the trial of void (TOV)
A successful TOV for the purposes of this trial is defined as follows:
A SINGLE void of greater than or equal to 2/3 of total bladder volume
i.e. volume voided/(volume voided + post void residual) is more than 68%.

This will be determined by measuring volume of urine voided and then using a bladder scanner to measure the volume of the post void residual.

It requires clinician assessment that voiding is adequate by measuring volume voided with a measuring jug and post void residual with a bladder scanner. If initial trial of void is failed, most clinicians would consider 2 consecutive succsssful voids at defined previously as adequate for a successful trial of void. There is some clinician discretion involved but ultimately it is a question of whether the patient can successful void. </outcome>

    <summary>Aim
The aim of the study was to determine length of time from tension-free vaginal tape procedure to discharge can be shortened by using the infusion method trial of void rather than the standard auto-fill trial of void.

Background
Tension free vaginal tape (TVT-exact) procedure is a commonly performed continence procedure for urodynamic stress incontinence. At present, prior to discharge home, standard practice at our institution requires completion of a trial of void (TOV). Protocols differ between institutions, but generally a TOV requires overnight admission.
However in some centres, it is routine practice to send patients home within 2 hours of the operation if they have passed urine. The nature of the surgery does not require patients to undergo an extended period of observation.

Currently, our practice is to empty each patients bladder upon completion of surgery. The time to initial void is then dependent on the rate of urine production for each patient. This process is termed  auto-fill.   The alternative method is called the infusion method, where the bladder is filled with a predefined volume at completion of surgery to facilitate a shorter time until first postoperative void. 

The infusion method has been studied in several trials and is safe for patients and effective at predicting which patients will have post-operative voiding dysfunction in gynaecology patients. (Kleeman S, Goldwassar S, Vassallo B. Predicting postoperative voiding efficacy after operation for incontinence and prolapse. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2002;187:49, Pulvino JQ, Duecy EE, Buchsbaum GM, Flynn MK. Comparison of 2 Techniques to Predict Voiding Efficiency After Inpatient Urogynecologic Surgery. J Urol 2010;184:1408)
However these studies are not powered to find a significant difference in time to complete TOV.

The TOV process will begin in the recovery area of theatre. If the patient passes the TOV within 2 hours and they are otherwise well, they will be discharged home from recovery. If they have not passed their TOV within 2 hours, they will be transferred to the ward for continuation of the process.
Recovery and ward nurses assessing the TOVs will be blinded as to which group the patient belongs to. Unlike previous studies, patients will also be blinded as to which group they have been allocated to.
