    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Investigators will enrol subjects during routine clinical assessments and phone the central pharmacy that holds the randomisation schedule, for allocation of treatment. 

This study is performed in a double-blind fashion. The investigators and study staff and the subjects will remain blinded to the treatment until study closure. The investigational drug and its matching placebo will be indistinguishable and all treatment kits will be packaged in the same way.</concealment>

    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>If the subject experiences a medical emergency wherein management would be improved by the knowledge of the blinded treatment assignment, unblinding will be available 24 Hours per day. The Principal Investigator (PI) at each site responsible for the subject will be the first point of contact. If he/she deems it necessary to unblind treatment assignment, he/she (or a delegate) will contact the rostered Chief Investigator (CI), MN, WS, DP or HN, at the study coordinating site (SVHM), who will have 24 hours a day access to the blinding codes. 

Unblinded subjects will be withdrawn from the study and will complete an EOS visit as soon as possible after unblinding. A log of every access to the unblinding codes will be kept. The request for unblinding of any subject during the study must be clearly justified and explained by the investigator requesting the code break and documented in the CRF. In addition a set of tamper-proof sealed envelopes containing the blinding code for each subject will be kept at each site in case contact with the rostered CI at SVHM for some reason fails. The integrity of these sealed envelopes will be periodically checked.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Protocol deviations will be identified by medically-trained staff before the Study Closure. There will be no interim efficacy analyses and all analyses for efficacy will be undertaken at the end of the study. All statistical analyses will be performed using STATA software (Version 12).

Subjects without a valid or substituted post-baseline value for a particular endpoint will be excluded from the relevant analysis. Four analysis sets are defined:
1. Intention to treat = all randomised subjects, whether or not they received study drug.
2. All treated = all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug.
3. Safety set = randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug, and had at least one assessment visit post-baseline.
4. Per-protocol set = all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug and did not violate the protocol in a way that might affect the evaluation of the effect of the study drug on the primary endpoint, ie. without major protocol violations.

The ratio of the hazards of a clinical worsening event in the two groups is not expected to change over time. Therefore, the use of methods requiring proportional hazards is considered appropriate.

The following hypothesis will be tested:
Null hypothesis (H0): The distribution of the primary endpoint is the same in the treatment groups.

Alternative hypothesis (H1): The distribution of the primary endpoint in the placebo group differs from the distribution in the active group.

The difference to be detected is a hazard ratio placebo/treatment of 2.0. 
Type I error: alpha = 0.05 (2-sided)
Type II error: beta = 0.2 (power = 80%)

The null hypothesis will be tested by means of the log-rank test. No adjustment for covariates is planned for the primary analysis. Clinical worsening up to 30 days after last study drug intake will be counted for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Subjects without clinical worsening event permanently discontinuing treatment will be censored 30 days after study treatment discontinuation. The time to occurrence of the first clinical worsening event up to 30 days after the last study drug intake will be described by Kaplan Meier curves. 95% confidence intervals of the event-free proportion estimates at relevant time-points will be presented for each treatment group in graphical and tabular form. The hazard ratio of placebo/treatment with its 95% two-sided confidence limits will also be computed.

We expect a drop-out/withdrawal rate of 10% over the duration of the study. The primary analysis set will be the all-randomised set (intention-to-treat analysis). In order to evaluate the robustness of results, the primary endpoint will be analyzed on the Per-protocol set. 

Supportive analyses will be conducted using appropriate covariates (e.g., the start date of concomitant PAH medications) in a Cox regression model.

Sample size calculation was based on the comparison of two survival curves for the primary outcome variable, according to the method of Rubinstein. The following variables were used: (i) alpha=0.05, two-sided; (ii) beta=0.2 (power 80%); (iii) delta (hazard ratio of control:exposed) = 2.0; this was based on the effect size seen in our observational study, but reduced by 75% for the purposes of an RCT to provide a more conservative estimate. It is expected that 65 events will be observed in this study. As previously discussed, several other observational studies have found a similar 2- to 3-fold survival benefit over 3 years with anticoagulation in SSc-PAH (44-47) (iv) control group median survival = 45.6 months; this was taken from our observational study; (v) ratio of subjects randomised to control and experimental groups = 1:1 (vi) block randomisation according to 13 centres; (vii) duration of recruitment = 24 months; (viii) duration of follow-up = 36 months; (ix) expected attrition = 10%; however, substantial loss to follow-up is unlikely as subjects are required to attend for regular review in order to continue receiving PBS-subsidised PAH therapy. Based on these variables, our required sample size in each of two groups is 85, making a total of 170 patients. Power considerations are determined using STATA software (Version 12.0).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Among the rheumatological diseases, Systemic Sclerosis or Scleroderma (SSc), a multi-organ autoimmune disease characterized by increased scarring or fibrosis of tissues and narrowed blood vessels, carries the greatest burden of case-based mortality, reducing the average patients life expectancy by 34 years.

One of the major causes of SSc related death is Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) which develops in 10-15% of patients with SSc. PAH is a condition that narrows the blood vessels in the lungs making blood flow through the lungs more difficult and causing increased strain on the heart and as a result it can cause heart failure and death. Although new specific vasodilator therapies have become available in the last 10 years to treat PAH, some patients still experience poor health outcomes with the 3 year survival of patients with SSc-PAH being about 70%.

Blood clot formation in the blood vessels that supply the lungs has been implicated as one of the events that occur
in the complicated pathway leading to the development of PAH. For this reason, researchers have begun to consider
whether the use of anticoagulant medications that can prevent blood clot formation, would be beneficial to patients
with SSc-PAH. International clinical guidelines recommend the use of anticoagulant medication for some types of PAH, but due to a lack of convincing evidence, this therapy has not become part of standard care for SSc-PAH.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are any health benefits to be gained from the addition of an
oral anticoagulant medication, apixaban, in patients with SSc-PAH who are already prescribed advanced PAH therapy. This study is the first of its kind.

Apixaban is approved in Australia for the prevention of blood clots in patients who have undergone elective total hip or total knee replacement surgery and to prevent stroke in some patients with Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter, however it is not approved to treat SSc-PAH. Therefore, it is an experimental treatment for SSc-PAH.

The study will be a double blind placebo controlled study and will continue for 3 years. The primary outcome measure will be the time to clinical worsening of PAH. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life measures and health resource use.</summary>
