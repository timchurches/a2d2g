  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention of interest for this study is e-couch for depression, a 12-week, online, multimedia application that provides mental health literacy (e.g. what causes mood problems, how to prevent them and how to treat them) and a set of online evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy interventions designed to equip the user with strategies to improve their mood and emotional state, along with a workbook to track progress and record experiences. Participants will be asked to visit e-couch to complete a module once a week (spending approximately 30 minutes to an hour) for twelve weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the control treatment will interact with a specially designed HealthWatch website which requires them to read about different health topics each week over 12 weeks. Topics include: environmental health; nutrition; a healthy heart; energise yourself and your family; medicines in your home; temperature extremes; oral health; blood pressure and cholesterol; calcium and backpain. In addition, participants complete online questionnaires that probe: health factors; physical and artistic activities; education and hobbies; social, financial and family roles; work habits and stress; medications; pain; nutrition; and alcohol use. Participants will be asked to visit HealthWatch to complete a module and the associated questionnaire once a week (spending approximately 30 minutes to an hour) for twelve weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A change in severity of depressive symptoms, as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). This 9-item assessment tool, designed for community samples, provides a summary score ranging from 0 to 27. Participants meeting the cut point on the PHQ-9 depression score suggestive of more than moderate (greater than 9) results will be considered positive as having depressive symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes will be measured from baseline to 3 months (post-intervention).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in cognitive function, as measured using internet deliverable computerised cognitive tasks (CogState) with well established validity and sensitivity to slowing of psychomotor function and impairment of attention, working memory and new learning abilities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes in cognitive function will be measured from baseline to 3 months (post-intervention), 6 months and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in adherence to treatment for cardiovascular disease, using the Medical Outcomes Study Measures of Patient Adherence Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Changes in adherence to treatment for cardiovascular disease will be measured from baseline to 3 months (post-intervention), 6 months and 12 months.</timepoint>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria will be applied at the time of screening entry to the trial as follows: 1. No depressive symptoms, as determined using the PHQ-9 (scores less than or equal to 7 on the 27-point scale). 2. Suicidal ideation determined from the PHQ-9. 3. Current psychotherapy of any form.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Participants will be automatically randomised upon completion of the online consent, eligibility screening and baseline assessment phase. Allocation concealment will be achieved using a customised randomisation facility. The fully itemised procedure allows for full replication and can accommodate stratification and specification of block sizes. The randomisation facility will be built into the internet programme.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using the computer software built into the internet programme. Randomisation will be stratified by depressive symptom severity in blocks. Symptom severity will be determined using PHQ-9 scores, where scores 14 or less will be classified as low, indicating minor depression, and scores ranging from 15 to 27 will be classified as high, indicating major depression.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depression, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and cognitive impairment are key causes of disability and poor health outcomes. Comorbidity of these leads to an even worse prognosis. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to determine the effect of an evidence-based internet intervention program for depression on depressive mood symptoms in patients being treated for, or at risk of developing, CVD. Participants will be drawn from the longitudinal cohort study of healthy volunteers, the 45 and Up Study. Participants will be selected on the basis of self-reported history of CVD or multiple risk-factors for developing CVD and positive screen for depressive symptoms, as measured by the Kessler-10.

The 12 week intervention will compare the effectiveness of online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-couch) with an attention control placebo (HealthWatch website). Follow-up will occur post-intervention and again at 6 and 12 months.  Therefore, secondary aims of this trial are to determine the immediate and 12 month efficacy of the internet intervention on cognitive function and adherence to cardiovascular treatment and exercise.</summary>
