  <interventions>
    <interventions>Samples will be collected from current Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients undergoing follow-up/routine endoscopy.

The Gastroenterologist will collect up to 12 small biopsy samples from the bowel during your colonoscopy; of the 12 small samples 5 will be used as standard clinical care the other 7 samples will be frozen and used as part of our research and stored at The University of Newcastle School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy for analysis. The size of the biopsy is small, ranging in size between 2  4mm each. Biopsies will be taken from the ileum, ascending colon, descending colon and biopsies from any inflamed areas and non-inflamed areas of the colon.

Thus the sample collection will not involve any additional processes to what the participant will already being undergoing. 

Participants will be recruited during procedures and will not be contacted post care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control biopsies will be obtained from cancer or lower GI bleeding colonoscopy screenings which are normal with no
history of IBD or IBS that are ongoing during the course of the trial (2012-2015)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One major problem for those afflicted with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the breakdown of the gut wall lining due to inflammation. This breakdown is best described as an open wound allowing bacteria and toxic substances to enter the body through the gut which prolongs and worsens the existing inflammation. 
In severe IBD, these wounds may prevent immediate application of certain treatments and require steroids to permit wound healing. This route of therapy often comes with many unwanted side effects for the patient. There is currently very little known about how wound healing is initiated or how it progresses in the gut. Understanding of how the wound healing process is regulated may allow us to improve the treatment of IBD wounding and allow the design of new therapies to control the disease. This project examines the roles and interactions of HIF, a protein that regulates a cells response to lack of oxygen, and of a cell membrane linker protein, Beta1 integrin, which allows cells to interact and form the gut lining that protects the body from the intestinal contents.  
We will test the importance of this protein in the repair of intestinal wounds and the factors which drive its role in wound repair. To achieve this, we will use reductionist models of the intestine that mimic the wound healing process and animal models of IBD. These models will allow us to manipulate Beta1 integrin in the hope of understanding the role it plays in wound healing. We will then use the knowledge gained from these studies, to examine human tissue from IBD patients, in the hope of identifying a trend in how Beta1 integrin contributes to the severity of IBD disease</summary>
