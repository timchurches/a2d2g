  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will be delivered in two phases:

Phase 1 (face-to-face)

* Fathers and daughters will attend 8 weekly sessions of the DADEE program together. 

* Each session will be broken up into 2 components: 

(i) a 25-minute education session conducted separately for fathers and girls;

(ii) a 60-minute practical session where fathers and daughter(s) participate together.

* The sessions will be group-based (20-25 families), delivered by qualified physical education teachers and will focus on: 
- parenting and behavioural strategies to improve physical activity &amp; social-emotional well-being;
- fundamental movement skills (e.g. throwing, kicking, striking and catching);
- rough and tumble play;
- physical challenges to develop social-emotional well-being

* All participants will be provided with program resources including handbook, logbooks and sports equipment pack. 

Phase 2 (home-based)

* The second phase of the intervention is home-based. The primary interface will be a 'DADEE' App which will include physical activity tasks for fathers to complete with their daughter/s between weeks 8 and 36. Both fathers and daughters will have access to the app. Participants will be advised to complete activities from a variety of categories equating to a minimum time investment of 30-60 minutes per week.

Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by:
- Attendance records at the sessions
- Compliance to home tasks by dads and daughters
- Activities completed on the DADEE app</interventions>
    <comparator>Wait-list control group for 36 weeks. The wait-list control group will be offered the intervention after the 36 week assessment.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Study information for the two different groups (DADEE program group and wait-list control) will be pre-packed into identical, sealed opaque envelopes and consecutively numbered and ordered according to the randomisation schedule.

The packing and sequencing of these envelopes will be completed by a research assistant who will not be involved in enrolment, assessment or allocation of participants.

Study participants will complete all baseline assessments before proceeding to a separate room to meet with a research assistant who will not be involved with assessments. The allocation sequence will be concealed during this process.

Families will be stratified by father's BMI and their name will be written down in the next available position on the relevant randomisation schedule. At this point the corresponding envelope for that position will be opened by the research assistant and details of the group assignment will be provided to the family using a standardised protocol.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation allocation sequence will be generated by a statistician who will not have any contact with participants during the trial. Allocation will be stratified by father's BMI and the allocation sequence within strata will be generated by a computer based random number producing algorithm.

Randomisation codes will be stored in a restricted computer folder, which will not be accessible by those assessing participants, those involved in group allocating participants or those participating in data entry for the study.</sequence>

A sample size of 86 fathers will provide 80% power to detect a 1500 step/day difference in physical activity between the intervention and control groups at 8 weeks with 15% attrition (p&lt;0.05). This calculation is based on a correlation between pre and post scores of 0.64 and a baseline standard deviation of 2643 steps/day (values derived from fathers in the Healthy Dads Healthy Kids pilot study, which tested a healthy lifestyle program for fathers and their primary school aged children).

Similarly, a sample size of 134 daughters will provide 80% power to detect a 1500 step/day difference in physical activity between the intervention and control groups at 8 weeks with 15% attrition (p&lt;0.05). This calculation is based on a correlation between pre and post scores of 0.58 and a baseline standard deviation of 3082 steps/day (values derived from daughters in the Healthy Dads Healthy Kids pilot study).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children and adults who participate in recommended levels of physical activity experience a plethora of physical and psychological health benefits. However, 80% of men and 80% of girls do not meet government physical activity recommendations in Australia. Of particular concern is that girls are less active than boys at all ages. Moreover, girls drop out of sport at a rate six times greater than boys. There are a number of biological, psycho-social and environmental factors that explain girls' lower activity levels, with many of these modifiable. For example, less than 10% of girls can perform basic sports skills (e.g. throwing, catching) by the time they leave primary school. This is alarming as research shows that these skills are strongly associated with physical activity, fitness and weight status. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop community-based interventions that engage girls in physical activity and develop the knowledge and movement skills for lifelong participation.

Parents play a critical role in their children's physical activity levels through provision of opportunities, encouragement and role modelling positive activity attitudes and behaviours. Despite this, girls receive less encouragement and opportunities for physical activity from their parents than boys. Emerging research has shown that mothers and fathers differ in their physical activity-related parenting practices and that fathers who are actively engaged with their daughters impact on a host of important physical and mental health outcomes including higher levels of cognitive ability, self-esteem, social skills, and educational outcomes. However, research has shown fathers spend less time with their daughters than their sons and may discount the importance of their relationships with their daughters. Physical activity provides an exciting medium through which to develop physical, cognitive and social-emotional skills in girls and fathers may play a key role.
The overall aim of this pilot project is to develop and evaluate an intervention targeting both fathers and their daughter(s) to improve the physical activity levels and social/emotional health of girls. Two major purposes are:

(i) to help fathers improve their own physical activity levels and learn parenting skills to promote and role model positive behaviours relating to physical activity for their daughters 

(ii) to improve the physical activity behaviours, fundamental movement skill proficiency and social-emotional well-being of their daughters.
