  <interventions>
    <interventions>8 week treatment with exclusive enteral nutrition (liquid diet) instead of corticosteroid therapy.  The liquid diet consists of commercially available a polymeric nutrition formula.  It will meet all of the participants calorie and nutrient requirements, no food or fluid other than water is allowed.  It is to be taken orally, or via nasogastric tube if not tolerated orally, 6 - 8 times per day based on individual requirements.</interventions>
    <comparator>8 week treatment with corticosteroid therapy as prescribed by the participant's gastroenterologist.  The corticosteroid medication will be taken orally as per standard practice.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Demonstrate patterns and extent of changes in faecal inflammatory markers consequent to exclusive enteral nutrition.  Upon receipt stool samples will be stored at -80 degrees.  Batched stool samples will be subsequently retrieved from storage and used to measure calprotectin, S100A12 and osteroprotegrin by immunoassay using standard methods. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Assess at start of intervention, every 2 weeks during 8 week intervention and then after 3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Define nutrition status of participant cohort.  Nutritional status will be measured by albumin, vitamin D, iron status, IGF-1, BMI, body composition (as measured by bioimpedance analysis and skin fold thickness).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assess at start of intervention, every 2 weeks during 8 week intervention and then after 3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Document remission rate following exclusive enteral nutrition.  Remission of disease will be defined as a Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) of less than 150 or a drop of more than 100 points.  CDAI will be measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 4 weeks and at end of the 8 week intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Document changes in nutritional markers following exclusive enteral nutrition.  Serum albumin and IGF-1, weight, bioimpedance analysis skin fold thickness will be measured as markers of nutritional status.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assess at start of intervention, every 2 weeks during 8 week intervention and then after 3 and 6 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the impact of exclusive enteral nutrition upon quality of life and disability scores.  Quality of life will be measured using the IBDQ and disability will be measured using the Disability Index.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assess at start of intervention, every 2 weeks during 8 week intervention and then after 3 and 6 months</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to investigate whether the benefits of exclusive enteral nutrition (a liquid diet) seen in paediatric populations can be replicated in adult populations.  The study hypothesis is that a liquid diet changes markers of gut inflammation in adults with newly diagnosed Crohns disease leading to clinical and biochemical remission of Crohns disease.
