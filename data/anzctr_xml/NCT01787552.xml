    <summary>The purpose of this phase Ib/II clinical trial is to: a) evaluate the safety of the
      co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 in myelofibrosis patients and establish a maximum
      tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose of the combination and b) to assess the
      efficacy of the co-administration of LDE225 and INC424 on spleen volume reduction.</summary>
