  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgical implantation of the pedicle screw system in adolescent patients to correct curvature of the spine.  The system is left in place until skeletal maturity and adequate curve correction.  Depending on the maturity of the patient when implanted, will determine the length of time the system will be left in place. It is assumed most patients will have the device for 2 - 5 years. The surgical implantation procedure is just like that of the standard pedicle screw systems that are currently used in surgery using a posterior approach. The system uses pedicle screws, rods and cables to align the spine. The procedure will last about 2 - 4 hours depending on the number of pedicle screws that are placed.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device safety as freedom from serious device and/or procedural-related adverse events within 6 months post-index implantation. Possible adverse events are those that may currently happen with any deformity surgery of the thoracic region where a pedicle screw system is used.  They may include but are not limited to: implant failure including malpositon, migration, bending and/or fracture, early or late loosening of the implanted system. These are all monitoring at the imlplant procedure and with imaging at various stages of the study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The pedicle screw system is a posterior implantable system to stabilize spinal segments and promote fusion.  The pedicle screw system will be utilized to facilitate deformity correction in adolescent patients with scoliosis.  The study will look at the amount of correction of the curve from x-ray images at baseline and compare those to x-ray images of the spine post-implant and at follow-up visits.  The study will also evaluate the safety profile of the device and collect information on any serious device and/or procedural adverse events.</summary>
