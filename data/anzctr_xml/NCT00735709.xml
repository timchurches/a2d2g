      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale Total Score At Week 8 - The 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D24) is a clinician-rated 24-item scale for assessing the severity of depression symptoms. The scores for each item range from 0 to 4 or 0 to 2, where 0 represents no symptoms. The rating is based on the past 7 days prior to the time of assessment. The total score range is from 0 to 74 where a higher score indicates a greater depressive state. Least squares (LS) means are from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with Baseline-by-week, center, week, and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Week 8 - The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities.

The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment. LS means are from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with Baseline-by-week, center, week, and week-by-treatment as factors in the analysis.</outcome>
