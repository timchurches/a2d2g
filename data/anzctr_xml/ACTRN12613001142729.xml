  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 capsules of fish oil containing a total dose of approximately 800 mg of DHA will be administered orally per day until 34 weeks gestation or birth (whichever occurs first). Women will be asked to return unused supplements at the end of the 34 weeks gestation when a spot blood sample is taken. The proportion of capsules returned will serve as a measure of adherence. DHA concentration at the end of intervention will be used as an independent biomarker of adherence.</interventions>

    <concealment>Women will be approached to enter the trial by research staff at the time of attending the hospital for their first antenatal booking visit.  If they are interested in the study, they will be screened and have the study explained to them.  When all the inclusion and exclusion criteria have been checked and the eligibility of the women confirmed, a copy of the information sheet and consent form will be given to the women.  

The information sheet will describe the prurpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation.  The research staff will conduct the informed consent discussion and will check that information provided is understood and answer any questions about the study.  Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion.

Upon receiving written informed consent, a research staff member will collect baseline data including contact details, birth order, age, weight, height, heighest level of education, occupation, smoking status and pregnancy related background data.  A blood sample will also be collected to assess fatty acid status.  Women will then be randomly assigned to treatment or control group.  A copy of the information sheet and signed consent form will be provided to the women and the original filed in the case report form (CRF).</concealment>
    <sequence>Women will be assigned to study packs labelled with a unique study number assigned through a web-based randomisation service.  Allocation will follow a computer generated randomisation schedule with balanced variable blocks, prepared by an independent consultant.  Stratification will be by centre and supplements used prior to trial entry (containing no LCPUFA vs. less than or equal to 150mg LCPUFA/day).

Each study pack will contain either treatment or control capsules, pre-packed according to the randomisation schedule.  Participants and their family, care providers, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to randomisation group.

    <statisticalmethods>All analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis.  The primary outcome of early preterm birth will be compared between treatment and control groups using log binomial regression.  Adjustment will be made for the stratification variables centre and supplements, as well as pre-specified prognostic baseline variables.  Results will be presented as a relative risk with confidence interval and 2-sided p-value.  Statistical significance will be assessed accounting for the pre-specified interim analysis using the O'Brien-Fleming approach.  All analyses will follow a pre-specified statistical analysis plan.  Infant outcomes will be analysed using generalised estimating equations to account for clustering due to multiple births.

Missing data (deaths) will be multiple imputed.  Sensitivity analyses will also be performed using the original unimputed data, excluding deaths. 

The sample size estimation was based on our published DOMInO trial (Makrdies et al, JAMA, 2010; 304: p 1675-83) of women with singleton pregnancies, treatment resulted in a 1.16% absolute reduction (from 2.25% to 1.09%) in the incidence of early preterm birth (EPTB). Inclusion of women with multiple pregnancies in the ORIP trial is expected to result in a small increase in the incidence of EPTB in both treatment groups, since EPTB is more common in multiple pregnancies. To demonstrate an absolute reduction in the incidence of EPTB of 1.16% (from 2.45% to 1.29%) with 85% power and overall two-sided alpha=0.05, a sample size of 2618 per group (i.e. 5236 total) is required. Allowing for a loss to follow up of 5%, a total of 5540 women is required to ensure adequate power for the primary outcome. Since EPTB is a mother level outcome, the sample size calculations define the number of mothers that need to be recruited and no adjustment for clustering due to multiple pregnancies is required for this outcome.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early preterm birth (EPTB) is the major cause of perinatal mortality, serious neonatal morbidity and moderate to severe childhood disability in developed countries.  Currently, effective broadly applicable primary prevention strategies to reduce the risk of EPTB in the general population are lacking. This randomised controlled trial will determine whether n-3 LCPUFA supplementation from mid-pregnancy (before 20 weeks gestation) to 34 weeks gestation reduces the risk of EPTB. The study is a double blind, randomised controlled multi-centre trial. The primary outcome is the Incidence of early preterm birth (EPTB) defined as delivery before 34 completed weeks gestation. Secondary outcomes include  Incidence of post-term induction or post-term pre-labour caesarean section, other outcomes known to be directly affected by EPTB, and the safety and tolerability of DHA supplementation. Eligible women will be randomly allocated to either intervention (~800 mg DHA) or control groups..  Women will receive intervention from trial entry (&lt;20 weeks) to 34 weeks gestation or birth, whichever comes first. Women will be followed up to discharge after birth.   The study will be conducted over a 5 year period 2013 to 2017.  A total of 5540 pregnant women will be recruited to take part in the trial. </summary>
