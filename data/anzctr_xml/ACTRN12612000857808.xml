  <interventions>
    <interventions>comparing traditional 2D laparoscope and bichanneled 3D laparoscope in performing skill board models and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 

In skill board model, each surgeon will perform 2 tasks: knot tying and objects transfer. They will first perform object transfer using one laparoscope setting (2D or 3D, surgeon is blinded to the setting) then repeat the task using another scope setting. Then they will perform knot tying in the same manner. Both skill board model will be completed in the same session  (~15-20min) on the same day

In laparoscopic cholecystectomy, each surgeon will perform 2 lap. cholecystectomy ( one with 2D scope one with 3D scope). 

In both skill board model and lap. cholecystectomy model the surgeon's performance will be recorded and reviewed by an independent assessor and rate their performance. The 2 surgeries will be performed by the surgeon on separate days when the suitable cases are available

Also the surgeons will need to complete a set of questionnaire to evaluate their opinion on the 2 systems after completing the skill board and the lap. cholecystectomy</interventions>
