  <interventions>
    <interventions>The usual practice of low molecular heparin therapy after orthopedic surgery to reduce risk of DVT and PE remains controversial in terms of length of therapy. This study is aimed at answering this question by reducing the length of therapy from 2 weeks to 1 week, without compromising safety in terms of increasing risk of clotting complications. The usual therapy involves enoxaparim 0.5 mg/kg,daily, commencing 8-12 hours post op, given subcutaneously. The only difference between the study groups was the length of the therapy but given daily.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>No difference between the two groups in terms of clotting episodes post operation, with a 3 month follow up
Method of assessment includes post operative day 5, venous doppler study of the treated limb as well as clinical assessments. In case of an abnormal venous doppler study indicating DVT, then pulmonary CT angiogram was performed to assess any PE. </outcome>

Assessed using pain score charts and calf measurements</outcome>

    <concealment>participants invited by questionnaire.  Those eligible and willing consented.  Upon arrival for their operation, allocated (by randomised computer allocation) to a treatment group (standard therapy LMWH or short course LMWH therapy).  Clinicians then went ahead and treated patients based on their allocation to a particular treatment group. 
The trial coordinator was the person who determined if the patient was eligible for inclusion in the trial  and was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. It was allocated by randomisation by computer ( computerised sequence generation)</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study hypothesises that shorter duration low molecular weight therpay is as effective as standard therapy in post operative orthopaedic DVT prophylaxis. There will be no significant difference in the incidence of post operative thrombotic events such as DVTs and PE. There mat be added advantages of reduced leg swelling and hence pain with the use of mobile calf compressor device as an outpatient.</summary>
    <trialwebsite />
    <publication>There are various published data on the use of a shorter course of LMWH but there are no uniform guidelines developed as the evidence generated lacked clarity. This prompted this study which also aimed at assessing the use of post op outpatient calf compressor to reduce leg swelling and hence pain and improve mobility.</publication>
