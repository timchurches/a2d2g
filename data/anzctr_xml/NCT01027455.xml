  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In laparoscopic (key-hole) surgery, the use of cold dry carbon dioxide gas to inflate the
      abdominal cavity for the creation a clear operating field, results in damage to the cavity
      lining, known as the peritoneum. This has been associated with negative effects on
      post-operative recovery. Adult studies using warm humidified insufflation gas have indicated
      possible decreased post-operative pain, reduced narcotic analgesia requirements, decreased
      fogging of the laparoscopic camera lens, and reduced time to return to normal activities.
      Cold dry gas during laparoscopic surgery also has potential to cause abnormal decrease in
      body core temperature (hypothermia). This has been established by trials in adult humans and
      animal models. The WARMIST study aims to investigate for whether warm humid gas insuflation
      during laparoscopic removal of the appendix in children reduces intraoperative temperature
      variations, post-operative pain (indicated by morphine usage and pain scores), length of
      hospital stay and degree of camera lens fogging, and speed post-operative recovery compared
      to using cold dry gas insufflation.</summary>
