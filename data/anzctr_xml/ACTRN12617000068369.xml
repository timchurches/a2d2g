    <interventions>Group 1: Nurse-led, tailored, survivorship care intervention using telehealth delivery

At 4 weeks following end of treatment (e.g. chemotherapy or radiotherapy), participants will be offered an initial 60 minute tailored nurse video consultation.
Subsequently, monthly 30 minute video consultation follow-up sessions at 8 weeks and 12 weeks.

During the 4 week consultation (60 minutes):
- Evidence-based Patient Education: this includes the provision of a booklet including evidence-based coping or management strategies, and available healthcare resources. The booklet is entitled "Post-treatment Wellness Booklet for Patients diagnosed with Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma". This booklet is designed by the Cancer Nursing Professorial Precinct Team, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in collaboration with Queensland University of Technology and the Leukaemia Foundation. The nurse will discuss specific components of the topic that are relevant to the patient as identified by the Distress Thermometer and Problem Checklist. The Distress Thermometer and Problem Checklist will be completed by the patient prior to the consultation.
- Treatment Summary and Survivorship Care Plan: The nurse will develop a post-treatment care plan in collaboration with the patient. In this care plan, it includes a treatment summary (details of lymphoma treatment received by the patient), a follow-up schedule; collaborative goal setting.
- Patient referrals (as appropriate): The nurse will also facilitate referrals for the patients to receive services as appropriate.

During the 8 and 12 week consultations (30 minutes each),
The survivorship care plan will be reviewed as informed by the Distress Thermometer and Problem Checklist completed by patients prior to the consultations. Patient education and referrals will also be facilitated accordingly if required.

- Log of all consultations will be kept by treating nurse</interventions>

The allocation is concealed from the research nurse until after the patient has consented.</concealment>
    <sequence>A block randomisation schedule  is used to allocate treatment. The block randomisation schedule is held by the central registry in a 1:1:1 ratio. Block randomisation within centre will ensure even allocation to each treatment arm at each site.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The  patient data will be analysed by intention to treat using PASW (Version 22.0, SPSS).
Descriptive analysis will be performed for all clinical, demographic, and other risk factors collected at baseline. The mean scores of FACT-Lym, and a range of secondary outcome measures will be compared across the intervention, information only and control groups using Linear Mixed Effects Models to analyse the effect between groups from baseline to study completion at 3 months time. Qualitative analysis will involve using conversation analysis to identify recurrent patterns in the delivered interventions that may contribute towards the intervention outcome. Process factors identified through the qualitative analysis of this pilot study will be used to inform the development of a large-scale trial. Analysis will be undertaken by an experienced conversation analyst.
 
Economic analysis: Cost evaluation- this involves exploratory multivariable analyses using generalised linear equations . Analysis of the FACIT-COST and EQ-5D will use respective scoring algorithms and descriptive analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led, tailored survivorship care intervention using telehealth delivery, relative to Information Only and Usual Care, for improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

Who it focuses on: Patients within four weeks of completion of treatment with curative intent for HL, or aggressive NHL. Others include speaking and reading English; 18 years of age or older; an ambulatory patient at the time of recruitment; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; and have access to the Internet and a smart device and/or computer.

Study Details:
Recruited patients will be randomly allocated to one of the three arms. . The intervention group will receive the nurse-led tailored Survivorship Care intervention between the last cycle of chemotherapy and four weeks post treatment completion for people who have completed their defined active treatment for Hodgkin's Lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In total, this group will receive three nurse-led consultations via video conferencing. The first consultation will be 60 minutes, involving the provision of treatment summary, evidence-based patient education, survivorship care plan, follow up schedule, and appropriate patient referrals. The second and third consultation will take 30 minutes each. These 30 minute consultations will focus on patient education and amendment to the care plan depending on the needs of the individual patient.

The Information Only group will receive an evidence-based information booklet via post at the end of treatment. The booklet is entitled "Post-treatment Wellness Booklet for Patients diagnosed with Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma". This booklet is designed by the Cancer Nursing Professorial Precinct Team, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in collaboration with Queensland University of Technology and the Leukaemia Foundation.

The control group will receive usual care. Usual care is the absence of any structured survivorship intervention, involving traditional physician follow up.</summary>
