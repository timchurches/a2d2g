    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using mixed model MANOVA to test for differences between control and experimental conditions in levels of mindfulness. Second, to investigate whether components of mindfulness predict levels of distress and avoidance behaviours, general linear model analyses will be conducted. Thirdly, to determine whether mindfulness moderates the relationship between distress and avoidance behaviours, logistic regressions will be conducted, with possible demographic confounds (age and sex) entered in the first step, measures of distress and/or avoidance behaviours, entered in the second, mindfulness entered in the third step, and finally interactions between standardised distress, avoidance and/or mindfulness components in the final step, allowing a test of whether mindfulness components moderate the link between the distress and avoidance behaviours in cancer patients. </statisticalmethods>
