    <interventions>A 25-minute multimedia module explaining the processes expected before, during and after a caesarean section, and the risks associated with this procedure.
The module will be delivered via an iPad, 2-4 weeks prior to surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Up to 25 minutes of reading time with the RANZCOG published pamphlets on Caesarean Section and Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Section, which will be viewed by the participant 2-4 weeks prior to surgery. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge score - based on a 12-question MCQ style questionnaire, developed by the authors. Questions will be based on the content of the written pamphlet and the multimedia module, centred on the processes and risks associated with caesarean section.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaire administered to participants prior to the education method (module or pamphlet), immediately post-education, and on the day of surgery (2-4 weeks after education method).</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety Score - Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory Short Form </outcome>
      <timepoint>Administered with the knowledge questionnaire prior to the education method, immediately post-education, and on the day of surgery (2-4 weeks after education method).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction score - based on a Likert scale, and on a 10-point score verbally reported by the patient.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Likert scale for satisfaction score will be administered immediately post-education. The verbal report of a 10-point score will be obtained over the phone on a follow up call 6 weeks post-caesarean section.</timepoint>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients on the upcoming booked elective caesarean section theatre lists are identified as suitable for the study. Suitable patients are approached at their antenatal appointment 2-4 weeks prior to their theatre date. Patients are consented for the study prior to randomisation. They are administered the pre-education questionnaire. They are then randomised to either the control or intervention group. After randomisation, they will receive their allocated method of education (pamphlet or multimedia module), and complete their post-education questionnaire. On the day of their surgery, they will be administered a 3rd questionnaire. Six weeks following their operation, they will be contacted by phone to assess their satisfaction score with their method of education.</concealment>
    <sequence>Patients are randomised into either control or intervention group using a computerised randomisation program "Sealed Envelope". Each participant's allocated group is placed into opaque envelopes, and not opened until the patient consented to participate in the study. Neither researcher nor patient will be aware of which group the participant will be allocated to prior to consent for the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we will be looking at the education process as a part of informed consent prior to an elective caesarean section. In particular, we will be comparing a 25-minute multimedia module that we have developed, with the current RANZCOG published written pamphlets on caesarean section and vaginal birth after caesarean section. We hypothesise that the multimedia module will compare favourably in terms of improved knowledge and satisfaction scores, and reduced anxiety scores in comparison to the written pamphlets that patients currently receive.</summary>
