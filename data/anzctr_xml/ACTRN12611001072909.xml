  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised controlled cross over trial with 3 treatment arms; arm 1 (~60-80g Hi Oleic peanuts), arm 2 (~60-80g regular peanuts), arm 3 (~70-90g low salt potato crisps - control) the foods will provide ~15% of participants energy intake. 
Participants will consume the snack on day 1 after an overnight fast and then complete visual analogue scales (for hunger appetite, thirst, fullness and amount they could consume), at baseline and t= 30, 60 120 180 minutes. Participants will then consume a buffet meal and energy intake from this meal will be calculated.  Participants will then consume the snack food daily for the following 3 days and complete food intake records. After a minimum 4 day washout period between each food, they will cross over to the other snack foods. The order if which foods are consumed will be determined using a Latin-square design</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects meeting entry criteria at screening will be allocated to a treatment at random by the study code-holder who will remain blinded to their identities.

A randomisation schedule will be generated by a random number generator which will match participant identification numbers with order of treatment allocation. Treatment allocation will be single-blind.
As the foods used look different participants will not be blinded to which food they are consuming but the primary researcher analysing the data will be blinded to which treatment phase participants are engaged in.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised into 6 groups of equal numbers using a random number generator. Foods will be allocated a letter A-F for identification and will not be decoded until all the data has been analysed.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will measure the effect of 3 snack foods (2 types of peanuts one type of potato chips) on acute satiety and on subsequent satiety and energy intake over a 4 day period which may provide a mechanism for weight control.
 Hypothesis; It is hypothesised that consumption of  high-oleic peanuts will improve satiety and reduce subsequent energy intake. It is anticipated that the protein and fibre content of high-oleic peanuts will increase satiety compared with consumption of low salt potato crisps of the same energy value</summary>
