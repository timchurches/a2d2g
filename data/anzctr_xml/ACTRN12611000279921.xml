    <interventions>Aim: This study will be a 10 year follow-up of the RCT conducted by this research group, assigned a registration number  ACTRN12605000113651,   registered 9/08/2005. 

Randomisation details: Obese patients were randomized to either the medical or surgical group. The medical arm received treatment with a VLCD plus ongoing individualized care encompassing other obesity drugs as determined and behaviour modification programs. The surgical arm received treatment with the Lap-Band System, a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band. 
Timeline and method of data collection: Patients were initially followed for two years from randomization, and in this study we wish to extend this followup to ten years.
Data will be collected on all patients via telephone or in person contact. All outcomes including weight will be retaken as per the original protocol.</interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>All patients will be included in the 10 yr follow-up:

    <exclusivecriteria>Lack of acceptance of the randomization process, history of previous abdominal surgery which would potentially preclude the laparoscopic placement of the band, medical issues which contra-indicated either arm of the study including acute myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, dementia, active psychosis, concurrent experimental drug use, autoimmune disease, pregnancy, lactation, illicit drug use, excessive alcohol intake, use of drugs known to affect body composition, cytotoxic drugs, internal malignancy or major organ failure, inability to understand the risks, unrealistic expectation of benefits or likelihood of failure to comply with the follow up requirements of either program.</exclusivecriteria>
