  <interventions>
    <interventions>The FitMindKit program consists of 18 internet-based modules adapted and abridged to encapsulate CBT-based therapeutic techniques, such as behavioural activation, cognitive reframing, problem solving, exposure, motivational interviewing, mindfulness, and relaxation. These modules consist of short videos followed by activities and are based on existing evidence-based online programs. Of these modules, 10 are based on therapeutic techniques that are broadly aimed at improving general mental health, while 2 target social anxiety and panic, 2 target generalised anxiety and depression, 2 target alcohol and substance use, and 2 target suicidal thoughts. Participants are assigned 10 modules and complete 1 module per day. Each module takes approximately 10 minutes. There are 3 conditions, Tailored, Static, and Control. Participants in the Tailored condition receive a set of 10 of the 18 above modules tailored to their specific mental health symptoms, participants in the Static condition receive the 10 general mental health modules, and participants in the Control condition receive an attention=matched control program consisting of general health information not directly related to mental health.

Data measuring adherence to all three versions of the program will be automatically gathered by the online platform hosting the FitMindKit study. The adherence variables measured will include total number of visits to the site, average length of each visit, and the number of modules completed.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are two (2) comparison/control conditions. One, the Non-Tailored condition, is a static version of the FitMindKit program without tailoring and symptom-specific modules. The second, the Control condition, is an attention-matched control program consisting of general health information not directly related to mental health.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to test the feasibility and effectiveness of the FitMindKit program to reduce symptoms of mental health problems in adults. FitMindKit is an online program that uses brief therapeutic modules (based on cognitive behavioural therapy) to reduce symptoms of common mental disorders (major depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders) and suicidal thoughts. Unlike existing internet programs, FitMindKit is tailored to the individual's mental health profile, taking account of multiple mental health problems using rapid screening methods.

570 adults, 18 years and over, with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and/or substance use will be recruited from the community and randomised to receive one of three programs: (i) the FitMindKit program, (ii) a static, untailored version of the FitMindKit program, or (iii) an attention-matched control program containing general health information not directly related to mental health.

We hypothesise that: (1) compared to users of the control program, users of both versions of the FitMindKit program will show a greater reduction of symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety, social anxiety, panic, alcohol and other substance use, and suicidal thoughts; (2) users of the tailored FitMindKit program will show a greater symptom reduction than users of the static FitMindKit program; (3) users of both versions of the FitMindKit program will report greater satisfaction than users of the control program; (4) users of the tailored FitMindKit program will have greater adherence to the program; and (5) the FitMindKit program will be cost-effective, through reduced need for primary care and mental health services.</summary>
