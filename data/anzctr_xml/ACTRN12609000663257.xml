  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two types of surgery are currently available in the treatment of rectal cancer: open laparotomy and rectal resection and laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection. 
 
While open laparotomy (an incision into the abdomen) and surgical resection is currently the standard of care for rectal cancer, laparoscopic-assisted resection (key-hole surgery to resect the tumour, performed under the guidance of a video camera) has emerged as a new treatment option for rectal cancer.  This technique achieves removal of the rectal tumour with minimally invasive surgery, and potentially achieves better recovery and shorter stays in hospital post-operatively.
Patients will be randomised to receive one of the two surgical treatments to remove the primary rectal cancer - i.e. Open Laparotomy and Rectal Resection or Laparoscopic-assisted Rectal Resection.</interventions>
    <comparator>The purpose of the A La CaRT study is to compare these two types of surgery and to 
determine whether the new technique of laparoscopic-assisted resection is as safe and effective as the current standard of open laparotomy and resection in the treatment of rectal cancer.  

This study will also determine whether disease recurrence rates are improved and whether patients with rectal cancer benefit through improved short and long term recovery and overall quality of life.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether laparoscopic-assisted resection is not inferior to open rectal resection as a safe, effective oncologic approach to rectal cancer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative staging and evaluation of disease will be determined by Computerised Tomography (CT) scan, and pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI or CT scan and Endorectal ultrasound.  Pathology specimens  obtained at surgery will be reviewed by a  Pathology Review Committee to assess a composite of oncologic parameters which must be met for surgical resection to be successful.  These parameters which form the primary endpoint are: 
Circumferential margin greater than or equal to 1mm 
Distal resected margin greater than or equal to 2cm (or greater than or equal to 1cm  with clear frozen section in the low rectum) 
Completeness of total mesorectal excision (TME)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether laparoscopic resection for rectal cancer is not inferior to open resection from a patient related benefit perspective, based on morbidity, mortality associated with surgery, disease-free survival and disease recurrence and quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative assessment of clinical status and baseline quality of life questionnaire instruments will be completed within 6 weeks prior to surgery. Follow up visits take place at day 3 and day 14 post surgery, and then at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and annually at 3,4,and 5 years. Patient morbidity/mortality associated with surgical intervention data is to be collected, disease-free survival and local pelvic recurrence is assessed at 2 years, overall survival is assessed at 5 years, and quality of life assessment is followed to one year.</timepoint>

    <concealment>On confirmation of eligibility, patients will be recruited through the hospital, clinic or surgeons' rooms at each site. Sites will fax randomisation data to the central coordinating body, the National Health and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Centre (NHMRC CTC).  Only authorised staff at the NHMRC CTC are eligible to access the randomisation system.  Upon verification of site accreditation, patient eligibility, that documentation is correct and complete, a check is performed to ensure that patient duplication will not occur, before allocation to either treatment arm is performed.  This allocation is by an electronic randomisation  system which generates patient study ID and treatment arm.
Patients will be randomised to either open laparotomy and rectal resection or laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection. 
Confirmation of randomisation, patient ID and treatment arm is faxed by the NHMRC CTC to the investigator at the study site.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study compares surgery using a laparoscope (keyhole surgery) compared with open surgery in treating colorectal (bowel) cancer. 
You can join this study if you have been diagnosed with primary cancer of the rectum or lower bowel (stage T 1-3 N 0-1 M 0-1) that requires surgery.   

Trial participants will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive surgery using a laparoscope (keyhole surgery) while the other will receive the standard open surgery. Patients will be assessed 6 weeks prior to surgery, with follow up checks at day 3 and day 14 post surgery, and then at 46 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months and annually at 3, 4 and 5 years. 
Surgical resection of the tumour is the most important treatment for rectal cancer. Laparoscopic-assisted techniques allow the tumour to be removed with smaller incisions, and less invasive surgery. 
This study aims to determine whether these new techniques offer a safe and viable alternative to standard surgery.

The primary aim of this study will be to determine whether laparoscopic-assisted resection of rectal cancer is non-inferior (or equivalent) in safety and efficacy to the open technique of laparotomy and surgical resection.  
The secondary aim of the study will be to determine whether laparoscopic-assisted rectal resection is equivalent to open rectal resection in providing comparable recovery outcomes and in terms of disease recurrence and survival, and quality of life.</summary>
