  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label, sequential dose exploration study of single agent AMG 595 administered
      in subjects with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and/or anaplastic astrocytomas (AA).
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      AMG 595, and also to evaluate the objective response rate in subjects receiving AMG 595. This
      study will be conducted in two parts. Part 1 will explore doses of AMG 595 in subjects with
      recurrent GBM and/or AA. Part 2 (dose expansion) will examine the MTD established in Part 1
      in subjects with recurrent GBM.</summary>
