    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>From CGM analyses obtained in people from this clinic who were on multiple insulin injections prior to commencing insulin pumps for treatment of type 1 diabetes, the change in SD was 0.2 mmol/L and the SD of the change in SD was 0.25. Average duration of diabetes was 16.1 years (range 4-28 years). For 80% power (2-sided calculation) with an alpha of 0.05 and assuming a difference between groups of 0.2, a minimum of 25 participants will be required in each arm of this trial (minimum total number 50 participants). To allow for screen failures and drop out rate between randomisation and 3 months (allow 20% extra), 60 participants will need to be screened. 
In a previous study the percentage of patients who were C-peptide positive on the ultrasensitive C-peptide assay was 39.1% with duration of diabetes of 11-20 years. 
Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for all randomised patients.  The last observation will be carried forward in calculating the primary endpoint. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 1 diabetes is associated with significant fluctuations in blood glucose levels in patients on multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy. This glycaemic variability limits patients ability to adequately control blood glucose due to its association with hypoglycaemia and subsequent high readings or 'rebounds'. The medication vildagliptin is currently used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and in this setting has the ability to lower glucose and reduce hypoglycaemia. Its action is both on insulin producing cells, beta cells, and glucagon producing cells, alpha cells. Patients with type 1 diabetes have traditionally been thought to have no insulin production, however recent studies using a more sensitive assay have shown residual beta cell function in many type 1 patients after 10 years. This study is designed to assess the effects of vildagliptin in patients with type 1 diabetes and aspects of blood glucose control including glycaemic variablity. The hypothesis is that vildagliptin may reduce variability due to its action on both alpha and beta cell activity in a glucose dependent manner.  </summary>
