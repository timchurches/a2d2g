  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in both groups will continue with their on-going medical care and will be encouraged by a trained occupational therapist to perform 10 minutes of daily bilateral finger and wrist passive stretching. An exercise sheet hand-out will be distributed to the participants. To measure the true effect of the knitting intervention, active hand exercises need to be avoided since they are proven effective for hand osteoarthritis.
Participants in Group 1 will take part in a low-intensity knitting program, performed as a morning functional activity, which will comprise two components: 1) bi-weekly 20-minute knitting sessions at a seniors club and 2) 20-minute home daily knitting sessions for the five remaining weekdays over 12 consecutive weeks (total of 90 sessions). Each knitting session will begin with a five-minute warm-up, consisting of light passive stretching exercises of the bilateral hand and wrist muscles, before engaging in the 20-minute active knitting phase. The knitting session will end with a cool-down that involves an additional five minutes of bilateral finger and wrist passive stretching. The bi-weekly 20-minute knitting session will take place, at a seniors Club in metropolitan Ottawa, on Tuesday and Thursday mornings with a group of regular members who knit wool blankets for sick children admitted at a regional Childrens Hospital. The blankets are composed of individual squares that are assembled together. Each wool square takes approximately 20 minutes for a beginner knitter. Each knitter will be encouraged to knit one wool square per day for a total of seven squares per week. To avoid excessive isometric strength and potential muscle fatigue with the use of small needles that require precise pinching, participants will use specific knitting needle and wool sizes (sizes #6 and #5 respectively according to the Standard Yarn Weight System (http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html). Study participants will learn how to knit with a qualified instructor from The Pace Setters Seniors Club during the knitting sessions which will also be supervised by a trained occupational therapist to ensure that the physiological and clinical characteristics of therapeutic exercise are being met. A knitting instructor will ensure that participants follow the prescribed program and whether their individual logbooks, where they recorded their daily hand activities and morning stiffness and pain levels, are properly completed. In the event that a session is missed, participants in Group 1 will receive a telephone reminder from the research assistant to encourage them to attend the next session. At the end of 12 weeks, participants will be encouraged to continue on with the program if their condition has imporoved. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants assigned to the control group (Group 2) will be placed on a waiting list until the end of the study (12 weeks) plus the 4-week follow-up period. The research coordinator will offer one introductory session to explain how to record activity in their logbooks as well a weekly telephone follow-up by the coordinator inquire whether the participant has any questions using their logbooks. They will not be permitted to attend knitting sessions at the seniors club during the study duration. After the completion of the study duration, the knitting sessions will be available to all study participants.  To avoid potential contamination, individuals in Group 2 will have no contact with the individuals registered at The Pace Setters Seniors Club in Group 1. Club membership annual fees ($10/year) will be paid for all study participants in Group 1 and for those in Group 2 only after the completion of the study. Free knitting material and lessons will be provided for all study participants.</comparator>

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to each group. Participants in Group 2 will have access to the knitting program after the completion of the randomized controlled trial.
After each potential participant registers to a universal email address, they will be contacted by the research coordinator and their eligibility confirmed. The research assistant, who will not be involved in data collection, will contact the research study Methods Center data manager. Prior to running the randomization program, the data manager will document the participant’s initials (first and last) and date of birth (month and year). After running the program, the data manager will document the intervention assignment with the participant information, assign a study identification (ID) number and then inform the research assistant of the assignment and participant ID. This process will help ensure concealment of allocation. After randomization, the participant will be informed of their group assignment.

    <designfeatures>The study is a single blind, two-arm RCT with a parallel group design to compare two study groups: 1) a knitting intervention (Group 1) and 2) a waiting list control group (Group 2). The intervention period will be 12 weeks plus a follow-up at 4 weeks post-intervention to measure the retention effect.  Since this RCT involves a physical intervention (i.e. knitting program), the therapist, participants, and research coordinator administering the program will not be blinded. A blinded independent assessor will be trained to assess the participants though performance evaluation and self-reported questionnaires given at baseline, three weeks, six weeks, nine weeks, end of study (12 weeks), and four weeks follow-up to reduce detection bias. With training and standard operating procedures, it is anticipated that any performance bias due to unblinding will be minimized. The study protocol is approved by the University of Ottawa Research Ethics Board (#H02-16-12).</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the study variables and to assess the distributional assumptions of the statistical techniques used. An intention to treat analysis will be conducted for all the data analyses. A per protocol analysis will be considered as part of the sensitivity analyses. For the primary outcome, the area under the curve over 12 weeks for stiffness for participants in the knitting group (Group 1) will be compared to participants in the control group (Group 2) at 2 hours post-awakening from sleep. The cumulative visual analogue scale score will be calculated with use of the area under the curve and will be compared between the groups for the all daily morning stiffness and pain measurements over the 12 weeks program as well as follow-up. The independent Student's t-test will be applied using the pooled or separate variance estimate, as appropriate. For the secondary outcomes, the area under the curve for stiffness, pain and function will be compared using a 2-way analysis of variance with the between factor group (knitting vs control) and within factor time (0 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, evening).  Tukey's honestly significance difference will be used to make specific between group comparisons (knitting vs control), stiffness (0 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, evening); pain (0 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, evening)and function (0 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, evening). The secondary outcomes including: AUSCAN overall, AUSCAN pain, AUSCAN stiffness, AUSCAN function, hand and fingers strength and physical function, self-efficacy, hand physical activity level and adherence, global patient improvement as well as QoL, will be compared using a 2-way ANOVA with the between factor group (knitting vs. control) and within factor time (baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks and 4-week follow-up).  Again, Tukey's honestly significance difference  will be used to make specific between knitting vs control group comparisons.  As a secondary analysis, additional time assessments to 16 weeks will be included in the above analyses to assess follow-up. An alpha significance of 0.05 was chosen for all analyses.  Mixed models repeated measured will be used to accommodate missing data.  No interim efficacy or subgroup analyses are planned.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: The prevalence of hand osteoarthritis has been reported to be higher  amongst women over 50 years old (66%) compared to men of the same age (34%). Although exercise therapy has shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and disability associated with hand osteoarthritis, adherence to treatment programs remains low. The primary objective of this proposed randomized controlled trial will be to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week knitting program (Group 1) for morning stiffness and pain relief (intermediate outcome) compared to a waiting list control group (Group 2) in older females (50 to 85 years old) with mild to moderate osteoarthritis of the hands after 2 hours post-wakening from sleep.  

Methods/Design: This single-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial with a parallel group design. seeks to examine the effectiveness of a 12-week knitting program on morning stiffness , pain relief, functional status and self-efficacy in females (50 to 85 years old) with mild to moderate hand osteoarthritis compared to a control group receiving passive stretching exercises only. The premise behind the knitting program is to use a meaningful occupation as main component of an exercise program to reduce pain and morning stiffness. The knitting program comprises two components: 1) bi-weekly 20-minute knitting sessions at a seniors club and 2) 20-minute home daily knitting sessions for the five remaining weekdays. Each knitting session begins with a five-minute warm-up (light passive bilateral stretching exercises of the hand and wrist) and ends with a cool-down (five minutes of bilateral finger and wrist passive stretching). Participants assigned to the control  will be encouraged to perform 10 minutes of daily passive hand stretching. Pain, morning stiffness, hand function, self-efficacy and quality of life will be measured at baseline, six weeks, and 12 weeks (end of program) with standardized tools. We hypothesize that participants in the knitting program will have significant improvements in all clinical outcomes compared to the control group. A published case study as well as the preliminary results of a feasibility study as examined through a 6-week pre-post study (n=5 women with hand osteoarthritis) involving 20-minute daily knitting morning sessions led to this proposed randomized controlled trial research protocol. This article describes the intervention and the empirical evidence to support it.

Discussion: This knitting randomized controlled trial has the potential to enhance our understanding of daily hand osteoarthritis symptom management and exercise adherence, to refine functional exercise recommendations in this prevalent disease, and to reduce the burden of disability in older women.</summary>
