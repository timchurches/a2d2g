  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The era of precision medicine is an exciting time for clinicians, scientists and patients
      alike. The increasing appreciation and identification of specific mutations that drive
      cancers, leaves us on the threshold of a new era in which biomarkers will be used to direct
      targeted agents to only those patients most likely to respond. The potential medical and
      scientific benefits of such a personalised approach to cancer therapy are immense. However, a
      number of barriers challenge successful implementation of this approach of which spatial and
      temporal heterogeneity are a major concern.

      Gynaecological cancers are a major cause of mortality and morbidity internationally. In
      Auckland 150 new patients with ovarian, endometrial or cervical cancer are seen by a medical
      oncologist each year. In general, when these diseases recur, there are few effective
      therapeutic options and prognosis is poor. Better therapeutic targets and treatments are an
      unmet need across these tumour types with treatment paradigms still based upon platinum based
      therapy.

      PROSPER (Profiling of Oncology Patients as part of Clinical care and Research) will
      investigate the evolution of gynaecological cancers over time and in response to treatment to
      develop better biomarkers to guide treatment decisions and ultimately improve patient
      outcomes. Biopsies at relapse will be collected and profiled with a 580 cancer gene panel.
      Circulating tumour DNA will be collected and analysed alongside biopsies as a potential
      non-invasive alternative. Linking genomic and clinical data will allow us to learn more to
      begin to change our paradigm of care.</summary>
