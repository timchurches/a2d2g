    <statisticalmethods>The number of participants needed to achieve study objectives has not been formally determined. This is an early phase study which seeks to test early-stage hypotheses based on a review of existing exploratory studies.

In order to ensure the three groups are comparable at baseline, group homogeneity will be tested in relation to the following: primary outcome measures, age (years), aphasia severity (Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient score) (Kertesz, 2007), and education (years). The Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) by ranks (H-test) is the non-parametric alternative to the one-way analysis of variance (F-test) used to test for three or more independent samples (Portney &amp; Watkins, 2009). A significance level of .05 will be used. 

Given 1) the use of a small sample size within the present study cannot automatically be considered representative of larger normal distributions and 2) the use of ordinal scale-level measurements, non-parametric statistical analyses will be conducted (Portney &amp; Watkins, 2009). These will involve between- and within-groups analyses.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of three models of community aphasia groups for participants with aphasia and their nominated family members. 

Outcomes for people with aphasia will be measured in relation to each domain of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (WHO, 2001): impairment, activity &amp; participation, personal factors, and environmental factors. Quality of life and participant experience of the program will be additional outcome areas of interest. Outcomes for family members will relate to caregiving, psychological health, supported conversation skill, and participant experience of the program.

Hypotheses:

1) Each of the three community aphasia groups will lead to positive outcomes for all people with aphasia at the end of participation in at least one area of outcome measurement,

2) People with aphasia attending the treatment group (known as multidisciplinary-facilitated community aphasia group, or MD-CAG) will show greater gains than people with aphasia attending either of the two active comparison groups,  

3) The gains made by people with aphasia attending MD-CAG will be maintained or will increase further 4-6 weeks after the end of participation,

4) Family members attending MD-CAG and one of the active comparison groups (known as volunteer and peer-facilitated community aphasia group, or VP-CAG), will show gains in at least one area of outcome measurement at the end of participation, 

5) Family members of people with aphasia attending MD-CAG will show greater gains than family members of people with aphasia attending either of the two comparison groups, and

6) The gains made by family members will be maintained or will increase further 4-6 weeks after the end of participation.
