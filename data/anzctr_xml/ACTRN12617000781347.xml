    <interventions>PROCEDURE


First month: 

Participants will be asked to fill in an online survey, which will take approximately 30 minutes. They will receive a blood glucose meter and test strips in the post and will be asked to use this meter for checking their blood glucose before driving (as per current national guidelines). We will also provide them with a GPS device in the vehicle that they normally drive. This device will provide information regarding what times they are driving during the day. We will not use any location data generated by this device and such data will be deleted upon its return to ACBRD. Its sole purpose is to provide accurate data on the driving times.


Second month: 

Participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control groups. 

If they are allocated to the control group:

They will be asked to continue their normal routine. At the end of the second month they will be asked to complete an online survey (30 minutes). The vehicle usage logging device and blood glucose meter will be returned via post. Participants in this control group will be given an opportunity to view a brief (30 minute) online hypo / diabetes management strategies unit at the end of the study (see details below). 

If they are allocated to the intervention group:

They will be provided with a small tool-kit to keep in their car. This tool-kit will consist of a pre-drive checklist, rapid-acting and long-acting glucose sources, blood glucose driving benchmark keychain and stickers, and a blood glucose meter. The purpose of the tool-kit is to help support drivers who are managing their diabetes with insulin and will include such things as rapid-acting and long-acting glucose sources and a pre-driving checklist. Before using this tool-kit they will also be required to view a brief (30 minute) online hypo / diabetes management strategies unit, which will introduce the tool-kit and its purpose in supporting anticipation, prevention, detection and treatment of hypoglycaemia while driving. 


A member of the study team will contact them to make sure they have received the tool-kit and to provide advice on how to incorporate it into their daily driving routine. At the end of the second month them will be asked to complete an online survey (30 minutes). The GPS device and blood glucose meter will be returned via post.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure: Number of blood glucose related driving mishaps over a six-month period since intervention completion. 

Assessment: Participants will be asked to complete monthly online driving mishap diaries during this period. Driving mishaps will be defined as collisions, moving vehicle violations, severe hypoglycemia while driving, loss of vehicle control, automatic driving (finding themselves at a destination with no awareness of the drive), and instances of impaired driving in which someone else took over driving.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six-month post intervention completion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure: Consistency of pre-driving blood glucose checks during the eight week assessment period.

Assessment: A car usage logger will timestamp participant vehicle usage over this period. The blood glucose meter supplied by the study team will timestamp any blood glucose checks performed by the driver. This will allow the latency between blood glucose checks and driving to be documented objectively </outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected over two four-week assessments. The first is a four week baseline assessment period. The second is a four week intervention or control assessment period. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure: Self-assessed risky driving behaviour.

Assessment: Diabetic Driving Assessment scale (DDAS) and the Risk Assessment of Diabetic Drivers (RADD) questionnaires will be used to score driver behaviour. </outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at the start of the first month (week one) and at the end of the second month (week eight).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure: Hypoawareness

Assessment: The Gold score, a brief measure of impaired hypoawareness will be used to describe participants in terms of their hypoawareness . 

</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at the start of the first month (week one) and at the end of the second month (week eight).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome measure: Severe hypoglycaemia incidence 

Assessment: The Hypoglycaemia Awareness Questionnaire (HypoA-Q), a validated measure of frequency and severity of hypoglycaemia, will be used to describe participants in terms of their hypoglycaemia history.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This data will be collected at the start of the first month (week one) and at the end of the second month (week eight).</timepoint>

The analysis will test the primary hypothesis that the number of blood glucose related driving mishaps will differ at a six-month follow up between participants in the DDA intervention group compared to those in routine care. 

The group difference in mean latency between checking blood glucose and driving will be explored as a secondary hypothesis.

    <summary>Brief summary

Background 

Australia drivers are required to stop driving for at least six weeks if they experience a severe hypoglycaemic event (requiring the assistance of another person for recovery). Australian fitness to drive guidelines indicate that specialist support should be available during this time to assist in the individuals assessment and their potential return to driving. However, at present there are no structured education programs in place to assist these drivers when they return to driving, or pre-emptively, to minimize the risk of a hypoglycaemia-related driving incident.

Objectives
This project will develop an Australian version of the DiabetesDriving.com intervention, a low-cost educational program specifically aimed towards at-risk drivers with type 1 diabetes.

Study Plan
This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted in Australia. 

The number of blood glucose related driving mishaps is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include self-assessed risky driving behaviour and the frequency of pre-driving blood glucose checks. The latter is relevant as current guidelines require drivers to check their blood glucose level before driving.

As a pilot, no power calculations have been undertaken. Data will inform a larger RCT. Estimating a 20% dropout/incomplete data, we will recruit a minimum of 60 participants to achieve a sample of 50.
