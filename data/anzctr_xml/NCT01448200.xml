                  liver disease

               2. Seropositive for HCV antibody or HCV RNA at least once previously, and at Screen

               3. Serum HCV RNA &gt; 5 log10 IU/mL at Screen, by the PCR assay at the central study
                  laboratory

               4. HCV genotype-1 (1a or 1b, or non-subtypable genotype-1), or HCV genotype-2a or
                  genotype-3a

          2. ALT must be &lt;5 x ULN at screen

          3. No previous treatment with interferon, pegIFN, or ribavirin for genotype-1 patients

          4. No history of signs or symptoms of decompensated liver disease

          5. Any of the following laboratory values at Screening will be exclusionary for study
             participation:

               -  Hgb &lt;11 g/dL in women or 12 g/dL in men.

               -  White blood cell count &lt; 4,000/mm3.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1800 per mm3.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PPI-668 is an antiviral agent (a hepatitis C NS5A inhibitor) that is being developed as a
      potential treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. This study is being done to assess the
      safety and tolerance of PPI-668 when given to healthy volunteers for up to 5 days (Part I of
      the study) and to hepatitis C patients for up to 3 days (Part II). In addition, the study
      will assess how much PPI-668 is absorbed into the bloodstream. In Part II, the effect of
      PPI-668 on the amount of hepatitis C virus in patients' bloodstream (serum HCV RNA levels)
      also will be assessed.</summary>
