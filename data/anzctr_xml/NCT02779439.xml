  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Recipients of myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic or solid organ
             transplantation for any indication.

          -  Presence of viral reactivation or infection with CMV, Adv or EBV or invasive fungal
             disease must be present at the time of infusion as determined by:

               -  For CMV CMV detectable by antigen detection, PCR or culture in peripheral blood
                  or tissue biopsy or by immunohistochemical staining on tissue biopsy specimen

               -  For Adv Presence of Adv as detected by PCR, antigen detection or culture in body
                  fluids including blood, stool, urine or nasopharyngeal secretions

               -  For EBV Elevated EB virus detectable in peripheral blood by PCR or Presence of
                  documented EBV related PTLD diagnosed by tissue biopsy or Elevated EB virus
                  detectable in the blood by PCR and clinical or imaging findings consistent with
                  EBV lymphoma

                  to De Pauw 2008[114]

          -  Failure of standard therapy as defined by:

               -  For CMV The continued presence of detectable CMV virus or antigen after at least
                  14 days of antiviral therapy with IV ganciclovir or foscarnet Recurrence of
                  detectable CMV virus or antigen after at least 2 weeks of prior antiviral therapy

               -  For Adv A rise or less than 50% reduction in viral load in blood or any site of
                  disease as measured by PCR or any quantitative assay despite use of therapy as
                  determined by the treating physician; Standard therapy may include intravenous
                  cidofovir within the limits of renal function

               -  For EBV Increase or less than 50% decrease in the size of EBV lymphoma or

        Increase or less than 50% decrease in the EBV viral load in peripheral blood despite use of
        appropriate therapy as determined by the treating physician which may include:

          -  Reduction in immunosuppression

          -  Rituximab 375mg/m2 up to 4 infusions

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy

             o For invasive fungal disease inadequate or incomplete clinical response according to
             treating physician after at least 5 days of best available therapy

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function (&lt; 3 x upper limit of normal for AST (SGOT), ALT
             (SGPT), &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal for total bilirubin, serum creatinine)

          -  ECOG status 0 to 3 or Lansky score 30-100

             antibody) given in the 4 weeks immediately prior to infusion or planned within 4 weeks
             after infusion.

          -  Grade II or greater graft versus host disease within 1 week prior to infusion.

          -  Prednisone or methylprednisolone at a dose of &gt; 1 mg/kg (or equivalent in other
             steroid preparations) administered within 72 hours prior to cell infusion.
