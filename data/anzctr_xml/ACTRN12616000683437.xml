  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both cervical VEMPs and ocular VEMPs will be measured in all participants at a Public Hospital by Jon Osborne, an Masters of Audiology student. Following placement of skin electrodes on the neck and below the eyes, the vestibular system will be stimulated using high level (starting at 100 dB HL before reducing intensity to determine threshold) 500 and 1000 Hz tone bursts via TDH headphones to each ear. 

The rise and fall time of the tone burst will be set to 1 ms with a 2 ms plateau. The tone bursts will be presented at 10 Hz, and  256 repetitions will be used to produce a waveform (Lasting about 26 seconds).

Electromyography activity will be recorded using a CED 1902 bioamplifier and National Instruments USB6215 DAQ attached to a laptop. There are no known risks associated with VEMPs. However the sound levels may be uncomfortable.
All testing will be performed on one day, and will take less than an hour. 

The cVEMPs and oVEMPs are not being compared directly.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>One-tailed t-tests with an alpha of 0.1 and power of 0.8 will be used. Corrections for multiple comparisons will not be made due to reduction of power. One-tailed t-tests are being used because an impairment of VEMP measures is typically in one direction.

Power analysis was performed using GPower 3.1 to determine sample size for one-tailed t-tests with a power of 0.8, alpha of 0.1 and effect size of 0.6 (based on previous literature of VEMPs in vestibular migraine). This gave an n of 26 per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We will use a test of a balance  (Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potential) in people with vestibular migraine and those without. This study aims to see whether the test could help to diagnose vestibular migraine. If useful, it may assist in the diagnosis of vestibular migraine. Previous studies have suggested that the test produces abnormal results. We will be excluding the primary differential diagnosis of vesibular migraine (Meniere's disease) from our vestibular migraine group using electrocochleography, an objective test for Meniere's disease. It is hypothesised that the vestibular test results will be the same between healthy controls and patients with vestibular migraine.</summary>
