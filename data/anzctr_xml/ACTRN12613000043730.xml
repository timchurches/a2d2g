  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pparticipants in the intervention group will receive a multifactorial, interdisciplinary treatment program intended to target the frailty criteria that are present for a 12-month period following randomisation. The interventions will be individually tailored to each participant based on their frailty characteristics as assessed at baseline, and additional problems as identified during a detailed assessment by experienced physiotherapist(s) providing the intervention program. Geriatric evaluation and management principles will underpin both the assessment and intervention. Case management and regular case conferences will facilitate coordination of intervention delivery. Reassessment will be ongoing throughout the intervention phase.  

The intervention is the same as that used in the FIT study. See https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=82814 </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive the usual healthcare available to older residents in the Hornsby Ku-ring-gai area from their general practitioner (GP) and community services. </comparator>

    <concealment>There will be an initial interview at which eligibility is confirmed and informed consent is obtained. Participants will be randomised immediately after this.

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Data will be coded to permit blinding to group allocation in the statistical analysis. Frailty criteria will be treated as dichotomous: transitioned to frailty (that is, the number of frailty criteria was 3 or more) or did not transition to frailty (number of frailty criteria was 0. 1 or 2). Other study outcomes as continuous variables. The chi-square test will be used for frailty as a dichotomous variable, and linear regression models with baseline values as a covariate will be used for continuous outcomes. We will report between group differences in percentages, or mean, with 95% confidence intervals at the 4- and 12-month follow-ups. We will test whether the patterns of change in frailty and mobility are modified by the number of frailty criteria present at baseline, by including an interaction term of study groups with frailty criteria at baseline in the regression analyses. Secondary analyses will also be carried out to explore the effect of different rates of adherence (i.e. as a category variable: &lt;25%, 25-49%, 50-75% and &gt;75%) on the outcomes in the intervention group at the 12-month follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>This is a randomised trial of a multifactorial interdisciplinary intervention for pre frailty. The intervention has previously been shown to be effective in frailty older people (see ACTRN12608000250336, https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=82814).</summary>
