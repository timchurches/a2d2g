  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Control (no cognitive aid). This arm proceeds with airway cart set-up as in their routine clinical practice, Arm 2: Airway Checklist. The airway checklist includes a list of intubation equipment suggested for non-operating room use by the Australian Resuscitation Council. This arm uses the airway checklist as a cognitive aid while setting up the airway cart, Arm 3: Airway Template. The airway template is designed to lie on top of the airway trolley and uses silhouettes of intubation equipment to prompt their inclusion in set-up and also their location on the trolley. This arm uses the airway template as a cognitive aid while setting up the airway cart. The airway cart set-up process will be monitored by a study investigator, but the use or non-use of the cognitive aid will be up to the study participant. The entire process of airway cart set-up takes on average less than 5 minutes, and the study participant can use the cognitive aid for the entirety of this process.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Our sample size calculation is based upon the absolute omission rate. We estimate from observations of current practice that omission rate is 80% without any template/checklist usage.  We estimate that introduction of the template or checklist will result in an improvement to a 20% omission rate. Using a superiority design, recruiting 21 participants per group delivers a power of 0.99 with an alpha of 0.05, therefore 63 participants will be recruited. This is recruitment is feasible with current staffing levels at RCH ED. We estimate that the omission rate will improve from the 80% control rate to 20% using the template or the checklists. Using a superiority design, recruiting 21 participants per group delivers a power of 0.99 with an alpha of 0.05. The statistical analysis will be by intention to treat. The primary outcome is dichotomous and effect sizes will be presented as proportions of intervention and control groups who have reduced their omission rate. Primary and secondary outcomes have non-Gaussian distributions. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Primary outcome analysis will be the comparison of proportions of two independent samples using Chi squared  test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is a prospective randomized controlled study. 
The study is designed as a paper-based intervention of senior medical and nursing staff working in the resuscitation room environment in the Emergency Department of The Royal Childrens Hospital.
The study is single centred.
The study is designed to assess the utility of paper-based interventions (checklist or template) in standardizing airway trolley set-up compared to no intervention. As a randomized controlled study, the primary study objective should be free of bias.
Data collected will include the participant role (medical or nursing) and level of seniority. Additionally, study information will include the rate of omitted items from airway trolley set-up, the error rate in airway trolley set-up, the time taken to set up the airway trolley, and staff confidence and satisfaction with airway trolley set-up. A photo of the airway trolley set up will be recorded for blinded assessment of variability in equipment location. No identifiable information will be recorded at any stage of the investigation.
Data will be collected during the participant encounter for omission rate, error rate, and satisfaction / confidence survey. This data will be recorded on a standardized Clinician Report Form (CRF). This will be stored in a locked study cabinet accessible only to the primary investigator. A photograph of the airway trolley set-up will be taken with a dedicated digital camera at the time of participant encounter for later analysis. This will be stored on a password protected external hard drive.
Study preparation and planning will take approximately 2 months. Participant recruitment, based on a total number of participants of 63 with 7 study investigators recruiting 3-5 participants per week, will take approximately 1 month. Data collection and analysis will take approximately 2-3 months.
