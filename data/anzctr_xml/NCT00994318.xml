  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis for Time to Other Anemia Therapy or Hb Trigger - Endpoint reported number of participants with/without events and was reached:
First time of initiation of additional or alternative anaemia management,
First time the subject reached the Hb trigger.
3 primary comparisons using a hierarchical step-down procedure on the log-rank test to preserve an alpha level of 0.05, performed in the following order:
FCM (high ferritin target) compared with oral iron.
FCM (high ferritin target) compared with FCM (low ferritin target).
FCM (low ferritin target) compared with oral iron.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed using the following alternative definitions of time to initiation of additional or alternative anaemia management:
Without taking into account the Hb trigger.
Taking into account the Hb trigger based on local laboratory data, instead of central laboratory data.
Taking into account the Hb trigger based on subjects with a complete set of Hb values from the central laboratory.</outcome>

             chorionic gonadotropin test) or was breast feeding.
