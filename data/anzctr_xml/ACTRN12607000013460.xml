  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible patients will be registered to receive the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, ZD1839 (gefitinib; IRESSA) for a minimum of 14 days to a maximum of 45 days; commencing within the 8 days following registration and ceasing 24 hours prior to the time of definitive surgery.  No more than 28 days should elapse between the initial breast cancer diagnosis and the first dose of ZD1839 (IRESSA).   Each patient should receive a minimum of 10 consecutive days of treatment with ZD1839 (IRESSA) prior to the definitive surgery date.

During the treatment period, ZD1839 (IRESSA) will be administered orally, once daily, in a 250 mg dose.  

Follow up of patients will continue beyond definitive surgery with the last planned clinic visit scheduled for 30 days after the last administration of ZD1839 (IRESSA).  In the event that related adverse events or serious adverse events are ongoing at the last planned visit, patient follow up will continue as clinically indicated until the event/s resolve or, in the Investigators opinion, are unlikely to resolve due to the nature of the condition and/or the patients underlying disease.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify the molecular alterations which occur in human breast cancer tissue after short term exposure to ZD1839 (IRESSA).  Short term exposure to ZD1839 (IRESSA) is defined as a maximum of 45 days (range 14  45 days).  Molecular alterations occurring due to ZD1839 (IRESSA) exposure will be identified by analyses of tumour tissue samples (core needle or incisional biopsy) and skin punch biopsies collected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of initial diagnosis (baseline) and again at the time of definitive surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses will be conducted on assays of plasma samples collected from the patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, immediately prior to the last dose of ZD1839 (IRESSA), and again 24 hours after the last dose of ZD1839 (IRESSA).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For all patients: 
 To evaluate the molecular effects of short term ZD1839 exposure in normal skin tissue and on Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) signalling pathways in non-tumour cells (skin tissue). 
 To correlate the pharmacokinetic parameters with molecular alterations detected in breast cancer tissue and normal skin following study treatment. 
 To evaluate the tolerability and safety of short term exposure to a daily oral single dose of 250 mg ZD1839 administration.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from assays of plasma samples (collected at baseline, immediately prior to, and 24 hours after, the last dose of ZD1839 (IRESSA).   </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>For patients having consented to the optional substudy (tumour tissue collection): 
 To determine intratumoural concentrations of ZD1839 and correlate these with pharmacokinetic parameters and molecular alterations detected in breast cancer tissue.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intratumoural concentrations of ZD1839 and pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from assays of plasma samples (collected at baseline, immediately prior to, and 24 hours after, the last dose of ZD1839 (IRESSA).</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>1. Written informed consent prior to beginning specific protocol procedures, including expected cooperation of the patients for the treatment and follow-up, must be obtained and documented according to the local regulatory requirements. 2.

Tumour must be confined to either the breast or to the breast and ipsilateral axilla. Patients must have a tumour size of &gt;= 2 cm (T1 with T=2cm, T2 - T3). Patient can have either clinically positive (N1) or clinically negative axillary nodes (N0). 4. Patient must provide tumour tissue from four (4) core needle biopsies (or the equivalent with respect to tumour volume acquired from an incisional biopsy) for the molecular analyses being performed by the designated UCLA laboratory. 5. Patient must provide normal skin tissue from two punch biopsies for analyses being performed by the designated UCLA laboratory. 6. Patient must provide a baseline plasma sample for the pharmacokinetic analysis. 7. Age &gt;=18 years. 8. Karnofsky Performance status index &gt;= 80%. 9.

Total bilirubin &lt;= 1 UNL (patients with a well documented history of Gilbert's Syndrome are eligible)ii. ASAT (SGOT) and ALAT (SGPT) &lt;= 2.5 UNLiii. Alkaline phosphatase &lt;= 5 UNLc. Renal function:i. Creatinine &lt;= 175 Âµmol/L (2 mg/dL)10. Not more than 28 days from the time of the initial diagnosis and 8 days from registration to the first dose of ZD1839 shall elapse. 11. Patients must be accessible for treatment and the 30-day follow-up. 12. Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 7 days prior to registration for all women of childbearing potential. </inclusivecriteria>
