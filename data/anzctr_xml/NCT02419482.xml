  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behaviour - 4x4 minutes high intensity interval training
Behaviour - 10x1 minute high intensity interval training

Experimental: 4x4 minutes interval training - 4x4 minutes high intensity interval training with 4 minute intervals

Experimental: 10x1 minute interval training - 10x1 minute high intensity interval training with 1 minute intervals

No Intervention: control - Physical activity recommended


Behaviour: 4x4 minutes high intensity interval training
Treadmill running/walking with 10 minutes varm-up at 60-70% of maximum heart rate, 4x4 minute intervals at 90-95% of maximum heart rate separated by 3-minutes active pauses at 60-70% of maximum heart rate, and 3 minutes cool-down.

Behaviour: 10x1 minute high intensity interval training
Treadmill running/walking with 10 minutes varm-up at 60-70% of maximum heart rate, ten 1-minute intervals at maximal intensity (that can be performed for one minute), separated by 1-minutes active pauses at 60-70% of maximum heart rate, and 3 minutes cool-down.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim is to investigate whether 16 weeks of high intensity interval training, followed by
      36 weeks of home-based exercise, will improve menstrual frequency in women with Polycystic
      Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) compared with a non-exercising control group.</summary>
