  <interventions>
    <interventions>Etanercept (Enbrel) 25mg or less prepared in 1ml syringe as 25mg/1ml, injected subcutaneously at the back of the neck in an area that drains into the blood supply that goes towards the brain spaces. The treatment consists of a weekly injection of Etanercept over a period of 4 weeks by a trained and certified medical practitioner, followed by a follow-up assessment on the 5th week. Participant will be tilted forward on a purpose built tilt bed after the injection lowering the head for 5 minutes to aid the Etanercept enter the brain spaces.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Etanercept, when given by injection overlying the spine, has been reported to be very beneficial for treatment of patients with moderate Alzheimers disease and is a beneficial treatment for other related forms of dementia in multiple published, peer-reviewed scientific studies. The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of perispinal injection of Etanercept in subjects with progressive dementia with a focus on Australian Alzheimer's sufferers.</summary>
