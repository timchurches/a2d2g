  <interventions>
    <interventions>DUR-928 solution: 30 mg/mL DUR-928 solution after constitution with sterile vehicle solution.
Placebo for solution: The sterile vehicle solution contains hydroxypropyl betadex in phosphate buffered water. 
DUR-928 suspension: 25 mg/mL DUR-928 suspension after constitution with sterile vehicle suspension.
Placebo for suspension: The sterile vehicle suspension contains polyethylene glycol  in phosphate buffered water.
Active Comparator: 2mg/mL Kenalog-10 (Triamcinolone Acetonide) after dilution with sterile sodium chloride.
Treatment Control: one site will contain no intervention. 
Each participant will be treated with 2 different formulations of study drug, 2 placebo (vehicle) formulations, one active comparator and one untreated area (6 treatments in total). Each treatment will be administered to every participant as three 100 microlitre intralesional injections, with the exception of the untreated area. All 5 treatments will be administered consecutively. Each treatment area is approximately 4cm^2. 
The planned study treatments are: 
A = DUR-928 Solution, 30 mg/mL (3 x 100 microlitre = 9 mg) 
B = DUR-928 Suspension, 25 mg/mL (3 x 100 microlitre = 7.5 mg) 
C = Vehicle for Solution, (3 x 100 microlitre = 0.3 mL) 
D = Vehicle for Suspension, (3 x 100 microlitre = 0.3 mL) 
E = Kenalog-10 (diluted) 2mg/mL (3 x 100 microlitre = 0.6 mg) 
F = Untreated area
Unblinded study staff will administer all doses. Adherence to the correct dosing procedure will be documented in source data and review by an unblinded monitor. This is a single dose trial. </interventions>

      <outcome>To establish preliminary evidence for the efficacy of intralesionally injected DUR-928 in patients with psoriasis, as assessed by microplaque assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Local Psoriasis Severity Index (LPSI): LPSI assessments will be performed by the Principal Investigator or delegate at Screening, Baseline (Day 0, pre-dose), and at each outpatient visit at Day 1, Day 2, Day 7 and Day 14. The effect of DUR-928 in psoriasis will be assessed by the change of Local Plaque Severity Index (LPSI) score as compared to vehicle in this microplaque assay.
Photography: Digital photography of the application sites will be performed at Day 0 at Baseline (pre-dose) and 2 hours post-dose, and at each outpatient visit at Day 1, Day 2, Day 7 and Day 14. </timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of DUR-928 in patients with psoriasis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Routine vital sign measurements (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) will be measured at screening, pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose (Day 0), and at out-patient visits on Day 1, Day 2, Day 7 and Day 14. 
Physical examination will be performed at screening, pre-dose (Day 0), and at the out-patient visit on Day 14.
Safety Laboratory tests (Chemistry, Hematology and Urinalysis) will be drawn at screening, pre-dose (Day 0), and at out-patient visits on Day 2 and Day 14.

    <concealment>10-12 participants will each be administered all 6 treatments: 2 different formulations of study drug, 2 vehicle formulations, one active comparator and one untreated area. The dose will be provided to blinded subjects by unblinded dosing staff. All other site staff will remain blinded to the treatment positions. 

A central randomization schedule will be generated by the INC Research Head of Biometrics personnel â€“ who will have no further involvement in the study. The central Randomization schedule will be provided only to the site dosing administration staff (unblinded) who will be exclusively responsible for administering the doses. Subjects will be assigned a randomization number in sequential order, as their eligibility is confirmed, by blinded site staff (who have no access to the Randomization schedule).

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety  Safety will be evaluated by assessment of clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations including vital signs, and ECGs, and by the documentation of all spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs). Treatment-emergent AEs will be tabulated by patient.

Efficacy - The effect of DUR-928 in psoriasis will be assessed by the change of LPSI score as compared to vehicle in this microplaque assay. The following evaluations will be made: 
Evaluation of the drug effect within the same formulation: For each formulation within a subjects target plaque, the comparison of drug vs the vehicle will be made by deriving the difference and its 95% Confidence Interval (CI) of the change in LPSI scores by study visit. 
Evaluation of formulation effect: The difference from DUR-928 solution formulation vs DUR-928 suspension formulation within a subjects target plaque(s) will be derived by study visit. 
Microplaque assay sensitivity of the active comparator: The positive effect of the active comparator, Kenalog 'Registered Trademark', on the plaque is expected. The active comparator treatment vs each vehicle treatment and the untreated site will be compared within a subjects target plaque(s).

No formal statistical assumptions or sample size calculations have been made for the study as this is a Proof of Concept study, wherein within each patient the vehicle treatment is compared to the active treatment (self-controlled study) to evaluate the signal of efficacy.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at how safe, well tolerated and effective a new drug called DUR-928 is when given as an interlesional injection to participants with plaque-type psoriasis. The study will look at comparing the study drugs safety, tolerability and effectiveness as a treatment for psoriasis using 2 different formulations when compared against placebo vehicle formulations, an active comparator and no treatment at all. </summary>
