    <studytitle>Evaluation of the Chocolate Balloon Catheter for Percutaneous Transluminal Revascularization of Infrainguinal Arterial Disease</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients with infrainguinal arterial disease, can the Chocolate Balloon Catheter be used safely and effectively for ballon dilatation during percutaneous transluminal revascularization procedures?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)- During this procedure a balloon, such as the Chocolate Balloon, is placed across a narrowing in a blood vessel of the leg.  The balloon is inflated temporarily to open up the narrowing by pushing on the wall of the vessel to restore blood flow in that part of the artery.  After inflation, the balloon is removed and no part of the balloon catheter is left behind in the artery.  The balloon can be inflated for up to a few minutes and it may be inflated more than one time.  The procedure will usually take about 30 minutes to complete, but a more complicated blockage can take one hour or more.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Technical Success: defined as &lt;50% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection at the target lesion based on physician review of the imaging taken at the end of the procedure.  An idependent core lab will also asses the images for this outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at the end of the Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA) procedure</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>percentage of patients free from Major Adverse Events (MAE) including death, index limb major amputation and target lesion revascularization based upon a review of the patient chart and a physical exam</outcome>
      <timepoint>patients are monitored through hospital discharge and then at follow-up visits to be conducted at 1 month, 6 months and 12 months after the procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device Success: defined as &lt;50% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection at the target lesion based on physician review of the imaging taken after the Chocolate Balloon is used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after use of the investigational device</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>primary patency - defined as freedom from hemodynamically significant restenosis at the target lesion without the need of target lesion revascularization.  This will be asssesed by an independent core lab review of the follow-up images.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at follw-up vists conducted 6 months and 12 months after the procedure</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
