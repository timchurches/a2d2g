  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pilot studies show that spironolactone is effective in the arrest of female pattern hair loss and may result in some hair gain. However to date there have been no placebo controlled trials to verify this. As well minoxidil has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of female pattern hair loss and there are recent case reports that it may have a synergistic effect when used with spironolactone. This project aims to study the effectiveness of these treatments as well as determining underlying tissue and genetic factors that may effect response.</summary>
