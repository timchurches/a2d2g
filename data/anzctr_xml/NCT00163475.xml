  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bronchial asthma is among the world's most prevalent diseases. Roflumilast is a novel, orally
      active, selective enzyme inhibitor (phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor), which has shown
      effectiveness in the treatment of asthma.

      The aim of the study is to compare the effect of roflumilast on lung function, symptoms, and
      use of rescue medication in patients with stable asthma. Roflumilast will be administered
      orally either in the morning or in the evening at one dose level. The study duration consists
      of a baseline period (1 to 2 weeks) and a treatment period (6 weeks). The study will provide
      further data on safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of roflumilast.</summary>
