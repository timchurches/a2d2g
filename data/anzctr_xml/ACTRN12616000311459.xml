  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention for this trial is:: melatonin (10mg) prolonged release (Circadin) oral tablet.

For the induction of labour, standard clinical practice involves admission to hospital in the late afternoon/early evening.. At this time, a trans-cervical balloon catheter is inserted in order to facilitate cervical ripening, prior to the commencement of an intravenous oxytocin infusion (IVI) the following morning 

For the trial, we propose to administer the trial intervention (melatonin 10mg prolonged release) or the comparator (placebo) at up to four time points, the administration regimen is as follows:

1) The first dose at the time of the trans-cervical balloon insertion (around 16.00-19.00hrs).
2) The second dose will be the following morning when the oxytocin intravenous infusion (IVI) is commenced (around 06.00-07.00hrs). 
3) Six hours later (around midday to 13.00hr), if birth has not occurred, a third dose will be given. 
4) Six hours later (around. 18,00hr to 19.00hr) if birth has not yet occurred, a fourth and final dose will be administered.

If birth occurs at any time between the first and fourth dose, administration of the study intervention will cease</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator for this trial is: a placebo tablet, the placebo will be have an identical presentation to the intervention (melatonin 10mg prolonged release) tablet, thus the intervention and comparator will be indistinguishable from each other.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: Primary Outcome- Caesarean section: Within our health service, 37% of term nulliparous women who were induced had an intrapartum caesarean section compared to 17% of term nulliparous women who labour spontaneously (Data derived from Monash Health Birthing Outcomes System 2009-2015). A clinically relevant decrease in caesarean births, should melatonin supplementation at induction of labour be effective, would be an absolute reduction of 10% in the caesarean rate from 37% to 27%. This is aligned with the Healthy people 2020 targets, an initiative of the American Federal Government that recommends a 10% reduction in caesarean rates. To detect a 10% decrease in the rate of caesarean birth (37% down to 27%) with 80% power (two-tailed, p&lt;0.05) we will need to recruit 361 women to each arm, allowing a potential loss to follow up of 10% will recruit a total of 796 women.

Statistical Analysis: All analyses will be performed using intention-to-treat and per- protocol if relevant. All data will be assessed for normality. Characteristics of the two groups will be tabulated and compared using the appropriate statistical test (chi2, independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test). Differences in the primary outcome will be assessed by logistic regression adjusting for confounders/baseline imbalances between groups. Differences in the secondary outcomes will be assessed using the appropriate regression method adjusting for confounders/baseline imbalances between groups. The costs will be calculated separately for each mother/infant pair. The data will be assessed for normality and then compared between the melatonin and control arm using the appropriate statistical test. A p value of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant and all analyses will be undertaken using StataCorp 12 (StataCorp. 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release 12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP.)</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Induction of labour is a common obstetric intervention that 1 in 4 women will experience. The ultimate goal of induction of labour is to achieve a vaginal birth, however in almost 40% of first time mothers it fails. The outcome of a failed induction, a caesarean delivery is associated with vast range of adverse effects, both short and long term for the mother and her baby. In this application we propose that a simple and inexpensive intervention will increase the success of induction of labour. Lessons from successful spontaneous births tell us that labour occurs more frequently, and is shorter with less intervention when it occurs at night. The driver of this is thought to be the endogenous hormone, melatonin. Melatonin is synthesised by the placenta. Healthy pregnant women have higher concentrations of melatonin compared to non-pregnant women. Melatonin levels also increase with gestation, peaking during labour and then falling rapidly after delivery. The biological reason for an altered melatonin cycle in pregnancy is unclear. However, the myometrium of the pregnant uterus expresses melatonin receptors and these receptors have been shown to be up-regulated in labouring compared to non-labouring women. Intriguingly, both melatonin and oxytocin activate the same signalling pathway that results in uterine contractions. Specifically, melatonin treatment of myometrium increases its sensitivity, enhances oxytocin-induced contractions and improves myometrium cell communication and synchronization. Taken together this suggests an important role of melatonin in the onset and progress of labour. We therefore hypothesise that supplementing women undergoing induction of labour with melatonin will improve the success rate of induction of labour. We will undertake a double-blinded randomised controlled trial of melatonin supplementation to improve the success of induction of labour in healthy first time mothers.</summary>
