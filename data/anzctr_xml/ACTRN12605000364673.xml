  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure for PMS is the Premenstrual Symptom Complex Score, (derived from the Menstrual Health Questionnaire).  This is assessed from the means of 23 daily individual symptom ratings and is calculated as shown below.

Luteal Phase Score Ã¢Â¿Â¿ Follicular Phase Score x 100
Luteal Phase Score

Efficacy is defined as a 20% difference between the premenstrual symptom complex score of those on either of two different dietary supplements compared to those on the placebo.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Calcium and magnesium in the form of a specific mineral supplement will reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome by 20% after 4 months of daily use.  This calcium and magnesium supplement used in conjunction with a combination of micronutrients in the form of a specific multi vitamin, mineral and herbal tablet will reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome by 30 % after 4 months of daily use.The study also seeks to compare differences in bone densitometry parameters in women with and women without PMS.  To achieve this aim 2 cohorts of subjects will be enrolled, Cohort A will be an initial enrolment of 180 women with self-report of PMS.  (This number will allow for 30% exclusion due to insufficient premenstrual symptom score at visit 2).  Cohort B will be an enrolment of 40 women who do not have PMS after assessment with Menstrual Health Questionnaire (This number will allow for 50% exclusion/drop out at visit 2).</summary>
