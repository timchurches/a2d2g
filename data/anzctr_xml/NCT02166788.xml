    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Inguinal Lymphadenectomy
Treatment: surgery - Ilio-inguinal Lymphadenectomy

Other: Arm 1: Inguinal Lymphadenectomy - Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (IL) is removal of the easily accessible superficial groin lymph nodes (LNs) and has a median LN retrieval of 11 lymph nodes

Other: Arm 2: Ilio-inguinal Lymphadenectomy - Ilio-inguinal Lymphadenectomy (I-IL) is the removal of the same superficial groin lymp nodes (LN) removed during an IL but also combined with the more surgically complex removal of the ipsilateral pelvic LN. About twice as many LN are removed with I-IL compared to IL.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND: Spread of metastatic melanoma to the groin lymph nodes (LN) is a common event
      affecting about 350 people a year in Australia. Globally it has been shown that patients with
      involved groin LN, without proven pelvic LN disease on imaging receive 1 of 3 management
      strategies in equal proportions - inguinal lymphadenectomy (IL); ilio-inguinal
      lymphadenectomy (I-IL); or variable use of either depending on circumstances. Different
      experts have strong and polarised opinions favouring either IL or more extensive I-IL with
      existing cases series reporting conflicting data on best cancer outcomes. No high level
      evidence proves which operation is best. HYPOTHESIS: There will be no significant difference
      in DFS between patients having IL or I-IL, conditional on PET/CT scan showing no evidence of
      pelvic disease at the time of diagnosis of groin LN metastatic melanoma. AIMS: To provide a
      rational evidence base for management for melanoma to the groin LNs by randomly assessing the
      effect of each operation on DFS, distant DFS, overall survival (OS), morbidity - including
      early complications and longer-term rates of lymphedema as well as comprehensively assessed
      QOL. Also to clarify the reliability of PET/CT scans for staging pelvic LNs and evaluate any
      health economic benefits of I-IL over IL. TARGET POPULATION: To recruit 634 patients in 5
      years. DESIGN: An Australian led, international, multi-centre, non-inferiority, phase III,
      prospective, randomised clinical trial comparing IL or I-IL for patients with metastatic
      melanoma to groin LNs and no evidence of pelvic disease on PET/CT. ENDPOINTS: DFS, Distant
      DFS, OS and QOL at 5 years. Accuracy of PET/CT for pelvic LN metastases.

      OUTCOMES: International standardization of care, improved cancer outcomes, improved QOL for
      patients with groin metastatic melanoma. Proof of principle about extent of surgery when
      PET/CT is clear in adjacent LN areas, leading to clinical trials investigating management of
      other lymph node fields.</summary>
