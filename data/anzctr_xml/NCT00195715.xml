  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Clinical Remission - Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &lt; 150. The CDAI is a weighted composite score of 8 clinical factors measured over a 1-week period. A lower CDAI score indicates lesser disease severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 156</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Clinical Remission - Clinical remission was defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &lt; 150. The CDAI is a weighted composite score of 8 clinical factors measured over a 1-week period. A lower CDAI score indicates lesser disease severity.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Clinical Response 100 (CR-100) - A CR-100 is a decrease from baseline in CDAI score of 100 or more points. The CDAI is a weighted composite score of 8 clinical factors measured over a 1-week period. A lower CDAI score indicates lesser disease severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 156</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Clinical Response 70 (CR-70) - A CR-70 is a decrease from baseline in CDAI score of 70 or more points.

      <timepoint>Week 156</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Steroid-free Clinical Remission - Steroid-free remission was achieved if the subject stopped taking steroids before the visit and had a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of &lt;150. The CDAI is a weighted composite score of 8 clinical factors measured over a 1-week period. A lower CDAI score indicates lesser disease severity.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving Steroid-free CR-100 - Steroid-free CR-100 was achieved if the subject stopped taking steroids before the visit and had a decrease from baseline in CDAI score of 100 or more points at that visit. The CDAI is a weighted composite score of 8 clinical factors measured over a 1-week period. A lower CDAI score indicates lesser disease severity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 156</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects With Fistula Remission - Fistula remission was defined as the absence of draining fistulas in subjects with fistula present at the preceding study's baseline visit.</outcome>
