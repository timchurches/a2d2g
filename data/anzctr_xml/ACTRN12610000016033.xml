If the patient met inclusion criteria and signed informed consent randomization occurred. Hidden numbered envelops containing the treatment arm were used.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are two major hypothesis to test: 
1) Valacyclovir prophylaxis for cytomegalovirus infection is not inferior than valganciclovir prophylaxis in the prevention of active cytomegalovirus infection and disease. 
2) Valacyclovir is superior to valganciclovir in the prevention of indirect effects of cytomegalovirus: acute renal allograft rejection in short term follow up, and renal function and chronic interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) in long-term follow up.</summary>
