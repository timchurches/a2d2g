    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Eligible subjects who agree to participate will undergo baseline laboratory evaluation, measurements of serum lipoproteins, fast serum glucose, hs-CRP, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2(Lp-PLA2), liver and kidney function tests, creatine kinase, and a baseline CT study, including coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurements and a contrast- enhanced coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) examination. Subjects then will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio either to a combination of rosuvastatin 10 mg plus fenofibrate 80 mg plus metoprolol 50mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg plus fenofibrate 80 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg plus metoprolol 50mg or blank control group. Allocation is randomised by computer. Treatment assignment and patients check result will be blind to the CCTA operator and data analyst, and the whole survey will continue for 6 months.</concealment>
    <sequence>Using  statistical software(SPSS 13.0) to generate a series randomized number and allocate the eligible subjects to the four groups respectively.</sequence>
