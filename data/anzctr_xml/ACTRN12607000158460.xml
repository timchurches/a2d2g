  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised, placebo controlled cross-over trial.  Volunteers will be randomised with 1 group receiving 25grams of sesame seeds (in a bar format) daily for 5 weeks.  The bars will replace the volunteers usual breakfast intake.  After a 4 week washout period, the volunteers will receive the alternative bars for another 5 weeks</interventions>
    <comparator>Volunteers will be randomised with 1 group receiving a placebo bar (containing the same macronutrients but without sesame seeds) for 5 weeks.  The bars will replace the volunteers usual breakfast intake.  </comparator>

    <concealment>Newspaper advertisement of study, followed by telephone screening and screening visit by potential volunteers to determine suitability to be enrolled in the study.  Volunteers who meet the study criteria and are willing to participate will sign a consent form before taking part in the study. Sesame and placebo bars will be handed out in pre-packaged boxes coded 'A' and 'B' and all personnel to be involved in sample and data analysis will be blinded to the coding of the bars.Volunteers will be randomised to receive one of the two possible treatment orders (sesame bars followed by placebo bars, and vice versa).  The randomisation sequence will be generated prior to enrollment of patients and sealed in opaque envelopes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the effects of two food bar formulations.  One of the bars is wheat bran based, and the other sesame seed based.  Both formulations are high in fibre and unsaturated fats, which have been shown in previous studies to reduce heart disease risk factors such as blood cholesterol.  This study is designed to assess if different dietary sources of fibre and unsaturated fats will have similar or different benefit in reducing heart disease risk factors.  The study will be single-blinded with the study co-ordinator blinded to the sequence of treatment the volunteers underwent.  However because of a noticeble taste difference between the two bar formulations, the volunteers will be aware of their treatment.</summary>
