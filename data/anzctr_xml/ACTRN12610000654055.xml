  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will consume, by mouth, 6 x 1 g/day fish oil capsules composed of 270mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 70mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)/capsule for four weeks while following a normal, healthy diet, ie. their normal diet without fast foods/take away foods.  Participants will then consume a very low Kilojoule (kJ) diet (VLCD) of 3,000 kJ/day using meal replacements for four weeks while continuing to consume 6 x 1g/day fish oil capsules, also for four weeks.  The meal replacements will be supplied to participants as part of the study.

Participants receive 1 x 20 minutes per week individual education sessions on dietary modification and behaviour change for the four weeks of weight loss.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Weight gain has been associated with increased inflammation and n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) supplementation have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties.  This study is investigating whether presupplementation with fish oil, then followed by supplementation with fish oil while following a weight loss program, may assist weight loss and reduce inflammatory biomarkers</summary>
