  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be an exercise programme incorporating both aerobic and resisted exercise for three times per week for a total of approximately 60 minutes per session (40 minutes aerobic, 20 minutes resisted) for a 6 week period. This will be in a small group session (2-3 people) supervised by a physiotherapist.

The aerobic component will be conducted on a treadmill, exercise bike or arm ergometer (depending on preference and/or disability (eg injuries to legs), at an intensity of 80 % of VO2peak established during the initial exercise test. 

The resisted exercise, the three repetition maximum (3RM) (maximum weight able to be lifted a maximum of 3 times) will be established and exercise commenced at 60% of the 3RM in the first week.  Resisted exercise will be progressed weekly by 5-10% by increasing the number of repetitions or the weights lifted.  All resisted exercises will be carried out using variable resistance machines or free weights. Exercises included; bench press, leg press, shoulder press, triceps and biceps curl, seated row, resisted shoulder flexion / abduction, toe raises and hand / grip strengthening.  

The intervention group will also receive a stretching program, holding all major joints in a stretched position for 15 seconds twice a day. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will complete only the stretching program, holding all major joints in a stretched position for 15 seconds twice a day. This will take 30 minutes per day.

The patient will be initally taught this by a physiotherapist but will then complete this exercise session at home unsupervised.
