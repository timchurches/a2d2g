  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with type 2 diabetes referred for Exercise Physiology treatment. The exercise physiology treatment will include the provision of an individualised lifestyle intervention program that follows best practice exercise guidelines for the type 2 diabetes population. While the program will be designed to be ongoing the intensity, frequency and modes of exercise prescribed will be individualised according to the individual client needs, goals, and exercise preferences. The follow up period for participants will be 6 months. Enrolment and baseline testing will occur at the initial consultation with the Exercise Physiologist.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Intervention versus control group data will be assessed for changes in health related variables and behaviours over time via mixed methods linear regression (ANOVA). Where assumptions of linear regression are violated, data will be analysed using nonparametric analysis via ordinal logistic regression.
Combined outcome data for the intervention group will be analysed against baseline data using mixed methods regression corrected for repeated measures with potential contributing variables such as age, gender, co-morbidities, medications, self-reported participation, number of client EP consultations, other allied health interventions and types of exercise prescription (home-based versus a commercial gymnasium or community centre) included in the analysis as co-variates. We anticipate that this analysis will provide crucial information regarding real health outcomes being achieved through the application of Exercise Physiology interventions to clients with T2DM. The internal cost-effectiveness of the program (the relationship between rising exercise clinic costs as treatment frequency increases against improving exercise compliance with counselling) will also be estimated.
Sample size was calculated on the basis of numbers needed to achieve statistically significant differences in HbA1c (alpha = 0.05) given a standard deviation of change of 1.0%. Ninety nine patients will be required per group to detect a 0.4 difference, SD 1.0, power 80% with participants divided into groups. As potential difficulties are expected in accessing Type 2 diabetics who have not received a referral for Exercise Physiology services due to increasing awareness of the benefits of exercise for this condition as well as budgetary constraints we have performed a sample size calculation for unequal groups (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizUnequal_Pgm.php). This calculation indicated we require 500 individuals in the intervention group and 55 individuals in the control group. Consequently 500 individuals with type II diabetes who have been referred for an Exercise Physiology intervention will be recruited for the interventions while 55 patients with type II diabetes who have not been referred for Exercise Physiology services will be recruited for the control group by opportunistic sample.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Currently, there is very little collective evidence on the efficacy of AEP-led exercise
interventions in practice for people with chronic disease. This project aims to determine the effectiveness of services provided by Accredited Exercise Physiologists (AEP) for clients with type 2 diabetes on sustained participation on physical activity and clinical markers.
Clients with type 2 diabetes who are referred by their General Practitioner to one of the
participating Exercise Physiology clinics will be recruited for this study. Their outcomes will be compared to those of a control group that do not receive a referral but who are willing to undergo the same battery of assessments on two occasions. </summary>
