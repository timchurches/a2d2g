  <interventions>
    <interventions>50mg and/or 200mg tablets of Quetiapine Fumarate XR, given at a flexible dose of 50mg up to 400mg oral tablets once a day (as determined by the physician) for a total of 12 weeks, followed by a 1 to 2 week tapering down period. 
Flexible dosage of Quetiapine Fumarate XR will be added as an adjunctive therapy to the current pain treatment of patients with Chronic Somatoform Pain Disorder (CSPD). The pain management medications will include non-opioid analgesic/s and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with or without an antidepressant. The dosage amounts and frequency of the patients pain treatment medications will differ on a case by case basis.
To be eligible, patients will require: (i) to have been on stable doses of  non-opioid analgesic/s and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with or without an antidepressant  for at least 6 weeks; and (ii) to have experienced an inadequate response.</interventions>

      <outcome>Pain intensity with 33% decrease of numerical rating scale for pain (NRS-P) score.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide shown to be a possible biological marker of chronic pain, and has been found to be significantly decreased in the saliva of chronic pain patients as compared with that of healthy human volunteers. Samples of saliva will be collected using a saliva collection device and transferred frozen on dry ice to Southern Cross Pathology Australia, where the samples will be stored at &lt; 80oC until ready to be analysed using a Substance P Immunoassay. Saliva levels of SP will be measured and analysed to determine if a significant change has occurred during the course of the study. A significant increase in saliva levels SP from randomisation to Visit 9 indicates a reduction in pain perception.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks after intervention commencement.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main rationale for this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of Quetiapine XR in conjunction with non-opioid analgesic/s and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with or without an antidepressant in treating patients with Chronic Somatoform Pain Disorder (CSPD), who have not responded adequately to their existing pain management therapy alone.</summary>
