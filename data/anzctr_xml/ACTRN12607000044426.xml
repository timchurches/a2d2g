  <interventions>
    <interventions>A DVD will be shown to participants during the home visit. There is only one planned home visit in the 12-week period. The DVD will contain health information for consumers regarding medicines in relation to their chronic conditions to enhance decision-making and behavioural change. Patients will be taught how to take their blood pressure using an electronic self-monitoring blood pressure machine during the home visit. A medication review will be conducted at this time, which will involve checking the medication regimen with the patient to reach agreement about their treatment and development of a tailored drug chart for the patient. Fortnightly follow-up telephone calls will be made thereafter to the patients for 12 weeks. The intervention will be 12 weeks in total.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment is the usual care provided to patients by the outpatients clinic. Standard care will be assessed prior to the randomised controlled trial (RCT) by survey of consulting physicians of the clinics.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Australians are experiencing an increased prevalence of chronic diseases which require sustained self-management of medicines and long term monitoring by health professionals. The proposed study will determine the psychosocial influences affecting self-management of medicines by consumers with co-existing chronic diseases, specifically diabetes, kidney disease and hypertension. The aims of the study are to develop and test the effectiveness of a medicine self-management training package (MESMI). Null hypothesis: Compared to patients receiving standard care, patients who receive the intervention will show no change in blood pressure</summary>
