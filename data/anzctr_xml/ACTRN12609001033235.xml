  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of consumers asking targeted questions to prompt evidence-based, shared decision making on the frequency and nature of evidence-based, shared decision making behaviours. 


Asking these three questions improved information given by family physicians and increased physician facilitation of patient involvement. Practice implications. These questions can drive evidence-based practice, strengthen patientphysician communication, and improve safety and quality.
