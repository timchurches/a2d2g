    <interventions>MyBrainSolutions (www.mybrainsolutions.com) cognitive training intervention. 

Twin pairs are randomly assigned to either a training group or a waitlist control group.

Participants in the training group are requested to register online, complete a web assessment, after which they receive their personal brain scores. They are then instructed to play the recommended cognitive games (suited to their profile) for 30 minutes, 2-3 times a week, over a period of 30 days. These participants are then asked to complete the web assessment again, following the 30 days of training. 

At the 30-day period, matched waitlist control participants are provided access to the web platform to complete their web assessment, and then are provided access to the training program.

To encourage adherence, participants are contacted by phone and/or email on a fortnightly basis. The online program also sends out automated reminders prior to the 30-day assessment period, encouraging adherence. Log-in time and date, game type and playing duration data are automatically collected by the cognitive training program.

    <comparator>The control group is a waitlist control group. These participants are not required to do anything during the 30-day trial, but following the 30 days, they are provided access to the training portal to use like the treatment group were provided.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The project involves 1652 participants, or 826 twin pairs. The sample size is large enough to be robust, even with a possible 20% attrition rate (n=1322). For the MANOVAs there will be 83% power to detect the smallest effects at p&lt;.01.
A minimum of 321 twin pairs is required to detect small to moderate genetic effects (&gt;0.20). There is 82% power to detect the smallest effects (1.5-5%) of specific genes or environment at p&lt;.01, with up to 15 predictors in the multiple regression model.

Repeated-measures MANOVAs will be used to compare training and control groups over the two time periods (pre- and post-intervention), with training frequency and type incorporated as moderating factors.
Genetic and environmental variation will be estimated using multivariate structural equation modeling.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project evaluates the effectiveness of a web-based cognitive training tool, MyBrainSolutions, in improving emotional and cognitive function over 30 days. 
The impact of the cognitive training on both trained and untrained real-world functions will be determined, as well as the minimum time commitment required to see improvement. By comparing identical to non-identical twins, a comparison of the relative impact of genetics versus environment in improving scores can be evaluated.
