  <interventions>
    <interventions>High Resolution Anoscopy (HRA) is being used to determine if the study will provide important information to guide the possible future introduction of anal cancer screening program for gay men.  The HRA examination  takes about 20 minutes for perform.  It is not generally painful, due to local anaesthesia given prior to the procedure.  Mild, transient anal bleeding may occur, for 72 hours after the procedure.  The HRA procedure is conducted at Baseline and all 4 follow up visits which occur 6 months after Baseline and then annually to 36 months.  There is a very small risk of a significant post-procedure haemorrhage.  During the seven days after the procedure, it is possible that this may increase the risk of HIV infection should the participant have unprotected receptive anal intercourse.  The procedure itself, and awaiting the pathology result, may cause anxiety in some participants.  After having this procedure the participants are advised not to have receptive anal intercourse for at least 7 days.  As a result of this procedure some participants may be referred for treatment of anal abnormalities. </interventions>

      <outcome>Psychosocial and quality of life impact of anal cytology screening in homosexual men.

Participants will be asked a series of questions via computer-assisted self-interviewing about their history and recent experiences of anal intercourse in the last six months, including protected and unprotected; other anal sexual practices.  Questions considered also include oral sexual practices and demographics, and possible anal cancer risk factors such as cigarette smoking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The results of the participants visit are received and reviewed within 2 weeks of collection.

Two weeks after participants receive their anal screening test results, participants are asked by the research assistant to complete a two week post anal screening psychological assessment questionnaire online or by post (if preferred).  This includes the SF36 version 2 questionnaire, distress thermometer, cancer worry and intrusive thoughts questions.  A reminder will be sent two weeks later to non-responders and telephone follow-up if no response is received after four weeks.
Participants who score 6 or 7 or the distress thermometer will be prompted to call the study nurse for support.  Participants who score 8 or above will be notified that a study nurse will contact them.  The study nurse will further assess the psychological health and wellbeing of these participants.  Referral to special psychological services will be offered if indicated.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming the incidence of HSIL is 5 and 15 per 100 person-years in HIV negative and HIVB positive men, respectively, the 95% confidence intervals will be 4.2 - 6.0 in the HIV negative arm and 12.6 - 17.8 per 100 person-years in the HIV positive arm.  Analysis plan: HPV prevalence and incidence, including overall, low risk, high risk and individual types, will be calculated according to participants HIV status.  Prevalence and incidence of LSIL and HSIL will be calculated in the same fashion.  Clearance and persistence of HPV infection, and progression and regression of HSIL will also be determined.  Risk factors for prevalent HPV infection and LSIL and HSIL will be analysed using logistical regression.  Risk factors for incident conditions will be analysed using Cox regression.

Please note that the SPANC study is a prospective cohort study of the national history of anal human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and anal cellular abnormalities in homosexual men aged 35 years and above in Sydney. It is expected that the study results will be influential in the possible development of an anal cancer screening program in high-risk populations. Data on the natural history of anal HPV infection in homosexual men recruited from community-based settings are rare. We aim to recruit a total of 600 men, 360 HIV-negative and 240 HIV-positive. This will make the SPANC study one of the biggest ongoing anal HPV natural history study in the world to provide critical data on the incidence and clearance of anal HPV infection, progression and regression of pre-cancerous HPV associated anal lesions, the potential psychological impact on men who participate anal cancer screening programs, and the cost-effectiveness of rolling out these programs. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of anal (HPV) infection and related anal disease in gay men.  Both HIV positive and HIV negative men are eligible. You should not have been previously diagnosed with anal cancer. 

All participants in this study will undergo high resolution anoscopy during the study over 36 months.  The first HRA will be conducted at Baseline and at all 4 follow up visits.  The high resolution anoscopy involves, examination of the peri-anal region and perineum, and the a plastic anoscope is inserted into the anal canal.  Following staining of the anal canal with acetic acid and lugol's solution, the anal canal is visualised under high resolution magnification.  Biopsy samples will be taken by the clinician for histological assessment if there are any detected abnormalities. The data collected from these examinations will be used to determine the prevalence, incidence and risk factors for specific types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. There are more than 100 type of HPV. Some cause genital warts and other types cause more than 90% of anal cancer. Gay men are over 20 times more likely than others to develop anal cancer. The information collected in this study may guide the possible future introduction of anal cancer screening programs for gay men.
