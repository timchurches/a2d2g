  <interventions>
    <interventions>The current study will be conducted at Orthopedics Clinic in Malaysian public hospitals, namely Hospital Putrajaya and Hospital Serdang, which are located in the greater Klang Valley area of Selangor, Malaysia. This study consists of a two arm randomised clinical trial involving diagnosed knee OA patients who are eligible to the study. Both the experimental and control group will receive standard routine care throughout the study. Respondents have to attend clinic and physiotherapy session as usual on their fixed appointment date. However, respondents in the control group will be given The Knee Book and not receive further intervention. Respondents in the experimental group will be given The Knee Book and received a three sessions of group CBT (each session will be last for two and a half hours) every two weeks. The sessions will be held in a group of eight to ten respondents under the supervision of an experienced senior clinical psychologist and a physiotherapist. The intervention will be delivered by physiotherapists, nurses and graduate researcher who will undergo at least one day of training, specifically tailored for the trial which will be conducted by an experienced senior clinical psychologist with CBT experience. Each session will be audio- recorded with a written consent from the respondents. Fidelity of the CBT session will be assessed with a random sample of recordings by the experienced psychologist with the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTS-R).
The Knee Book was adapted with permission from the Ministry of Health, Singapore (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2007). This booklet was based on the Ministry of Health Clinical Practice Guidelines for OA of the Knee and has been written for patients with the aforementioned condition, their family members and caregivers. </interventions>

    <concealment>Randomisation using the block randomisation method will be implemented by an individual who is not involved in the recruitment process. The randomised names will be divided into 15 smaller subgroups in each experimental and control group. The subgroup lists will be given to the hospital staffs. All the names in the subgroups will be contacted personally before every assignment by different hospital staffs, who will not have visibility on the group allocation. Therefore, the allocation will be concealed in advance from the patients, researchers involved in recruitment, hospital staffs and therapists.</concealment>
    <sequence>Those patients who are eligible and willing to participate in this study will be randomly assigned to either of the experimental or control group based on block randomisation method by using random allocation software (http://random-allocation-software.software.informer.com/2.0/) after the written consent is obtained.</sequence>
