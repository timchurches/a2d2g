  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation of changes in cardiorespiratory parameters over the course of valve replacement surgery in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Patients were were given oral tablet of sildenafil 25mg three times per day in the 48 hour preoperative period in order to reduce pulmonary pressures prior to surgery.  The initial observational period will be one year.</interventions>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in pulmonary pressures after administration of sildenafil. This will be assessed using pre-operative transthoracic echo, intraoperative trans oesophageal echo, and post operative pulmonary artery catheter measurements. Comparison will be made to pre-intervention TTE and right heart study findings.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Right Ventricular failure. This will be assessed by review of patients clinical peri and post op course and findings from transoesophageal echo, pulmonary artery catheters etc</outcome>

      <outcome>Post operative ventilation duration. This is determined by the time between arrival in ICU and extubation of patient.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sildenafil is a drug that can be used to treat raised blood pressure within the lungs. In patients undergoing valvular heart surgery who also have high pressure, it is thought that it may reduce the risk of the right side of the heart from stopping working properly. In addition there is also evidence that it may reduce time on a ventilator in ICU. There have been several studies in heart transplants and congenital heart disease that have shown some advantage. We want to ascertain whether the theoretical advantages of the drug are actually borne out in clinical practice</summary>
