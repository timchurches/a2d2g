  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as 3-AP and gemcitabine, work in different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving 3-AP together with gemcitabine as
      second-line therapy works in treating patients with recurrent stage III or stage IV non-small
      cell lung cancer.</summary>
