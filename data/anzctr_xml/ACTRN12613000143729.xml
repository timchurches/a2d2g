    <interventions>corneal collagen cross-linking. Cross-linking is a single  treatment involving the use of riboflavin and UVA light to increase the strength of the cornea. The cornea is treated with riboflavin drops for 30 minutes followed by exposure to UVA irradiation for a 30 minutes, during which the riboflavin drops are continued.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The technique of collagen cross-linking for keratoconus (a condition leading to thinning and protrusion of the cornea, the front clear window of the eye, leading to a reduction in vision) was introduced in Europe. It involves the use of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and ultraviolet light A, and has been shown in animal studies to strengthen the cornea. This trial was  initiated to assess the effectiveness and safety of this treatment in comparison to a second group of participants who have the disease but are not given the cross-linking treatment. It runs over 5 years.</summary>
