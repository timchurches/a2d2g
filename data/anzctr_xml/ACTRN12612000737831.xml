  <interventions>
    <interventions>Not applicable - Observational study: in this study no experimental intervention or treatment is applied.It involves observations done in the retrospective manner.Data obtained from hospital database from yr Dec-2011-June-2012 Acute pain service data also used.Since the surgery has already been done there is no intervention in that course. But the satisfaction outcomes are measured by doing a likert score to observe what extent these methods benefited in each group.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are only two groups
Active group: Wound infiltration group ( Bupivacaine)
The comparator group: The  transversus abdominis plane (TAP) (Mode of administration of bupivacaine in TAP plane.)</comparator>

pain scores assesed on numerical rating scale of 0-10</outcome>
      <timepoint>pain scores and Discharge Time in recovery and ward

Pain scores assesed on numerical rating scale of 0-10
Time in minutes</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2.Amount of analgesics used in the immediate postoperative period in Recovery room and Ward. Out come will be assessed by using the Acute pain service data for pain scores and also from the inpatient medical records.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality  of pain relief assesed on Likert scale for satisfaction : 4 point rating used: 1. completely relieved; 2. relieved; 3. somewhat relieved; and 4. not relieved.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The key hole gall bladder surgery is one of the commonest surgery performed. there are  various methods used for pain relief after the surgery.Traditionally local anaesthetics is injected into the wounds.Recently by ultrsound guidance local anaesthetics were injected into the abdonminal planes (transverses abdominis plane).The nerves supply the the entire abdominal wall. Recent trials did show they benefit in abdominal surgery. So far only one trial compared these two methods.The purpose of this trial is to find out which one of them did better in regards to pain releief. Also patient satisfaction score may reveal which of these methods were acceptable</summary>
