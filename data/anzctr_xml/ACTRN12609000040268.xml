  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will measure serial BNP-SP concentrations in patients admitted to hospital within 4 hours of symptom onset and with clear documented myocardial infarction to determine if temporal plasma concentrations of BNP-Signal Peptide (BNP-SP)  achieve peak values within 1-3 hours of onset of infarction. Blood samples will be collected at 0, 0.5, 1. 2. 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post admission. 
The study will continue until recruitment and blood sampling is complete for 50 people with acute myocardial infarction, 10 with chronic renal failure on maintenance haemodialysis, 5 patients with hypothyroidism, 5 patients with thyrotoxicosis and 10 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute heart failure not secondary to Acute Myocardial Infarction.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this proposal will be the identification of B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP) as a novel, specific biomarker of acute cardiac injury. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SP as well as the standard serial biomarker concentrations of troponin, creatine kinase and myoglobin.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be takn on admission, then at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours, pre-discharge and 1 month post discharge</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome will be the potential identification of a new class of circulating biomarkers that may have diagnostic potential in pathophysiology. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SP as well as the standard serial biomarker concentrations of troponin, creatine kinase and myoglobin.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be takn on admission, then at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours, pre-discharge and 1 month post discharge</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Early clinical detection of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) can be difficult. In particular, distinction between cardiac and non-cardiac events may entail 12-36 hours of delay whilst serial biomarker results are awaited and/or subsequent tests (such as exercise electrocardiography) are performed. We have achieved the first ever identification of a signal peptide in the circulation (B-type Natriuretic Peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP)) and show that it has potential to specifically and rapidly identify cardiac ischemia.
We will measure serial BNP-SP concentrations in patients with clear documented myocardial infarction. This research has the potential to speed up diagnosis and ultimately improve outcomes for patients with acute coronary events.
50 patients presenting to the coronary care unit of Christchurch Hospital with typical chest pains (=4 hours from onset), clear evidence of ST-elevation on ECG together with a rise and fall of plasma troponin levels will be studied. Venous blood samples will be drawn at baseline (0), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours.
For each blood sample, we will also measure standard plasma biomarkers of myocardial injury.</summary>
