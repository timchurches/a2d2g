  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants receive one of three dietary challenges consecutively for 3 days, followed by a minimum 3-day washout before crossing over to the next diet. Challenge food is supplemented with gluten (16g/day whole wheat gluten), whey (16g/day whey protein isolate) or not supplemented (control). All meals and snacks are supplied throughout the duration of the study and controlled for other potential inducers of symptoms (FODMAPs, dairy, food chemicals). 

Dietary adherence will be assessed by entries into a tick-box diary and unused food is counted at the end of each dietary challenge. Participants are asked to document any additional foods consumed. </interventions>

    <inclusivecriteria>Aged &gt;16 years of age, met Rome III criteria for IBS prior to implementation of a GFD, had currently well controlled gastrointestinal symptoms, and had been adherent to a GFD for at least the preceding six weeks.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of gluten on gastrointestinal symptoms and mental health in those with NCGS. It is hypothesised that a major effect of gluten in those with NCGS is on mental health and not necessarily on GI symptoms.</summary>
