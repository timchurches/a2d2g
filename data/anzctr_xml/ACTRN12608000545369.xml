  <interventions>
    <interventions>The media literacy program was an 8-lesson (50 minutes each) school-based program delivered by the primary researcher (SW, with the regular class teacher also present).  Media literacy aims to target media internalisation (strong investment in societal ideals of size and appearance to the point that they become rigid, guiding principles), which has been prospectively identified as an eating disorder risk factor.

The program was informed by previous trials as well as a pilot evaluation.  It was designed to be interactive (e.g., small group work, class discussions) as this approach has been found to have a self-esteem enhancing effect and to thus be more valuable than didactic delivery.  The program was constructed around the key concepts of literacy, activism and advocacy.  It was delivered at the rate of 2 lessons per week and thus took 4 weeks to complete.</interventions>

      <outcome>In addition to the primary outcome, a further seven eating disorder risk factors were measured in questionnaire format:
dieting (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire - Restraint, Van Strien, Frijters, Bergers, &amp; Defares, 1986);
body dissatisfaction (Eating Disorder Inventory, Garner, 1991);
media internalisation (Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3, Thompson, van den Berg, Roehrig, Guarda, &amp; Heinberg, 2004);
perceived sociocultural pressure to be thin (Perceived Sociocultural Pressure Scale, Stice, Ziemba, Margolis, &amp; Flick, 1996);
feelings of ineffectiveness (Eating Disorder Inventory, Garner, 1991);
depression (Kovacs, 1992); and, 
self-esteem (Rosenberg, 1965).</outcome>

    <concealment>Schools were selected at random and invited to participate in the study.  Approximately half of the Grade 8 classes from each school were randomly allocated to the media literacy condition, while the other half were randomly allocated to the control condition.  Allocation was not concealed, however the researchers chose intact classes without prior knowledge of students or staff members from individual classes.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The key objective of the current study was to address the shortcomings of previous universal eating disorder prevention programs by evaluating in a methodologically rigorous manner if a theoretically-informed prevention program (media literacy) can be effective in reducing eating disorder risk in a controlled trial with a universal, young-adolescent, mixed gender audience.</summary>
