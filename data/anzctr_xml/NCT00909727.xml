  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Through Week 24 - Spirometry (as measured by FEV1) is a standardized assessment to evaluate lung function that is the most widely used endpoint in cystic fibrosis studies.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Percent Predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Through Week 48 - Spirometry (as measured by FEV1) is a standardized assessment to evaluate lung function that is the most widely used endpoint in cystic fibrosis studies.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Through Week 24 and Week 48 (Respiratory Domain Score, Children) - The CFQ-R is a health-related quality of life measure for subjects with cystic fibrosis. Each domain is scored from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A difference of at least 4 points in the respiratory domain score of the CFQ-R is considered a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Sweat Chloride Concentration Through Week 24 and Week 48 - The sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) test is a standard diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis (CF), serving as an indicator of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) activity.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Absolute Change From Baseline in Weight at Week 24 and Week 48 - As malnutrition is common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) because of increased energy expenditures due to lung disease and fat malabsorption, body weight is an important clinical measure of nutritional status.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor in subjects
      with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 years who have the G551D mutation in the cystic fibrosis
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Ivacaftor is a potent and selective
      potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR protein. Potentiators
      are pharmacological agents that increase the chloride ion transport properties of the channel
      in the presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA)
      activation.</summary>
