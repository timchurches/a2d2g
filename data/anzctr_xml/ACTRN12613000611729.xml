  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involves three phases:
	
i.	Observational Phase
Enrolled patients will be studied for five months of current usual practice using the units current sedation and mobilisation practices.

ii.	Mobilisation Target Phase
Enrolled patients will be studied for five months following the introduction of the physiotherapy mobilisation flowchart, targets and contraindications and the nursing mobilisation guidelines, targets and contraindications. Mobilisation procuderes outlined in the targeted mobilisation protocol does not differ from current practice by senior physiotherapy staff in the ICU. The aim is to provide consistency with the mobilisation procedures regardless of the presence of senior staff. The Physiotherapist Mobilisation Flow Chart commences with assessing whether the patient is awake and alert. If the patient is not awake and there are no contraindications to mobilisation the patient follows nursing mobilisation guidelines and is for passive mobilisation (PM) i.e. a sling transfer to sit-ou-of-bed (SOOB). If there is a contraindication to mobilisation the patient remains rest-in-bed. If the patient is awake and alert and there is no contrainidications to mobilisation a strength and functional assessment will be completed by physiotherapists. Based on this assessment patients will be allocated to either Phase 1 Rehabilitation (P1R) which will include sitting balance, strengthening exercises, tilt table etc or Phase 2 Rehabilitation Supported Weight Bearing (P2RSWB) which involves mobilisationu using gait harness or Phase 2 Rehabilitation Active Weight Bearing (P2RAW) which involves no gait harness. Phase 2 Rehabiliation will include sit-to-stand practice, marching on the spot and mobilisation away from the bedspace +/- gait aid.  Mobilisation targets will be set daily for each patient after review by a physiotherapist. The target in the nursing mobilisation guidelines is for daily Passive Mobilisation (PM) i.e. sling transfer to SOOB for a minimum of 4 hours. P1R and P2R targets are as for a minimum daily episode of rehabilitation with a physiotherapist and SOOB for a minimum of 4 hours.

Nursing staff and Physiotherapist education and training will be conducted over one month between Phases i and ii. Education will be delivered to physiotherapy staff in a 1 hour in-service. Teaching and training will be conducted as per current physiotherapy department competency based assesment processes. Nursing education will be conducted in education sessions in the ICU Interprofessional Program. Training in mobilisation will be conducted as per current unit practices.    

iii.	Nurse Led Sedation Phase
Enrolled patients will be studied for five months following the introduction of a nurse led sedation protocol for impact on mobilisation targets. 

This protocol uses structured targets and recommended medications for the management of analgesia, sedation and delirium using the numerical pain scale, the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU). Current practice in the ICU adresses sedation and analgesia on an individual paitent basis. 

Nursing staff education and training will be conducted over one month between Phases ii and iii. Nursing education and traing will be conducted in multiple education sessions in the ICU Interprofessional Education Program and individual education at the bedside.

Data will be collect on reaching mobilisation, analgesia, sedation and delirium targets. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics will be presented using means, standard deviations, medians and inter-quartile ranges, counts and percentages as appropriate. Comparisons of frequencies or rates will be performed using Poisson regression models. Hospital length of stay between the three periods will be compared using a log rank test. The relationship between functional status at hospital discharge, the two interventions and other variables will be determined using a multiple logistic regression analysis model using functional status as the response variable. Patients who die will be censored at the time of death. All analyses will use two-sided p-values. Data will be analysed a priori for the impact of a neurological diagnosis, chronic substance abuse and pre-existing co-morbidities likely to limit mobility.

Sample size justification:
Based on recent local pilot data, which assessed the ACIF at hospital discharge in a similar sample of ventilated critically ill patients, 45 subjects in each group will provide a power in excess of 90% to detect a 20% difference between groups with alpha of 0.05. This assumes a within groups standard deviation of 0.29, and provides a difference that would be clinically meaningful. A minimum sample size of 60 subjects in each group allows for patient drop out. Review of unit data for patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours reveals a mortality rate of approximately 20%. Currently the ICU admits over 250 patients per year who are mechanically ventilated for two days or more. Even if only 50% of patients are enrolled, the study will meet the above power requirements.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sedative medications are commonly used for ICU patients who require a breathing machine (ventilator). Side effects of the ventilator and sedatives include decreased muscle strength resulting in increased time in ICU and hospital, and decreased functioning on discharge.
Recent studies suggest early mobilisation of patients while they are on a ventilator leads to better functioning. However, too much sedative medication makes this difficult.
This study investigates the effect of protocols for mobilisation and sedatives on function at hospital discharge in intensive care patients expected to need a breathing machine for more than 2 days. Our hypothesis is that the addition of a nurse led targeted sedation protocol to a targeted mobilisation protocol in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients will lead to improvement in functional status at ICU and hospital discharge. 
The results will help physiotherapists and intensive care doctors improve the way that they use sedation and mobilisation and will be highly relevant internationally.
