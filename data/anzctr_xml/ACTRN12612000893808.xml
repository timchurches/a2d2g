  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two treatment options will be compared (the trial will be designed as a within-subject cross-over trial, hence each subject will experience both interventions):
a) use of a conventional removable partial denture.  This will involve standard clinical practice in designing and constructing a removable partial denture.  In general, it will involve approximately 4 clinical appointments, each lasting between 30-60 minutes each.  The appointments will generally be about 1 week apart, depending on how quickly the dental laboratory can prepare and return the required denture work.  The denture will be tooth retained.  After a 6 month adaptation period, a range of simple clinical tests and questionnaires will be used to assess the denture performance (approximately 2 hour appointment).
b) use of a removable partial denture retained and supported by dental implants.  This will involve the surgical placement of two short and narrow implants per patient, conducted under local anaesthetic.  The surgical appointment will take approximately 2 hours.  Following healing (minimum of 6 weeks), the removable partial denture will be modified to incorporate the resilient retainer system (approximately 2 hour appointment), hence the denture will be both tooth and implant retained (after a 6 month adaptation period, a range of simple clinical tests and questionnaires will be used to assess the denture performance (approximately 2 hour appointment).
.

There will be a minimal-to-no wash-out period between the two treatment options.  The dentures will be modified such that the patient will experience the alternate treatment option.

The aim will be for one operator to conduct all treatments, hence minimising the potential for operator inconsistencies.</interventions>

    <concealment>All subjects will experience both interventions.  However, which of the two interventions the subjects experiences first will be randomly determined.  The person assessing the patients for eligibility to be included in the trial will not know which of the two treatment options the patient will experience first.  This decision will be made on a random basis.  

An independant 'holder' willhold a list outlining which treatment option each subject will experience first (see method below).</concealment>
    <sequence>Use of a randimisation table from a suitable statistics book.  Apart from this, no further concealment will be employed.

A list containing the numbers from 1 to 30 will be constructed.  Next to each of these numbers, a 1 or 2 will be assigned (this will be determined randomly - using a statistics book).  1 will represent treatment option 1, and 2 will represent treatment option 2.  This list will be given to an independant 'holder' who will keep this list under his/her control.  As a participant is recruited into the trial, he/she will be sequentially given an identification number (a number from 1 - 30).  The researcher will then contact the holder to establish which treatment option the newly recruited participant will receive first.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The puropse of this study is to compare two treatment options for the replacement of missing lower back teeth; one option is the standard treatment using a removal partial denture, and the other option is use of a removable partial denture held in place by dental implants (a dental implant is an artificial tooth root, surgically placed into the jaw bone, to hold a tooth or denture in place).  The hypothesis is that the implant-supported option provides  significant benefits over the conventional removable partial denture in terms of function (ability to chew and break-down food), comfort, and overall patient satisfaction.</summary>
