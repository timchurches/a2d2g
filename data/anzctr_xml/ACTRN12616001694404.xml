  <interventions>
    <interventions>750 ml of milk to be consumed on three different occasions separated by 1 week of wash out period between the milk ingestion. Subjects will be fasted overnight prior to each intervention arm. The milk will be consumed in full in the presence of the researchers to confirm compliance, to be ingested within 10 minutes. No additionally food or drink will be consumed during the 3 hour intervention. The milks to be consumed are 
(1) Conventional milk (A1+A2 beta-casein)
 (2) a2 milk (only A2 beta-casein) and
 (3) Lactose free milk (A1+A2 beta-casein).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dairy intolerance is often attributed to lactose intolerance but there may be individuals who exhibit an intolerance due to the A1 version of bovine beta-casein protein found in the dairy supply. The peptide sequence variation in the A2 version of beta-casein  may alter the digestion but it is still unclear how these variants of the bovine beta-casein in milk are digested and metabolised in humans. This study aims to evaluate digestive, metabolic and immunological responses to milks with or without lactose and A1 betacasein  in self-reported dairy intolerant individuals.
