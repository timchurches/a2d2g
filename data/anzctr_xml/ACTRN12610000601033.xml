  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard total knee replacement (TKR) rehabilitation with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) would be delivered separately by experienced Physiotherapists. Standard TKR rehabilitation would be delivered daily from the first day post surgery till the day of discharge. One day post surgery, NMES would be delivered daily for 4 consecutive days. Standard TKR rehabilitation comprises ambulatory, knee mobility, and knee strengthening exercises. For NMES, a portable unit will be used to deliver the electrical stimulation, and 2 pairs of self-adhesive surface electrodes will be placed over the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles of the affected (operated) limb. The NMES unit will be set to deliver a 40-Hz biphasic current (450 microseconds pulse duration) for 5 seconds followed by a 20-second resting period (i.e., 20% duty cycle). During each 15-minute NMES session, a total of 30 repetitions will be performed, and the stimulation intensity will be adjusted to the maximal intensity tolerated by the patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients who are randomized to the standard TKR rehabilitation without NMES group will receive standard TKR rehabilitation plus an active control treatment which comprises one set of 30 "static" (isometric) quadriceps exercises. Standard rehabilitation and the active control treatment would be delivered separately by experienced Physiotherapists. Standard TKR rehabilitation would be delivered daily from the first day post surgery till the day of discharge. One day post surgery, patients will perform active control exercises of the affected (operated) limb daily for 15minutes for 4 consecutive days.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be identified and recruited from the outpatient orthopaedic clinic of a large tertiary institution in Singapore. Once the participant has provided written informed consent, preoperative testing would be performed and 1 day post surgery, participants will be randomised into one of two groups: (i) standard TKR rehabilitation and NMES and (ii) standard TKR rehabilitation and one set of quadriceps exercises. The randomisation schedule will be prepared by a research physiotherapist who is not involved in the study. He will be the only person with access to the schedule, which will be kept in a locked location. To conceal randomisation, consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes will be used and maintained centrally.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic, costly joint disease and a major contributor to functional limitations in older adults. For patients with end-staged symptomatic knee OA, a total knee replacement (TKR) is commonly indicated and although a TKR does improve selfreport (perceived) physical function and pain, patients who have undergone a TKR continue to show substantial, long-term quadriceps weakness which, in turn, is associated with activity limitations and participation restrictions. Accordingly, conservative, early interventions that effectively improve knee strength in patients with TKR are vital, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is one potential intervention given its ability to improve muscle activation more effectively than do voluntary exercises. Yet, little research has rigorously evaluated its benefits on muscle performance and physical function in patients with TKR. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to compare the symptomatic and biomechanical effects of NMES versus static quadriceps exercises in patients who are receiving standard acute TKR rehabilitation. Secondary aims are to assess changes in relevant musculoskeletal impairments with NMES and its cost-effectiveness.</summary>
