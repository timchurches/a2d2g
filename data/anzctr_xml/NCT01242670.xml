Experimental: Ross River Virus Vaccine - Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers (1:1:1) to receive one of three different lots of the vaccine on Day 1, Day 22 and Day 181. (The study is blinded with regard to which vaccine lot is administered to a subject but all subjects will receive 3 injections with a 2.5 µg aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted dose of RRV vaccine.)


Other interventions: Ross River Virus Vaccine
Ross River Virus Vaccine (Formalin Treated, UV Inactivated, Vero Cell-Derived) with Aluminum Hydroxide Adjuvant
