  <interventions>
    <interventions>Older adult inpatients with wounds at the Repatriation General Hospital (SA) will have their nutritional status assessed using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA), a validated and reliable nutrition assessment tool.  In addition to this, participants will have their body composition measured using a Bioelectrical Impedance Assay (BIA), and their weight and height will be measured using standard protocols.  The investigators will interview the participants to obtain information on their nutritional intake to enable comparisons to be made to recommendations for nutrition and wound healing.  These measures will be repeated every 5-6 days during their hospital stay, to a maximum of 3 measurement intervals.
Patients with wounds at RGH have their wounds assessed by a registered nurse using standardised hospital-wide protocols. Data will be collected from the nursing documentation to allow the investigators to determine wound healing. 
The BIA, MNA and the standardised interview (using the multiple replicate 24hr recall) are not currently practices of usual care.  Currently, patients are assessed on an individual basis by a dietitian using a diet history or record of intake, compared with estimated nutritional requirements.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this study is to identify nutritional issues that may impact nutritional status and on the healing on lower limb wounds or pressure ulcers in an inpatient population of Older Adults. A range of assessment methods will be utilised at designated time points during the participants' hospital admission.  It is currently hypothesized that this group of patients are at an increased risk of under nutrition which may impact on the healing of their wounds.  The results of this study will allow the investigators to identify the extent of nutritional issues within this group of patients, and some of the factors that may be contributing to undernutrition and poorer wound healing.</summary>
