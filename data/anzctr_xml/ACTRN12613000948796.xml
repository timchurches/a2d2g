  <interventions>
    <interventions>Baby Triple P: This is a preventative intervention for first time parents. It involves four weekly 2-hour group sessions during the antenatal period which cover parenting topics, the couple relationship and individual adjustment of the parents. There are also four weekly 20-minute telephone consultations in the postnatal period starting when the baby is 6 weeks old which reinforce the strategies learned during the group sessions. Telephone consultations will be conducted primarily with the mother, however it would be encouraged if the father is present as well. The intervention group will further receive a workbook at the start of the program (at the first session during pregnancy) which will be used throughout the program and can be used at home. Parenting topics to be covered are: teaching couples parenting strategies (Sessions 1 &amp; 2), individual coping skills (Session 3) and partner support skills (Session 4). The parenting strategies are designed to promote a warm and responsive relationship between parents and their babies as well as promoting a positive learning environment for the infant. The 4 telephone consultations will not cover any new material, rather it provides the opportunity to problem solve and it employs a self-regulatory model. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by marking attendance of both parents at the sessions. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group consists of a care-as usual group. This group will receive care as they normally would in the community (e.g. by their GP, obstetrician or other health services). At completion of the study, this group will receive a short seminar of the Baby Triple P content and the workbook to work through the topics on their own.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A power analysis was conducted via Optimal Design software to determine the required sample size for the planned multilevel modeling of longitudinal data. To detect a medium effects size of .50, with alpha set at .05, and power at .80, a minimum sample size of 80 participants per group is needed (i.e., N = 160 for the two-group study). Allowing for potential attraction of 25% the proposed sample size will provide sufficient power to conduct the proposed analyses.

To test change over time due to the intervention we will apply Multilevel Modelling and more precisely we will test Multilevel Latent Growth Curve Models (MLMLGCM) in MPlus version 7.12. The MLM modeling will enable us to test the effects of the intervention across three time points and between two conditions (intervention vs. care as usual). The primary advantage of using Multilevel Modelling approach to longitudinal repeated-measures data is allows for appropriate treatment of missing data points by applying Full Information Maximum Likelihood approach. This maximizes power to detect effects and reduces bias owing to missing data in longitudinal studies</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The transition to parenthood is a very exciting time for new parents, but it also is a time of great demands and challenges. After the baby is born, parents are faced with sleep deprivation, mastering infant caregiving tasks, changes in their relationships and lifestyle. At the same time, these early months are crucial for the infant's development and wellbeing.
The proposed project aims to evaluate Baby Triple P, a preventative intervention designed to support parents during the transition to firstÂ­time parenthood. It aims to give babies a healthy start in life by enhancing their parents knowledge, skills and confidence in early parenting practices. In addition, it intends to protect the mental and emotional wellbeing of parents.
The transition to parenthood can be particularly challenging for families where a range of risk factors are present, and it is couples who are at risk for experiencing difficulties at the transition that may benefit most from a preventative intervention. Specifically, this project focuses on couples who experience at least two of the following risk factors: unplanned pregnancy, low education, experience financial strain, low relationship satisfaction, low social support, history of and/or current depression or anxiety, low confidence in ability to parent or low life satisfaction. This was done as these couples may benefit the most from Baby Triple P.
Participants will be approximately 150 couples where the mother is 20Â­-35 weeks pregnant. Recruitment will be done through primary care settings, GPs, hospitals in the Brisbane and Ipswich area and targeted mailÂ­out and media campaigns.
The research will be carried out as a randomised controlled trial comparing the Baby Triple P group to a care as usual group. The study is a 2 (Baby Triple P vs care as usual) x 3 (timeÂ­points: preÂ­test, postÂ­test, 6Â­month follow up) design. The intervention consists of four weekly 2Â­hour group sessions during pregnancy, and four weekly 20Â­ minute telephone consultations starting when the baby is about 6 weeks old.
Assessment will include a series of selfÂ­report questionnaires (preÂ­, postÂ­, and followÂ­up) and a home observation, which will observe mothers as they normally interact with the baby (postÂ­ and followÂ­up).
The primary outcome variable for this study is parental confidence/ self-efficacy. Accordingly, it is hypothesised that compared to the care as usual group:
H1: Participation in Baby Triple P will lead higher levels of parenting confidence and perceived competence.
This study will also look at several secondary outcome variables. For these,it is hypothesised that, compared with the care as usual control group, participation in Baby Triple P will lead to:
H2: higher levels of parental responsiveness and bonding to the baby.,
H3: higher relationship happiness,
H4: higher levels of life satisfaction
H5: fewer instances of depression or anxiety
H6: Infants will show less fussing, crying and fewer sleeping p</summary>
