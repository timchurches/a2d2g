  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - TMC114
Treatment: drugs - rtv

Experimental: TMC114 + rtv - Every participant recieves 2 tablets of TMC114, 300 mg, combined with one tablet of rtv (ritonavir), 100mg, orally twice daily, every 12 hours


Treatment: drugs: TMC114
300 mg tablets of TMC114 ethanolate with microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon dioxide, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, and Opadry® Orange

Treatment: drugs: rtv
100 mg tablet of Norvir®

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety and tolerability of TMC114/RTV 600/100 mg combination</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, up to the end of follow-up period (approximatelly 100 weeks)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of patients with HIV-1 plasma viral load level &lt;50 copies/mL (TLOVR, non-VF censored) - The Time to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR) algorithm will be used to derive response. Response will be confirmed at 2 consecutive visits and participants who discontinue will be considered nonresponders after discontinuation. Resuppression after confirmed virologic failure will be considered as failure. Virologic Failure will include participants who are rebounders (ie, confirmed viral load &gt;= 50 copies/mL after being a responder) or who were never suppressed (no confirmed viral load &lt;50 copies/mL); non-VF censored: participants who discontinue treatment due to reason other than Virologic Failure will be excluded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48, Week 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in CD4 cells absolute count - The immunologic change will be determined by changes in absolute values for CD4 cells.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was primarily to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of
      TMC114/rtv in addition to an individually optimized background antiretroviral therapy in
      HIV-1 infected participants. In addition, antiviral activity and immunological effect were
      also evaluated.</summary>
