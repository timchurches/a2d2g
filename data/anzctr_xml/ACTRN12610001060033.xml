  <interventions>
    <interventions>Diet varying in glycaemic load (one high (GL= 206), one low (GL=126) fed over 12 hour period.  Diets consisted of everyday food items.  The high GL diet included white bread, jam, lucozade, pizza, macaroni cheese whilst the low GL diet consised of soy and linseed bread, milo, cheese, hummus, salad, falafel,  yoghurt, fruit).  Meals will be given at 08.00 (breakfast), 10.00 (morning tea), 13.00 (lunch), 15.00 (afternoon tea) and 18.00 (dinner).  Measurements of  blood glucose levels; satiety (visual analogue scales);mood (state trait anxiety scales); cognitive function (mini mental state exam) were made through the course of the day.  As this is a cross over study, participants will have a period of at least 7 days between each visit.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be required to visit the clinic for an introductory interview.  This visit will be to establish their suitability for the trial and to gain consent.  Following a discussion about the trial, participants will  be asked to fill out a questionnaire designed to assess their motivation to eat, i.e the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire to assess issues which may affect adequate food intake and body weight control.  Following their inclusion into the study, particpants will be allocated a unique idenifier code and will be randomly allocated to the first dietary intevention (low or high glycaemic load (GL) diet).  following completion of this they will then cross over to the remaining diet for the second twelve hour intervention after a seven day washout period.  Particpants will be allocated to the diets using Microsoft EXCEL randomisation procedure</concealment>
    <sequence>The 24 participants will be randomly assigned to consume the low GL or high GL diet once on each of the two visits to the clinic.  Participants will not be informed which diet they will be consuming on which day. Participants will be randomly assigned using random number tables.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Satiety measures levels of hunger and feelings of fullness after a meal and stops us eating more.  There are many physiological and psychological processes involved and our apparent inability to control our food intake is thought to be contributing to the rising levels of obesity and its associated health problems.  In this study we aim to examine some of the factors involved in satiety by measuring an individuals response to food over a period of twelve hours. Food will be high glycaemic load or low glycaemic load which is a way of measuring the type of carbohydrate (CHO) in food and how quickly we can digest it to release glucose into the blood.  The slower the digestion of CHO, the more satiating the food.  Subjects will be given breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. Blood glucose measurements will be taken throughout the day and subjects will also be asked to rate feelings of hunger, fullness and how much more food they could eat.  Participants will also be asked to rate if they feel stressed or anxious and also asked to complete some easy tasks to measure how well they remember and recall information.</summary>
