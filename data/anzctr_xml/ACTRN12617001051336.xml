  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether+lumefantrine (20/120 mg in tablet) given twice daily for three days. The recommended dose by weight bands will be used as follows: 1 tablet to those weighing 5 to 14 kg; 2 tablets for 15 to 24 kg; 3 tablets for 25 to 34 kg and 4 tablets for equal or greater than 35 kg. 
All treatments will be taken orally under direct supervision by the health worker. The patient will be given artemether+lumefantrine and will be followed up for 28 days. Patients will be asked to attend the study facilities at scheduled days (days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and any other day, if required). If the patient fail to attend the scheduled days a designated member of the study team will visit the patient at home. </interventions>

The known adverse events of:

Atemether+lumefantrine are abdominal pain, asthenia, cough, diarrhoea, dizziness, fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, loss of appetite, rush, nausea, vomiting.

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Comoros 

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections

Study Sites: Pole Sud, Pole du centre et Pole du Nord de la grande ile dans lUnion des Comores. 

Study Period: The study started in July 2017 and will continue until March 2018.

Study Design: Single arm prospective study.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months and 60 years, inclusive, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection. Female 12 years will be excluded as subjecting them to pregnancy testing is unacceptable according to the local customs and cultures.

Sample Size: 88 patients will be enrolled.

Treatments and follow-up: artemether-lumefantrine (twice daily dose for 3 days) will be given. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 42-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency of adverse events and frequency of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance (K13)
