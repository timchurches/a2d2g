  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Cycle 1 Dose-limiting Toxicities (DLT) - DLT includes: Grade (GR) 4 neutropenia (NP) that persisted for &gt;7 consecutive days; Febrile NP; GR3 NP infection; GR4 thrombocytopenia (TP); GR3 TP with bleeding; Any other GR&gt;=3 toxicity not classified under Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) blood or bone marrow (exception of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in subjects who received optimal treatment with antiemetics or anti-diarrheals); Failure to recover to an adequate condition to recommence study treatment after a 2-week delay; Failure to receive &gt;= 80% of planned PF-03758309 dose due to study drug related toxicity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (up to 30 days prior to first study drug administration) till 28 days after the last treatment administration (end of Cycle 1 [28 days])</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Objective Response - Number of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to RECIST. Confirmed CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR defined as =30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions (LD) of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum LD according to RECIST. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study =4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until the date of first documented progression or discontinuation from the study due to any cause, assessed every 2 months until when the last participant was discontinued due to disease progression in Month 27 of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Tumor Progression (TTP) - Time in weeks from start of study treatment to first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer, whichever comes first. TTP was calculated as (first event date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 7. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD])</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until the date of first documented progression or discontinuation from the study due to any cause, assessed every 2 months until when the last participant was discontinued due to disease progression in Month 27 of the study</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline until the date of first documented progression or discontinuation from the study due to any cause, assessed every 2 months until when the last participant was discontinued due to disease progression in Month 27 of the study</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is the first study using PF-03758309, an oral compound, in patients with advanced solid
      tumors. In this study different doses of PF-03758309 will be administered to different groups
      of patients. The study will assess the compound's safety, the blood levels of PF-03758309
      during the treatment and the effect of the compound on the tumor cells.</summary>
