    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants were allocated a participant number on recruitment. These were consecutive integer values starting at 1. Allocations were implemented from the list of random numbers with no variations to the order in which the numbers were assigned.</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to recruitment, a random number drawn from a (0,1) uniform distribution (using the random number generator in SAS) was allocated to each participant number. These were rounded to 0 if less than 0.5, or 1 if greater than or equal to 0.5. The 0 or 1 produced the assignment to one of the two intervention groups.</sequence>
