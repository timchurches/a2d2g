    <summary>The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 12 weeks of evolocumab subcutaneously
      once every 2 weeks (Q2W) and once monthly (QM), compared with placebo, on percent change from
      baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in adults with heterozygous familial
      hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).</summary>
