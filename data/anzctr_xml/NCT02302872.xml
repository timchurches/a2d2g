             written informed consent

          2. Age = 18

          3. Trans-septal catheterization is determined to be feasible by the treating physician

          4. NYHA class II-IV heart failure of any etiology

          6. LVEF =20% = 50%

          7. LVEDD &gt; 50 mm and = 70 mm

          8. No anticipated change in patient's cardiac medication regimen anticipated throughout
             the course of the study.

          9.  In the opinion of the investigator and heart surgery team, the patient is not a
             candidate for surgery, and the use of the ARTO System is technically feasible.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. In the opinion of the Investigator, the femoral vein and internal jugular vein cannot
             accommodate a 16 F catheter or the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter
             would interfere with advancement of the catheter or ipsilateral DVT is present

          2. Significant structural abnormality of the mitral valve (e.g., flail, prolapse, leaflet
             calcification)

          3. Significant mitral annular calcification

          4. Hemodynamic instability (systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg without afterload reduction or
             cardiogenic shock or the need for inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon pump)

          5. Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or any currently implanted prosthetic
             valve or VAD

          6. History of, or active, rheumatic heart disease

          7. History of Atrial Septal Defects (ASD), whether repaired or not

          8. History of previously repaired PFO or PFO associated with clinical symptoms (e.g.,
             cerebral ischemia) within 6 months of the planned investigational procedure

          9. In the opinion of the investigator, an atrial septal aneurysm is present that may
             interfere with transseptal crossing

         10. Biventricular pacing initiated or anticipated within 6 months of the planned
             investigational procedure</exclusivecriteria>
