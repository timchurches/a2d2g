  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three weeks wear of a wide, flexible neoprene support belt. Participants were shown by a physiotherapist how to wear the belt, aligned over the pubic symphysis and were advised to wear it whenever possible during waking hours. Women were sent daily text messages asking whether pain and function had improved (yes/no/sometimes) and for how many hours they wore the belt for. Weekly phone interviews also monitored adherence, comfort and pain and functional improvement.</interventions>
    <comparator>Three weeks wear of a thinner, more rigid pelvic support belt made of cotton webbing with foam lining. Participants were shown by a physiotherapist how to wear the belt, aligned over the pubic symphysis and were advised to wear it whenever possible during waking hours. Women were sent daily text messages asking whether pain and function had improved (yes/no/sometimes) and for how many hours they wore the belt for.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient Specific Functional Scale. Administered verbally and completed by the study investigator. Each participant was required to identify three important activities, and up to two additional activities, that they were unable to do or have difficulty with as a result of their problem (pubic symphysis pain). Then, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being unable to perform the activity and 10 able to perform the activity at pre-pregnancy level, participants rated their ability to perform each activity that was identified. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain intensity rated on the 10cm Visual Analogue Scale for worst pain over the preceding 24 hours. Participants were asked to mark an X on the 10cm line provided to represent their worst pubic symphysis pain experienced during the last 24 hour period. A mark on the left hand side of the scale (at 0cm) indicated participants experienced "no pain", and at a mark on the right hand side of the scale (at 10cm) indicated that participants experienced "worst possible pain".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain intensity rated on the 10cm Visual Analogue Scale for the worst pain over the preceding week. Participants were asked to mark an X on the 10cm line provided to represent their worst pubic symphysis pain experienced during the last week. A mark on the left hand side of the scale (at 0cm) indicated participants experienced "no pain", and at a mark on the right hand side of the scale (at 10cm) indicated that participants experienced "worst possible pain".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional status determined by the Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire. Participants self completed the questionnaire which asks about pain intensity, ability to maintain personal care, ability to perform tasks such as lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping and driving, and the impact of their pain on their social lives, employment/homemaking and sex lives.  Participants were asked to tick one box for each category that best described their condition on the day they were completing the questionnaire. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Three weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Pregnant women, at least 18 years of age, whom had experienced pubic symphyseal pain for at least two weeks (which was worse than any concurrent posterior pelvic pain), and had a positive response to at least two of three clinical tests: reproduction of pain from palpation, modified Trendelenburg's test, active straight leg raise test. </inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>One of the study designers, who was not involved in participant recruitment, assessment or data collection, performed the randomization of participants and concealed the results in sealed opaque envelopes, sequentially numbered. Following assessment and enrollment into the study, the study administrator drew and opened the next sequentially numbered envelope and then communicated with the assessor (physiotherapist) about which belt each participant would be using.</concealment>
    <sequence>Performed by one of the study designers not involved in assessment or data collection. Using a computer-generated random number table and block sizes of 4, participants were assigned in a 1:1 allocation to either flexible or rigid belt. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Before a multi-center trial of pelvic support belts can be launched, it is essential to gather data on the most appropriate type of belt, symptomatic effectiveness, comfort, and adherence as well as to provide estimates of anticipated variability and correlations between repeated measures. Having 10 participants in each arm of this study was considered sufficient to obtain preliminary data to help with estimating power for a larger subsequent study. Data were entered into a spreadsheet. Any out of range values were double-checked for input accuracy. Appropriate descriptive statistics were derived for all variables. Linear regression models were used to examine differences in follow-up values between the two groups (flexible and rigid belts) after adjusting for baseline values. Model assumptions were assessed using histograms of residuals, plots of residuals against fitted values, and Levenes test for equality of variance between groups. Where model residuals were positively skewed or demonstrated heteroscedasticity, natural logarithmic transformations were investigated, after adding one in the case of measures that included zero values. Overall changes (across both groups) in measures were examined using paired t-tests where there was no evidence of differences in change between groups and regression models using follow-up values while controlling for baseline values were used to assess any association with compliance. Stata 13.1 was used for all statistical analysis and all tests were performed using two-sided p &lt; 0.05 as indicating statistical significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The pubic symphysis is a joint at the front of the pelvis that can cause pain during pregnancy and after delivery. This pain is not well understood. In particular, how common it is and how it changes during and after pregnancy are poorly described. The effectiveness of suggested treatments are unknown. This pilot study aimed to trial two types of pelvic belt commonly used in the treatment of symphyseal pain to assess their comfort and symptom relief.</summary>
