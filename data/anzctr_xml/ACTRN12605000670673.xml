  <interventions>
    <interventions>This multi center study will assess the ability of the GIVEN Patency System to verify the patency of the GI tract in patients with known strictures in the small bowel. The overall plan for all patients consists of the following elements:
Patient is assessed for his eligibility to participate in the study.
Patient ingests a GIVEN Patency Capsule.
Patient is followed using the GIVEN Patency Scanner until the excretion of the capsule and/or its components. 
Patients will undergo fluoroscopy 32-38 hours after ingestion.
Patients will undergo fluoroscopy (as applicable) 68-72 hours after ingestion 
Patients will undergo fluoroscopy (as applicable) 94-100 hours after ingestion 
Patient with patent GI tract will undergo PillCam SB Capsule Endoscopy to further assess the patient's condition and evaluate the correlation between the results of GIVEN Patency Capsule passage and the PillCam SB Capsule findings</interventions>
