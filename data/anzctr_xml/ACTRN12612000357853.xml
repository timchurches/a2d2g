  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study will aim to recruit only those chronic HCV patients who have previously undergone a liver transplant (Group A). However, in order to meet recruitment timelines, patients who have chronic HCV infection but who have not had a liver transplant (Group B) will also be included in the study. 

Each study participant (both those from Group A and Group B) will undergo an abdominal MRI examination on two separate occasions (at Visits 1 and 2 which will be performed 35-45 days apart). MR images will be acquired at each visit both before and after the administration of gadoterate (Dotarem(R)).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for a non-invasive MRI-based method to diagnose and quantitate liver fibrosis. The results will be compared to the current standard of care which is the histopathologists visual examination of tissue obtained via an invasive liver biopsy as well as FibroScan an ultrasound-based liver imaging method.</summary>
