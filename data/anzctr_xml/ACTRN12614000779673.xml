  <interventions>
    <interventions>Triple P is a multilevel system of behavioural family interventions that aims to prevent and treat child social, emotional and behavioural problems by enhancing parenting confidence, knowledge and skills. Triple P offers five levels of intervention varying in the degree and type of parental support required. The current intervention is classified as Level 2 (seminars). 

Within the Triple P system, Family Transitions Triple P was developed specifically for who are separated or divorced. Parents in the intervention group will participate in a 4 hour seminar on successfully navigating the transition through divorce. The seminar will describe the needs of children following divorce, provide an understanding of the transition of divorce, and help parents identify factors that play a role in causing problems for children following divorce. The intervention also aims to teach positive parenting skills, reduce conflict between parents over parenting issues, improve communication with children and build parents' stress management and coping skills. 

A randomised controlled trial design will be used to evaluate the effects of participation in the seminar intervention, in comparison with a wait list control group.</interventions>
    <comparator>The wait list control group will receive no intervention during the actual study, however will be provided with the Family Transitions Seminar approximately 3 months after the intervention group has completed the intervention, after the study has been completed and all data has been collected.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents interested in participating in the study are asked to contact the researcher for further information about the study protocol. After initial contact, parents will complete a brief telephone screening interview to ensure the inclusion and exclusion criteria are met and therefore confirm participant eligibility. A participant information sheet and consent form will be provided online for the parent before they can access the survey. Informed consent will be obtained online before the pre-intervention measures can be completed. Randomisation to conditions will be conducted after the participant's completion of pre-intervention measures. 
Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to the intervention, participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or waitlist control conditions using a pre-generated computerised number sequence, administered by a research assistant, to ensure that the researcher is blind to group assignment. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A priori power analysis was performed using G*Power software to determine a reasonable sample size for the study. Sample size was determined based on repeated-measures MANOVA with interactions, with two primary outcomes and three measurement time points (number of measurements = 6). An effect size of 0.25 was set, based on previous level 2 Triple P trials. Consistent with convention a Type I error rate of 0.05 was used, along with Power of 0.8, yielding a total sample size of 158 participants.
Initial comparisons of the control and treatment groups at baseline will be performed using analysis of variance and chi-square tests. This is to ensure adequate randomization in that there were no significant differences between demographic variables or outcome variables prior to the intervention. This also includes chi-square test significant differences in rates of attrition between the intervention and waitlist control group. 

Short-term intervention effects will be measured using univariate ANCOVAs &amp; MANCOVAS. Differences at baseline will be used as covariates in the analyses to control for any differences and therefore reduce error. Cohens d will be used to measure the effect sizes in order to report the magnitude of relationships. Means and standard deviations will also be reported, in particular for reporting the results of the measure of intervention acceptability. Clinically reliable change will be calculated to determine how much change was caused by the intervention. A change exceeding 1.96 times the standard error will be considered a statistically reliable change. 

Long-term intervention effects will be measure using ANOVAs and MANOVAs. Repeated measures MANOVAs will be used to compare pre-intervention and follow-up effects for the intervention group across child and parent variables. Univariate ANOVAs will be used to measure across variables with a significant multivariate effect. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the project is to evaluate the impact of a brief, intensive seminar on positive parenting for parents who are divorced. The seminar is specifically developed to address risk factors and enhance protective factors for parents who are divorced. It aims to enhance parental coping, communication, and conflict management skills as well as reduce dysfunctional parenting styles and parental adjustment issues. The seminar also aims to encourage parents to build skills and competencies in their child that will enable the child to successfully negotiate high-risk environments, and enhancing their childs resilience. </summary>
