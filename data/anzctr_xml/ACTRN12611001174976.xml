    <interventions>MiTii (Move it To improve it) is an internet-based multimodal therapy which combines upper-limb training within the context of meaningful physical activity that can be accessed in children's homes. Inherent in this approach is the ability to scaffold visual perception skills and cognitive challenge, both important aspects of activity engagement and participation in a virtual training environment. The program is potentially cost effective as only three centre-based therapists (Physiotherapist, Occupation Therapist, and psychologist) are required to provide initial assessment, goal setting and training for families and participating children. Each therapist then spends 30 minutes each week to remotely modify the individualised program. This current application proposes to test the efficacy of MiTii in a wait list randomised controlled trial. We propose to provide MiTii at an intensity of 30 minutes per day, 6 days/week for 20 weeks (total dose 60 hours). All children will therefore receive the therapy within 10 months of being randomised either to commence MiTii immediately or waitlisted for 20 weeks before receiving the same Mitii therapy as the Immediate invention group. Retention of effects will be tested at 10 months. As current therapy programs are resource intensive and time consuming it is important to determine if gains from MiTii are sustained over a 10 month period as this could offer a cost effective model of care, particularly for rural, remote and isolated children with CP.</interventions>
    <comparator>The delayed intervention or waitlist group will act as a control group. These children will undergo baseline assessment and then be sent home for 20 weeks receiving standard Treatment/Care as Usual. After the 20 weeks, assessments will be repeated and they will then receive the same 20 week Mitii training as the Immediate Intervention group. Standard care is considered Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy or Psychology that the child would otherwise receive without the intervention, excluding splinting, casting or surgery management. Should children normally received Botox, their inclusion in the study will be delayed until after their Botox and standard follow up care has been completed. Standard care will be assessed using a parent questionnaire which documents the types of therapies and frequency received</comparator>

    <concealment>Screening phone call to ensure participant's suitability. Rolling recruitment in blocks of 10-15 children. Matching pairs for age/gender/MACS scores Once baseline assessments have been completed, children will be randomised within pairs from concealed envelopes opened by non-study personnel. Treatment allocation will be recorded on a piece of folded paper inside each envelope in random order (computer generated). The randomisation process will involve allocating a number “1” or “2’ to each member of the pair which will be written on the paper inside the envelope. As each pair is entered, they will be allocated the next consecutive envelope, which will be opened by the non-study personnel who will read and record the treatment allocation from the paper inside the envelope. Study personnel will be informed of group allocation.</concealment>
