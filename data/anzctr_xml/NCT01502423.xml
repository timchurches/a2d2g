             drug.

          -  All female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative test for pregnancy
             on a serum sample at Screening and prior to study drug dosing on a urine sample
             obtained at Visit 1.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare injection site pain levels between current Humira® formulation versus
      a new formulation of Humira in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), who are either
      currently on a stable dose (minimum six consecutive doses) of on-label Humira or biological
      naïve who will be prescribed on-label Humira as treatment for their Rheumatoid Arthritis. The
      study is being conducted in three countries, Australia (3 sites), Canada (2 sites), and
      Germany (2 sites).</summary>
