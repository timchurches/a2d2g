  <interventions>
    <interventions>The i-FOCIS intervention will encompass:
1.	Assessing functional cognition to determine personal resources; fall risk factors using evidencebased protocol; and, daily routines and preferred activities by interview.
2.	Based on the assessment, developing tailored and prioritized intervention goals:
a.	Identifying and modifying environmental risk factors and simplifying environmental press to match cognitive abilities.  
b.	Providing  exercise and functional tasks matched to capacity that will improve balance and increase lower limb strength.  
c.	Developing personal strategies to address safety and behavioral risk factors by focusing on meaningful activity that is associated with a high risk of falling for the individual (e.g., task analysis and simplification).
d.	Training for caregiver in the above problem solving strategies and generic principles of risk reduction, and in specific communication strategies to facilitate management of the person and environment and ongoing engagement in falls prevention. 
The planned program is four occupational therapy visits of 1-2hours duration and 4 physiotherapy visits of 1-1.5 hours duration, plus three follow up phone calls. The sessions will finish in the 12th week and be more frequent over the first 6 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Seventy to eighty-five percent of people with cognitive impairment fall each year. This alarming rate is twice that seen in cognitively normal older people. In addition, people with cognitive impairment and dementia are at increased risk of serious injury and have a poorer prognosis following a fall. Falling in older age can markedly change an individuals health trajectory, having debilitating and isolating consequences. Falls can start a downward spiral of immobility, reduced confidence and incapacity leading to institutionalization, and can be a cause of premature death. Typically, fall studies conducted with community-residing people exclude those with cognitive impairment. Thus little is known about how to best conduct falls prevention in this population.  
This project will refine, trial and pilot a program that integrates the known evidence for falls prevention for environmental adaptation along with a dementia-specific approach to safe activity engagement in fall risk situations. Assessment of functional abilities and functional cognition will be conducted using Allens Cognitive Disability Model of practice. This will frame the intervention which will utilise the older persons personal and environmental resources to make adaptations to the environment and behaviours that will significantly reduce their risk of falling.</summary>
