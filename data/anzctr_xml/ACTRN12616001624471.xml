  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective, randomized, longitudinal study of the clinical outcomes of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee treated by two different philosophies for knee joint replacement. Participants will be treated using either the Stryker cemented or uncemented Triathlon Total Knee System for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The approximate duration of the procedure is 90 minutes and will be performed by consultant orthopaedic surgeons. For both knee systems the surgical technique is the same, but differ in whether cement is used at the bony interface or trabecular metal/porous metal gritted surface is used
</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is the Cemented Stryker Triathlon Total Knee System for Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) implanted using Stryker PrecisioN v4.0 Knee Navigation (control). The navigation technique adds approximately 10 minutes to the procedure therefore the total time of the operation will be approximately 90 minutes. It involves the use of bony landmarks and computer navigation trackers to more accurately work out alignment of bony cuts aiding better positioning of the implant over not using it. The operations will be performed by consultant orthopaedic surgeons.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We have based our sample size calculation on a non-inferiority test , as the new technique has some advantage and can be accepted if it is not worse than the standard TKR technique in the proportion of non-progressive medical radiolucent lines by a certain value. In that paper, if you think 3% of non-progressive medical radiolucent lines (at 5 years) is acceptable, then you will need to have 150 patients each group, with a power of 80% and at 95% confidence level. This actually means an 9% difference (12%-3%=9%) is acceptable, given the advantage gain using the new TKR technique.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This  prospective, randomized, longitudinal  clinical  trial  is to  assess the early durability and clinical reliability of a highly porous metal tibial component versus a traditional cemented modular tibial component in Total Knee Replacement (TKR). We are looking to answer the following questions: (1) Is TKA with an uncemented highly porous metal tibial component as reliable clinically as TKR with a  cemented  tibial  component  (as  judged  by  health status and functional outcome measures, complications, and reoperations)? (2) Is TKR with an uncemented highly porous metal tibial component as durable as TKA with a standard cemented tibial component (as judged by 5-year survivorship)?

There will be 1 site (North Shore Hospital, Auckland), 1 Principal Investigator and 6 co-Investigators for this study. A maximum of 150 cases will be enrolled in each group, for a total of 300 patients. It is expected that participants will be recruited over a 24 month period. Total duration of the study is expected to be 10 years.

The study consists of two groups:
1.	Intervention Group: Treatment by total knee replacement using Stryker Triathlon uncemented TKR with uncemented patellar resurfacing;

2.	Control Group: Treatment by total knee replacement using Stryker Triathlon Cemented TKR with cemented patellar resurfacing

Pre-operatively, all participants will be required to have standard Knee X Rays (AP/M-L and Skyline view of patella.

All participants (control and intervention groups) will be requested to attend visits pre- operatively and post-operatively at 6 weeks, 12 months, 24 months, 5 years and 10 years. At these visits participants will complete assessments relating to quality of life, pain and functional outcome. In addition, participants will have standard knee X-rays taken pre- operatively and post-operatively. A further follow up visit at 5 and 10 years, to collect longer term data on radiographic and patient outcomes including the secondary objectives of revision rate, device-related adverse events and re-operation rates.
