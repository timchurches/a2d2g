    <interventions>Administration of Pediatric Balance Scale  (PBS) in 60 school-age child with mild to moderate motor impairment. Forty children will be selected for the cultural adaptation process and 20 for assessment of the reliability of Brazilian PBS. The scale was administered on a one-to-one basis by physiotherapist. Ethical approval will be obtained prior to the commencement of the study from our Institutional Ethics Committee. The 14 items contained within PBS assess many of functional activities children must perform to safely and independently their daily function. The aprroximate time taken to administer the PBS is 25 minutes and it will be applied only once in each child for cultural adaptation process. For assessment of the reliability, the PBS was applied twice in each child.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>a) Translation from English to Brazilian-Portuguese and consensus version of the original PBS by two persons proficient in English;
b) Back translation of Brazilian-Portuguese version of PBS by two translators;
c)Generation of consensus version of Brazilian-Portuguese PBS.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the first 6 months of the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cultural Equivalence of Brazilian after construction of the first version of PBS. Twenty physiotherapists specialized in the areas of pediatric and neurology will apply the first version of Brazilian PBS to 40 school-age children with mild to moderate motor impairment (administred on two children by each physioterapist). Items with more them 15% incomprehension with respect to both the instruction and response alternatives will be discussed and the items will be modified.</outcome>
      <timepoint>at 6 months after first version of Brazilian-Portuguese PBS.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reliability of the measure from Brazilian final version of PBS.
To test the reliability of the Brazilian PBS, the scale will be applied to 20 children during three assessments. The first two assessments will be performed consecutively on the same day by two observers (interobserver reliability), at an interval of approximately 15 min, with either observer 1 or observer 2 applying the first assessment. The third assessment will be applied after seven days at the same time by observer 1 (intraobserver reliability).</outcome>
      <timepoint>at one year after Brazilian final version of PBS construction.</timepoint>
