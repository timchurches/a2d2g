  <interventions>
    <interventions>A) * Paracetamol + Ibuprofen oral suspension (group receiving analgesia). 
* Placebo liquid oral suspension (group not receiving analgesia)
B) Dose of paracetamol (20mg/kg) and ibuprofen (10mg/kg)  based on individual childs weight. Dose of placebo will be in equivalent volume of liquid as they would receive if they were getting ibuprofen and paracetamol
C) Dose frequency is one dose preoperatively. (excluding any rescue analgesia which is available to all children in both groups after their operation as needed)
D)Oral suspension
E) The duration of the intervention and its follow-up is 1 day

</interventions>
    <comparator>1. Children undergoing grommet insertion (who meet selection criteria) who receive a placebo mixture instead of Paracetamol plus ibuprofen prior to surgery
2. Fluid thickener: Modified maize starch (E1442), maltodextrin, tara gum, xanthan gum, guar gum. (Dietitian approved)
3. Oral suspension

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure: Pain levels (Wong-Baker Pain Scale) in the ear(s) after surgery 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two pain scores will be routinely recorded: one 90min post surgery and the other just prior to discharge home from recovery (2-4hours on average after the operation). Further pain scores will be taken prior to any rescue analgesia if required.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Rescue analgesic requirements in the peri-operative unit after the operation. This will only be done if the child is assessed to be in pain postoperatively.  If at any stage after the operation, regardless of the group the child is in, if the child is in distress a pain score will be taken.  If the child is in pain then appropriate analgesia will be given.  The amount of rescue analgesia needed will be collated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Two pain scores will be routinely recorded: one 90min post surgery and the other just prior to discharge home from recovery (2-4hours on average after the operation). Further pain scores will be taken prior to any rescue analgesia if required.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain in throat from intubation/laryngeal mask airway. If possible all children will be ventilated with bag mask ventilation and no airway device will be used. Hence this outcome measure only applies to children who recieved the above airway adjuncts.  When the pain score is obtained (using the Wong-Baker Pain Scale) the child will be asked to locate their pain and if it is in their throat it will be assumed this is due to the airway adjunct and not their grommet procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two pain scores will be routinely recorded: one 90min post surgery the other just prior to discharge home from recovery(2-4hours on average after the operation). Further pain scores will be taken prior to any rescue analgesia if required</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain from IV cannulae. If possible all children will not be cannulated. Hence this outcome measure only applies to children who it was found necessary to have a IV cannula insitu. When the pain score is obtained (using the Wong-Baker Pain Scale) the child will be asked to locate their pain and if it is around their cannula site it will be assumed this is due to the IV cannula and not their grommet procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two pain scores will be routinely recorded: one 90min post surgery the other just prior to discharge home from recovery(2-4hours on average after the operation). Further pain scores will be taken prior to any rescue analgesia if required</timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will be recruiting patients planned for grommet insertion at the pre-operative assessment. An explanation regarding the study will be given to them (or carer/guardian). They will also be given the study information sheet. 

Consent forms are available at the time to be completed if they feel ready to give their consent. If not, when they come for their surgery they can let us know whether they wish to participate in the study.  If required we may also call the parent/guardian at home to answer any questions they may have.

Sealed envelope will be used to deliver the randomization to the point of intervention. The anaesthetist will open the envelop to determine the grouping of the participant, just before the patient is anaesthetized for their grommet operation to ensure adequate allocation concealment</concealment>
    <sequence>Sampling method: Consecutive sampling of every patient who are being listed for grommet insertion according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria and then Block randomisation will be employed</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Title of Project: Do children undergoing grommet insertion require analgesia?

Brief Description of the Purpose of the Project: 
The opinion of pain experienced by children after Grommet insertion varies from no pain to mild or moderate pain. During the operation the amount of pain relief given to a child varies from none to three classes of analgesia. We plan to conduct a triple blinded randomized controlled trial to determine whether analgesia is required during the operation to prevent early post-operative pain. 

Hypothesis: There is no difference in the pain levels between children who did and did not receive intra-operative analgesia.
