  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In about half the patients who have an open chest surgery there is persistent severe pain in
      the chest. The investigators are examining whether minocycline, a commonly used antibiotic,
      will prevent pain. Minocycline blocks the activity of immune cells which the investigators
      believe are responsible for prolonging the pain.</summary>
