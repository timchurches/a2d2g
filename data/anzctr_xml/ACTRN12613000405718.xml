  <interventions>
    <interventions>The calcium in a total spent dialysate is measured by collection into a 200L vessel.  The total calcium content in the spent dialysate is subtracted from the calcium infused during during citrate anticoagulation to provide the net amount of calcium retained by the patient (the calcium flux).  The dialysate is collected for the duration of the dialysis session (usually 4 hours)</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mass of calcium infused during citrate antocoagulated dialysis is measured by multiplying the volume infused by the concentration in the infused liquid.  The mass of calcium in the spent dialysate is determined by collecting spent dialysate over the entire duration of the patient's dialysis session (usually 4 hours).  The difference between these two figures produces the net calcium flux into or out of the patient during the dialysis therapy</outcome>
      <timepoint>One dialysis session (usually 4 hours)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The mass of citrate infused during citrate antocoagulated dialysis is measured by multiplying the volume infused by the concentration in the infused fluid.  The mass of citrae in the spent dialysate is determined by collecting spent dialysate over the entire duration of the patient's dialysis session (usually 4 hours).  The difference between these two figures produces the net citrate returned to the patient during therapy.  If expressed as a proportion of the mass infused, it yields the proportional extration during dialysis.</outcome>
