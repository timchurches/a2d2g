  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients are randomised by random number allocation to one of five treatment groups. Each receives an injection under fluoroscopic guidance. In three groups the needle is placed in the intervertebral foramen that lodges the affected nerve. Respectively those groups are randomly injected with (1) 0.75ml of a local anaesthetic (0.5% bupivacaine) followed by a steroid preparation (1.75 ml triamcinolone 40mg/ml) or (2) 2ml bupivacaine 0.5% or (3) 2ml normal saline. In two other groups the needle is placed deeply in the back muscles opposite the segment affected by the disc herniation. They receive either 1.75 ml triamcinolone 40mg/ml or 2 ml normal saline. All patients receive at least one therapeutic injection, but are entitled to have one or two repeats of the allocated agent if their response is favourable but partial, and they wish to boost their response.</interventions>
    <comparator>There are no explicit control groups. Each of the tratments to which patients might be allocated has been regarded as effective. EVen intramuscular normal saline is purported to be effective in 48% of patients. The intervention for which there is no quantiative data is transforaminal injection of normal saline, also known as "washout". Of all the interventions, this most closely approximates a control group or placebo.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Five different injections are purported to be effective for lumbar radicular pain. Each has its advocates but each lacks convincing scientific data. This study is designed to test which of these injections is effective, for relieving pain and restoring function, in the greatest proportion of patients and for the longest duration.</summary>
