    <interventions>We will compare the effects of standardised conventional treatment (CT) with diuretics and vasodilators in 25 patients to CT plus a once only intravenous infusion (IV) of urocortin 2 (UCN2 at 5ng/kg/min for 4 hours; n=25) in patients recruited within 24 hours of admission with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF). Serial assessment of symptoms, physical signs, arterial blood pressure, heart rate, observed jugular venous pressure , plasma and urine creatinine and urine volume, creatinine, sodium and potassium excretion and serial plasma neurohormone levels (urocortins 1 and 2, cardiac natriuretic peptides, renin, angiotensin, aldosterone, catecholamines, endothelin, adrenomedullin , cortisol, urotensin2, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) will be carried out over 24 hours  in all 50 patients, with the addition of  right heart catheter monitoring of central cardiac haemodynamic status in subgroups of 10 patients in each treatment limb.  Follow-up observations will include blood pressure, heart rate, renal function and symptom status pre-discharge and clinical events out to 30 days post-discharge.</interventions>

    <concealment>Subjects will be randomised to receive standardised conventional treatment (CT) or standardised conventional treatment with the addition of a 4 hour infusion of urocortin 2 (UCN2 group) at a dose of 5ng/kg/minute (equating to approximately 25µg/hour for an 80kg patient).  A total of 50 patients will be recruited with 25 within each treatment limb.  Within each treatment limb a sub-group of 10 patients will undergo right heart catheter studies in addition to a common panel of neurohumoral, renal, haemodynamic and symptom measures undertaken in all 50 participants
In 10 patients within each study treatment limb, a right heart catheter will be deployed using ultrasound location of the internal jugular vein as the access point.  A Swan-Ganz catheter will be used to measure right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and cardiac output (thermodilution) at -30 minutes, time zero, +30 minutes and +1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 hours relative to commencement of randomised treatment. Swan-Ganz catheters will be removed after 8 hours.
The 10 patients in each limb will constitute 40% of each group. They will be selected randomly by random number generation as provided by our biostatistician. They will provide direct measurements of cardiac hemodynamics over a more sustained period than they can be derived from intermittent echo with associated indirect measurement. This element will introduce no bias. Allocation concealment will be managed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>About 1,000 people per year are admitted to Christchurch hospital with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (ADHF) which is the inability of the heart to pump efficiently, resulting in symptoms like shortness of breath at rest or with minimal activity. The average length of hospital stay for these people is 6 days.
Urocortin 2 is a naturally occurring hormone which we have shown to have promising beneficial effects in stable human heart failure.  
We therefore propose a randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of urocortin 2 on heart hormone activity and kidney function in addition to fluid volume status and shortness of breath symptoms in patients requiring admission to hospital for treatment of ADHF.
Once consent is obtained, participants will be given (in addition to the standard treatment) urocortin 2 or placebo as a continuous intravenous infusion (IV) of urocortin 2 or placebo for up to 4 hours.  
A total of 50 people will be recruited, 25 to each treatment group.  
Serial assessment of symptoms, physical signs, blood pressure, heart rate, observed jugular venous pressure, renal function (plasma and urine creatinine and urine volume, creatinine, sodium and potassium excretion) and serial plasma neurohormone levels will be carried out over 24 hours  in all 50 patients, Within each group, a sub-group of 10 people will undergo right heart catheter studies in addition to a serial blood tests undertaken in all 50 participants.
Follow-up observations will include blood pressure, heart rate, renal function and symptom status pre-discharge and clinical events out to 30 days post-discharge</summary>
