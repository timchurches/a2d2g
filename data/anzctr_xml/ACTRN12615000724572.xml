  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 6, 30 minute weekly sessions of usual physiotherapy care, the physiotherapy content of which will be at the discretion of the treating therapist. This will be in addition to their initial physiotherapy session, during which they will be recruited for the trial. Throughout each session the physiotherapist will communicate with patients in a style consistent with Motivational Interviewing (MI). Physiotherapists will be trained on how to communicate in an MI consistent style via two 4 hour training sessions prior to the commencement of the study. Training will be provided by two of the study coordinators who are both trained in the use of MI. One of the study coordinators is a PhD candidate and current practicing physiotherapist and the other an academic and current practicing psychologist. As part of training physiotherapists will participate in an audio recorded role play with one of the study coordinators. Therapists will be provided with a copy of this recording to reflect and improve on their MI techniques. Physiotherapists will practice learned MI techniques until patient recruitment commences. Prior to patient recruitment physiotherapists will receive a 3 hour training session to review learned MI techniques. To establish a measure of MI proficiency, physiotherapists will participate in a 20-30 minute role play with one of the study coordinators following this review session. This will be audio recorded and reviewed by a third party assessor not otherwise associated with the study. The assessor will use the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity scale to assess the interaction and provide a measure of therapist proficiency in MI. This will be repeated 6 weeks into patient recruitment to establish any change in MI proficiency. Between sessions, patients will access a newly developed MI app. The app will endeavor to replicate face to face MI and help participants to formulate their own reasons for increasing their activity levels though a question and answer format. The majority of questions will be open ended and focus on building the importance of increasing activity levels and the confidence the participant has in being able to achieve this. Finally an activity related goal will be developed in conjunction with the physiotherapist and the smartphone application. Participants will access the app two to three times per week. The amount of time required for each log in will vary between participants and depend on how skilled they are at using smartphones, however each session has been designed to last no longer than 15 minutes. Participants will then access the smartphone application for a further 6 weeks after physiotherapy has ceased. There will be a central web server accessible to physiotherapists from intervention clusters and the study coordinators. This will allow app usage to be monitored and the answers participants provide may be reviewed. A review of the answers may take place if the therapist wishes to use this information to plan upcoming sessions. The app will contain a feature, whereby if the participant gets stuck on a certain module, an email will be generated to one of the study coordinators, a current practicing psychologist who has extensive training in MI. The participant and the study coordinator will converse via email to problem solve why the participant is not progressing though the application. This will be done in an MI consistent manner. Once the study coordinator establishes that the participant is ready to recommence the app they will be instructed to do so.

    <concealment>Physiotherapists: Physiotherapists at intervention sites will be recruited as follows; Physiotherapists will be selected to be participated by the musculoskeletal unit stream leader based on work loads and other unit specific factors. Interested physiotherapists will contact one of the study coordinators to confirm their participation, who will advise the stream leader of this decision. 

Patients: Patients will be selected by their treating physiotherapist based on the selection criteria. Physiotherapists will explain the study to patients and make it clear to patients that participation is voluntary. Physiotherapists will administer the DASS 21 to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria regarding depression and anxiety. Patients will be provided with an information and consent form to review and will be followed up by a research assistant who will confirm participation and obtain written consent at the initial home visit when baseline outcome measures will be taken. 

</concealment>
    <sequence>A cluster randomised controlled trial with health care site as the unit of randomisation. An independent researcher will place the name of each healthcare site will be placed into an opaque envelope using a random number generator. Sites will then alternately be allocated to intervention or control sites using a random number generator.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>Assessments will be carried out by a blinded research assistant who will conduct home visits to patients at baseline and 7 weeks. At the start of the assessment week the research assistant will drop off the accelerometer and patients will complete the standardised pen and paper outcome measures. Half way through the assessment week the research assistant will call the patient to remind them to wear their accelerometer. At the end of the assessment week the research assistant will pick up the accelerometer and download the data using propriety software. 

Participants will also be provided with the email address of one of the study coordinators, so they can contact them if the accelerometer stops working.

To acknowledge the work and time physiotherapists will be donating to the project, physiotherapists will be provided with recruitment incentives for every 5 patients recruited (up to a maximum of 10 patients), and for the therapist who recruits the most patients overall across sites.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Primary and secondary outcomes will be entered into an ANCOVA using baseline scores as a co-variate to establish between groups at 7 weeks. 

To establish consistency in the Motivational Interviewing skills of therapists, paired-sampled t-tests will be used comparing baseline scores with obtained at the conclusion of the study.

To achieve 80% power at a 0.05 significance level with a large effect size a total of 34 patients are required (Faul, Franz
Erdfelder &amp; Edgar, 2007). As this is a cluster randomised trial the sample size needs to be increased due to outcome variation between clusters (van Breukelen &amp; Candel, 2012).  Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.05, a total of 14 patients per cluster is required (Machin, Campbell, Tan &amp; Tan, 2009). Therefore the target sample size will be set at 60 patients (15 for each cluster), to allow some loss to follow up.</statisticalmethods>
