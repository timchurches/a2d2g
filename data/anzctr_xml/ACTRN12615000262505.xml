    <interventions>A prospective observational study investigating the psychometric properties of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and a short symptom screening tool (Respiratory Symptoms in CF - ReS-CF) for use in people with cystic fibrosis. The questionnaires will be completed during a period of stability and also pre/post treatment for a respiratory exacerbation.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determination of the psychometric properties of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire in cystic fibrosis. Concurrent validity will be determined by calculating correlation coefficients using either the Pearson correlation coefficient or Spearmans rank correlation coefficient depending on the distribution of the data (determined by visual inspection and skewness and kurtosis statistics). Internal consistency of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (total and 3 domains) will be determined using Cronbachs alpha coefficient. Cronbachs alpha scores of 0.7-0.9 will be selected to represent appropriate internal consistency. Content validity will be determined by analysing for floor and ceiling effects, with less than 15% of subjects achieving either the minimum or maximum scores considered acceptable. Reliability of the Leicester Cough Questionnaire and Respiratory Symptoms in cystic fibrosis (domain and total scores) will be analysed using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC). Correlation coefficients greater than 0.8 will be considered to represent strong correlation, 0.6-0.79 to represent moderate correlation, 0.4-0.59 to reflect fair correlation and less than 0.4 to represent poor or no correlation. Repeatability will be determined using Bland-Altman plots. Responsiveness will be analysed by calculating the effect size.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients with stable respiratory disease will be assessed twice, separated by one week. Patients who have a respiratory exacerbation will be assessed at commencement of treatment of the exacerbation and 4 weeks later. </timepoint>

Because there are no data in cystic fibrosis on which to base sample size calculations, both phases of the study will use a sample of convenience, namely patients attending the Royal Adelaide Hospital Cystic Fibrosis Service. Currently, there are approximately 120 patients attending this service and it is hoped that a sample of 100 participants will participate in the reliability and validity phase of the study. This will provide sufficient data to evaluate the measurement properties of the questionnaires in those with mild, moderate and severe cystic fibrosis lung disease. The responsiveness phase will aim to recruit all patients who meet the eligibility criteria between January and June 2015. Whilst there are no current data available to indicate how many patients received new oral, inhaled or intravenous antibiotics within our service over a similar time period, we believe that it should be possible to recruit at least 20 patients.</statisticalmethods>
