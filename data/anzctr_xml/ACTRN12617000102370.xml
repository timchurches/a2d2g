    <interventions>This single-centre study enrolling up to 16 healthy, non-immune men and women aged 18 to 55 years, This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study comprising two cohorts of eight participants each. Participants will visit the clinical research unit (CRU) where they will be randomized within each cohort to receive tafenoquine or placebo in a 6:2 ratio. The participant, Investigator, clinic staff and laboratory conducting the qPCR and PK endpoint assessment will be blinded to this randomization. Tafenoquine will be administered as one 200 mg dose per day (oral tablet) for three consecutive days (loading doses; Days 1-3) given after the participants normal breakfast. This will be followed by another 200 mg base dose (oral tablet) 7 days later given after the participants normal breakfast (Day 10). Participants will then be inoculated with erthrocytes containing viable ~2,800 viable P. falciparum parasites on Day 13 to assess the schizonticidal activity of tafenoquine against early blood stage infection. After inoculation, participants will be followed up regularly for safety assessments, clinical evaluation, PK sampling, and sampling for qPCR monitoring of malaria infection. All participants will receive a standard course of therapy with Riamet (Registered Trademark) (artemether 20mg/lumefantrine 120mg) tablets for oral use (4 tablets 12 hourly for 3 days) on Day 32 or earlier in the event of failure of TQ to inhibit uncontrolled parasite growth, or at the discretion of the Investigator. If required for clearance of gametocytes, Primacin (Trademark) (primaquine) 45 mg will also be administered as a single oral dose at the time of Riamet (Registered Trademark) treatment. An End of Study (EOS) visit will occur on Day 34. Each participant will participate in only one cohort.  Participants will begin the Riamet (Registered Trademark) while at the clinic and will be then be contacted by telephone every day to ensure they continue the treatment course for 3 days. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the control group will receive matching placebo tablets (oral microcellulose tablets 200mg) and all other treatments are identical to the intervention group is inoculation, malaria rescue treatment etc. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies suggest that tafenoquine is an effective antimalarial, acting against both Plasmodium liver stages and subsequent asexual blood stages, although it is difficult to determine the contribution of each activity to the overall prophylatic effect of tafenoquine. Both activites would be important as any parasites that escape killing in the liver would need to be killed at the subsequent asexual blood stage. Furthermore, there was a paucity of observed P. falciparumin fections in non-immune participants during Study 033 (Nasveld 2010). Therefore, confirmation of blood parasite activity separate to any liver activity is warranted in a non-immune population to confirm the findings of the activity tafenoquine demonstrated in semi-immune participants in Africa (Dow 2015).
This Phase Ib study will evaluate the prophylatic activity of a multiple dose regime of tafenoquine against challenge with P. falciparum asexual blood stage parasites in  nonimmune participants. The Induced Blood Stage Malaria (IBSM) challenge model in which healthy non-immune participants are administered ~2,800 viable P. falciparum parasites within red blood cells is well suited to test this hypothesis.  This study will help identify if a single dose of tafenoquine following three loading doses can prevent symptomatic blood stage infection following P. falciparum exposure.
This study will also enable characterisation of the exposure-response relationship for
tafenoquine and will also provide data regarding the safety and tolerability of tafenoquine in a controlled disease-like setting.</summary>
