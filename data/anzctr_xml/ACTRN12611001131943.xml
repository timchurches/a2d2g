  <interventions>
    <interventions>The percutaneous revascularization of native coronary arteries exhibiting stenotic lesion(s) using a novel sirolimus-eluting cobalt chromium stent with bioerodable drug carrier delivered via fixed-wire catheter system is similar to current stenting procedures.  Depending on difficulty of lesion treatment, procedures, typcially under conscious sedation, take between 30 and 90 minutes and are conducted in the cardiology cath lab.  A small puncture in the groin or arm provides arterial access to place a stent in the heart using x-ray fluoroscopy for visualization during the procedure.  Ususally this is a one-time procedure; however, some patients experience re-clogging of the target artery and have to return for reinitervention.</interventions>

7. Myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the index procedure, with the exception of:
a. Patients who have had a STEMI and PCI to the culprit lesion may be included if they have a suitable lesion in another vessel, and have been clinically and hemodynamically stable for 72 hours;
b. Patients who have had a non- STEMI may be included if their CK is within the laboratory normal range within 24 hours pre-procedure.

21. Target  vessel is excessively tortuous or has heavy calcification;

22. Significant ( greater than 50%) stenosis proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require revascularization or impede run off;

23. Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft;

24. Ostial target lesion (within 5.0mm of vessel origin) or any location within the left main coronary artery;
