  <interventions>
    <interventions>Nasal saline spray administered at least 4 times per day in addition to usual care (excluding other nasal decongestants) until resolution of symptoms (considered the first day they are no longer troublesome and participants answer "yes" to the question "Are you well again?") or for 6 weeks, whichever comes first.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care only (excluding other nasal decongestants). Usual care is likely to consist of a combination of common treatments available to relieve symptoms of common cold. These include, but are not limited to, cough lozenges, cough syrup, antibiotics, analgesics, honey and lemon, salt water gargling, rest, intake of fluids etc. Participants will be asked to indicate on their patient diary the treatments they have used each day until resolution of symptoms or for 6 weeks, whichever comes first.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of days until the return of wellness, indicated by the patient's assessment of the first day of wellbeing. Patients will be asked to fill in a patient diary at the end of each day to indicate the severity of their symptoms that day and answer the question "Are you well again?".</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days to resolution of symptoms or 6 weeks from day of enrolment in the study, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severity and duration of troublesome nasal stuffiness or rhinorrhea, cough, or malaise. This will be assessed via patient self-report on the severity of symptoms each day on a 4 point scale (0=Normal/not present, 1=Slight problem, 2=Moderate, 3=Severe).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days to resolution or 6 weeks from day of enrolment in the study, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>antibiotic use - participants will indicate each day on their patient diary whether they took antibiotics that day.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Days to resolution or 6 weeks from day of enrolment in the study, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>acceptabilty and feasibility of study processes to patients, general practitioners and practice nurses.  Patient satisfaction with their involvement in the study and, for the nasal saline group, use of the study medication, will be assessed at the time of the final follow-up phone call by asking for patient feedback. GPs and practice staff will similarly be asked to indicate satisfaction with their participation in the study in a telephone or face-to-face conversation.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>patients &gt;= 2 years of age presenting to a participating General Practitioner (GP) with common cold with symptoms of runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, cough, lethargy etc, or acute rhinosinusitus.

Any patient who, subsequent to the recruitment consultation, receives a positive identification of pertussis infection (Whooping Cough) will be excluded from the study.</exclusivecriteria>
