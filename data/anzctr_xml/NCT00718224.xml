  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Semuloparin sodium
Treatment: drugs - Enoxaparin
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Semuloparin - Semuloparin sodium 20 mg (10 mg if Severe Renal Impairment [SRI]) once daily for 7-10 days with an initial dose given 8 hours after surgery
To maintain the blind, placebo for Enoxaparin sodium:
12 and 24 hours after surgery, then once daily if no SRI
12 hours after surgery only if SRI

Active Comparator: Enoxaparin - Enoxaparin sodium 30 mg twice daily (20 mg once daily if Severe Renal Impairment [SRI]) for 7-10 days with an initial dose given 12 hours after surgery
Placebo for Semuloparin sodium 8 hours after surgery to maintain the blind


Treatment: drugs: Semuloparin sodium
0.3 mL (0.2 mL if SRI) solution in ready-to-use 0.5 mL pre-filled syringe
Subcutaneous injection

Treatment: drugs: Enoxaparin
0.3 mL (0.2 mL if SRI) solution in ready-to-use 0.5 mL pre-filled syringe
Subcutaneous injection

Treatment: drugs: Placebo

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Venous Thromboembolism Event (VTE) or All-cause Death - VTE included any proximal or distal Deep Vein Thrombosis [DVT] (symptomatic or not) and non-fatal Pulmonary Embolism [PE] as confirmed by a Central Independent Adjudication Committee [CIAC] after central and blind review of mandatory bilateral venograms and diagnostic tests for VTE.
All-cause deaths included fatal PE and deaths for other reason than PE.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 10 days after surgery or the day of mandatory venography, whichever came first</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced "Major" VTE or All-cause Death - "major" VTE included any proximal DVT, symptomatic distal DVT and non-fatal PE as confirmed by the CIAC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 10 days after surgery or the day of mandatory venography, whichever came first</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced Clinically Relevant Bleedings - Bleedings were centrally and blindly reviewed by the CIAC and classified as:
"major" (fatal, in a critical area/organ, causing a post-operative drop in hemoglobin =2 g/dL or requiring post-operative transfusion =2 units of blood, leading to an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention, or associated with circulatory decompensation);
"clinically relevant non-major" (skin hematoma or epistaxis requiring surgical/medical intervention/treatment, macroscopic hematuria, or overt bleeding requiring specific attention by healthcare professional);
"Non-clinically relevant bleeding".</outcome>
      <timepoint>From first study drug injection up to 3 days after last study drug injection</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Required the Initiation of Curative Anticoagulant or Thrombolytic Treatment After VTE Assessment - Initiation of curative anticoagulant or thrombolytic treatment after VTE assessment was defined from investigator's answer to the question "was the subject treated for VTE?" asked after the diagnostic tests for suspected VTE and after the mandatory venography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization up to 10 days after surgery or the day of mandatory venography, whichever came first</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of Semuloparin sodium (AVE5026) with
      Enoxaparin for the prevention of Venous Thromboembolic Events [VTE] in patients undergoing
      elective knee replacement surgery.

      The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety of AVE5026 in patients undergoing
      elective knee replacement surgery, and to document AVE5026 exposure in this population.</summary>
