  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) in medical, surgical, anaesthetic and intensive care departments.. Patients or substitute decision makers (if appropriate) will have their PICCs secured with one of the following randomly assigned dressings and securements:
Arm 1: Tissue Adhesive (TA) is a medical grade 'superglue' (cyanoacrylate) used mainly to close skin lacerations/wounds as an alternative to sutures and staples. A bordered polyurethane dressing will also be applied.
Arm 2: Combined securement and dressing product: extra-reinforced borders, with an absorbent layer around the polyurethane claimed to wick moisture away from the wound. A chlorhexidine-impregnated disc will also be used.
Arm 3: An absorbent polyurethane dressing:  a tri-layer dressing made up of a low adherent wound contact layer, a lattice shaped absorbent pad and a top film that is waterproof and is coated with a water-based adhesive. A chlorhexidine-impregnated disc is also to be used.
Arm 4 (Control): Sutureless Stabilisation Device (SSD) have a large adhesive padded footplate with locking clasp made of hard plastic. SSD are used in addition to polyurethane dressing and a chlorhexidine-impregnated disc. 

The randomly allocated dressing will be applied until completion of therapy, hospital discharge or at four dressing changes. The dressing will be applied at PICC insertion and then changed every 7 days, or on disruption of the dressing integrity.</interventions>

    <concealment>The research nurse (ReN) will screen patients daily (screening log kept), gain informed consent, and perform randomisation. The ReN will have the study products in pre-packs and liaise closely with the ordering and inserting surgeon. All elligible patients (or their representative) will be approached for written informed consent by the ReN or inserter. If this is given, the staff member use a centralised web-based randomisation service. Allocation is fully concealed until the patient is randomised.</concealment>

    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All randomised patients will be analysed by intention to treat, regardless of treatment received. The patient is the unit of measurement with one PICC per patient.

Feasibility outcomes will be described using descriptive statistics including mean, median, range, IQR, counts and percentages. Comparability of groups at baseline will be assessed using clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of PICC and dressing failure per
100 devices and per 1,000 device days with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will summarise the impact of each dressing, and to test difference between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare PICC failure over time. Secondary endpoints including dwell-time, costs, dislodgement, occlusion, breakage, patient/staff
satisfaction scores and adverse events will be compared between groups using parametric/nonparametric techniques as appropriate.

 Data will be exported into STATA. Prior to analysis, data cleaning of outlying figures, missing, and implausible data will be undertaken, and a random 5% sample of source data rechecked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will
be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes to assess for effect on overall results. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.

Sample size and study power: This is a pilot study to gain information to prepare for an efficacy trial. Forty participants per study arm will be recruited - totaling 160 participants.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adults admitted to an acute care facility frequently require the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for the administration of medication and fluids. These PICCs are associated with a high rate of failure, including PICC-related bloodstream infection (BSI). In order to prevent failure, dressings, such as bordered polyurethane (BPU) and sutureless securement devices (SSD), are used to protect the PICC insertion site from contamination. Additional securement devices, such as sutures, are used to reduce movement of the catheter.
New products, including tissue adhesive (TA), absorbent dressings, and combined  securement and dressing products (CSD), are available to clinicians to provide securement and dressings for PICC. It is not known whether these new products are effective at reducing PICC failure and complication, in comparison to standard care.

The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the feasibility of launching a full-scale efficacy trial, using pre-defined feasibility criteria for recruitment, retention and protocol fidelity. The secondary aim is to compare the effectiveness of dressings and securement products on PICC failure and complication due to infection, occlusion, dislodgement, thrombosis, or breakage, for adults with PICC in acute care.</summary>
