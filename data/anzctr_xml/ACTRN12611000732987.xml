    <interventions>Arm One: HELPing Mealtime Behaviour 
Type of intervention:  One-on-one behaviour modification therapy.
Delivery of intervention: To be run in individual sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or run twice daily over 1 week (intensive schedule).
Description of Intervention: Involves providing a verbal prompt to encourage consumption of spoonfuls of new food/s , with positive reinforcement (verbal and/or with toys etc), upon consumption of these foods. Parents initially observe from behind a one-way mirror and assist in collecting information about the behaviours they are observing in their child. As sessions continue, parents are transitioned into the room, and are trained to offer new foods and provide positive reinforcement by the end of the therapy block. 

Arm Two: HELPing Mealtime Experience
Type of Intervention: Small group sensory desensitisation therapy
Delivery of intervention: Run in small group sessions for 1 hour per week over 10 weeks (weekly schedule) or twice daily for 1 week (intensive schedule). 
Involves the child being exposed to gradually more challenging modelling and play with food (based on a sensory heirarchy of look&gt;touch&gt;smell&gt;taste). Parents initially observe the sessions from behing a one-way mirror with a second therapist and assist in observing transitions and reactions in their children.  As the block continues, parents are rotated in and out of the room to assist in modeling play using the sensory hierarchy (i.e. 1 parent and primary therapist in room; 1 parent and secondary therapist outside of room). 

Arm Three: HELPing Mealtime Knowledge.
Type of intervention: Parent education regarding nutrition and behaviour management.
Delivery of Intervention: This is a parents only intervention. In groups of 6, parents are provided with a 3 hour education session regarding general nutrition and behaviour management, and will receive 2 hours of follow-up phone calls during the duration of the 10 week block. This form of intervention is not able to be run in an intensive model and will therefore only be offered in this format.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a natural control group who is on the wait-list to receive therapy. Following assessment, and in determining eligibility for intervention, these children will either be offered input via an intensive schedule (as described above) or during a subsequent 10-week block. As recruitment for this study will occur in an ongoing fashion, there will be multiple opportunities to access therapy if it is not immediately available.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adequacy of diet and overall increase in dietary variety

Assessed via 3-day weighed food diary, Modified Children's Dietary Questionnaire (Margarey et al., 1999),  and a Food Frequency Questionnaire. In addition to this, there will be a New Foods List where parents indicate, in an ongoing fashion, how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances or rejections.</outcome>

Measured via Behaviour Paediatrics Feeding Assessment (Adapted from Crist et al., 2001), and self-developed HELP study: Eating Skills and Behaviour Questionnaire.

Measured via Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (Revised) (Eyberg, 1994). A video-tape is taken of the parent interacting with their child in a non-food related activity, a parent offering their child a preferred food and the parent offering their child a non-preferred food. All videos will be rated externally by the team psychologist who will not be working directly with the children involved.</outcome>

    <concealment>Sealed envelopes containing three stratified participant numbers will be developed using a random number generator before enrolment commences. This box will be kept under the control of a blinded colleague who will not have direct contact with any of the participants. An intake questionnaire is completed on contact with the parents' to determine eligibility. Parents provide written consent for their child to participate in the study if they are eligible. After initial assessment is booked with the principal investigator, the participants will then be allocated a number as per their order of enrolment. Assessment will need to be completed with a minimum of 3 participants before treatment can begin.</concealment>
    <sequence>As per above, sealed envelopes containing three (because one arm needs to operate in at least small groups of three), participants will be developed before intervention commences.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of three feeding intervention programs for children recovering from cancer with feeding difficulties and/or restricted oral intake. 
Who is it for? Children can join this study if they are aged between 1 and 6 years, are stable and/or in their maintenance phase of treatment for cancer, and have a feeding difficulty and/or restricted range of oral intake (e.g. limited range of foods, prolonged mealtime duration, problematic behaviour at mealtimes, parent stress related to mealtimes). 
Trial details: Participants of this trial will be offered a comprehensive assessment of feeding, general development and nutrition in the first instance. Children identified as eligible, based on these assessments, will be randomly (by chance) divided into one of three groups. Group 1 will undergo an individual child-directed behaviour modification program, Group 2 will undergo small group child-directed sensory desensitisation program, and Group 3 will involve group parent education sessions on general nutrition and behaviour management for children with feeding difficulties. Treatment will be offered in weekly sessions for a 10 week block (10 sessions). Participants who are unable to commit for weekly intervention for 10 weeks will be offered the opportunity to be placed on a wait list for intensive intervention (10 sessions in 1 week).  Assessments will be conducted at baseline, immediately post treatment, and 3 months post treatment to determine the impact of the programs on dietary variety, overall nutrition, maladaptive behaviours and parent stress.</summary>
