  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Clinical Stability (Kaplan-Meier Estimate) - Time to clinical stability was summarized overall and for individual clinical signs for each treatment group using the method of Kaplan Meier. Subjects who did not experience clinical stability were censored at the date of their last non-missing assessment during the study (whether this assessment occurred as an inpatient or as an outpatient).</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Scores of Symptoms of Influenza - Descriptive statistics for the change from baseline in each of the 7 symptoms of influenza (cough; sore throat; nasal congestion; myalgia [aches and pains]; headache; feverishness; and fatigue, each graded on a 4-point severity scale [0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe]) were tabulated by treatment group. Missing data were excluded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 14</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Resumption of Ability to Perform Usual Activities (Kaplan-Meier Estimate) - Changes in each subject's ability to perform usual activities as determined from the visual analog scale (0 to 10, where 0 indicated subject was unable to perform usual activities at all and 10 indicated subject was able to perform all usual activities fully) were summarized by study visit and treatment group. The time to resumption of a subject's ability to perform usual activities was estimated using the method of Kaplan Meier. Subjects who did not return to the pre-study level of performance of usual activities were censored at the time of their last assessment. (Note: N is the number of ITTI participants with available data).</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of Clinical Relapse of Influenza After Treatment (Number of Participants Experiencing Relapse During the Study) - The number of subjects with clinical relapse, defined as changes in 2 or more signs of clinical stability to values outside the range of normalization criteria for a duration of at least 12 consecutive hours after clinical stability had been attained, were summarized by treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Hospital Discharge (Kaplan-Meier Estimate) - Time to discharge from hospital was estimated using the method of Kaplan Meier. Subjects who were not discharged from the hospital were censored at the time of their last assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>14 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Amount of Influenza Virus in Nose and Throat (Influenza A and B Combined) - Reduction in viral shedding, assessed as the change in quantitative viral titers and defined as the time-weighted change from baseline in TCID50/mL, was summarized for each treatment group.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours</timepoint>

    <summary>This study has been designed as a randomized, double-blind, controlled, study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two once daily intravenous peramivir regimens (200 mg and 400 mg)
      versus oral oseltamivir phosphate (75 mg twice daily) in hospitalized subjects with acute
      serious or potentially life threatening influenza. Study treatments will be provided for up
      to 5 consecutive days.</summary>
