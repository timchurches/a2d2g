Experimental: Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy - Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR)
Treatment schedule 1: 26 Gray (Gy) in 1 fraction, for tumours of less than or equal to 4cm in size.
Treatment schedule 2: 42 Gray (Gy) in 3 fractions, for tumours of greater than 4cm in size


Treatment: other: SABR
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is conventionally considered "radioresistant" to fully fractionated EBRT. In an effort to overcome the perceived "radioresistance" of RCC, severely hypofractionated External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in the form of stereotactic radiotherapy will be used in the management of renal cell carcinoma with radiotherapy.
