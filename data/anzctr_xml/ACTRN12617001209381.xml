  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study focus on improving the coparenting experience between parent and grandparents in the Asian family context. The target of this intervention are Vietnamese parents who having some sort of conflict with the grandparents regarding grandchild care. 

Group Triple P plus the Building Coparenting Alliance module has been chosen as the intervention to be used in this study. The entire program consists of nine sessions, of which, 5 sessions occur in the group context. These 5 sessions will be divided into 2 all-day training blocks; each block will be administered once per week for 2 weeks. The other four sessions occur through phone call consultations (15-30 mins each) in every 5 days post intervention. The 5 in-group sessions focused on providing parents skills and strategies needed to manage their children behaviors as well as skills and strategies to manage their relationship with the grandparents . The other four follow-up phone calls were designed to help families tailor the program to the family needs. 

Parents will be provided with Group Triple P workbook and handouts, all in Vietnamese and the program will be delivered in Vietnamese by the principle researcher of this project who was trained and certified with Group Triple P and is fluently in Vietnamese language. 

Parents in the intervention group will receive intervention in late 2017 (ideal October). Waitlist group will receive a Triple P intervention after the six-month follow up assessment.

    <concealment>The participants will be mainly selected from the pool of 250 parents took part in the project’s survey in Feb-April 2017 who indicated that they would like to participate in this training program. Also, advertising will be posted on researcher’s facebook and her network in order to catch attention from other parents who had not had a chance to participate in our previous survey. Any new register is welcomed. 
All of the parents will receive a screening survey from project to confirm their eligibility. Only parents that meet study requirements will be selected to participate.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the effect of improved intergenerational coparenting relationship in Vietnamese families whose parents participate in a parenting support program.
Throughout this intervention, it is expected that families whose parents receive the Triple P program will report significant increase in parents' skills and confidence to communicate with grandparents about childcare disagreement; significant increases in parenting confidence and the use of effective parenting techniques; improvements in parental psychological well-being, less symptoms of child emotional and behavioural problems.
This study will offer a unique contribution to the understanding of the efficacy of a parenting program in building a cooperative and nurturing parenting environment for the child's development where multi-adults share childcare. </summary>
