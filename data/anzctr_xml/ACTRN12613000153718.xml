  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chronic prostatitis-Chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS)patients in II, IIIa and IIIb categories according to NIDDK (NIH) classification, investigated for sperm abnormalities and correlation of these abnormalities with DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) determinated by TUNEL technique
TUNEL is a common method for detecting DNA fragmentation that results from apoptotic signaling cascades. The assay relies on the presence of nicks in the DNA which can be identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase or TdT, an enzyme that will catalyze the addition of dUTPs that are secondarily labeled with a marker. It may also label cells that have suffered severe DNA damage. This examination is going to be performed the 3-5 days after the first clinical examination
Every patient is going to be observed for 7-10 days, time necessary to have the final results of the sperm culture, urine analysis and culture, spermogram, and estimation of DNA fragmantation Index.</interventions>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Categorization of the patients in the various categories of chronic prostatitis
(Categories II, IIIA and IIIB by NIH (NIDDK)).
   Category II: Chronic bacterial prostatitis
   Category III: Chronic abacterial prostatitis
                   - IIIA infiammatory
                   - IIIB non infiammatory 
                  (with the present or not of infiammatory cells in
                    the prostatic fluid)

These parameters are going to be assessed by:
Urine analysis and urine culture before and after massage of the prostate in assotiation with semen culture.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Urine analysis and urine culture before and after prostate massage are going to be examined during the first examination.
Semen culture are going to be examined the day after the first clinical examination.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The level of the patients fertility.
This is going to be assessed by Spermogram
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sperm for Spermogram are going to be selected after 3 days absence of sexual activity. 
This exam is going to be done once.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of the symptoms duration and the level of the fertility</outcome>
      <timepoint>The last day (5th or 7th day) after the evaluation of all the laboratory exams </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    <summary>The aim of our study is to identify each of the three categories of CPPS II, IIIA and IIIB patients according to NIDDK (NIH) classification, to investigate their sperm DFI and to correlate it with potential abnormalities in their sperm, with the DFI of general and infertile men population, thus  to provide useful informations for potential association of CPPS and male infertlity.</summary>
