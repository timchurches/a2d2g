  <interventions>
    <interventions>A total number of approximately 100 pregnant cases will be included in this prospective study. Subjects will be divided into 2 arms according to their urinary ultrasonographic findings between 24-36th week of their pregnancies. Pelvic-calyceal complex in millimeters from leading edge to leading edge, in two dimensions less than 5mm will be included in control arm, whereas dimensions between 5-15mm will be included in study arm as mild hydronephrosis cases. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) excretion and other renal functions will be determined on the day of ultrasonography.

Group sample sizes of 43 and 43 achieve 90% power to detect a difference of -50.0 between the
null hypothesis that both group means are 50.0 and the alternative hypothesis that the mean of
group 2 is 100.0 with known group standard deviations of 50.0 and 100.0 and with a significance

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a 25 kDa protein of the lipocalin superfamily. NGAL was identified in neutrophils and is expressed in many tissues,
including adipocytes, bone marrow, uterus, stomach, colon, lung, liver, and kidney. This is especially seen in response to renal tubular injury, and NGAL appears so rapidly in the urine and serum that it is useful as an early biomarker of renal failure. 
Objective of the study is to assess the renal functions and urinary NGAL levels in pregnants with or without mild maternal hydronephrosis. Approximately 100 subjects will be included in this study. Cases with mild hydronephrosis will be included as study group and remaining normal subjects will be included as control group. Urinary NGAL levels and other renal functions will be compared between groups using statistical methods following completion of all medical records.</summary>
