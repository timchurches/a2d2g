  <interventions>
    <interventions>A trial of an active hearing conservation device for and its applicability for use with professional orchestral musicians.  The device is worn in both ears within a custom-moulded soft silicone shell and is easily insertable/removable by the musician.
The study will be undertaken both with musicians working in the field during their normal playing activities and under controlled conditions, allowing both subjective and objective assessment.  Subjects wearing the device are requested to use the device at least once during each program their orchestra undertakes during the four week trial.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: device is effective at reducing sound to a safe level while still allowing most (&gt;70% of sample) musicians to work to a professional standard.  

Outcomes will be assessed through interview, a series of brief (non-validated) questionnaires (3) and a usage log completed by each subject.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Questionnaires will be distributed at the commencement of the trial, at two weeks and again at the conclusion of the trial.  Interviews will take place two weeks into the trial.

Completion of project will occur one year from trial commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device is capable of delivering undistorted sound to the ear in a non-linear fashion.
This outcome will be assessed using a combination of standard audiological 'real-ear' insertion loss techniques and coupler/test box based assessments.  Results will be compared to   manufacturer's claims.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be assessed in a selection (6) of participants at the commencement of the trial.

This outcome will be completed three months from commencement of trial.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project involves an investigation amongst noise-exposed professional orchestral musicians into the usability of an electronic hearing protection device.  The device is specifically designed for musicians and apparently capable of delivering hi-fidelity sound to the ear at a level that will protect the wearer from noise-induced hearing loss in a performance or rehearsal setting. Twenty-four musicians selected from two professional orchestras will be fitted with the device and be closely monitored for both their reaction to and their use of the device over a period of four weeks during at-risk activities.  The actual attenuation provided by the device will be determined in each subject using standard audiological test techniques.  The device will also be subjected to laboratory testing to determine if manufacturers claims of attenuation and fidelity are reproducible.</summary>
