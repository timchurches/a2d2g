  <interventions>
    <interventions>Particpants will be randomly allocated to one of four treatment groups.
Group 1 will receive daily subcutaneous (s/c) injections of saline (placebo) for 4 days.
Group 2 will receive daily s/c injections of superactive GnRH analog (Lucrin 1mg) for 4 days.
Group 3 will receive daily s/c injections of Lucrin 1mg for 4 days and concurrent administration of 100mg injectable testosterone (T) esters to supress endogenous leutenising hormone (LH) and T production.
Group 4  will receive daily s/c injections of Lucrin 1mg for 4 days and concurrent administration of nandrolone decanoate 100mg to supress endogenous LH and T production.
Blood and urine samples will be collected from all particpants at intervals from 0 for up to 14 days.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 1 (placebo group) will receive s/c saline injection in place of s/c Lucrin.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sports anti-doping study. The aim of this study is to see what effects on testosterone an injection of a synthetic hormone called GnRH analog has.  GnRH analogs are banned in elite sports as they are considered to enhance an athletes performance by increasing the bodies production of testosterone. In this study blood and urine specimens will be collected from healthy male volunteers who have been given  several injections a GnRH analog.  Some of the volunteers  will also  be given an injection of testosterone or a drug called nandrolone.  These three drugs are all banned in elite athletes, but it is thought that they may be being used in combination illicitly.
Some of the volunteers will recieve injections of saline only given as a placebo, this allows us to compare the results with those of the volunteers receiving the drugs.
The blood and urine samples taken from the volunteers (before and after the injections) will be analysed  to see what effects they have on hormone levels, and will be used to help develop a test to detect the use of GnRH anaolgs by elite athletes.</summary>
