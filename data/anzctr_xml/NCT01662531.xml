  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incremental Recovery Following a Single Intravenous Dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP or Previous FIX Product - Incremental recovery (IU/dL/IU/kg) is defined as the FIX activity (IU/dL) obtained 30 minutes following infusion, per dose of (IU/kg) infusion. FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method. Recovery values were baseline-corrected for pre-infusion plasma FIX activity. Incremental recovery was measured following a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP on Day 1. Analysis of previous FIX product was conducted at the beginning of the study in a subset of subjects who had no historical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of their previous FIX product. For the PK assessment, the previous FIX product was administered by IV infusion after approximately 4 days following the last FIX treatment, prior to any dosing of rIX-FP. The formal PK population consisted of subjects who received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP for PK assessment and for whom a sufficient number of analyzable PK samples had been obtained to permit the evaluation of the PK profile of rIX-FP.</outcome>

      <outcome>Half-life (t1/2) Following a Single Intravenous Dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP or Previous FIX Product - FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method. FIX levels were not corrected for baseline values.</outcome>
