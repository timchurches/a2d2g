  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cemented hemiarthroplasty. This operation is to be performed through a Rorabeck Modification of the Hardinge Approach. The  conjoined tendon of Vastus Lateralis and Gluteus removed in continuity with the capsule from anterior of Gt. Trochanter. An anterior superior capsulotomy is then performed with an incision directly along the line of the Femoral neck. Cementing is to be performed with second generation technique including Simplex cement with antibiotic mixed in a bowl and poured into insertion gun. Lavage and cement plug should be inserted prior. The cement shopuld be  inserted retrograde and major pressurization avoided. Anteversion should be camparable to native anteversion and offset measured from digital xray prior to surgery. The stem insertion amount should also be measured prior to procedure during the templating process.

This intervention takes approximately one hour of surgical time</interventions>

    <concealment>All patients presenting to Auckland Hospital requiring hemiarthroplasty will be offered entry into the trial. 
After appropriate consent the patients will be randomised to either a cemented or a uncemented Hemiarthroplasty by a numbered opaque envelope opened in the operating room.  Each patient then discussed with trial supervisor by telephone to ensure sequence followed.

Followup will be at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following surgery. At each follow up the patient will be seen and assessed by an experienced orthopaedic research nurse blinded to the initial procedure.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip fracture is a very common presentation to hospital. The patient group is elderly and is associated with a long hospital stay often requiring extensive rehabilitation. Many of these patients suffer significant pain and disability following fracture and as a consequence of this are unable to return to their previous residence incurring significant cost increase associated with a higher level of care.
This study has the potential to improve the outcome of these patients, reduce costly time in hospital and the requirement for further care following discharge related to reduced mobility.
If either cemented or uncemented hemiarthroplasty is shown to improve pain control and increase mobility this will significantly improve outcome for these patients.</summary>
