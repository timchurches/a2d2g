  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine if some women with early breast cancer can avoid radiotherapy treatment after breast surgery. If radiotherapy treatment can be omitted without there being any more than a very small risk of the cancer coming back in the same breast, more women may be able to avoid radiotherapy in the future. This means that these women would avoid 5 weeks of daily radiotherapy and the possible short term side effects; including, fatigue, skin redness, discomfort. Radiotherapy is associated with long term side effects which also may be avoided: discomfort in the breast, thickening of breast tissue, and very occasionally possible lung problems (pneumonitis and lung scarring), heart problems and a very small risk of radiation-induced cancer.

Who is it for?
This study is for women with early breast cancer that must be positive for the oestrogen receptor and/or progesterone receptor and/or human epidermal growth factor receptor. Prior to entering the main study, patients must have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. All treatment is standard treatment except that radiotherapy after surgery to remove the breast cancer will not be given.

Trial Details
The study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to select women with early breast cancer for whom radiotherapy is not needed because the risk of a local recurrence (cancer coming back in the same area) is low. We are investigating whether the abnormalities found by MRI are in fact the reason that local recurrence sometimes occurs, so if nothing is found on MRI, radiotherapy may not be required.</summary>
