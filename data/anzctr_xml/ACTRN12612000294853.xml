    <interventions>120 infertility patients  randomly divided in two groups. Highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophine(menopur) 150IU once a day was given to first group, recombinant FSH(Gonal F)150IU once a day was given to second group for IVF/ICSI cycles.These drugs were given every day subcutaneously, beginning from third day of menstrual cycle up to the day that two or more follicles greater than 17mm in diameter were seen by ultrasonography</interventions>

    <summary>Objective: Our aims were to compare hpHMG and rFSH for the duration of treatment, doses of the drugs used , the number of oocytes retrieved,  the number of embryos obtained and hormonal status of the  patients  during ovarian stimulation.
Material &amp; methods: 120 infertility patients  were recruited and randomly divided into two groups.First group used hpHMG , other group used rFSH for ovulation induction before IVF.  Long protocol GnRH agonist was started at 21st day of stimulation.Transvaginal ultrasonography was performed at third and eighth day of the cycle, if ovarian cyst &gt; 20 mm was not exist, stimulation was started. Blood samples were taken at third and eighth day of the cycle , for  serum levels of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), androstenedione (A), free testosterone (fT) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S).When two or more follicles greater than 17 mm were observed, 10.000 IU HCG was applied inramuscularly. Follicles were collected after 36 hours from the HCG injection by transvaginal USG, using 17 gauge needles.Endometrial thickness was recorded. Aspiration of each follicle 10 millimeters and above was made. Blood samples were taken again at the day of follicle aspiration day for hormonal evaluation. All blood samples were sentrifuged and plasma was extracted immediately, and stored at '-20C'.</summary>
