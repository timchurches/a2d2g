    <interventions>The intervention will be implemented over 12 weeks, post-intervention will assessment will be at 12 weeks and follow-up assessment will be completed at 26 weeks. 

The Watermemories Swimming Club (WSC) is an established aquatic exercise intervention designed by a team which includes a gerontological exercise physiologist and dementia experts. This intervention targets resistance, balance, flexibility and aerobic training, and includes a warm up and cool down phase. Exercises include walking, marching and weight transfer, lower and upper body resistance activities. Following each session the intervention has a time allowance of up to 15 minutes for free swimming so participants can engage in laps, playing or relaxing. Specific exercises can be tapered to cater for both group and individual capacity. Sessions are delivered by experienced swimming instructors and in-pool assistants trained in the intervention delivery.

The Watermemories aquatic exercise intervention is designed to increase physical activity, improve health as well as enhance social, BPSD and affective outcomes. The need to increase physical activity in people with dementia is straight-forward. The beauty of swimming is that not only is accessible, simple, measurable, safe, non-invasive, inexpensive and enjoyable but it addresses the adverse physical effects of inactivity as well as having a significant impact on BPSD, psychological distress, anxiety and depression.

Water is a supportive environment ideal for people with arthritis and at risk of falls and importantly, offers resistance to maintain exercise progression and intensity. From the perspective of person-centered care, it is appropriate for people who have a history of aquatic exercise, or do not like, or are unable to partake in, common alternatives such as gym exercise, walking, dancing or gardening. 

Adults in facilities participating in the WSC intervention will partake in the WSC program, after receiving consent from a substitute decision-maker and medical clearance from a GP. The program involves twice-weekly, 45 minute sessions over a 12 week period. 

Adults will be accompanied in the pool by trained volunteers. In addition, the pool will have at least one life guard on duty and an exercise physiologist will regularly attend sessions to assist with supervision. A maximum of 10 adults with dementia will attend each session. At the beginning and conclusion of the 12 week period, all participants will receive physical and psychological assessments. Throughout the intervention period, a weekly attendance list will be generated by each facility so that participant attendance and adherence to the program can be monitored. 

</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with whole of residential care facility (RACF) randomised either to control or intervention. Data will be aggregated and participants in the intervention condition will be compared to participants in the attention control condition. Participants in the control condition will be engaged in activities such as casual conversation, newspaper reading and/or craft activities for an equivalent amount of time over the 12 week period (ie. twice-weekly 45 minute sessions). These social groups will be facilitated by a diversional therapist in a common meeting area in the RACF. Therapeutically-oriented interaction such as reminiscence will be avoided. </comparator>

    <concealment>Clustering will occur at the RACF level with randomisation by necessity occurring at this level in order to prevent contamination of results.  Seven RACFs will be allocated as intervention RACFs and seven as control RACFs.  
Participant enrollment begins with supplying information and meeting with RACF directors, staff, residents, families and medical practitioners to explain the benefits and safety features of the program. All resources to support these sessions have been developed and trialled in our pilot work. Written informed consent will be obtained from the participants or if required, their substitute decision maker, and assent is required from the person with dementia at all times for the duration of the project. Evidence of the participantâ€™s medical fitness is required from their general medical practitioner.  Allocation is not concealed. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed using standard statistical practices and using the SPSS statistical package. Between-groups analyses will be used to compare the WSC intervention group to the control group at baseline, at the conclusion of the 12 week intervention period, and 26 weeks post-intervention. Within-groups analyses will examine whether there are any changes in each group over time. Significance will be set at .05.
Sample size was calculated on the outcome psychological well-being, as measured by Psychological Well-Being in Cognitively Impaired Person (Burgener 1992) during the pilot study. Assuming a mean change between pre- and post-intervention of 4 points with a SD of 4.9 on a 33 point scale (scores range from 11-44). Using Cohens classification of effect size and assuming a moderate effect size, a two-sided p of 0.05 and a power of 80% require 24 participants in intervention and 24 in RACF usual care program. Allowing for a 52% attrition rate, final sample size is n=50 for the intervention group and n=50 for the control group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will determine the effectiveness of a non-pharmacological intervention, aquatic exercise (WSC), designed to reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) compared to an attention control. 

The WSC aims to rekindle positive memories of swimming in people with dementia and get them involved in a safe, regular physical activity. Swimming is an activity that has the capacity to address physical health needs, because it involves exercise; psychological health needs, because it is fun and relaxing; and social health needs, because it involves interactions with other people. 

The WSC is designed for municipal swimming pools that are widely available in Australian communities. A training manual and DVD are available to address safety and incontinence issues and to support feasibility and sustainability.  </summary>
