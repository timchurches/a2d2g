  <interventions>
    <interventions>In obligatory Physical Education (PE) classes, the experimental group will perform dual-task exercises consisting in improving motor functions (activities of daily living) and stimulating righting reactions, working with the same physiotherapists. The programme will comprise dual-task exercises in which on unstable surfaces (stability balls, sensory air cushions ans soft mattresses) participants will perform functional tasks consisting of ADLs (for example: putting on and taking off footwear). The intervention programme will last for 12 weeks, and will include 45-minute training sessions conducted three times per week. Additionally, it will be supplemented by the Kinesio Taping (KT) method during its whole length of 12 weeks. Elastic tapes will be applied according to well established methods by a trained physiotherapist on the sole side of both feet and they should be kept in situ for six days. After this period, a day of rest will be left in between to prevent skin intolerance and KT will be applied again. 
Before commencing the intervention and after 12 weeks, postural balance and foot typology will be assessed in all participants of the project on the BTS P-WALK platform and the quality of gait by means of a G-SENSOR. All measurements will be performed by the same independent researcher.

    <comparator>The controls will participate in obligatory PE classes in the same programme as the experimental group, combining dual-task exercises focused on improving motor functions (activities of daily living) and stimulating righting reactions. The intervention will be conducted individually for 12 weeks and will include 45-minute training sessions conducted three times per week.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Individuals with ID have poor visual and motor coordination, limited precision of movement, inhibition and difficulties in learning new forms of activities. Moreover, disturbed prioprioception and poor spatial orientation considerably decrease the level of static and dynamic balance which is manifested by awkwardness and increases the risk of accidental falls. It has been assumed that the application of elastic tapes on the sole side of the foot will facilitate proprioception and improve the tension of the neighbouring soft tissues. Harmonious cooperation of the muscles stabilizing the foot should beneficially influence the ability to maintain the stable standing position and improve the quality of gait in disabled persons. The intervention will aim to assess the quality of postural balance, gait and foot typology in school children with moderate intellectual disability after the application of kinesio taping for 12 weeks. </summary>
