    <summary>This study will evaluate ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) plus
      ribavirin (RBV) in participants with advanced liver disease or posttransplant and chronic
      genotype 1 or 4 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

        -  Cohort A: decompensated cirrhosis (advanced liver disease), no prior liver transplant;

        -  Cohort B: post-liver transplant, with or without cirrhosis;

        -  Group assignment within cohorts is based on severity of liver impairment at screening
           (Child-Pugh-Turcotte (CPT) score for participants with cirrhosis; fibrosis; or presence
           of disease for fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH) groups)

        -  Randomization is 1:1 within groups to 12 or 24 weeks of LDV/SOF+RBV treatment.</summary>
