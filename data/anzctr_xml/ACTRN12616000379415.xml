    <interventions>Health Wellness Coaching Intervention:
This study will test the effectiveness of Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) for primary prevention of stroke, is particularly relevant to the ageing population where most strokes occur. Participants in this trial will be randomly allocated to the Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) Intervention (n=160) or Usual Care (n=160) over a 9 month period.
The Health Wellness Intervention will be administered 15 x sessions over a 9 month period. The first session will be face to face for approximately  60 minutes, and the remaining sessions  conducted over the phone (30 minutes). The first 12 sessions will be carried out within the first 3 months (weekly or fortnightly depending on the need of the study participant). The 3 remaining session will be carried out 2 months apart at 5, 7 and 9 months)  Trained Health Wellness Coaches (research assistant, post graduate level) will have completed an intensive 6 week course  run by Momentum Coaching Ltd. All participants will complete questionnaires at baseline, 3,6,9 and 12 months. The questionnaire will include  outcome measures including lifes simple 7 (measure diet and lifestyle), PHQ-9 (measure mood), ED-5D-5L (health-related quality of life), Readiness to change measure, MMAS-8 medication adherence Scale. 
 We will be monitoring adherence by logging phone calls, recording all information, duration, frequency of phone calls in the data base. 
HWC is an innovative, structured, patient-focused multi-dimensional psychological intervention designed to motivate participants to adhere to recommended medication and lifestyle changes.
HWC is goal oriented and a health coach can help a person and their family/whanau/supporters identify individual strengths, empowering them to focus on lifestyle-related behaviours that the individual wants to, and can, change. Individuals who receive HWC are shown to have increased perceived health status, medication adherence, and physical activity, with decreases in stress levels.

The participants will be identified through GP practices that use PREDICT or a similar tool for CVD risk calculation. Must be able to converse in english, have not had a previous stroke or heart attack. There is no upper age limit.

    <concealment>Eligible participants will be randomised into HWC or Usual Care groups using the online randomisation process on the ART database. A predetermined algorithm will stratify participants by age, sex, ethnicity and CVD risk score. The CVD risk score would have been obtained at the time of initial participant selection. After randomisation is complete, participants will be informed of their group allocation and requested not to inform the RA conducting the assessments

Allocation concealment will be done by central randomisation  by computer. When  a consented participant  has completed the screening criteria and signed consent, the RA will enter in their details and the computer program will allocate them to either HWC group or Usual Care. The RA will be blinded to the allocation of the allocation.  Only the study manager and HWC Coaches will know.</concealment>

    <summary>Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) for primary stroke and CVD prevention: a randomised control trial.
Aim: to determine the effectiveness of HWC for primary stroke prevention in Maori, Pasifika, Asians and NZ Europeans.
Strokes are the main cause of disease burden in older adults, yet evidence suggests more than 80% of strokes are preventable, with adequate control of modifiable risk factors. This proposal to test the effectiveness of Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) for primary prevention of stroke, is particularly relevant to the ageing population where most strokes occur.
HWC is an innovative, structured, patient-focused multi-dimensional psychological intervention designed to motivate participants to adhere to recommended medication and lifestyle changes. This randomised control trial is being conducted in NZ to address the question: is HWC effective for primary stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention in Maori, Pasifika, Asians and NZ Europeans? The primary outcome is a substantial relative risk reduction of CVD
The projects aligns well with the Ageing Well NSC mission to Enable all New Zealanders to realise the potential of the longevity dividend by testing a means to attenuate the impact of potentially modifiable risk factors for two of the most common and devastating causes of disease burden in the older populations of NZ; stroke and cardiovascular disease. Preventing the occurrence of these conditions will allow individuals and their families to live longer, healthier and more productive lives. If shown to be effective, Health Wellness Coaching will in turn enhance and maintain wellness, independence &amp; autonomy.
Research Question: Is HWC effective for primary stroke and CVD prevention in Maori, Pasifika, Asians and NZ Europeans? The primary outcome is a substantial relative risk reduction (RRR) of CVD in the next 5 years at 9 months post-randomisation. This is defined as a 10% RRR amongst those at moderate 5-year CVD risk (10-15%) and a 25% RRR amongst those at high risk (&gt;15%). Additional outcomes will be to evaluate the effectiveness of HWC on (a) self-reported adherence (self-reported use of anti-platelet, statin and BP lowering therapy as prescribed), (b) self-reported changes in adherence to medication and changes in readiness to change, (c) cardiovascular events (new stroke or coronary heart disease, both fatal or non-fatal), (d) lifestyle changes (e.g., change in physical activity, smoking status, diet pattern etc), using the Lifes simple 7 Health Behaviour scoring system (e) health related quality of life, (f) change in participants expectations of treatment benefits; (g) participant satisfaction, and (h) healthcare resource consumption and cost-effectiveness at 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. 
Intervention: The HWC group will have 15 sessions with HWC coaches, of which 12 will be carried out within the first 3 months of the intervention and the remaining three sessions will be done three months</summary>
