    <interventions>The study design is four-period crossover study (repeated measures design) with two arms. There will be a non-rebreather arm and BVM arm, participants will be randomly allocated to either arm. Each participant will be required to complete four trials of 3-minutes pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen in only one of the arms (mask alone, mask and nasal-prongs, mask and nasal-prongs with leak, mask alone with leak). The simulated leak will be created using 16F nasogastric tube taped to both sides of the mask. At the end of each trial oxygen will be measured by an expiratory breath into an oxygen analyser. This will be followed by a washout period of 2 minutes after which the ETO2 will be remeasured to ensure it is within 1% of the participants baseline.

The sequence of the trials will be randomised in a balanced design.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>The sequence by which the trial are to conducted within each preoxygenation method, for each participant, will by a
balanced Latin-Squares design. This allows the sequence of trials to be randomised, but balanced so that, if one participant was to conduct the trials in a particular order, another participant will perform their trials in the reverse of that order.</designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis will be performed using using the statistical software R (version 3.1.2). Participant demographics will be reported as mean plus or minus standard deviation, whilst non-normal data will be reported as median and interquartile range. Categorical data will be reported as counts and proportions.
The analysis of ETO2 will be completed separately for the NRB and BMV groups. This will be performed using a within-subject repeated measures ANOVA, with ETO2 and then ETCO2 as the dependant variable and method of preoxygenation as the within subjects variable and participant as the between
subjects variable. Planned post-hoc comparisons will use Tukey HSD to identify significant differences
between the trials of preoxygenation. A 2-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
Analysis of the visual analogue scales for breathing comfort will be performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A 2-sided p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
To compare whether there is a difference between the NRB and BMV masks in each condition, an
independent T Test will be conducted if the data are parametric or Mann-Whitney U test if nonparametric
with Bonferroni corrections applied for the number of comparisons. It is planned to only compare preoxygenation methods with their similar conditions. For example, a comparison will be made between BVM+leak+NP and NRB+leak+NP but not BVM+leak+NP to NRB alone.

Two methods were used to calculate the sample size, using the statistical software R (version 3.1.2).
The clinically significant difference we have chosen is an ETO2 of 5%, as this would equate to 30sec of extra apnoea time ([5% x 2400ml] / 250mls/min oxygen consumption) in an 80kg male. This value is consistent with previous research.
The sample size calculated is for each arm, as out primary outcome of interest is whether nasal prongs
increase the value of ETO2 for each preoxygenation method in the presence of a leak.
The pooled standard deviation from previous studies is 6.84. The effect size was calculated as (mean difference / standard deviation) = 0.74.
The above values were applied to a sample size calculation using Cohens method14, with a power of 0.8 and significance of 0.05, and returned a sample size of 26.

As a check of this sample size, a second calculation was made for an independent two-samples t test as this can also be used to calculate sample size for crossover study designs. This returned a sample size of 30 using a significance level of 0.05 and power of 0.8.
In summary a sample size of 30 in each arm will be required for us to detect a 5% ETO2 difference at a
5% significance level with a power of 80%, making a total sample size of 60 participants.
Assuming a drop out rate of 10%, a total of 66 participants will be needed to provide 30 participants for each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aim to measure the adequacy of preoxygenation by NRB and BVM in the abscence and presence of a simulated
mask leak, and whether the addition of oxygen via NP significantly improves preoxygenation in these conditions, as
measured by ETO2.
We propose to perform a four-period crossover study (repeated measures design) with two arms, using healthy
volunteers. There will be a NRB arm and BVM arm. After informed consent participants with be randomised to NRB
and BVM. They will then be randomised to a sequence of 3minutes preoxygenation using the NRB, NRB+NP, NRB
and simulated leak, NRB+NP and simulated leak in the NRB arm; or BVM, BVM+NP, BVM and simulated leak,
BVM+NP and simulated leak in the BVM arm.
ETO2 and endtidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) will be measured using the gas sample analyser on an anaesthetic machine. Participants will also be asked to rate their comfort with each preoxygenation method.</summary>
