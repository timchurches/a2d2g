  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thermal Vapor ablation delivered to target lung areas (Cancerous Lesions).
One dose of 330 calories of energy is delivered to targeted lung lesions (according to a CT guided therapy plan) during a single bronchoscopic procedure prior to lung resection.
Lung resection will then occur according to the standard hospital procedures.  
The first two patients will have lung resection on the same day as the bronchoscopic delivery of Vapor.  Subsequent patients will have lung resection performed up to 3 days post bronchoscopic delivery of vapour.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This feasibility study will determine the local effects of thermal vapour ablation of operable cancer lesions in the lung. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 to 75 years and have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung or metastatic lung cancer suitable for resection. 
Study details: All participants will receive one treatment of thermal vapour ablation via a bronchoscopy procedure before undergoing surgical lung resection within 3 days of the thermal vapour ablation treatment. Resected tissue will be examined to determine effectiveness of treatment. Participants will be followed-up according to standard lung resection procedures.  Official study follow up is completed once the resection occurs but patients will be monitored for Adverse Events in the standard lung resection follow up procedure, in order to determine efficacy, safety and feasibility of the study. </summary>
