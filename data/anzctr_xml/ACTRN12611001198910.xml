  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study investigates the physiology of brown fat in adult humans. Brown fat plays a major role in metabolism,
protecting animals from obesity. In humans, brown fat is thought to disappear after infancy. However, metabolic imaging by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a glucose analogue, has revealed fat of high metabolic activity in the neck region in adults, confirmed to be brown fat on histology.

Our previous molecular and histological analysis suggests brown fat to be present in the majority of adult humans. However, factors regulating brown fat activity/abundance are unknown. By PET, brown fat prevalence was higher in women, associated with lower age, weight and glucose level, suggesting regulation by hormones and a role in energy homeostasis. 

The hypothesis of the current study is that brown fat is regulated hormonally and contributes significantly to metabolism.

We aim to determine physiologic factors which regulate brown fat activity and its metabolic significance in adulthood. The
proposal involves regulatory studies in-vivo (FDG uptake) to explore effects of adrenergic, sex and metabolic hormones on brown fat activity. Metabolic significance will be determined by relating FDG uptake to diet-induced thermogenesis.</summary>
