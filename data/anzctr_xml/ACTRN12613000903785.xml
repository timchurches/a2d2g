  <interventions>
    <interventions>This prospective face-to-face IBD ambulatory clinic cohort study measured IBD-DI, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) for Crohns disease (CD) or partial Mayo score (pMayo) for ulcerative colitis (UC), IBDQ quality-of-life, and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment performed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Validation tests are performed and predictors and extent of work absenteeism are determined. </interventions>
    <comparator>Controls are non-IBD subjects, age- and sex-matched family members of hospital staff. They complete the same questionnaires as the intervention group at baseline only. Follow up is not required as they do not have IBD and do not flare. </comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of the study was to design and validate a numerical scoring system for the IBD-DI to measure IBD disability using standard statistical techniques. 
Patients will have nonparametric statistical validation studies on construct validity of the IBD-DI against CDAI, pMayo, IBDQ (Spearman correlation) along with Crohbachs alpha, intraclass correlation and reliability testing. Wilcoxon signed ranks test will be conducted to determine significance of median changes at 4 week follow up in those with and without flares of disease in between paired testing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Four weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints include identification of the extent of severe disability. Percentage of "severe disability" is defined as those with &lt; - 30 IBD-DI scores within the cohort. 
 </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Correlation of disability with work absenteeism. The Work Productivity Assessment questionnaire will be used to correlate IBD-DI with hours of work absenteeism in the previous week to determine indirect cost of disability in terms of partial employment and unemployment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identifying predictors of employment status. 
Binary logistic regression is used to determine the predictive of unemployment - testing IBD-DI, IBDQ, medical and surgical treatment. This will be conducted using univariate tests selecting P&lt;0.05 components and testing for multi-variate independent risk factors. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The central hypothesis is that the IBD-DI is an objective measure of disability in IBD that correlates with work absenteeism. The primary objective of the study was to design and validate a numerical scoring system for the IBD-DI to measure IBD disability using standard statistical techniques. Secondary endpoints include identification of the extent of severe disability, correlation of disability with work absenteeism, and identifying predictors of employment status. </summary>
