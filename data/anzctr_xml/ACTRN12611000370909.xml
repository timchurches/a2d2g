  <interventions>
    <interventions>Withdrawal of multiple medications according to a structured deprescribing protocol.  

We will record a detailed medical history and conduct a clinical examination of each participant. We will record the generic name, indication, dosage, and frequency of all medications taken by the participant, including all prescribed and over-the-counter medications and any herbal or mineral supplements. We will determine the indication for each medication by discussion with the participant, the participants doctor, and, if necessary, by accessing the participants medical records. 

Two investigators will independently review the medication lists and indications and identify target drugs for withdrawal in each participant.  Target drugs will be identified using previously published lists of medications considered potentially inappropriate in older people.   The list of medications considered for withdrawal will include, but not necessarily be limited to, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, long-acting sulphonylureas, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antispasmodics, anticholinergic antihistamines, short-acting calcium channel blockers, stimulant laxatives, muscle relaxants, dipyridamole, nitrofurantoin, ditropan, amiodarone, antihypertensives, statins, potassium supplements, mineral supplements, vitamins, opioid analgesics, inhaled and oral corticosteroids, diuretics, antiemetics, oral and topical oestrogens, digoxin, nitrates, antacids, antireflux medications, iron supplements, herbal remedies, cough suppressants, and nasal decongestants. 

Each potentially inappropriate medication will be checked against four criteria and if any of the criteria are met in a participant, the medication will be targeted for withdrawal in that participant.  The criteria are as follows: 

1. Inappropriate prescription (no indication for drug OR clear contraindication)
2. Adverse effects (adverse effects or interactions outweigh any symptomatic benefit OR any future potential benefit)
3. Drug taken for symptom relief AND symptoms stable or absent (determined by reference to a table of pre-defined criteria for assessing symptom stability)
4. Drug taken to prevent future serious events AND patient is experiencing serious adverse effects OR potential future benefit unlikely to be realised due to limited life expectancy.

Both investigators will independently determine the order of drug withdrawal. Drugs least likely to cause an adverse drug withdrawal event (ADWE) will be ceased before drugs most likely to cause an ADWE. The investigators will resolve by consensus any differences in the target drugs and withdrawal order.

Dose reductions will be made at two weekly intervals by the investigator or the participant's usual treating doctor.  Participants will be monitored twice weekly for adverse drug withdrawal effects.   If no adverse effects or symptom recurrence are noted, dose reduction and target drug cessation will continue until all target drugs are ceased.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care continues in the control group. The protocol does not specify any change to management of these patients. Medications can be amended by treating general practitioner as clinically indicated.  We will visit control participants with same frequency as we visit intervention group participants during the drug withdrawal phase of the trial. We will measure blood pressure at each visit and make general enquiries as to any problems the participant may wish to report. At the end of the 12-month trial period, we will provide the usual treating doctor with a list of target medications, withdrawal protocols, and a list of indications for restarting withdrawn medications.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people are at high risk of adverse drug reactions and many medications cause confusion and falls in older patients. In addition, evidence for the benefit of preventative and symptomatic therapies in frail older people is limited, as most clinical trials specifically exclude these patients.  Although polypharmacy is widely recognised as a serious problem in frail older people, data on the effects of active medication withdrawal ("deprescribing") are scarce. 

Our primary aim is to determine whether we can safely reduce the total number of medications prescribed to older people living in residential aged care facilities (RACF). Secondary aims are to estimate the effect of deprescribing on mortality, falls and fractures, sleep quality, cognitive function, and independence.</summary>
