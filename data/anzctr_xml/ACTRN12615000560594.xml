  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>This trial is to assess the tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy adult volunteers and does not focus on any particular health condition or problem.
Subsequent studies are planned to evaluate efficacy in promoting improved exercise endurance and recovery, reduced muscle damage and soreness post exercise and for its lipid lowering effects in appropriate populations.</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single dose of GDN-1 will be administered on Day 0 either sublingually or orally in either a fed or fasted state according to the randomisation schedule.  Patients will be randomised into one of six treatment groups:
Group 1, 10mg of sublingual GDN-1 in a fasted state,
Group 2, 20mg of sublingual GDN-1 in a fasted state,
Group 3, 40mg of sublingual GDN-1 in a fasted state,
Group 4, 40mg of sublingual GDN-1 in a fed state,
Group 5, 40mg of oral GDN-1 in a fasted state,
Group 6, 40mg of oral GDN-1 in a fed state,





</interventions>
    <comparator>There are 6 treatment arms which include doses at 10mg, 20mg and 40mg.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate:
*The safety and tolerability of GDN-1 in healthy adults following a single dose.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability:
*Adverse events over the course of the study (from the time of drug administration until the end of study - Day 7).
*Changes in vital signs, physical examination, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and 12-lead ECG within 24 hours post receiving the single dose

</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of GDN-1 following administration of a single sublingual or oral dose to healthy adults in the fed and fasted states.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetics:
*Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) obtained directly from the plasma concentration data without interpolation
*Time to peak plasma concentration (tmax) obtained directly from the plasma concentration data without interpolation.
*Elimination half-life (t 1/2)
*Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last time point evaluated (AUC(0t))
*Area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 and extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0inf))

PK sampling will occur pre-dose, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 hours.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:
To evaluate in subjects randomised to receive the sublingual Investigational Medicinal Product:
*The tolerability of the sublingual GDN-1 formulation in terms of palatability (using a 5 point scale) 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS:

*Subjects judgement of the palatability of the sublingual Investigational Product utilising a 5 point scale (within 15 minutes of dosing).
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate in subjects randomised to receive the sublingual Investigational Medicinal Product:
*The tolerability of the sublingual GDN-1 formulation in terms of  disintegration time (observational).
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time taken for the sublingual Investigational Product to disintegrate (less than or equal to 10 minutes);</timepoint>
