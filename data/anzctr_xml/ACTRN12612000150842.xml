    <interventions>Comparison of 2 different doses of misoprostol (400 mcg and 800mcg[control]) administered intravaginally as part of the medical management of recognized miscarriage. The dose of misoprostol is administered at recruitment, and then the following day if the miscarriage is not considered complete. Comparison of efficacy to induce complete miscarriage, side-effect profile and patient tolerance and acceptance is to be determined. The duration of the study is  anticipated to be 5 years.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Enrolment - Eligible participants included women presenting with pregnancy loss between 6+0 and 12+6 weeks to the Emergency Department or Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit. Women with ultrasound confirmed incomplete or missed miscarriage (intra-uterine gestational sac with or without a fetal pole) are provided with written information regarding the surgical, expectant or medical management of miscarriage. Women electing medical management and meeting the inclusion criteria will then be offered participation in the study and provide written consent. 
Randomization will be performed using a computer generated model with a block size of 6 stratified for study site. After enrolling the women into the study, allocation to the 400 mcg or 800 mcg group will be made by opening the next consecutively numbered, sealed opaque envelope. The allocated dose will be recorded in the medication chart and administered by the non-blinded attending clinicians or nursing staff; the study dose will not be revealed to the participating women who remain blinded throughout the study period.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The optimal dose of Misoprostol to be used in the medical management of miscarriage before 13 weeks has not been resolved. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness and side effect profile of two different dosages of Misoprostol.  
Methods
A randomized controlled, equivalence study comparing 400mcg vs 800mcg Misoprostol per vaginum (PV) on an outpatient basis. The allocated dose was repeated the next day if clinically the products of conception had not been passed. Complete miscarriage was evaluated using two methods: ultrasound criteria on Day 7; and the need for surgical management (clinical criteria). Equivalence was demonstrated if the 95% confidence interval [CI] of the observed risk difference between the two doses for complete miscarriage lay between -15.0% and 15.0%. Differences in side effects and patient satisfaction were evaluated using patient-completed questionnaires.</summary>
