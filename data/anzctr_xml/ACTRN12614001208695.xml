  <interventions>
    <interventions>both treatment groups(1and 2)  received the standard medical treatment  in addition to NIV .The  NIV were delivered through a full-face mask by a Respironics Synchrony ventilator (Model RTX Inodes, 10 Downage RespiCare, Drager, London). In the CPAP group(group1) a continuous pressure of 10 cmH2O was generated. Patients in Bi-PAP group(group 2) received IPAP (15 cmH2O) and EPAP (5 cmH2O)
. All patients received their assigned treatment for 1 hour. After NIV mask remove the patients continued to receive standardO2 face mask.

	Criteria for termination of noninvasive ventilation therapy include inability to tolerate the tightness of the mask or pressure, abundant secretion or met  the criteria for intubation according to Brochard et al. 1995. In those who were unable to tolerate the NIV, it was stopped and standard face mask O2 applied.After study period(90 minutes), the patients were transferred to medical ward or admitted to an intensive care unit(ICU) if they require intubation or did not improve. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients were helped to assume a semi-recumbent  position.  patients of control group ( group 3 ) received the standard medical treatment only , according to the emergency department protocol, at the National Heart Institute. These included:1)supplementary oxygen therapy was supplied at a rate of up to 15 liters per minute via a reservoir mask to maintain oxygen saturation greater than or equal to90%; 2), nitroglycerine 0.4 mg sublingual if systolic BPgreater than100 mmHg-excluding patients receiving potential drug interaction preparations, doses can be repeated every 5 minutes;3) frusemide IV starts with 40 mg and in incremental doses if required; 4)morphine sulfate 2 mg IV, may be repeated once. If BP less than 100mmHg dopamine is given starting at 2.5 mcg/Kg/min intravenous and increase dose every 10 minutes if BP remains low .</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0. Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation while categorical variables were described by frequency and percentage. A one way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the Scheffe  test  for repeated comparison was used to identify specific differences within and between groups at each time point.Variables without normal distribution and homogeneous variance were analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. All statistical analysis was two-tailed with statistical significant differences was assumed at p =0.05. 
The sample size was estimated to be 60 patients in all groups and would be increased to 69 for possible dropout. This sample size was estimated to detect 5terro (0.7PKa) difference in PaCO2 between groups, with the probability level was set at 0.05 and power of 80% [Mehta et al. 1997</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE) is one of the most common emergency medical conditions leading to hospitalization, with the associated higher rate of mortality, especially when it is coupled with acute myocardial infarction (AMI (.
As many patients with ACPE respond rapidly to standardized medical treatment includes oxygen, diuretics, and vasodilators that could improve the symptoms. However, a significant number of patients required endotracheal intubation and ventilation, with its associated potential for complications.
Over the past two decades, application of noninvasive ventilation(NIV)  either with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or Bi-level positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP)  has been suggested in association with the standardized medical treatment as an effective approach to treat ACPE. These due to augmentation of cardiac output and oxygen delivery, improved function residual capacity and respiratory mechanism, reduced effort in breathing, and decreased left ventricular preload and after load.

Most studies evaluating CPAP and Bi-PAP have variable conclusions. As most of these studies were case series, and small, randomized trials, with considerable variation in study populations, the type of ventilation intervention, concomitant therapies, and outcome measurements. Moreover, the results from these studies are inconsistent.
In addition, there are no or few clinical studies that investigated the role of NIV on ACPE in emergency departments in Egypt. 
    Therefore, the current study was conducted to compare the efficacy of CPAP, Bi-PAP, and standard oxygen therapy on blood gases and vital signs in patients with ACPE, and to investigate whether either CPAP or Bi-PAP would cause improvement in endotracheal intubation and mortality rates.
