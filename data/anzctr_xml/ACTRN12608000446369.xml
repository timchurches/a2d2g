  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dalteparin sodium 5000U given subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) once daily up to 20 weeks gestation, then 5000U s.c. twice daily from 20 weeks gestation to 37 weeks gestation or delivery.  All participants will receive Fragmin 5000U s.c. daily from post-partum day 1 for 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control - standard care.  Standard care, depending on practitioner/physician preference, may include anti-platelet treatment with low dose aspirin (100mg daily), more frequent fetal ultrasound to monitor fetal health and growth, more frequent monitoring of mothers' blood pressure, blood biochemistry and haematology and more frequent urinalysis.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Severe or early onset (defined as prior to 32 weeks gestation) pre-eclampsia.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any stage of gestation.  As the pregnancy progresses the practitioner/physician will monitor the mother's blood pressure, analyse urine sample for presence of protein, monitor blood biochemistry and haematology for markers of developing pre-eclampsia.  This would be done at the visits at 12, 20, 28 and 32 or 36 weeks and as necessary.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objectively documented venous thromboembolic events including:
1.1 Deep vein thrombosis - as assessed by pain, swelling and diagnosed by ultrasound visualisation.
1.2 Pulmonary embolism - assessed by presence of chest pain, difficulty breathing and confirmation by lung perfusion scan.
1.3 Sudden death.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any stage of gestation, puerperium and post partum.  These outcome events will be assessed as necessary.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) fetal growth will be assessed by fetal ultrasound, fetal loss (miscarriage or stillbrith).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At any point of gestation if the obstetrician/physician has a concern that the fetus is not growing adequately</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pregnancy induced hypertension</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pregnancy induced hypertension will be assessed by monitoring the mother's blood pressure.  The blood pressure will be measured at each visit at 20, 24, 28 and 32 or 36 weeks of gestation.  If the participant is being cared for by both an Obstetrician and a Physician, she may have additional measures taken as part of routine clinical management.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-term delivery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time before 37 weeks gestation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Abruptio-placentae, major and minor haemorrhage.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Any time during gestation, for haemorrhage any time during gestation, puerperium, post-partum.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Side effects of low molecular weight heparin - fractures, thrombocytopenia, reduction in bone mineral density.</outcome>
      <timepoint>If a participant has a "minimal trauma" fracture event at any stage of pregnancy or the 6 week post partum period this will be recorded.  Thrombocytopenia is the decrease in the number of platelets in a persons blood.  In TIPPS, thrombocytopenia is defined as a 50% drop from baseline in the number of platelets in the  blood. Safety monitoring for thrombocytopenia will be conducted at baseline, randomisation, one week after joining the study, 12, 20, 28, at 32 or 36 weeks and 6 weeks after the birth.  Bone mineral density for all particpants will be assessed 6 weeks after the birth by Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study rationale:
Thrombophilias are disorders that result in a predisposition to develop Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTEs). Thrombophilias are common in the general population. Recent evidence indicates that women with thrombophilia not only have an increased risk of VTEs during pregnancy, but also increased risk of pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), abruptio placentae and foetal loss. The management of thrombophilic women in pregnancy is controversial and antithrombotic prophylaxis may reduce the rate of complications in pregnancy and the rate of VTEs.

Phase II studies with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in pregnant women, for a variety of indications, suggest that there may be a benefit to their use in this high-risk group. However, to date there have been no controlled clinical trials using LMWH to prevent pre-eclampsia, IUGR or foetal loss.
The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of LMWH in preventing VTE, pre-eclampsia, IUGR and foetal loss in pregnant thrombophilic women.

Study design:
This study is a multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial based in a maximum of 30 centres. Three hundred and eighty-five(385) pregnant women with confirmed thrombophilia and at high risk for pregnancy complications will be randomised to prophylactic dose dalteparin or control (identical follow-up and care, but no drug intervention).

The study will consist of five periods: a screening period, randomisation, antenatal follow-up, labour and delivery, and postpartum follow-up. Maximum time on study will vary between 26 and 46 weeks.

The primary objective of this study is to identify if LMWH prophylaxis in thrombophilic pregnant women results in a greater than 33% relative risk reduction in the composite outcome measure (VTE, pre-eclampsia, IUGR and foetal loss) compared to control.

Secondary objectives will be to:
1. Identify if prophylactic LMWH will reduce rates of PIH, pre-term labour and abruptio placentae in pregnant thrombophilic women compared to control.
2. Determine safety of LMWH use in pregnancy (specifically rates of bleeding, thrombocytopenia and fractures).
3. Identify whether prolonged LMWH use in pregnancy results in decreased BMD compared to control</summary>
