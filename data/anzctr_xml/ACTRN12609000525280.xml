  <interventions>
    <interventions>3 feeding assistance models across 3 internal medicine wards. Each will run for a duration of 3 months (with 2 weeks lead in time prior to collecting data):
1. additional assistant-in-nursing (AIN) to assist with nutrition intake and care: 1 additional AIN per ward (existing 10 nurses per ward) with nutrition specific-role to feed patients, set up, fill in menus, liaise with dietitian and speech pathologist etc.
2. team-based nutrition care including protected meal times: education of multidisciplinary team (allied health, nursing and medical) to encourage and assist nutritional intake and observe protected meal times (limit non-urgent interruptions to patients at mealtimes)
3. additional AIN introduced to ward with team-based model</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This intervention trial is a pragmatic study to investigate the impact of three feeding assistance models on energy intake of older hospitalised patients (compared with pre-intervention data) and will provide some pilot data for other clinical outcomes, such as functional capacity, length of stay and mortality. This study will add to the limited evidence base on interventions to improve nutritional intake in elderly hospital patients. While this study will not be adequately powered to determine whether clinical outcomes are improved with these interventions, findings could be used to inform the design of larger trials to further evaluate outcomes such as functional status, hospital readmission and mortality. 

This study will also explore the impact of the different feeding assistance models on ward culture. As implementation of these interventions will require complex changes to service delivery, it is imperative that changes in staff behaviours and their perspective and acceptability of interventions are explored.</summary>
