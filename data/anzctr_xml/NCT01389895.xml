    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - AMG 557
Treatment: drugs - AMG 557 Placebo

Active Comparator: AMG 557 - All will receive AMG 557 on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85, and Day 99.

Placebo Comparator: AMG 557 Placebo - All will receive placebo on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85, and Day 99.


Treatment: drugs: AMG 557
AMG 557 (210 mg) or (140 mg ) will be administered as subcutaneous injections in the anterior abdomen of the subjects. Twelve subjects will be randomized to receive AMG 557. Beginning on Day 1, subjects will receive either 210 mg AMG 557 or 140 mg AMG 557 once weekly for 3 weeks on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 15 and following with 6 additional doses of AMG 557 every other week on Day 29, Day 43, Day 57, Day 71, Day 85, and Day 99. Subjects will be followed out to Day 253 for safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments.

             and/or procedures per the investigator's discretion. This includes any age related
             co-morbidities such as presence of congestive heart failure, angina, chronic

             mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus, Intravenous (IV)
             immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, oral or IV cyclophosphamide;

          -  Receiving or has received any investigational drug (or is currently using an
             investigational device) within the 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer),

          -  29. Use of any other over-the-counter or prescription medications within the 14 days
             or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer), prior to receiving the first dose of study
             medication. Acetaminophen (up to 2 g per day) for analgesia and hormone replacement
             therapy (eg, estrogen, thyroid) will be allowed. In addition, prescription drugs for
             hypertension or hypercholesterolemia, oral hypoglycemic drugs, or NSAIDs will be
             allowed; however, NSAIDS are not permitted within 24 hours of skin biopsies to reduce
             the risk of bleeding. Other medications may be approved following review by the
             Principal Investigator and the Amgen Medical Monitor. Written documentation of this
             review and Amgen acknowledgement is required for subject participation;</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose
      study in which approximately 24 subjects with SCLE will be enrolled. Cohort 1 will consist of
      12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 210 mg or matching placebo.
      Cohort 2 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 140
      mg or matching placebo. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (140 mg) will be initiated after enrollment of
      Cohort 1 (210 mg) is completed.</summary>
