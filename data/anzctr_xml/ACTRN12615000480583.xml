  <interventions>
    <interventions>An cognitive behavioural and biopsychosocially-based e-mental health program for decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression (called LIFE FLeX) will be evaluated using a quasi experimental trial design. 


LIFE FLeX is designed to provide people with information and strategies to address their anxiety and depressive symptoms and contains six core modules, plus an Introduction module delivered over 7 weeks. There will also be a short two page Booster Module three weeks following the post-assessment. Participants will be notified by email as to when they should access it. 


The six core LIFE FLeX eHealth modules are: 

1.	Increasing Biological Flexibility
2.	Increasing Emotional Flexibility
3.	Increasing Thinking Flexibility
4.	Increasing Behavioural Flexibility
5.	Increasing Wellness (positive affect) Flexibility
6.	Increasing Life FleX-ability


Each module will take approximately 25 minutes to complete. In addition, in order to reinforce the module-based information, there are 20-30 minutes of offline activities each week. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions at the beginning of each module to monitor their progress. A 'stage release' design has been employed so that modules are released sequentially, but at the pace that each participant is most comfortable with over the 7 weeks. Modules include text, graphics, audio, video, editable forms and downloads. Modules can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1-7) assessments, post-intervention assessment (Week 8) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 12 &amp; Week 20 respectively) and they will be able to access the program for the entire trial period. Participant engagement with the program will be monitored by them 'releasing' of each new module, asking module review questions at the beginning of each new module and at the post assessment stage, and the completion of the daily electronic mood monitoring form.

LIFE FLeX has been written for people with depressive and anxiety symptoms and therefore recruitment will focus on people with depression and anxiety. However those without symptoms are able to register if they wish too (given this is a fully automated self help program). In addition, the program is also preventative in nature - thus 'healthy' participants may also benefit from some of the information within the program (e.g., increasing wellness flexibility).

    <statisticalmethods>1.	Pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to repeated measures MANOVA and ANOVA to determine significant changes over time.
2.	Correlational and multiple regression analyses will be used to determine any potential predictors and discriminators of attrition and adherence.
3.	Open ended data obtained from intervention satisfaction questionnaires may be analysed using protocols of content analysis to identify common themes.


Assuming a small-medium effect (i.e. GPower f test = 0.25), significance set at 5% (p = .05) and power at 80%, a total sample size of 80 (this figure also accounts for an expected attrition rate of 50%) will be required to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary outcome measure.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A cognitive behavioural and biopsychosocially-based program for decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression (called LIFE FLeX) will be evaluated. The LIFE FLeX eHealth program will be placed within the Federation University eHealth Platform. People who visit the website will be invited to take part in the LIFE FLeX eHealth evaluation study. Those that consent will be given access to the LIFE FLeX program website immediately.

LIFE FLeX is designed to provide people with information and strategies to address their anxiety and depressive symptoms and contains six core modules, plus an Introduction module delivered over 7 weeks. There will also be a short Booster Module released after post-assessment.

Each module will take approximately 25 minutes to complete. In addition, in order to reinforce the module-based information, there are 20-30 minutes of offline activities each week. Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions at the beginning of each week, to monitor their progress. Modules include text, graphics, audio, video, editable forms and downloads. Modules can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1-7) assessments, post-intervention assessment (Week 8) and a 1 and 3 month follow-up assessment (Week 12 &amp; Week 20 respectively). 

It is expected that people who undertake LIFE FLeX will show reductions in anxiety and / or depressive symptoms at post and follow-up time points as well as increases in positive affect and emotional regulation.
