  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To date, intervention foci to improve neurobehavioural outcomes in preterm infants have been primarily medical. The intervention developed for this study is based on the observation of severe dysregulation in premature infants and the potential of sensitive maternal-infant interaction to modulate the damaging effects of stress on infants' general and brain development. In essence we aim to train mothers to be therapists to their own hospitalised preterm infant. The development of infants of intervention and control mothers will be assessed and compared at several ages until 24 months corrected age.</summary>
