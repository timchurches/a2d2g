  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subject eligibility will be determined during a 28 day Screening Period. A total of 150 subjects will be randomized to 6 sequences, such that 25 subjects will be randomized to each of the sequences. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequence groups. Each sequence will receive all 3 treatments as described below:
Treatment A: HSP-130, 6 mg, single subcutaneous injection in the deltoid region
Treatment B: US-approved Neulasta (pegfilgrastim, Amgen), 6 mg, single subcutaneous injection in the deltoid region
Treatment C: EU-approved Neulasta, (pegfilgrastim, Amgen) 6 mg, single subcutaneous injection in the deltoid region
There will be at least 56 days of washout between each treatment. 
Two people will be performing dosing with one carrying out the activity while another observing the same. In addition IP accountability will be done by monitors i.e. reviewing the dispensing records, reviewing the drug labels that will be removed at dose administration and pasted in the subjects source document and reviewing syringe boxes.
All the three pegfilgrastim preparations i.e. the pegfilgrastim, US and EU Neulasta have the same amino acid sequences.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator/ control for this trial are:
 
Treatment B: US-approved Neulasta (pegfilgrastim, Amgen), 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region.
Treatment C: EU-approved Neulasta (pegfilgrastim, Amgen), 6 mg, single SC injection in the deltoid region.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is a composite assessment of the pharmacodynamic measures of area under the effect versus time curve for Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) from the time of dose administration to the 288 hour sample after dose administration (AUECanc) and the maximum observed value for ANC (ANC_Cmax).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood assessments will be carried out for PD (ANC) analysis.
Measurements to be taken 14 times in each period which include 1 hour prior to dose administration and at 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, and 288 hours post-dose.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary pharmacodynamic outcome is the time of maximum value for ANC (ANC_Tmax) from the time of dosing to 288 hours.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood assessments will be carried out for PD analysis. Measurements to be taken 14 times in each period which include 1 hour prior to dose administration and at 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192, 216, 240, 264, and 288 hours post-dose.
</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is a composite outcome assessing pharmacokinetics which will include area under the serum pegylated filgrastim versus time curve from the time of dose administration to time infinity (AUC0-infinity) and the maximum observed serum pegylated filgrastim concentration (Cmax).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the safety of HSP-130 by recording the adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessments, vital signs, ECG, and physical examination throughout the duration of the study. The known possible adverse events include bone pain and back pain, allergic reactions, splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sickle cell disease, inflammation of blood vessels, higher than normal count for white blood cells and lower than normal count for platelets.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be assessed for AEs and vital signs for a minimum of 6 days during confinement and 10 days as outpatient visits. 
laboratory assessments (blood and urine) will be assessed for a minimum of 3 days  during confinement and 3 days during out-patient visits. 
ECGs will be assessed twice during the study (both during out-patient visits).
Directed physical examination will be performed to assess the spleen at each visit during confinement and as outpatient, either as directed examination only or as part of a full physical examination which will be performed a total of 3 times during the study. </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the PD and PK of Hospiras pegylated filgrastim, HSP-130 and two pegfilgrastim preparations: US-approved Neulasta and EU-approved Neulasta.
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 18 and 65 years, are a non-smoker and have a BMI between 19 and 30 kg/m2, inclusive, and body weight of not less than 50 kg or more than 100 kg.
Participants in this study will all receive a single dose of three drugs in a random order (by chance). Each dose will be injected at 6 mg into the shoulder region. 
This study is designed to demonstrate three things:
- that HSP-130 has similar levels in the blood as the same dose of one or both of the approved pegfilgrastims.
- that HSP-130 has the same effect on increasing the specific kinds of white blood cells in study subjects as one or both of the approved pegfilgrastims
- that HSP-130 has a similar safety profile as both of the approved pegfilgrastims
