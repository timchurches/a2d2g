  <interventions>
    <interventions>Lens wearers are asked to follow a lens case cleaning guideline for one month: 
1. Rinse contact lens case once with disinfecting solution after use (minimum 5 times per week)
2. Rub lens cases with fingers for 5 seconds 
3. Wipe lens cases with tissue for 5 seconds
4. Air-dry the lens case face down

The disinfecting solution given to participants is called AMO Complete, a commercially available lens care product

After one month, participants are switched to the control treament (no washout period)</interventions>
    <comparator>Lens wearers are asked to follow current manufacturers' lens case cleaning guideline for one month: 1. Rinse contact lens case with disinfecting solution after use  2.Air-dry the case

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The instructions for contact lens case hygiene vary from source to source. Poor contact lens case hygiene has been shown to increase the risk of corneal infection in the eye. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new contact lens case cleaning method in reducing the level of microbial contamination and compare its efficacy with the current contact lens case cleaning guidelines.

Aims:
We aim to:
- Determine the level of microbial contamination in the contact lens cases of wearers in the community.
 - Compare the level of microbial contamination present after using the manufacturers lens case cleaning guidelines with that of the newly developed guidelines.
- To further refine the contact lens storage case cleaning guidelines</summary>
