  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Dementing syndromes are, for the most part, incurable. People with dementia become highly
      dependent and frequently have to move from their homes into residential aged care facilities.

      Medications aimed at reducing the severity of a number of symptoms associated with the
      different types of dementia have had only modest success.

      Increasingly, people with dementia, their families and carers are turning to supplementary or
      alternative approaches to the management of their symptoms. There are many published reports
      describing the successful use of music therapy in reducing the severity of many symptoms of
      dementia. These include reports of improved memory, improved language skills, reduced anxiety
      and depression, reductions in agitation and disruptive behaviours and better social
      relationships with family, peers and carers. However, the quality of evidence they provide
      for the most part fails meet the standards of evidence required by health care providers.
      This clinical trial will examine the effects of a music therapy intervention.

      The study will recruit 180 patients in sub-acute hospital wards. Participants will be
      randomly placed in groups that receive either occupational therapy or music therapy. Before
      the therapy programs begin, we will use questionnaires to measure memory function, language
      ability, orientation and mood. We will also record brain activity from the surface of the
      scalp, blood pressure and pulse to examine physiological responses. The same measures will be
      repeated after the 3 weeks of therapy to determine whether there has been any improvement in
      the symptoms of the participants and whether the group that had music therapy showed greater
      improvement than the group that had occupational therapy. We will make a video recording
      during one therapy session to allow us to observe levels of engagement and to assess changes
      in facial expressions. This will provide information about the immediate effects of music on
      mood and social interaction. The information we collect about brain activity and blood
      pressure will help us to understand how music therapy might bring about changes in the
      symptoms of dementia. This understanding will be useful in developing better applications of
      music therapy. It will also add to our current knowledge about how the various diseases cause
      the problems they do.

      In summary, the primary aim of the project is to determine whether the reported effects of
      music therapy are supported by objective evidence.</summary>
