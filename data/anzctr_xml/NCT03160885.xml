Treatment: drugs: Tralokinumab
Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the IgG4 subclass that specifically binds to human IL-13 and blocks interaction with the IL-13 receptors. It is presented as a liquid formulation for subcutaneous (SC) administration

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Placebo contains the same excipients, in the same concentration only lacking tralokinumab

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjects with Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16. - The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Subjects achieving at least 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI]. - The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) from baseline to Week 16. - The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction of Worst Daily Pruritus numeric rating scale (weekly average) of at least 4 from baseline to Week. 16 - Subjects will assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours using an 11 point NRS ('Worst Daily Pruritus NRS') with 0 indicating 'no itch' and 10 indicating 'worst itch imaginable'.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from baseline to Week 16. - The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life (QoL) over the last week such as dermatolog-yrelated symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all /not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor QoL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 0 to Week 16</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
