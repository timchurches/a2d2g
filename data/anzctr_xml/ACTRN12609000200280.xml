  <interventions>
    <interventions>Resistance/impact loading exercise group (1): progressive supervised resistance (e.g. upper and lower body resistance based exercises using weight machines) and impact loading exercises (e.g. skipping, bounding and drop jumping) twice weekly 60 minutes sessions during 12 months.
Resistance/cardiovascular exercise group (2): progressive supervised resistance (e.g. upper and lower body resistance based exercises using weight machines) and aerobic exercises (e.g. walking and cycling) twice weekly 60 minutes sessions during 6 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control: usual care delay exercise group. All participants in this group will be provided with a printed booklet with information about exercise for the initial 6-month period.  In the second 6-month period, supervised non impact aerobic exercise (cycling) sessions will be undertaken twice a week. Further, participants in this group will be also offered a 3-month resistance exercise program following the completion of the second 6-month period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiorespiratory capacity (maximum oxygen capacity) will be measured by expired air analysis during a staged walking test on a motorized treadmill. Exercise capacity (in METS) will be determined on the basis of the speed and grade of the treadmill as well as direct expired air gas analysis. Electrocardiogram will be recorded using a 12-lead monitoring system and blood pressure will be measured each testing minute by sphygmomanometer. This assessment will be conducted by medical doctor and an exercise physiologist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, midpoint (6 months) and post-test (12 months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hip, spine and whole body bone mineral density (BMD). BMD (g/cm2) of the hip (total hip) and lumbar spine (L2-4) regions as well as whole body bone mineral content (BMC, g) will be assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic Discovery A, Waltham, MA). Assessments will be conducted by an exercise physiologist with bone densitometry certification.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, midpoint (6 months) and post-test (12 months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood pressure and Artery Stiffness. A validated oscillometric device (HEM-705CP, Omron Corporation, Japan) will be used to record brachial blood pressure at the dominant arm in triplicate. Central (ascending aortic) blood pressure and indices of arterial stiffness will be determined by pulse wave analysis using SphygmoCor version 6.1 software (AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Radial artery pressure waveforms will be captured at the right arm by applanation tonometry using a high fidelity micromanometer (SPC-301, Millar Instruments, Houston, Texas, USA). A generalised transfer function is applied to the radial artery waveform in order to obtain the pressure waveform at the ascending aorta. This method has been validated against invasive techniques for determination of central blood pressure and the augmentation index (AIx) is a marker of systemic arterial stiffness. Assessments will be conducted by an exercise physiologist.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, midpoint (6 months) and post-test (12 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood biomarkers: Blood laboratory analysis including levels of testosterone, prostate specific antigen (PSA), insulin, lipid profile, glucose, HbA1c, alkaline phosphatase, Pro collagen Type 1 N-Terminal Propeptide (PINP), and C- reactive protein (CRP) levels will be measured commercially by an accredited Australian National</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, midpoint (6 months) and post-test (12 months).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body composition (lean and fat mass). Regional and whole body lean mass (including appendicular skeletal muscle mass) and fat mass will be derived from a DXA whole body scan.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at which types of exercise are most useful in reducing the side effects of hormonal therapy for prostate cancer. 

Who is it for? 
You can join this study if you are a man being treated for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce your level of male hormones. 

Trial details 
Participants will be divided into three groups. One group will undertake resistance/impact loading exercise. Sessions are 60 minutes each, twice weekly over 12 months. The second group will undertake resistance/cardiovascular exercise. Sessions are 60 minutes each, twice weekly over 6 months. The third group will be provided with a printed booklet with information about exercise for the initial 6-month period, and in the second 6-month period undertake twice weekly cycling exercise sessions. Participants in this group will be also offered a 3-month resistance exercise program following the completion of the second 6-month period. The study will measure cardio-respiratory capacity (maximum oxygen capacity), bone mineral density, blood pressure and artery stiffness, muscle function and other indicators of well-being before, during and immediately after the program. The use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is accompanied by a number of side effects. This study will investigate the effects of exercise on reversing musculoskeletal and cardiovascular related side effects.</summary>
