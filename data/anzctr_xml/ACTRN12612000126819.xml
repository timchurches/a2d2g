  <interventions>
    <interventions>Naropin versus marcaine in controlling postoperative pain
after open haemorrhoidectomy.
One group recieves 20 mls of Naropin 0.75% ( 150 mgs)administered as a local injection near the course of the pudendal nerve. 10 mls will be admisnistered on each side. 
The other group will receive 20 mls of  Marcaine 0.5%( 100 mgs) admisnistered as before.
In regards to the surgery itself; it is open haemorroidectomy, done under GA. patient is positioned in lithotomy position. LA is administred as described before. Haemorroids are excised. Haemostasis secured . All patents will be discharged home with oral metronidazole 400mg  TDS for 5 days and oral endone tablets of 5 mg  for pain as required by patient.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the effectivness between two local anaesthetic agents in performing Pudendal nerve block</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed daily for the first 7 days then at a 2 weeks.
Assessments will be a preoperative questionaire and postoperative questionaire regarding expected level of pain and postoperative pain score and use of oral analgesics.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the amount of oral analgesics used and to compare that to the type of the local anaesthetic used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed daily for the first 7 days then at a 2 weeks.
Assessments will be a preoperative questionaire and postoperative questionaire regarding expected level of pain and postoperative pain score and use of oral analgesics.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation of Sitz Bath ( Salt bath) manoeuvre in relief of pain. This is not compulsory the use of one will just be captured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed daily for the first 7 days then at a 2 weeks.
Assessments will be a preoperative questionaire and postoperative questionaire regarding expected level of pain and postoperative pain score and use of oral analgesics.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Group 1
Group name for participants in this group: 0.5% marcaine
Expected number of participants in this group: 30. 
Group 2
Group name for participants in this group: 0.75% Naropin
Expected number of participants in this group: 30

Allocation for all will be done post consent by taking the next  sealed opaque envelope.</concealment>
    <sequence>Single blinded study, randomisation in block to ensure equal number of subjects in each arm. The assessor/conducting interview and phone calls is blind to which local anaesthetic is used.</sequence>

    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>The study involves double blinded randomised controlled trial, the surgeon is blinded to which local anaesthetic is
used and the assessor is also blinded to which agent has been used. Pudendal nerve block is performed by the
colorectal surgeon prior to preceeding to perform open haemorrhoidectomy</designfeatures>
