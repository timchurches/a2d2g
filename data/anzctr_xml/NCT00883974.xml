Experimental: 1 - 

No Intervention: 2 - Standard Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) procedures for the care of pre-term infants


Behaviour: Sensitivity Training
The parent sensitivity training program was delivered in NICU (9 sessions) with a home-booster session. Therapists worked with parents following a manualized protocol. Targets of intervention included: recognizing signs of infant stress, "shut-down" mechanisms, alert-available behavior, motor behaviors, facial expressions,posture/muscle tone; graded stimulation; how to optimize interactions; touch, movement and massage; "kangaroo care" (nesting infants skin-to-skin against their mother); vocal, visual and multi-sensory stimulation; normalizing parental feelings; challenging dysfunctional thinking, and diary keeping.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Immediately following birth, preterm infants face a period of stressful environmental inputs,
      which may have negative consequences on early brain development and subsequent
      neurobehavioral outcomes. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of training parents in
      reducing stressful experiences early in life. The investigators hypothesized that this
      intervention would insulate preterm infants from the harmful effects of acute and chronic
      stress, which in turn would result in enhanced brain development. The primary aim of the
      current study was to investigate if this intervention was associated with improved brain
      development measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term-equivalent age. A secondary
      aim was to assess some possible short-term medical benefits.</summary>
