  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective is to assess the effect of NV-52 on one or more of the surrogate markers of IBD taken from patient blood and faecal collections. The surrogate markers are faecal calprotectin and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythricyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), platelets, fibrinogen, Interleukin 6 (IL-6), Tumour Necrosis Factor A (TNFa), Interleukin 1B (IL-1B), C3 and C4.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The levels of each surrogate marker will be measured at baseline. Then on day 1, day 7, day 14, day 28 and day 56.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of chronic dosing with NV-52. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by the number of adverse events and by standard medical examinations, blood tests.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients safety and tolerability will be monitored continually throughout the trial. Patients will be asked at every visit whether they have experienced any symptoms or illnesses. These symptoms or illnesses will be documented and monitored from screening, throughout the 28 days of treatment and at the follow up visit. Medical exams and routine blood tests will be performed at all visits.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The tertiary objective is to assess the oral absorption of NV-52 in a small population of IBD patients.</outcome>
      <timepoint>To measure absorption of NV-52 blood will be collected on day 1, day 7, day 14, and day 28.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. healthy, (without clinically significant impairment in cardiac, liver or renal function, central nervous system, pulmonary, hematological, immunological, or vascular disease in addition to IBD, or current malignancy or malignancy within 5 years prior to screening)  adults &gt; 18 years old

2. presenting with either UC or CD affecting colon, ideally with an even distribution of both disease types across the patient population.

3. stable but active mild disease defined as: an abnormal level (as defined by the reference laboratory) of at least one of the surrogate markers at both screening visits (The abnormality must occur in the same marker at both screening visits.)

4. The patients assessment of their own disease will include evidence of active but mild and stable disease eg 1-2 stools/day more than usual, or occasional streaks of blood. Patients will be trained in using this scoring system.

5. The physicians empirical (gestalt) assessment will categorise the patient as having mild overall disease. 

6. patients must be able to understand the risks and benefits of the study and give written informed consent to participation

7. Subjects of childbearing potential that agree to use contraception, or ensure that their sexual partner be using contraception which must be either oral contraceptives, implantable hormonal contraceptives, or double-barrier methods throughout the trial</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1. patients whose symptoms deteriorate to the point of acute relapse (CDAI &gt; 200, UCAI &gt; 4). 2. a change in current medication within the last 4 weeks. 3. the use of steroids (excluding inhaled asthma medications) within the last 4 weeks. 4. the use of biologicals (eg monoclonal antibodies) within the last 4 weeks. 5. the use of trial medications within the last four weeks. 6. the use of rectal preparations. 7. a return to normal levels of all surrogate markers (CRP, ESR, platelets and faecal calprotectin) during the screening period (Day -14  Day +1) ie at least one surrogate marker must be elevated at day1. If the results of the samples collected on Day 1, prior to drug being administered, show that markers have returned to normal levels, the patient will be excluded. 8. pregnant or lactating women or subjects not using adequate contraception.</exclusivecriteria>
