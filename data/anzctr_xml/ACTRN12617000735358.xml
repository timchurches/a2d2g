  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Move, Eat &amp; Sleep study is a 3-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel groups involving an Enhanced intervention group, Traditional intervention group and a wait-list control group. The primary outcome is weight loss at the 6 month post baseline assessment. The study also includes a 12 month post baseline assessment. 

The secondary aims of the study are to compare the relative efficacy of the enhanced intervention and traditional intervention on the following secondary outcomes: 1) waist circumference, 2) glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), 3) physical activity, 4) sedentary behaviour, 5) dietary quality and intake, 6) eating behaviours, 7) sleep health, 8) severity of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms and 9) health related quality-of-life.

The Move, Eat &amp; Sleep study is a technology-based, multi-behavioural intervention to promote weight loss in overweight and obese adults. This will be achieved by increasing physical activity levels, improving dietary quality and reducing energy intake to promote weight loss, and in the Enhanced group also improving sleep health. 

Participants will receive access to a modified version of the Balanced app for a period of 12 months, a set of body weight scales to self-monitor weight, a Fitbit to self-monitor activity and sleep behaviours, a participant handbook and additional email and text message based support, and personalised dietary counselling. Participants in the Traditional Group will not self-monitor sleep health via the Balanced app or Fitbit, and will not receive any intervention content related to sleep health. 
Participants will be asked to use the Balanced app daily for self-monitoring of behaviours but are instructed they can use the app as much or as little as they like and they will have access to the app continuously throughout the entire study period.  
Participants will be able to self-monitor minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, daily steps taken and resistance training performed on a daily basis. Participants will also be encouraged to use the Balanced app to self-monitor dietary intake and quality on a daily basis using ten specific food goals. These food goals are designed in line with Australian Dietary Guidelines to promote a nutritionally balanced diet and a reduction in energy intake. Self-monitoring of sleep in the Balanced app consists of sleep time, wake time, sleep quality and sleep hygiene behaviours. Finally, using the scales provided participants will be encouraged to weigh themselves once per week and manually enter this into the Balanced app. 

Participants will be provided with educational information via in-app content, email and text messages, a printed participant handbook and in person via the nutrition counselling session. This information will detail how target behaviours can influence weight loss and strategies to achieve weight loss. The single nutrition counselling session will be conducted by a qualified dietitian, in a one-on-one format at the University of Newcastle Callaghan campus at the completion of the baseline assessment. The session will last for 20-25 minutes, with the purpose of setting a weight loss goal for each participant, discussing the results of their previously completed Australian Eating Survey, and making recommendations on how they can improve their dietary intake and diet quality for weight loss. Topics covered in this session will include energy deficit for weight loss, Australian Dietary Guidelines, The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating, appropriate portion sizes, and how to interpret food labels. Weight loss recommendations are based on the Eat for Health Educator's Guide, by the National Health and Medical Research Council.

Participants will be sent weekly SMS to provide educational and motivating facts about how target behaviours (physical activity, diet and sleep (if in enhanced group) can assist with weight loss. Weekly SMS will also be sent to prompt reengagement with self monitoring if self monitoring has stopped. Each week for the first 6 months of the intervention participants will receive an email that provides a weekly summary of their self-monitored behaviours and progress against goals. This is intended to build self-efficacy for changing behaviours. 

Feedback will be provided to participants on behaviour and weight via in-app feedback, emailed personalised weekly summaries, and for dietary behaviours only, additional in person, and online feedback via completion of the Healthy Eating Quiz (www.healthyeatingquiz.com.au). 

As indicated above in description of the exposure during the first 6 months of the study all participants receive a weekly educational fact of the week SMS to provide insight on how behaviour can influence weight loss. If participants have stopped self monitoring during the week (no self monitoring on 4 days out of 7) they will also receive a weekly SMS to prompt them to reengage them with self-monitoring their behaviours. This will occur in the first 6 months of the intervention. 

Adherence to the intervention will be assessed by monitoring the usage of the intervention app provided to self monitor behaviours. This provides information on date and time a self monitoring entry is made and also the details of the actual entry (eg. 30 minutes of activity).

    <statisticalmethods>Power: Based on previous weight loss study in a similar population, we estimate a baseline weight of 94 kg, the change in weight in the traditional (2.4kg) and enhanced (4.8kg) represent relative changes in weight from baseline of 2.55% and 5.11% respectively, Therefore to detect a difference of 2.4 kg difference between control and traditional groups, 4.8kg difference between control and enhanced groups, and a 2.4kg difference between traditional and enhanced groups in weight loss a total of 27 participants per group is required. This calculation assumes a power of 0.80, a alpha level of 0.016 to account for multiple comparisons and a pre post correlation of 0.9, and a standard deviation of change in weight of 6 kg. Meta-analysis of ehealth interventions reported an average dropout rate of  22% and we have achieved &lt;20% drop out in previous weight loss studies over 6 months.We conservatively assumed a dropout rate of 20% in the current study. Allowing for 20% drop out, the number of participants required in each group is 34 (total sample size is 102).  

Analyses: All analyses will follow an intention to treat principal. The primary aim is to examine differences in body weight between the enhanced, traditional and wait-list control group at the six month primary time point. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) will be used to examine change in weight from baseline to 6 months. The model will include fixed effects for time, group, the time x group interaction and the stratification variable, and a random intercept will be used to account for the repeated measures on individuals. Differences between groups in change (baseline to 6 months) will be compared using an alpha level of 0.016 to account for multiple comparisons. Differences between groups in secondary outcomes will be examined using GLMM using a link function appropriate to the outcome and using an alpha level of 0.05. The LMMs provide unbiased estimates of the treatment effect under the assumption that data are missing at random. However, sensitivity analyses such as multiple imputation and pattern mixture modelling will be undertaken to investigate the robustness of conclusions to different assumed missing data mechanisms. Analysis of mediators will be examined using established frameworks (53) and analysis of moderators will be assessed by including an interaction term in the model of interest.  All analyses will be conducted using Stata. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overweight and obesity is highly prevalent among Australian adults and being overweight or obese increases the risk of developing stroke, coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. For optimum health and to prevent the development of chronic diseases individuals should aim to maintain Body Mass Index in the range 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2. For individuals who are overweight or obese, weight loss of &gt;5% is a key prevention and treatment recommendation to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Traditional weight loss interventions combining physical activity and dietary behaviour change are only modestly effective, as interventions often fail to achieve the weight loss target of 5%, on average achieving only 3.3% weight loss.  Consequently, the efficacy of behavioural weight loss interventions need to be improved. One potential way to enhance the efficacy of traditional weight loss interventions is to concurrently target improvements in sleep health.

The Move, Eat &amp; Sleep Study is a 3-arm randomised controlled trial to assess the relative efficacy of a physical activity, dietary behaviour, and sleep health intervention (enhanced), compared with a physical activity and dietary behaviour only intervention (traditional), and wait-list control for weight loss, in overweight/obese adults. The primary outcome of weight change will be assessed after 6 months and followed up at the 12 month time point.

It is hypothesised that both the enhanced and the traditional interventions will achieve a statistically significant reduction in weight relative to the wait list control at 6 months primary time point, and that the enhanced intervention will achieve a statistically significant greater reduction in weight relative to the traditional intervention at 6 months. 
 
The Move, Eat &amp; Sleep study is a technology-based, multi-behavioural intervention to promote weight loss. This will be achieved by increasing physical activity levels, improving dietary quality and reducing energy intake to promote weight loss, and in the Enhanced group also improving sleep health. Participants will receive access to a modified version of the Balanced app, body weight scales to self-monitor weight, a Fitbit to self-monitor activity and sleep behaviours, a participant handbook and additional email and text message based support, and personalised dietary counselling.</summary>
