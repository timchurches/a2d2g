  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a training programme for care staff in the precognition and detection of depression. Personal carers in residential facilities and direct carers in community services will participate in five 1.5 hour training sessions over 5 weeks that provide information on the nature and prevalence of depression amongst the elderly, symtoms and comorbidities. They will be taught to use a simple checklist of depression symtomatology, how to communicate with older depressed people, how to respond to depression, and how to facilitate referral of depressed people to appropriate services. Registered Nurses (residential) and Case managers (community) will particpate in these four sessions and two further 2 hours sessions focused on the use of standardised instruments to assess for depression, and liaison with General Practitioners.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of our research program is to improve pathways to care for frail older people with depression. The aim of this project is to demonstrate the efficacy of the beyondblue depression training program for aged care staff, through a randomised controlled study across community and residential aged care services. The specific hypotheses that will be tested are that, when compared with a wait-list control group that receives no training, aged care staff: (i) will demonstrate improved knowledge of late-life depression and more positive attitudes to the care of older people with depression, (ii) will demonstrate improved detection rates of depression among their care recipients and a higher number of referrals to medical services, (iii) will report improved self-efficacy in relation to caring for older people with depression, perceive fewer barriers to the provision of such care, and demonstrate improved care practices.</summary>
