Experimental: Eltrombopag - Eligible subject will receive a starting dose of eltrombopag of 200 milligrams (mg) (100 mg for subjects of East Asian heritage). Dose modifications of eltrombopag will be permitted by 100 mg increments (50 mg increments for East Asians) to a lowest dose of 100 mg (50 mg for East Asian heritage) or a maximum dose of 300 mg (150 mg for East Asian heritage) in order to maintain platelet counts at a safe and effective level (i.e. a level sufficient to avoid platelet transfusions and bleeding events). Subjects will receive azacitidine 75 mg/meter^2 subcutaneously once daily for 7 days (+/- 3 day treatment window permitted) every 28 days, for at least 6 cycles if tolerated and until they are no longer receiving benefit (defined as at least stable disease per the investigator's assessment) or until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity/adverse event. The subject may receive eltrombopag daily for the full 28 days each cycle for as long as the subject is receiving azacitidine

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - Eligible subject will receive eltrombopag matching placebo. Subjects will receive azacitidine 75 mg/meter^2 subcutaneously once daily for 7 days (+/- 3 day treatment window permitted) every 28 days, for at least 6 cycles if tolerated and until they are no longer receiving benefit (defined as at least stable disease per the investigator's assessment) or until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity/adverse event. The subject may receive eltrombopag daily for the full 28 days each cycle for as long as the subject is receiving azacitidine

    <summary>Eltrombopag olamine (SB-497115-GR) is an orally bioavailable, small molecule thrombopoietin
      receptor agonist that may be beneficial in medical disorders associated with
      thrombocytopenia. Eltrombopag has been shown to increase platelet counts in patients with
      thrombocytopenia from various etiologies (Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura [ITP], liver
      disease, aplastic anemia and chemotherapy induced thrombocytopenia). Approximately 350
      subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (175 into the eltrombopag arm and 175 into the
      placebo arm). Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled into the azacitidine. Subjects with
      intermediate-1, intermediate-2 or high risk MDS by IPSS, and baseline platelet count of &lt;75
      Giga (10^9) per liter (Gi/L) will only be enrolled. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      parallel group, placebo-controlled study designed to explore the platelet supportive care
      effects of eltrombopag versus placebo in combination with the standard of care
      hypomethylating agent, azacitidine. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      effect of eltrombopag versus placebo on the proportion of subjects who are platelet
      transfusion free during the first 4 cycles of azacitidine therapy. Key secondary endpoints
      include overall survival, disease response, and disease progression.</summary>
