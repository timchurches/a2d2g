    <concealment>All eligible patients enrolled on the study will be entered into the central randomisation system. The patient number assigned at the time of randomisation will be the primary identifier for the patient. Randomisation will be performed by the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre which will provide a centralised tele-randomisation service that will randomly allocate patients to nicotinamide or placebo groups in a 1:1 ratio stratified by baseline skin cancer count, gender, transplant group (renal, liver, heart, lung), current retinoid and/or mTor inhibitor use and study site. The pharmacist will provide the drug kit allocated by the system for the patient, recording the kit number in the pharmacy log. The study number, patient name and MRN will then be written on the medication bottle.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised to nicotinamide or placebo in a 1:1 ratio using a minimisation method stratified by baseline skin cancer count, (6 or more versus 2-5 previous nonmelanoma skin cancers), gender, study site, transplant group (renal, liver, heart, lung), current oral retinoid use and current mTor inhibitor use.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to assess the effect of nicotinamide (vitamin B3) on nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence in renal, hepatic, heart and lung transplant recipients. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have had a transplant more than 12 months ago. You should be experiencing current immune suppression and have a past history of at least two confirmed nonmelanoma skin cancers within the past 5 years. Trial details Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take two 500mg nicotinamide (vitamin B3) tablets daily for 12 months, whilst those in the other group will take two placebo (inactive) tablets daily instead. Participants will not know which group they are in until the end of the trial. Participants will be regularly assessed over the treatment period to determine the efficacy of nicotinamide in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancers and the safety of this treatment in transplant recipients.</summary>
