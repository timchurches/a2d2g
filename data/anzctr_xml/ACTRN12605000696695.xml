  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a history of moderate to severe pain [and who have poorly controlled pain] will be randomised to receive either HHER or MS Contin for 7 [+2] days.  Aim is to establish that HHER and MS Contin are equivalent [non-inferior] at an equianalgesic dose ratio of 1:7.5</interventions>

    <sequence>Patients successfully completing stabilisation are randomised to receive either HHER or MS Contin.  Equal number of each of the two treatment groups [test or reference medication] in each block of randomisation numbers [determined by statistician].  Each study centre assigns individual patients a double-blind randomisation number [and corresponding study medication] in ascending and sequential order.</sequence>
