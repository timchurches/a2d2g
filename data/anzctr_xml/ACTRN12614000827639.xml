  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consist of Senior Chef (Nutrition) programme, Steady As You Go programme (SAYGO; physical activity) or both

Participants will be randomised into 1) Senior Chef Group, 2) SAYGO group, 3) a group consisting of both Senior Chef and SAYGO or 4) the control group.  Participants in the group 3 (Senior Chef and SAYGO) will attend 2 classes in a week.  

The Senior Chef is an 8-week programme consisting of 3-hour weekly hands-on cooking classes followed by sharing the food cooked that day, nutrition education including menu planning, budgeting and shopping tips delivered by a trained facilitator.  There are 10 participants per class

The Steady As You Go programme (SAYGO) is a 1-hour weekly for 10-week strength and balance exercise programme based on the adapted Otago Exercise Programme.  The programmed focuses on peer-led exercises, rather than peer-led education alone.  There are 10 participants per class.  The exercise programme consist of seated flexibility, range of motion, and seated aerobic exercises taught by a trained instructor.  SAYGO is between 2-4 on a 10 point Rating of Perceived Exertion scale.

Facilitators will maintain an attendance log  to monitor adherence.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group is the social course where people gather to do activities that are productive, share a cup of tea and talk. It takes about two hours every week for 10 weeks.  The focus of the social groups is contact and interaction. There is no educational focus. Refreshments are usually part of the social outing.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Age-associated frailty is a significant cause of disability and dependency.  Physical frailty and falls predict, fractures, mobility/functional decline, residential care admissions, hospitalisations and death.  Often, older people who fell have serious personal and societal consequences. Studies showed that maintaining function and quality of life (QOL) are preferred over longevity, and healthy lifestyle behaviours benefit QOL and function.  However physical activity is low and nutrition risk high in older people. To date, most studies test a single programme (either physical activity or nutrition) with few combining both strategies in community setting.  

This study aims to answer this main question Does eating well and moving about more make life happier and easier by decreasing falls and reducing frailty?  We believe physical activity go with active ageing and new ways to cook will help an older person to eat better.  Changing the way of living and ageing will prevent the progression of frailty and reduce the risk of falling over.  The study, if successful, will have a positive impact on reducing health services and prolonging healthy life expectancy.  </summary>
