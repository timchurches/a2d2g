  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study looks at the use of oestrogen cream or a simple lubricant to treat vaginal dryness in women on Arimidex for breast cancer.
The aim of the study is to objectively measure vaginal atrophy in symptomatic breast cancer patients taking Arimidex and to compare the effectiveness, local vaginal effects and systemic absorption of 17-beta oestradiol (vagifem) with vaginal estriol (ovestin) and a non-hormonal lubricant, Replens.  In addition we will evaluate quality of life and sexual function before and after use of topical oestrogen or replens. Eighty four postmenopausal women will be recruited from menopause, breast and oncology clinics in New South Wales and Western Australia. To participate women must have a history of estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer, postmenopausal, taking Arimidex for at least 6 weeks and complaining of symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. Patients will be asked to attend 4 clinic visits over a total of 4 months. All particiapnts will be monitored at 2, 6 and 12 weeks following the start of treatment and the changes in their serum oestradiol levels will be recorded.</summary>
