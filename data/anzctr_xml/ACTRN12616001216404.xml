  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will involve healthy, undernourished and obese, younger (18-50 years, n=16 in each group) and older (older than 65 years, n=16 in each group) adults. Healthy subjects will have a BMI of 22-30kg/m2, undernourished of &lt;22 kg/m2 and obese subjects of 30-40kg/m2. 

The participant receives a single 450mL preload per study visit  in a randomised, crossover fashion of: i) 30 grams Whey Protein Isolate with diet lime cordial flavouring or ii) Water control with diet lime cordial flavouring. All preloads contain 100 microliter of 13C sodium acetate to enable measurement of gastric emptying via 13CO2 in the breath. Gastric emptying rate and intragastric meal distribution will be determined using 3D ultrasound.

Appetite sensation questionnaires in the form of a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) are measured and blood samples are collected for concentrations of gut hormones, amino acids and glucose.

A standard buffet meal is provided at 180 minutes following the preload and the participant has 30 minutes to eat until comfortably full. The buffet meal consists of 300ml orange juice, 600ml water, 375ml iced coffee, 4 slices white bread, 4 slices brown bread, 100g deli leg ham, 100g virginian chicken, 4 slices cheese, 100g tomato, 100g cucumber, 100g lettuce, 2 portions mayonnaise, 2 portions margarine, 1 medium apple, 1 medium banana, 200g chocolate custard, 150g fruit salad, 200g strawberry yoghurt, and a 14g milky way bar. Energy intake from this meal will be quantified.

Each volunteer receives one of each of the 2 treatments on each of the 2 study days. Each study visit is separated by no less than 3 days. Each visit lasts approximately 4 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy intake at buffet meal</outcome>
      <timepoint>Buffet meal is presented at 180 minutes after preload consumption and the subject is allowed to freely consume food until comfortably full for 30 minutes (until t= 210 minutes). The weight of the foods will be recorded before and after it is offered to the subjects and energy intake and macronutrient composition calculated subsequently using commercially available software (Foodworks 3.01, Xyris Software, Highgate Hill, QLD, Australia).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gastric emptying rate assessed by three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography</outcome>
      <timepoint>3D ultrasound defines the fraction of the meal emptied from the stomach, including 50% emptying time (T1/2), during the study. Ultrasound images will be taken at t= -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165 and 180 min, where t=0 is at just after drink consumption.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ageing is associated with a physiological reduction of appetite and energy intake, which has been called the anorexia of ageing. Dietary supplementation with liquid protein preparations is now used frequently to increase energy and protein intake in older adults in both institutionalized and community-dwelling populations. Although the latter would appear a logical approach, evidence for success of increased energy intake in older individuals is limited. Urgent investigation is warranted to determine the optimal load of protein that can be incorporated into their diet to assist in sparing muscle mass without reducing their appetite. Moreover, weight loss protein-rich diets are often recommended for obese older adults in the same manner as for younger adults. In young adults, obese individuals exhibit a less precise compensatory response to ingested energy than lean individuals. Although only a limited number of studies have examined the effects of state of nutrition in elderly on the regulation of appetite, there is persuasive evidence of substantial differences between undernourished and healthy older people, which may potentially represent an outcome of and/or contribute to the undernourished state. A common strategy to increase energy intake and body weight in undernourished elderly is the use of nutritional supplements, and this is now almost standard practice. Usually such supplements are provided as mixed macronutrient high-energy drinks. Because of the increasing awareness of the major muscle loss that preferentially accompanies weight loss in older people, and its particular adverse effects, there has been a recent, marked, increase in the preferential administration of protein in these supplements and the use of protein-enriched supplements in an attempt to preserve, or even increase, muscle mass, in both institutionalized and community-dwelling populations. Such recommendations and use are, however, largely empirical. Our understanding of the feeding responses, and mechanisms underlying them, of undernourished and obese older people to protein is very limited and will be increased greatly by the proposed study.

To aim of the study is to characterise in undernourished and obese, young and older individuals, the effect of different oral protein loads on energy intake, appetite, antral area, gastric emptying, plasma concentrations of amino acids, hormones (i.e. CCK, PYY, ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and insulin) and glucose, and to determine the relationship between the suppression of appetite and energy intake by protein with intragastric and small intestinal mechanisms.</summary>
