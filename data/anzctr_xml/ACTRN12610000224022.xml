  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be expected to attend two 60 minute group exercise classes per week for a 12 week period.  The classes will be facilitated by qualified instructors. The classes will be in a circuit format, with minimal equipment, and are suitable for women of all fitness levels and can be modified to accommodate individual needs.  Each participant will be given a pedometer to wear and will be asked to record their daily steps, and other physcial activity in their exercise log.  During the 12 week program participants will also be required to attend  4 nutrition and lifestyle workshops facilitated by a qualified nutritionist.</interventions>
    <comparator>No exercise, no nutrition workshops for 15 months.  Then the comparator group undergoes the 12 week exercise and nutrition program.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in waist circumference.

Participants will have their height, weight, waist and hip circumference, and Body Mass Index (BMI) measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 64 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved average metabolic profile (lower blood pressure (BP)), improved cholesterol fraction, lower fasting glycemia, reduction in markers of inflammation).

Participants will have fasting blood collected for analysis, and their blood pressure taken.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 64 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improved scores in tests of self-efficacy and social support for physical activity and self-reported diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, motives for physical activity and quality of life.
These measures will be assessed via self-reported questionnaires.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 64 weeks.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participant satisfaction interview with a semi-structured format.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Waist circumference interviews; 2 types, 1. Those maintaining waist loss from 12 weeks and 2. Those not maintaining waist loss from 12 weeks.

These interviews seek to understand the reasons behind participants' level of success in maintaining waist loss.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this intervention are:
1. To conduct environmental audits of obesogenic factors in the community and monitor any changes that might occur over the period of the study.
2. To demonstrate that central obesity (as measured by waist circumference) and associated diabetes risk among Indigenous women can be reduced and this reduction can be maintained with a locally planned and managed group-based physical fitness intervention.
3. To understand how individual and micro/macro environmental factors contribute to waist circumference trajectories from post-program to 3 and 12-months post-program.</summary>
