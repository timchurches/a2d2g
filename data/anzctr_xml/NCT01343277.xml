  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - The OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study drug to date of death from any cause. If the participant is alive or the vital status is unknown, the participant will be censored at the date the participant will be last known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 3 years 8 months (From Study start date [27 May 2011] up to final analysis data cut-off [05 January 2015]</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) - The Progression-Free Survival (PFS) was assessed as median number of months from baseline until the first documented sign of disease progression (increase in disease; radiographic, clinical, or both) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred earlier. Independent Data Monitoring Committee performed ongoing safety monitoring and conducted the interim analysis after 189 death events and 329 PFS events were observed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 2 years 4 months (From Study start date [27 May 2011] up to interim analysis data cut-off [16 September 2013])</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Progression - Time interval in months between the date of randomization and the date of disease progression or death due to progression, whichever occurred first.
Independent Data Monitoring Committee performed ongoing safety monitoring and conducted the interim analysis after 189 death events and 329 PFS events were observed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 2 years 4 months (From Study start date [27 May 2011] up to interim analysis data cut-off [16 September 2013])</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate - The objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants who achieved a Complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as best responses. according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST). CR defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes must have reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeter (mm). PR defined as at least 30 percent (%) decrease in sum of the diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the Baseline sum diameters. Confirmed responses are those that persist on repeat imaging study for at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. Independent Data Monitoring Committee performed ongoing safety monitoring and conducted the interim analysis after 189 death events and 329 PFS events were observed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 2 years 4 months (From Study start date [27 May 2011] up to interim analysis data cut-off [16 September 2013])</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Duration of response is defined as the time from the date of initial documentation of a response (CR or PR) to the date of first documented evidence of progressive disease (or relapse for participants who experience CR during the study) or death.
Independent Data Monitoring Committee performed ongoing safety monitoring and conducted the interim analysis after 189 death events and 329 PFS events were observed.</outcome>
      <timepoint>approximately 2 years 4 months (From Study start date [27 May 2011] up to interim analysis data cut-off [16 September 2013])</timepoint>
