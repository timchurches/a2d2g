  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study investigates a new model of  physiotherapy rehabilitation for patients admitted to  inpatient rehabilitation  at the Peter James Centre after surgery for a fractured hip. It is a randomised controlled trial consisting of an intervention group and a control group. The intervention group will receive 3x 15 minute sessions of physiotherapy 5 days/week and the control group will receive usual care of 1x 45 minute session of physiotherapy 5 days/week. This will commence after admission to  inpatient rehabilitation and continue until discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. The physiotherapy for both groups will consist of walking practice, therapeutic exercises and functional task practice. Only frequency and duration of sessions will be different between the two groups. Physiotherapy treatment records will be used to assess fidelity/compliance and content of the program. Separate physiotherapists and allied health assistants with a range of experience levels will independently deliver the program to the intervention and control groups. Information sessions and training will be provided to these staff by the principal researcher. Any new staff commencing during the study period will also be trained. Adherence to the protocol will be ensured by the principal researcher with weekly physiotherapy treatment record checks.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation
The primary dependent variable of the de Morton Mobility Index (DEMMI) was               used to determine sample size. Based on a previous study in this population and setting power at 80% and alpha at 5%, a sample size of 72 patients is required, 36 in each group to detect a clinically significant difference of 6 points in the DEMMI assuming a standard deviation of 8.9 (de Morton et al 2013).

Data analyses
Intention to treat analysis will be performed for all participants in the study using all available data. Between group differences of primary and continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed with ANCOVA using the baseline measures as covariates. The proportion of participants in each group achieving a minimally important change in mobility (DEMMI  greater than or equal to 6 points) will be analysed with relative risk rations. Categorical secondary outcomes will be analysed with Pearson chi square or risk ratios as appropriate. Survey data will be analysed descriptively.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to investigate if providing three short 15 minute sessions of physiotherapy each therapy day for patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation after hip fracture is more effective than providing the usual one long 45 minute session each therapy day in improving mobility.  

The secondary aims of this study are to:
*	Determine if this model of care reduces length of stay in this patient group
*	Determine whether more walking is achieved in 3 shorter sessions 5 days/week versus 1 longer session  5 days/week both within and outside of therapy sessions
*	Determine whether there is an increased chance of returning home with this model of care
*	Determine if Functional Independence Measure Scores for mobility improve faster in the distributed model
*	Compare the 30 day readmission rate after discharge in both groups
*	Determine if the new model of care is acceptable to patients and physiotherapists by means of a brief survey about the project.
