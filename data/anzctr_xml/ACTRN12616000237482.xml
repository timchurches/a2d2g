  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a single session of chiropractic care for the intervention group. The session will take approximately ten minutes. The entire spine and both sacroiliac joints will be assessed for segmental dysfunction, and treated where deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor with fifteen years clinical experience. The clinical indicators that will be used to assess the function of the spine prior to and after each spinal manipulation intervention include assessing for tenderness to palpation of the relevant joints, manually palpating for restricted intersegmental range of motion, assessing for palpable asymmetric intervertebral muscle tension, and any abnormal or blocked joint play and end-­-feel of the joints. All of these biomechanical characteristics are used by the chiropractors as clinical indicators of spinal dysfunction. All of the spinal manipulations carried out in this study will be high-­-velocity, low-­-amplitude thrusts to the spine or pelvic joints. This is a standard manipulation technique used by chiropractors, and is also referred to as spinal adjustments. The mechanical properties of this intervention have been investigated; and although the actual force applied to the subject's spine depends on the therapist, the patient, and the spinal location of the manipulation, the general shape of the force-­-time history of spinal manipulations is very consistent and the duration of the thrust is always less than 200 milliseconds. The high-­-velocity type of manipulation is chosen specifically because previous research has shown that reflex electromyographic activation observed after manipulations only occurred after high-­- velocity, low-­-amplitude manipulations (as compared with lower-­-velocity mobilizations). This manipulation technique has also been previously used in studies that have investigated the neurophysiological effects of spinal manipulation. The washout period for this project is 1 week.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is a single session. The subjects head and/or spine will be moved in ways that include passive and active movements, similar to what is done by the chiropractor that provide actual chiropractic treatment during the spinal manipulation intervention. Thus this control intervention involves the subjects being moved into the manipulation setup positions similar to how the chiropractor would normally setup a subject prior to applying the thrust to the spine to achieve the manipulations. Loading a joint, as is done prior to spinal manipulation has been shown to alter paraspinal proprioceptive firing in anesthetized cats, and therefore will be carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to end-­-range-­-of-­-motion when passively moving the subjects. No spinal manipulation will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is intended to act as a sham treatment session as well as to act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that would occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a subject/patient for a manipulation.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The outcome measure will be assessed pre and post spinal manipulation session and pre and post control intervention session. The primary outcome measure that will be included is haemodynamic kinetics of the Tibialis Anterior (TA) muscle, which will be measured with NIRS while the subject performs five maximum voluntary contractions of their TA muscle.  
Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a method using the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum to measure the relative changes in the hemoglobin concentration through the use of light attenuation at multiple wavelengths. This is a non-invasive technique using near-infrared light in a range of several transmitters and receivers placed in a matrix over the muscle. NIRS provides local information about hemoglobin, changes in and independent measurements of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin concentrations.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>15 subclinical pain subjects will be recruited via advertising within the New Zealand College of Chiropractic community. Participants may include students, staff, faculty, and previous patients of the Colleges chiropractic centre and also family, friends and acquaintances of the New Zealand College of Chiropractic community. Subjects will be eligible for inclusion if they are English speaking, aged 18-50, and have previously sought chiropractic care, and have some history of recurring spinal dysfunction such as mild pain, ache, and/or stiffness with or without a history of known trauma. </inclusivecriteria>

    <statisticalmethods>A multifactorial repeated measures ANOVA will be used to assess for within and between group differences. TIME (pre and post intervention measures) and INTERVENTION (Chiro vs. Control) will be used as factors. A priori pairwise comparisons of the pre and post intervention data will be carried out when an interactive effect is significant. Significance will be set at P = .05.

Allocation of participants will be carried out using an online randomisation programme. The randomisation sequence will created using Minimizer (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) with a 1:1 allocation to control and experimental groups. Allocation will remain concealed until after the baseline assessment has taken place. Participants and the chiropractors providing care during the study will not be blinded to group allocation. Outcomes assessors and data analysts will remain blinded to group allocation throughout the study period.

Sample size calculations  are  based  on detecting a difference in a continuous response variable from independent control and experimental participants with one control per experimental participant. Calculations are made based on the changes observed in our previous study that investigated changes in force of lower limb muscles pre and post a chiropractic adjustment session. If the true difference in haemodynamic kinetics between the experimental session and the control session has an effect size of 0.5 we will need 11 participants to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with the test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. To allow for attrition during the trial and relative uncertainty relating to power outcomes we will enroll 15 participants in this trial.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over the past ten years several research groups have demonstrated that spinal manipulation can change various aspects of nervous system function, including altered motor control, cognitive processing, reaction time, and the speed at which the brain processes information. Although motor control is altered after spinal manipulation, it is not yet clear if these alterations result in clinically significant changes to outcomes that are important for functional performance. 
A basic understanding of the mechanisms behind such changes needs further research. Various neurophysiological techniques can be utilized to study specific types of underlying mechanisms. In recent years, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been utilized to gain a better understanding of muscle function. This proposed study will build on our previous work by investigating whether spinal manipulation influences muscles hemodynamic kinetics using NIRS. This randomised controlled trial will be conducted at the Centre for Chiropractic Research at the New Zealand College of Chiropractic. A within-­-subject crossover design with a one-­-week washout period between interventions will be used to assess 15 subjects.</summary>
