  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention group members used of a physical activity self-management program delivered via the internet. The intervention program was branded "Get Set" and was developed as an eight module, highly interactive internet program based upon social cognitive theory, incorporating education, quizzes, goal-setting, self-reflection and positive role-modelling. Modules were released weekly onto the Get Set website. Intervention group participants received a one-on-one introduction to the Get Set website prior to commencement of the program, and were encouraged to log in at least weekly for the programs eight week duration.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group participants were encouraged to continue their normal activities. At the end of the 20 week randomised controlled trial, control participants were offered the opportunity to undertake the intervention.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants were recruited via Novita Childrenâ€™s Services, the sole provider of community-based therapy, equipment, and support services to children with physical disabilities in South Australia. They were sent a letter describing the study and inviting them to participate. Once eligibility and participation in the study was confirmed, participants were matched for Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level (the single most important determinant of physical activity level in this population) and randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Allocation was concealed, since recruitment of the entire cohort of participants was completed prior to any subjects being allocated to groups.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each participant's name was recorded on a card and these were then sorted into three gross motor function categories (based on the severity of their cerebral palsy). Cards from each category were then placed face down and shuffled. Two names were drawn at a time to create random pairs of participants from the same gross motor function category. A coin toss was then used to randomly assign one person from each pair into the intervention group (internet-program), with the remaining person going into the control group (usual care). This process was completed for each gross motor function category. Where
there was an odd number of participants in a gross motor function category, a coin toss determined the group allocation of the lone participant.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: To determine whether an online interactive intervention can improve physical activity and related behaviors in adolescents with cerebral palsy. 
Methods: Adolescents (11-17 year old) with cerebral palsy were recruited to this randomised controlled trial. Intervention participants used an 8-week online physical activity self-management program which incorporated education, self-reflection, goal setting and positive role modelling. Blinded assessments were undertaken at baseline, 10 weeks and 20 weeks. Outcomes included exercise knowledge, attitudes, intention and self-efficacy scales; self-reported physical and sedentary activity; objective physical activity; and functional capacity. 
Results: 41 adolescents (mean age 13y 7m: Standard Deviation 1y 8m; males n=26) participated. At the 10-week follow-up, the intervention group showed favourable changes (relative to the control group) approaching statistical significance for exercise knowledge (effect size 0.56, p=0.08) and physical activity behaviour as measured by pedometer (weekly step counts effect size 0.56, p=0.06; weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity effect size 0.50, p=0.06; weekly distance effect size 0.96, p=0.05). At the 20-week follow-up similar trends for change were observed but the effect sizes had weakened, suggesting a washout effect. 
Interpretation: Given the encouraging trends for change, interactive online programs may offer an effective alternative for participants unable to attend face-to-face programs.</summary>
