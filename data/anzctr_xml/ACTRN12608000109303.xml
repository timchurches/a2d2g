  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>Gynaecological laparoscopic procedure for resection of stage I-IV endometriosis, hysterectomy, myomectomy, salpingectomy, oophorectomy, cystectomy, urethropexy, adhesiolysis or any combination of these surgeries who would require postoperative drainage</healthcondition>

  </conditions>
  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants who are determined to require post-operative drainage will be allocated to receive either a suction or non-suction #14FC Bellovac drain (AstraTech, Sweden).  Drains are inserted at the end of the procedure through the left-lateral port site.  The drain is removed by nursing staff following medical review by the surgical team.  The duration the drain is left in situ is dependent upon medical review.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be two groups, suction and non-suction drainage, both groups will receive a drain.  The vacuum pack of the Bellovac drain will be compressed in patients randomised to suction and will be left open in the non-suction group</comparator>

      <outcome>Nausea associated with wearing and removal of pelvic drains and following drain removal</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immediately prior, during and immediately after drain removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Transvaginal ultrasound estimation of residual pelvic fluid</outcome>
      <timepoint>When considered medically appropriate to remove the drain, a transvaginal ultrasound will be performed</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Women undergoing a laparoscopic procedure for resection of stage I-IV endometriosis, hysterectomy, myomectomy, salpingectomy, oophorectomy, cystectomy, urethropexy, adhesiolysis or any combination of these surgeries who would possibly require post-operative drainage were approached for inclusion in the study; female aged 18-80; fluent in spoken and written English, able to understand implications of their involvement in the study and those who consent to involvement in the study.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria include patients who may become distressed due to involvement in the study,  intercurrent conditions precluding participation, known or suspected pregnancy and known or suspected gynecological malignancy.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects will be approached at pre-operative clinical visits and will be provided with a Patient Information Sheet and Consent Form.  The aims, procedure and risks of the study will be explained by the investigator and patients will be provided with the opportunity to discuss concerns before informed consent is obtained.  
All subjects who are determined to require post-operative drainage will be allocated to suction or non-suction drainage.  
All subjects who are determined to require post-operative drainage will be allocated to suction or non-suction drainage.  Randomisation slips will be placed in sequential opaque envelopes displaying only the randomisation number.  Envelopes will remain unopened until the surgeon makes the decision to use a drain.  Envelopes will then be opened sequentially and the surgeon will be provided with the subjectsâ€™ group allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocations were provided using computer-generated randomisation blocks to ensure complete randomisation across demographic fields and to provide a balanced data pool across both groups throughout the trial.</sequence>
