    <interventions>This study will be conducted using a randomised, crossover design.

All participants will be asked to attend a screening session (in order to determine their eligibility) and five test sessions with lunches varying in energy content. During the screening visit, participants will be asked to give informed consent, to complete several questionnaires, and some basic anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, body composition, waist and hip circumferences will be taken. Following this, participants will be asked to attend five test sessions, with a minimum of seven-day washout period between the test sessions. Participants will be asked to consume a pre-package study breakfast (around 500 kcal) in the morning on the test day. The same study breakfast will be provided on all five test days and participants will be asked to finish the entire study breakfast. During each test session, participants will be randomly allocated to receive one of the five test lunches, e.g. 150 kcal, 300 kcal, 600 kcal, 900 kcal or 1200 kcal of noodle soup. Noodle soup has been chosen as the test lunch as it is a popular and typical lunch in Asia. All test lunches contain the same ingredients, e.g. noodle, miso dashi broth, sesame seeds, chicken, zucchini, spring onion, mung bean, sea weed, fish cake, sesame oil, and canola oil, albeit the proportion of each ingredient differs between test lunches. Thus the amount of macronutrient and energy density vary across treatments, ranging from 18-26 g for protein, 4-63 g for fat, 14-136 g for carbohydrate, 0.27-1.81 kcal/g for energy density. The test lunches are matched for palatability, sensory properties, and weight. They will be covertly manipulated and hence participants will be blinded to the treatments they receive. Participants will be asked to consume the entire portion of the test lunch served. They will also be asked to rate their appetite every fifteen minutes for the first hour and every 30 minutes thereafter until they return for their evening meal. Participants are allowed to leave the study site after lunch and they will be asked to return for their evening meal 5 to 5.5 hours after lunch. They will be given a pre-package afternoon snacks before they leave the study site and they are allowed to have the afternoon snacks if they are hungry before the evening meal (optional). Participants are allowed to consume as little or as much food as they wish till they are comfortably full (i.e. ad libitum intake) for the evening meal. On each test day, participants are allowed to consume one black coffee or tea without sugar. All participants will be asked to complete a one-day food diary on the test day in order to monitor their adherence to the study protocol. In addition, all participants will be asked to complete some sensory measures during the study. Participants will also be encouraged to continue their habitual diet and physical activity during the intervention. </interventions>
    <comparator>This is a randomised crossover study where participants will act as their own control. The habitual calorie intake for lunch for a male participant will be 600 kcal. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy compensation, i.e. energy intake during an ad libitum evening meal. Ad libitum intake of the evening meal will be measured by weighing the leftovers on the plate. Calories and energy compensation will then be calculated. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Ad libitum dinner. During each test day, participants will leave the study site after lunch and they will return to the study site five to six hours later for their evening meal. Participants are allowed to consume any amount of food as they wish during the evening meal (ad libitum intake).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satiety. On the testing session days, participants will be asked to record their appetite ratings on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). The appetite-rating questionnaire will include questions on hunger, thirst, desire to eat, prospective consumption, and fullness.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to rate their appetite before lunch (baseline), every 15 minutes for the first hour after lunch and every 30 minutes thereafter until they return for their evening meal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Questionnaires on individual characteristics, food choice and preference will be used to determine whether the degree of energy compensation could be explained by these variables.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete the following questionnaires: Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, Body Perception Questionnaire, Intuitive Eating Scale, Dietary Practice Questionnaire, Food Choice Questionnaire, Food Preference Questionnaire, and Power of Food Scale during the screening visit. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>In order to provide 90% of power to detect a mean difference of 400 kcal in energy compensation between any of the two treatments using a two-sided significant level of 5%, 17 participants will be required with complete data. Allowing for 30% missing or unusable data, 23 participants will be recruited for this study. Baseline characteristics of the participants will be presented as arithmetic means and standard deviations. Linear mixed models with a random participant effect to account for the underlying correlation between the repeated measures will be used to examine the effects of consuming lunches with different energy content on energy compensation and 'satiety'. Statistical analyses will be conducted using Stata 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Two-sided P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant in all cases.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Numerous studies have examined the factors that lead to over consumption of energy in various population groups within an eating occasion, with partial or negative energy compensation (over consumption) at the subsequent meal. Only a limited number of studies have investigated whether people compensate for the missing calories from one meal at their subsequent meal. However no studies to date have investigated the dose-response effect of calorie reduction at one meal on energy compensation. The proposed study will provide important information on the dose-response effect of calorie reduction or calorie increment at a lunchtime meal on energy compensation at the subsequent meal and whether the degree of energy compensation could be explained by individual characteristics. </summary>
