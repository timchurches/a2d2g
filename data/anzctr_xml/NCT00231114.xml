  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Integrated Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and the average of 6-, 9-, and 12-month Follow-Up Visits. The AQLQ consists of 32 questions (scale from 1 to 7, where 7 reflects a higher quality of life). An increase in the AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life. The average of the 6-, 9-, and 12-month differences in the AQLQ Score are referred to as the "Integrated AQLQ Score."</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Symptom-Free Days (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. Symptom-Free Days were defined as days when Subject reported no cough, wheeze, breathlessness, or sputum during the daytime, and no wheeze, cough, or awakenings due to asthma symptoms during nighttime.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Total Symptom Score (Change From Baseline) - Change from Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. Total Symptom Score comprises the sum of these six asthma symptom measurements: wheeze during the night, cough during the night, wheeze during the day, cough during the day, breathlessness during the day, and sputum production during the day. Each of these symptoms is scored on a scale of 0 to 3 each day by the subject. The sum of the scores for these 6 symptoms comprises the Total Symptom Score, which measures overall asthma symptoms. The maximum score possible is 18. A lower Total Symptom score represents better asthma control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Used (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-Month Follow-up Visit. Average number of puffs per week. Rescue medications for asthma are short-acting beta-agonists that bring quick relief of asthma symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Days Rescue Medication Used (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-Month Follow-up Visit. Rescue medications for asthma are short-acting beta-agonists that bring quick relief of asthma symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. The ACQ is a self-administered patient questionnaire that also includes the patient's FEV1 value (% Predicted) that assesses individual subject asthma control. The ACQ comprises 6 questions that relate to the patient's asthma symptoms, activity limitations, and daily rescue bronchodilator use, and FEV1. Each question is scored from 0 (Better) to 6 (Worse). A decrease in the ACQ score indicates better asthma control.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (amPEF) (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. The peak expiratory flow rate measures the maximal rate at which a person can exhale air.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pre-Bronchodilator FEV1 (Percent Predicted) (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. The FEV1 is the volume of air expired during the first second of a maximal effort expiration started at total lung capacity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 Months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Post-Bronchodilator FEV1 (Percent Predicted) (Change From Baseline) - Change between Baseline and 12-month Follow-Up Visit. The FEV1 is the volume of air expired during the first second of a maximal effort expiration started at total lung capacity.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this randomized, double blind, sham-controlled study is to demonstrate the
      safety and effectiveness of the Alair System in a population of subjects with severe asthma
      who are still symptomatic despite being managed on conventional therapy of high doses of
      inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting ß2-agonists.

      The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference between Study groups in the change in
      Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) score from Baseline and the average score from
      the 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits.

      All other outcome measures assessed at 12 months post-treatment.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study comparing the
      effects of treatment with the Alair System to conventional therapy of inhaled corticosteroids
      (ICS) and long-acting ß2-agonists (LABA).

      A Bayesian adaptive approach to sample size selection is used with a randomization scheme of
      2:1 (two Alair Group Subjects for every one Control Group Subject).</summary>
