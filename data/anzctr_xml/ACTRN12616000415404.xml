  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will perform four exercises at home on a whole body vibration (WBV) board, at least 3 times a week for 10 weeks. Patients are allowed to perform the exercises more frequently if they wish but no more than once a day. Each exercise session should take ~30 minutes. 

A trained research assistant will instruct participants on the exercises to be performed during the initial home visit. This should take ~1 hour. 
All participants will be instructed to perform the following four exercises:
-	Dynamic bilateral squats for 3 sets of 8 repetitions with 3 second holds 
-	Static bilateral squats for 3 sets with 30 seconds hold
-	Bilateral marching for 30 seconds continuously 
-	Dynamic calf raises for 3 sets of 8 repetitions for each leg They can rest between exercises but for no more than 1 minute. The cool down and warm up will involve walking around their home at their own pace for 2 minutes. 

Halfway into the 10-week intervention block participants will receive an additional 30 minute home visit for instructions to increase exercise progression as appropriate. This may include increasing duration, repetitions, sets, or the use of a weighted vest.  Participants will also receive a phone call, lasting approximately 10 minutes, every ~4 weeks by the trained research assistant to ensure compliance and appropriate progression. The Fall Calendars will be collected ~monthly for 20 weeks. 

The WBV group will be instructed in how to perform the exercises on the WBV platform and in the use of the SilverMink V-988 electrically controlled exercise system supplied by SaunaGem Australia. The SilverMink WBV system is registered with Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG). The ARTG Number is 136007; the ARTG Product Number and Name: 222559 Massager, physical therapy. 

Potential risks using the unit include the possibility of falling off the platform, which could result in other injuries. However, the WBV platforms have handles that participants are able to hold onto and a safety strap to prevent them from falling backwards off the unit. Participants may experience mild discomfort and/or fatigue during and after the testing and exercise sessions. Some people may develop mild soreness in some muscles one to two days after exercise. 

If participants experience a relapse during participation they will be advised to stop exercise until after being reviewed by their physician and deemed ready to exercise again. The follow up measures for these participants will be conducted as their conditions allow. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>For participants in the control group, the treatment will be the same as in the WBV group, except that participants will perform the same four exercises on a hard stable surface at least 3 times a week for 10 weeks. A trained research assistant will instruct them on the four exercises to be performed in an initial home visit. All other aspects of the control group will be the same as in the WBV group.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>This study is a randomised, single blind control trial using a pre-post intervention design targeting proprioceptive feedback and exercise training to improve functional gait and reduce falls and falls risk in people with multiple sclerosis. 
100 subjects (age 18-65) will be randomly allocated to two groups, a control group and an intervention group (WBV group).

Over one year, five intervention blocks lasting 10 weeks will be delivered. 20 participants will be recruited for each block, 10 of which will receive a WBV platform delivered to their home. At the conclusion of the 10-week intervention block, the next 20 participants will begin the second 10-week block. This will be repeated three additional times (10-week intervention blocks 3, 4, and 5) bringing the total number of participants in each group to 50 at the end of one year. 

In addition, reliability for the choice stepping reaction time test, the physiological profile assessment, and the multiple sclerosis functional composite score will be measured at the start of each intervention block. 50 participants with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Levels ranging from 2-6 (n=10 for each of the five levels for a total of 50 participants) will return 1 week after the initial evaluation to be reassessed using the same testing protocol.
</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was selected based on several factors. First, the projects primary aim is to assess falls risk as a pilot project. The falls risk as assessed by the PPA is a good predictor of prospective falls (2) and has been validated in people with MS (1). Using data from a previous study (1) showing that falls risk score using the PPA is 2.7 (+/- 1.38) for people with MS (Disease Steps 0-5), we conducted a power and sample size analysis in STATA (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). The result showed a sample size of 108 (N1 = 54; N2 = 54; ratio: 1:1) will give 90% power to detect ~30% difference for falls risk using the PPA, assuming the use of a two tailed independent samples t-test with alpha = 0.05 (In Stata: power twomeans 0, diff(.87) sd(1.38) power(0.9)). Next, based on the recent findings of Uszynski and colleagues (3) a sample size of 104 is recommended to show differences in our secondary outcome examining functional mobility using the 6 Minute Walk test. To confirm this, we again conducted a power and sample size analysis in STATA using data from a previous study showing that people with MS in Disease Step 3 (or EDSS = ~4.5 5.5) walk ~315 meters (SD = 85) in 6 minutes (4). The result showed a sample size of 88 (N1 = 44; N2 = 44; ratio: 1:1) will give 90% power to detect ~20% difference for the 6 minute walk test outcome variable, assuming the use of a two-tailed independent samples t-test with alpha = 0.05 (In Stata: power twomeans 0, diff(60) sd(85) power(0.9)). 

With respect to reliability of outcome tests, a sample size of 50 participants provides an adequate sample size and narrow confidence intervals to sufficiently analyse reliability of the choice stepping reaction time test, the physiological profile assessment, and the multiple sclerosis functional composite score for people with MS. 

Between group comparisons of final test performance for the outcome measures will be made using General Linear Models (ANCOVA) controlled for pre-test performance. Significance is set at 0.05. Change scores (pre minus post) and effect sizes will be calculated. An estimate of the effect on falls will also be calculated to inform sample size calculations for any future trial to determine the effect on the intervention on fall rates. Participants can withdraw from the study at anytime. However, this is an intention to treat study and thus, all data collected will be included in the final analysis.

    <summary>This study examines an intervention that provides additional sensory feedback during exercise. We are investigating the effectiveness of home-based whole-body vibration training to improve mobility outcomes and reduce prospective falls and or falls risk compared to standard exercises in people with MS. 

The hypotheses of this study are that risk of falling and the number of prospective falls will be reduced and dynamic balance, endurance, and functional mobility will be improved after whole body vibration intervention and exercise compared to standard exercises alone.</summary>
