  <interventions>
    <interventions>Progenza (PRG) is composed of in vitro expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from human donor adipose tissue, frozen in vials ready to inject.  PRG will be administered in a single, once only, intra-articular injection into the knee of PRG. Two doses of PRG are being used in this trial.  Patients will be randomised to receive a single injection into the knee of either 3.9 million cells or 6.7 million cells or placebo. Participants will have follow up assessments out to 12 months post injection.  </interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo is vehicle control of cell culture media, administered as a single, once only, intra-articular injection into the knee. Participants will have follow up assessments out to 12 months post injection.</comparator>

      <outcome>To investigate the effect of PRG on study knee joint structures using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of knee joint structures via MRI will be done at Screening and 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effect of PRG on osteoarthritis biomarkers in serum and urine, specifically MIF, HA, CTX-I, C2C, CTX-II</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment of biomarkers will be done at Screening, Day 1 (pre-dose) and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To investigate the effect of PRG on activity levels using a fitbit (optional participation)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The fitbit will be used to collect activity data for the 7 days immediately prior to each clinic visit.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Additional Primary Outcome: 
The tolerability of PRG administered via a single intra-articular injection  will be measured by the incidence and nature of adverse events. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events are captured and assessed from the time of informed consent onwards, however post-treatment safety is specifically assessed at visits on Day 1, 7, 14, 28 and then at months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12.  </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study examines the safety and tolerability of Progenza, a stem cell product derived from a single donor, for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Progenza is injected once into the knee. There is a 1 in 5 chance of receiving placebo, which contains no stem cells. The study will investigate the effect of Progenza on knee pain, function and cartilage integrity. Quality of life and activity level will also be examined over the course of the study. </summary>
