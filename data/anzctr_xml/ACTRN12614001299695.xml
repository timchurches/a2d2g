    <interventions>Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either daily subcutaneous injections of APL-2 or daily subcutaneous injections of placebo, for 28 consecutive days. This study will be conducted in 4 sequential cohorts. The first cohort will receive 30 mg of APL-2 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject). 
The second cohort will receive 90 mg of APL-2 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject). 
The third cohort will receive 180 mg of APL-2 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject). 
The fourth cohort will receive 270 mg of APL-2 (4 subjects) or placebo (1 subject).
Injections will be administered by a study nurse or physician.
A second study nurse or physician will observe and document the injection procedure. An independent monitor will review the documentation and verify that each injection was correctly administered.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A computerised randomisation schedule will be made available to the pharmacy staff. The schedule will list randomisation numbers and treatment names. The pharmacist will refer to the schedule and label syringes with the randomisation number and then fill the syringes with either APL-2 or placebo as per the randomisation schedule. The name of the treatment will not be entered onto the syringe. A study nurse will administer the treatments to the study subjects. Neither the pharmacist nor the nurse administering the drug will be involved in subsequent study procedures. 
Subjects who complete the study screening assessments and meet all the eligibility criteria will be assigned a randomization number according to a randomization schedule and will receive the corresponding treatment.
Subjects will be randomized to receive either APL-2 or placebo, maintaining a 4:1 ratio in each cohort. 
The planned randomization numbers are:
R1001-R1005 for Cohort 1
R2001-R2005 for Cohort 2
R3001-R3005 for Cohort 3 
R4001-R4005 for Cohort 4.
If a subject needs to be replaced, the replacement randomisation number will be increased by 100, e.g. R2005 will be replaced by R2105. The same treatment will be allocated to the replacement subject. </concealment>

The placebo subjects from all cohorts will be pooled into a single placebo group for all summaries and presentations.
Descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], sample size [N], median, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated for quantitative safety data and frequency counts will be compiled for classification of qualitative safety data.  
No formal inferential statistics will be applied to safety assessments.
PK parameters for APL-2 will be computed from the individual serum concentrations-time data, using actual sample times using a non-compartmental approach. PK parameters will be summarized by cohort using descriptive statistics.
Pharmacodynamic data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>APL-2 is an experimental drug being developed by Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc for the potential use as a treatment for people with a broad range of blood disorders (including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)) and certain types of auto-immune diseases). PNH is caused by a small change to the individuals genes, which results in red blood cells being broken down prematurely. People with PNH typically feel tired and often see some blood in their urine. The condition is unfortunately progressive with sufferers needing increasing medical care, with an average life expectancy of only 10 years after diagnosis. The currently available treatments are insufficient to deal with this complex disease with most patients not fully responding to the treatments. APL-2 works in a different way to the drugs that are currently approved, and has been shown in animal studies to prevent the breakdown of red blood cells and keep them healthy. It is hoped that APL-2 will help improve the quality of life and reduce the severity of the condition for PNH sufferers. 
In this study, multiple ascending doses of APL 2 will be assessed in healthy volunteers. The assessments of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics following administration of single doses of APL-2 will guide decisions to further develop the drug.</summary>
