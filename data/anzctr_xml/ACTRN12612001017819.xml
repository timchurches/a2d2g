  <interventions>
    <interventions>12-week lifestyle intervention comprising of: 
(1) Physical activity (3 sessions per week).
a. 2 sessions per week of a 45-60 minute aerobic and strength training circuit/ group class (at 70-85% maximal effort) supervised by an exercise physiologist. The circuit incorporated cycling on a stationary ergometer, walking/jogging on a motorised treadmill, body-mass strength exercises and resistance training using free and machine weights.
b. 1 unsupervised session per week of brisk walking/jogging. Starting with 30 minutes and building to 45 minutes (with structured intervals) by the end of the intervention at an intensity of 70-85% maximal effort.

(2) Nutrition education - one theme (e.g. serving size, dietary fats) was prepared each week by a dietician. Printed information was administered to each participant. An accompanying short explanation (eg. 15 minutes) of this information was provided by the study coordinator (an exercise physiologist). 

(3) Cognitive behavioural therapy (1-hour group session per week - delivered by a counsellor).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Young Womens Heart Health Study aims to assess the influence and sustainability of a 12-week multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention - comprising of physical activity, nutrition education and cognitive behavioural therapy - on cardiovascular disease risk factors in young inactive Caucasian women aged 18 to 30 years who have abdominal obesity. Cardio-metabolic markers analysed at baseline, post-intervention and 3-months post intervention will include: waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure, aerobic fitness, triglycerides, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, hsCRP HDL-cholesterol, cardiac structure and function, myocardial strain, vascular endothelial function and arterial intima-media thickness. It is hypothesised that the lifestyle intervention will reduce abdominal obesity and improve cardio-metabolic markers. The outcome of this work aspires to advance the understanding of heart health in young women.</summary>
