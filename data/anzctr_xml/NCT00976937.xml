  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate benefits and risks of lixisenatide (AVE0010), in
      comparison to sitagliptin, as an add-on treatment to metformin, in obese (body mass index
      [BMI] greater than or equal to 30 kilogram per square meter [kg/m^2]) type 2 diabetic
      patients less than 50 years of age, over a period of 24 weeks of treatment.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of lixisenatide, in comparison
      to sitagliptin, as an add-on treatment to metformin on a composite endpoint of glycemic
      control in terms of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight, at Week 24.

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of lixisenatide, in comparison to sitagliptin,
      as an add-on treatment to metformin on absolute changes in HbA1c values and body weight;
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG); plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and proinsulin
      during a 2-hour standardized meal test; insulin resistance assessed by homeostatic model
      assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); beta cell function assessed by homeostatic model
      assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta); to evaluate safety, tolerability, and
      anti-lixisenatide antibody development.</summary>
