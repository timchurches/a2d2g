  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated egg allergy defined as an allergic reaction to a raw egg challenge and associated evidence of sensitisation to egg assessed by skin prick testing where a positive skin prick test has a mean weal diameter &gt;3mm to egg. An allergic reaction will be defined as at least 3 concurrent non-contact urticaria persisting for at least 5 minutes and/or generalised skin erthema and/or vomiting and/or anaphylaxis (evidence of circulatory or respiratory involvement) within 2 hours of ingestion of raw egg</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 12 months of age</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Egg allergy defined as a medically observed allergic reaction to oral cooked egg exposure. An allergic reaction will be defined as at least 3 concurrent non-contact urticaria persisting for at least 5 minutes and/or generalised skin erthema and/or vomiting and/or anaphylaxis (evidence of circulatory or respiratory involvement) within 2 hours of ingestion of the cooked egg</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 8 months of age</timepoint>

      <outcome>The development of underlining and humoral and cellular immune development. This will be assessed through blood sample analysis.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Food allergy and/or sensitisation to allergenic foods (other than egg). Sensitisation will be defined as a positive skin prick test with mean weal diameter &gt;3mm to a food allergen. A food allergy reaction will be defined as at least 3 concurrent non-contact urticaria persisting for at least 5 minutes and/or generalised skin erthema and/or vomiting and/or anaphylaxis (evidence of circulatory or respiratory involvement) within 2 hours of ingestion of a particular food.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Food allergies are common and result in a significant burden to families and the health care system. One approach to prevent food allergies may be to introduce specific foods earlier than currently recommended. The study will compare early regular introduction of egg from 4 months compared to the more common practice of egg avoidance until 8 months of age. If successful at reducing egg allergy, this approach will have a significant impact on reducing the burden of allergic disease.</summary>
