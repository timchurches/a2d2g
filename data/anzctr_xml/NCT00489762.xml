  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Housing, Heating and Health Study has enrolled 409 households with ineffective heaters,
      who have a child with asthma between 6 and 12 years.

      In the winter of 2005, houses were insulated and baseline measures taken of indoor
      temperatures, nitrogen dioxide, with more intensive indoor air quality monitoring in a
      sub-sample of 33 homes.

      Objective data are being collected on the households health and energy usage. The households
      randomly assigned to the intervention group will have new heaters installed over the summer.

      Results will be available after the follow-up data collection in 2006.</summary>
