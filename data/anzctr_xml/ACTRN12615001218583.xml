  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physiotherapy
The physiotherapy intervention will be delivered in 8x 30 minute sessions delivered over a twelve week period (1/week for 4 weeks, 1/fortnight for 8 weeks). They will also attend one  60 minute supervised gym session per week. Gym sessions will be semi-standardised and reflect same program tailored to suit the individual within the physiotherapy session. Physiotherapy treatment sessions will consists of:
i) manual hip mobilisation and stretching based on the persons clinical presentation addressing any assessed range of movement deficits in hip, knee and spinal joints; 
ii) hip muscle retraining tailored according to any assessed strength deficits with progression based on achievement of repetition and resistance goals in a semi-standardised strength program 
iii) trunk muscle retraining in same semi-standardised program
iv) functional, proprioceptive and sports- or activity-specific retraining tailored to assessed sport or occupational loads within same semi-standardised program
v) enhancing physical activity via a semi-standardised, 12 phase cardiovascular fitness program with progression based on achievement of training goal within set parameters for perceived effort and pain 
vi) education will be individualised  and could include topics including exercise, weight loss if appropriate and appropriate stretching.
This will be provided during the physiotherapy session.
The physiotherapist will supervise exercises during each visit for 15 minutes. A home exercise program will be performed independently at home 4 times per week for 60 minutes per session. An information and exercise manual will be provided to each participant as well as access to a mobile phone app which contains the home exercise program. Participants will be asked to record both the number of exercises completed and any associated symptoms for each exercise. They may record this in the app or in a paper, self-report diary if they prefer. Compliance with the home program will be reviewed at each visit, as well as use of medications and additional activity undertaken.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control
In order to control for the psychosocial contact inherent with physiotherapy treatment, the control group intervention will also receive manual therapy tailored to any assessed range of motion deficits in hip or spinal joints.
They will also receive the same semi-standardised cardiovascular training program with progression based on achievement of training goals within parameters of perceived effort and pain. 
The control participants will also receive the same individualised health education sessions covering topics such as exercise, diet, weight loss and appropriate stretching.
Control participants will not do any hip or trunk muscle retraining nor any functional proprioceptive or sports/activity specific retraining. 
Control participants will instead do a semi-standardised stretching program which may be minimally modified by exercise selected if they cause discomfort.
The control sessions will be provided with the same frequency and duration as the physiotherapy sessions and control participants will also be provided with an exercise manual (of stretches only) and access to a mobile phone app with the stretch exercise program on it. They will also attend one gym session per week, consisting entirely of stretches and cardiovascular fitness. Control participants will also be required to complete a home program consisting of stretches and cardiovascular fitness only and record compliance in the app or in a paper self-report diary. Compliance with the home program will be reviewed at each visit, as well as use of medications and additional activity undertaken.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>Individuals will respond to flyers/advertising/social media and contact the project coordinator. The project coordinator will screen interested people via telephone to partially determine their eligibility to participate using inclusion/exclusion criteria listed above. The coordinator will then organise an appointment to complete eligibility assessment at Federation University. Individuals will be tested for clinical impingement sign and x-ray alpha angle. If the individual has clinical impingement but has no hip x-ray, an x-ray investigation will be organised locally and assessed online to determine eligibility. Informed consent will be sought. If consent is given, the participant will then undergo baseline testing.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcomes measured at 12 weeks will include recruitment rate, compliance with all aspects of intervention and drop-out rate.
Secondary outcomes will be analysed using linear mixed regression models, including their respective baseline scores as a covariate, subjects as a random effect, treatment condition as a fixed factor and the covariate by treatment interaction. Participant characteristics (e.g. gender, age) will be included as covariates. We aim to detect the minimum clinically important improvement on this outcome as reported by Kemp et al.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Femoroacetabular (hip) impingement (FAI) is a painful condition that commonly affects healthy active younger adults. It can limit their ability to continue playing sport and perform normal daily activities. It can be related to extra bone formation at the hip joint known as a cam deformity. Physiotherapy is one treatment people may use to reduce their symptoms and improve their function. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to reduce pain and improve function in people with FAI. The study will compare the effects of two different physiotherapy treatment interventions.</summary>
