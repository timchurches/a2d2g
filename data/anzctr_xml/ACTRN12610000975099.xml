  <interventions>
    <interventions>1-Patients in electrical stimulation (ES)group received pelvic muscle exercises(PMEs), plus ES that was provided with a (Sonopuls- 992992(ENRAF NONIU, Dimeq Bu, Holland) using a surface electrodes. Treatment time was set for 20 minutes , twice weekly for 12 weeks, after this time the device was automatically switched off, to ensure that each patient had same treatment duration. Stimulation parameters were 30 Hz (first 10 minutes) and 50 Hz (second 10 minutes) of biphasic square waves at 300 microseconds pulse duration and output current of 24 mA of maximum tolerable intensity was given. The Sites of electrode application were placed at 2nd and 3rd sacral outflow for 30 Hz, where the lateral border of each electrode placed over the posterior superior iliac crest, and the inside border located one finger width from the midline. For 50 Hz, the electrodes were placed to the symphysis pubis, one finger width either side of the midline.

2-Patients in Biofeedback (BFB) group received PMEs and ES, additionally  for 30 mniutes twice times weekly, for 12 weeks, and  treated with BFB for 15 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks using (Reactive Biofeedback, BEAC, Stradella, Italy) a 2-channel electromyographic biofeedback apparatus, with one channel for perineal and the other for abdominal muscles and the signal received through surface electrodes. During the initial two to three sessions a strong emphasis was placed on the specificity of pelvic muscle contraction with minimum activity of abdominal muscles. During the following sessions, the exercises were designed to increase the power and endurance of the pelvic floor muscles. The patients performed these exercises while supine but later also when sitting or standing, and during normal daily activities.

The PMEs in both group1 and 2 same as for the control group.
electrical stimulation in undertaken by patient in biofeedback same as in electrical stimulation group except that duration is 30 minutes twice weekly</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients randomized to PMEs group received verbal and written instructions about PMEs from a physiotherapist. After this introduction, each patient received intensive physiotherapy for 30 minutes, for two days weekly, and up to for 12 weeks. At the first treatment visit (1-8sessions)four exercises were performed assuming with the patient in the supine and hook-lying position. Exercise 1 was PMEs contraction with a posterior pelvic tilt. Exercise 2 was PMEs contraction with a bridging motion. Exercise three was PMEs contraction with adduction against a pillow between the knees. Exercise four was PMEs contraction with external rotation of hip against an 8-pound elastic exercise band. On the second treatment visit(9-16sessions); four PMEs exercises were performed assuming with the patient sitting on an inflatable exercise ball. Exercise one was PMEs contraction with a posterior pelvic tilting and rolling on the ball in the sagittal plan. Exercise two was PMEs contraction with a posterior pelvic tilting and rolling on the ball in the oblique plan. Exercise three was bouncing vertically and performing PMEs contraction at each ascending movement. Exercise four was PMEs contraction while rolling on the ball from sitting to stand for functional training with transfers. At the third treatment visit to the clinic917-24), we invited the patients to practice PMEs contraction only before any effort or activity that might induce incontinence (sneezing, coughing, or lifting a weight). 
These set treatments were guided by the physical therapist. That encouraged the patients to perform four components of muscle function strength, endurance, speed, and control. Strength focused on recruiting as many muscle fibers as possible, maintaining the contraction at the optimum hold, while keeping the accessory muscles relaxed. 
Initial contractions were of 510s with a 1020s rest, with 1220 repetitions. Endurance exercises focused on maintaining a muscle contraction at 5060% of strength. The hold time was 2030s with an equal rest time, with sixeight repetitions. Speed was achieved by sets of quick repetitive contractions (5-10) in a 10-s span with a 20-s rest. Finally, purposeful control involved gradual recruitment to a maximal contraction and occurred in three stages, with a 5seconds hold at each stage and a slow release with a rest period of 1530seconds.</comparator>

      <outcome>Urodynamic data
Bladder volume at initial desire to void (ml)
Maximum cystometric capacity (ml)
Maximum flow rate (ml/sec)
 Detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate(cmH2O)  
Detrusor instability n(%)
Bladder compliance n(%)
Urodynamic evaluation included twin-channel subtracted cystometry and pressure-flow studies (UD 5000/5500 Dantec, Denmark), which allowed for simultaneous recording of intervesical and interurethral pressures .
The patients assumed supine position, where the urethral catheter was inserted transurethrally, and the bladder was emptied. Rectal pressure was recorded via an intrarectal transducer. For filling cystometry a medium bladder filling rate of 50 ml/minute was used. Bladder stability was assessed during cough as a provocative test. For urethral pressure profilometry, the catheter was attached to an electronic catheter puller and withdrawn at a speed of 60 mm/minute with a perfusion rate of 2 ml/minute. Measurement was repeated with voluntary contraction of the external sphincter muscle to record maximal urethral pressure. One tablet of norfloxacin was given for antibiotic prophylaxis. 
Evaluation included determination of bladder volume at initial desire to void, maximal cystometric capacity, and detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate. Bladder compliance defined as a compliance of less than 12.5 mL/cm H2O, and detrusor instability were defined as involuntary detrusor contractions at pressures greater than 15 cm. H2O.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Urinary incontinence is one of the most distressing and significant post operative problems of radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) and negatively affects the quality of life 

Urodynamic data were obtained at baseline (six to 12 weeks post-surgery), and again after 12 weeks after enrollment in therapy, according to International Continence Society (ICS) standards.
These evaluations were performed by urologists that were blinded to patient groups.

Urodynamic evaluation included twin-channel subtracted cystometry and pressure-flow studies (UD 5000/5500 Dantec, Denmark), which allowed for simultaneous recording of intervesical and interurethral pressures.</summary>
