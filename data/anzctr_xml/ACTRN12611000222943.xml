  <interventions>
    <interventions>Skin incisions with monopolar diathermy. Estimated duration for incising skin with diathermy(intervention) should take no longer than 30 seconds. The remaining time of the operation will depend on the nature and complexity of procedure and this does not relate to the intervention but more to the underlying pathology or disease being treated with the proposed surgery.
One half of the wound will be incised using a monopolar diathermy on "Cutting" setting. The depth of incision will be limited to the full depth of dermis only, just like with the scalpel incision. 
Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue will be done in the conventional method using diathermy on "Coagulation" setting.

All patients will have incisions done with a diathermy and scalpel. Randomisation process will determine which half of the skin wound is incised with diathermy and which half with scalpel.</interventions>
    <comparator>Skin incisions with scalpel blade. The skin incision with scalpel blade will be performed in the standard conventional fashion incising to the full depth of dermis. 
Dissection of the subcutaneous tissue will be done in the conventional method using diathermy on "Coagulation" setting.
All patients will have incisions done with a diathermy and scalpel. Randomisation process will determine which half of the skin wound is incised with diathermy and which half with scalpel.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>As participants will act as their own control(cross-over trial), recruitment of subjects will be from those patients on the waiting list undergoing elective hernia repair or those undergoing midline laparotomy surgery. Allocation will be done by the principal researcher (Felix Sim) and placed in a sealed opaque envelope. Each envelope will be numbered and these numbers will be allocated to each patient. Information containing which half of the wound is diathermy/scalpel will be known by the operating surgeon and principal researcher and therefore is not completely concealed.
After consent is obtained, theatre staff will handover a sealed opaque envelope to the operating surgeon outlining which half of the wound will be incised with diathermy and which half with scalpel blade.

Apart from the different method of skin incision, the rest of surgery will be carried out in the usual fashion as per the operating surgeon.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each patient will have half of their incision done with a scalpel blade and dathermy. Randomisation into one of the two groups will be done using a coin toss to determine which instrument is used to incise the lateral half or superior half of the wound. Heads will represent diathermy and tails will represent scalpel. The participants will be blinded to this randomisation process. Both participants and assessors will be blinded to this randomisation process.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the cosmetic outcomes of skin incisions made by diathermy and scalpel blade. Patients undergoing open hernia repair or elective midline laparotomy surgery will be recruited for this study. Each half of the incision (medial/lateral or superior/inferior) will be randomised into scalpel(control) or diathermy(intervention). Patients are blinded to this randomisation process. Primary outcome is the patients and independent observers assessment of which half of the wound has the better cosmetic outcome.</summary>
