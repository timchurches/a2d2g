  <interventions>
    <interventions>Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at 2mA intensity, and anodal transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) at 1mA intensity with gamma frequency range of 30-40Hz.  This will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 minutes using a neuroConn GBH/Eldith DC Stimulator.  tDCS will be delivered during three sessions (one tDCS, one tACS, and one sham tDCS) that will be one week apart.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). This will involve placing the electrodes in the same position as for active tDCS, however stimulation will be ceased after 30 seconds (so as to generate the same initial sensation and ensure blinding is maintained).</comparator>

      <outcome>A statistically significant improvement in performance on the N-Back working memory task following application of anodal tDCS or tACS stimulation, compared with sham stimulation, both in patients with schizophrenia/ schizoaffective disorder and in healthy controls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Comparison of conditions - Session 1 vs Session 2 vs Session 3.

Participants' performance on the N-Back task will be measured for each session, both during and immediately after tDCS/tACS/sham stimulation.  At the end of the trial, a final analysis will be conducted to compare participants' performance on the N-back across the three stimulation conditions.</timepoint>

    <concealment>This is a double-blind study. Neither the participant nor the researcher conducting the sessions will know what type of stimulation the participant is receiving during each session. The Chief Investigator, who will be unblinded, will provide a unique code to be entered into the tDCS stimulator, which will determine the stimulation condition and settings, thus allowing the second researcher to remain blinded.  The stimulation condition will be counterbalanced across participants.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Working memory difficulties are commonly experienced by individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.  These difficulties have been shown to negatively influence patients psychosocial functioning.  Any technique that may enhance working memory would therefore be very useful. Recent research has suggested that brain stimulation, and in particular transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) techniques such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS), may have a role to play in improving cognition.  TES techniques have been shown to be a safe and non-invasive way of modulating brain activity, by applying a very weak electrical current (1-2mA) to the cortex via electrodes that are placed on the scalp.  While tDCS has been shown to improve working memory in a number of conditions, to date there have been no tDCS or tACS studies looking at the enhancement of working memory in schizophrenia.  

The current study will investigate whether working memory can be improved using tDCS and tACS in healthy participants and patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Further, the study aims to establish the most effective stimulation parameters for optimal working memory enhancement.  Twenty healthy controls and 20 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will attend 3 sessions at The Alfred hospital, each session involving a different type of TES (1mA tACS, 2ma tDCS, or sham stimulation).  Participants' performance on a working memory task will be assessed following application of the stimulation, and brain activity will be monitored throughout the tasks using electroencephalography (EEG).</summary>
