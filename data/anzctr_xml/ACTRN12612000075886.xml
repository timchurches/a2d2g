  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete 6 x 40m sprints with an approximate two minute interval between sprints, following a warm-up consisting of 10 x 1 minute bouts of whole-body vibration, on a Galileo vibration plate set at 26Hz and 4.5mm amplitude, with a 30 second rest between bouts or a traditional dynamic warm-up. This is a randomised crossover study and following a washout of 1 week, participants will complete the sprinting session following the alternate warm-up intervention.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research will investigate the acute effect of whole body vibration (WBV) on sprinting gait and sprint starts in a group of 30 sub-elite sprint athletes that compete in national level athletics championships (18 to 30 yrs). This is a randomised cross-over design with two warm-up treatments and a 7 day wash-out period. There are two stages in this project. In the first stage, participants will be randomly assigned to either a whole body vibration (WBV; n=15) or traditional warm-up modality (TRAD; n=15) for sprinting. Participants will complete the warm-up followed by 6 x 40 m sprints on an athletics track. After a 7 day wash-out period, the participants will repeat the sprint task with the other warm-up modality (cross-over). The following measures will be recorded: 1) reaction time and force production using an instrumented starting block; 2) running pattern using a 2-dimensional motion analysis system; and, 3) 5, 10, 20 and 40 m interval times using timing gates. The randomised cross-over design described above will be used in the second stage of this project to investigate the effect of warm-up modality on over-ground running patterns for steady-state running speeds ranging from 6 to 7 m/s.  The patterns will be recorded by a 3-dimensional Vicon Motion Measurement system set up on a netball court in the Bundoora Netball and Sports Centre (BNASC).</summary>
