  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves the collection of detailed information over a two year period about treatment choices and preferences of pre-menopausal low risk young (47 years or younger) women with breast cancer who will be receiving Goserelin/ Zoladex as part of their breast cancer treatment. This is a prospective study looking at treatment preferences, decision making, decision regret, patient preferences, side effects and disease outcome in pre-menopausal women under 47 years with low-risk early breast cancer. Patients will be entered into the study after they have chosen their treatment. Treatment arms will include patients with "low risk" breast cancer choosing endocrine therapy alone with goserelin (monthly injection for 2 years) and Tamoxifen (Group 1) and "low risk" patients choosing chemotherapy (approximately 6 months) with or without endocrine therapy (Group 2).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To establish whether young women with ER positive early breast cancer who choose Goserelin will have a better quality of life, fewer side effects and less decisional regret than those choosing chemotherapy. Quality of life will be measured at four time points (study entry, 6, 12 and 24 months) using validated instruments: FACT ES (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with Endocrine Symptoms), FACT B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for patients with Breast Cancer), Sexual Activity Questionnaire and the Greene Menopause Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Surveys implemented at study entry (baseline), 6 12 and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To collect detailed information on treatment choices and preferences of pre-menopausal women under 47 years with low-risk early breast cancer who have had over 2 years of endocrine treatment. Patient preference interviews will be conducted with group 1 participants and a designated number of group 2 participants. All participants will be invited to complete a Decisional Conflict Questionnaire at study entry. Decision Regret Questionnaires will be completed by participants at 24 months. Information about treatment received, side effects and tolerability will be taken from patient notes and pharmacy data. Data will also be collected on patient status (disease free and overall survival). 	</outcome>
      <timepoint>Surveys implemented at study entry (baseline), 6, 12 and 24 months. Treatment received will be taken from patient notes and pharmacy data at study entry.  Patient notes and pharmacy data will also be used to monitor compliance post treatment.  Side effects and tolerability will be monitored throughout each patients chosen treatment using patient notes and pharmacy data. Disease free and overall survival status will be monitored for each patient throughout the study with final patient status noted at 2 years from their commencement into study.</timepoint>
