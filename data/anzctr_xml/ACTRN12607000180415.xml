  <interventions>
    <interventions>INTERVENTION:
Self-progressed home exercise program in DVD and booklet format, to be completed at least 3 times per week. Each session will be 30 minutes.  The program will include exercises to address balance, hip control, weight shift, lower limb strength and endurance, and components of walking.  Participants are to complete the exercise program no more than 7 times per week. The participants will be actively monitored and encouraged to participate for 8 weeks, followed by a 18 week period without active encouragement.</interventions>
