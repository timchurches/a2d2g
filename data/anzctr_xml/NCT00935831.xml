    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK1278863A
Treatment: drugs - Placebo

Experimental: Subjects with renal impairment, non-dialysis - Subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment equivalent to National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative stage 3 and stage 4 who are not undergoing dialysis will be included. Subjects will receive single 50 mg and 150 mg oral doses of GSK1278863A across two dosing periods in a single-blind, randomized sequence. Doses of GSK1278863A will be given as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets, with matching placebo tablets to maintain treatment blinding.

Experimental: Healthy volunteers - Healthy subjects will be matched to the moderate and severe renally impaired subjects for gender, age, and BMI. Subjects will receive single 50 mg and 150 mg oral doses of GSK1278863A across two dosing periods in a single-blind, randomized sequence. Doses of GSK1278863A will be given as 25 mg and 100 mg tablets, with matching placebo tablets to maintain treatment blinding.

Experimental: Hemodialysis dependent subjects - The arm will consist of subjects with severe renal impairment (end-stage renal failure) who have been on stable hemodialysis treatment scheduled three times per week. Subjects will receive single oral doses of 150 mg GSK1278863A in each of 2 dosing periods in an open-label, fixed sequence. GSK1278863A will be administered just prior to receiving scheduled hemodialysis in Dosing Period 1. In Dosing Period 2, subjects will receive a single oral dose of GSK1278863 the morning after completion of a scheduled hemodialysis session.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. A male or female is eligible to enroll and participate in this study if he/she:

               -  (Part 1) has Moderate to Severe Renal Impairment (equivalent to NKF KDOQI Stage 3
                  or 4, not receiving dialysis) as determined by estimated Glomerular Filtration
                  Rate (eGFR) calculated by the abbreviated MDRD equation, OR has Normal Renal
                  Function determined by creatinine clearance (CLCR) via the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation, using serum creatinine and demographic data, obtained at Screening.
                  Subjects with Normal Renal Function should have no greater than trace blood or
                  protein on Screening urinalysis.

               -  (Part 2) has severe renal impairment (end-stage renal failure) and has been on
                  stable hemodialysis treatment (three times weekly) for 3 months prior to
                  Screening.

               -  otherwise healthy or considered clinically stable with respect to underlying
                  renal impairment as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
                  on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination,
                  laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring.

               -  has clinical laboratory test results that are considered clinically stable in the
                  opinion of the Principal Investigator, especially if the clinical abnormality or
                  laboratory parameter is deemed associated with the subject's underlying renal
                  impairment. A normal subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
                  outside the reference range may be included only if the Investigator and the
                  Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
                  factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          2. Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          3. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

             - Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods described
             in the protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they
             must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT.

             Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
             during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          4. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             drug until completion of the Follow-up visit.

          5. Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 17 - 33 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

          6. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          7. QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block. These
             can be based on single ECG value or average of triplicate values obtained over brief
             recording period.

          8. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.</inclusivecriteria>

             interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject safety.

         13. History of sensitivity to any of the study drugs, or components thereof or a history
             of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Medical Monitor,

             anatomy or motility, and/or hepatic function that could interfere with the absorption,

             interfere with normal gastrointestinal anatomy or motility include cholecystectomy,
             gastrointestinal bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy, small bowel resection,
             vagotomy, malabsorption, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac sprue.
             Examples of conditions that could interfere with hepatic function include Gilberts

             pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit juices of the prohibited
             fruits from 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug in Dosing Period 1 until the
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic blood sample in Dosing Period 2, unless in the
             opinion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor this will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

         25. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an experimental
             investigational product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day
