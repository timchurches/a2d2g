  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty patients will undergo an additional imaging session at the Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF) on a different day to the standard planning CT scan.   
During the additional imaging session which should occur within 7 days of the standard planning CT scan, all twenty patients will undergo a 18-FDG PET/CT (using the Siemens Biograph mCT Flow) and 18-FDG PET/MRI (using the Siemens mMR Biograph PET/MRI ) under the same physical position and set-up as their standard of care radiotherapy CT simulation.
The twenty patients will be split into two cohorts. The ten patients in cohort 1 will have a 18-FDG PET/MRI followed by PET/CT. The ten patients in cohort 2 will have a 18-FDG PET/CT followed by PET/MRI.  The PET/MRI data from the pre-PET/CT cohort 1 will be used to investigate the value of dynamic imaging of the kinetics of FDG uptake.

You will be asked to fast for up to 6 hours prior to the scan session. A qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will insert a tube into a vein in your arm and give you an injection of a radioactive substance called FDG. 

If you are having the PET/MRI first then the scan will start immediately during the period known as the uptake time. You will be positioned in a way that closely matches your radiation therapy treatment position. The scan involves lying flat with knees and neck supported.  The scan time for the FDG PET/MRI is approximately 1 hour. After the examination is completed, you will be asked to empty your bladder and move to the PET/CT scanner where the scan will commence. The exam will take approximately 30 minutes. After the examination is completed, you will be able to eat and drink normally.

If you are having the PET/CT scan first then you will rest for 1 hour during the uptake time, before emptying your bladder and proceeding to have your PET/CT scan which will last approximately 30 minutes. You will then be moved to the PET/MRI scanner and the scan will commence, lasting approximately 1 hour. After completing both scans you will be able to eat and drink normally.

A qualified Nuclear Medicine Physician will interpret the results.  </interventions>
    <comparator>As part of Radiation Treatment Planning participants will undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan which is the current standard of care scan for planning radiation therapy.

    <summary>This study will evaluate the use of PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging for head and neck cancer patients receiving definitive radiation or chemoradiation treatment.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and are receiving definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiation for head and neck cancer at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital.

Study details
All participants in this study will undergo an additional imaging session at the Herston Imaging Research Facility (HIRF). During the additional imaging session participants will undergo a 18-FDG PET/CT and 18-FDG PET/MRI.  You will be asked to fast for up to 6 hours prior to the scan session. A qualified Nuclear Medicine Technologist will insert a tube into a vein in your arm and give you an injection of a radioactive substance called FDG. 

If you are having the PET/MRI first then the scan will start immediately during the period known as the uptake time. You will be positioned in a way that closely matches your radiation therapy treatment position. The scan involves lying flat with knees and neck supported.  The scan time for the FDG PET/MRI is approximately 1 hour. After the examination is completed, you will be asked to empty your bladder and move to the PET/CT scanner where the scan will commence. The exam will take approximately 30 minutes. After the examination is completed, you will be able to eat and drink normally.

If you are having the PET/CT scan first then you will rest for 1 hour during the uptake time, before emptying your bladder and proceeding to have your PET/CT scan which will last approximately 30 minutes. You will then be moved to the PET/MRI scanner and the scan will commence, lasting approximately 1 hour. After completing both scans you will be able to eat and drink normally.

Gross tumour volumes derived from each of the scans will be compared, as will the radiation dose. It is hoped that the new scans will improve our ability to localise cancer more accurately than our current methods, for planning radiation treatment.
