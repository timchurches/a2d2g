  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mother-infant pairs were randomised into four groups according to an experimental two-factor design taking into account infant location and apparel.                                                                        Group I infants were placed skin-to-skin on their mothers chest in the delivery ward. Infants were later kept roomed-in in the maternity ward.                                                                                 Group II infants were dressed and placed in their mother's arms. Infants were later kept roomed-in in the maternity ward.                                                                                                                    Group III infants were kept in a cot in the delivery and maternity ward nurseries with no rooming-in.                                                                                                                                           Group IV infants were kept in a cot in a delivery ward nursery and later roomed-in in the maternity ward.                                                                                                                                     Each group comprised two subgroups with infants either swaddled or kept in clothes. The duration of stay in the delivery ward was 2 first hours after birth; the duration of stay in the maternity ward lasted till discharge at day 5 after birth.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Maternity Home practices still existing in some countries (separation of newborn infants from their mothers immediately after birth, tight swaddling, keeping babies in the nursery without rooming-in with their mothers, scheduled breastfeeding, formula supplementation) might hinder temperature adaptation even in healthy babies, can influence early breastfeeding performance as well as duration of breastfeeding in a long run. Moreover, infant's development, health and maternal-infant interaction and attachment could be also affected.</summary>
