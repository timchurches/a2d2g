  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves two synergistic elements: 1. nurse-led consultations and 2. telephone peer support. 

The intervention addresses key physical, functional, psychological, sexual, informational and social needs of patients receiving radiotherapy, as prescribed by their clinician, that arise at four critical points in the illness trajectory: (a) Pre- treatment (Contact 1: Nurse-face to face - 1hour, or phone; Peer-phone - 30mins) (b) Mid- treatment (Contact 2: Nurse-face to face - 30mins; Peer-phone - 30mins) (c) End of treatment (Contact 3: Nurse-face to face - 30mins; Peer-phone - 30mins) (d) Post-treatment (Contact 4: Nurse-phone 2 weeks post-treatment - 30mins; Contact 5: Peer-phone 4 weeks post-treatment - 30mins). Note that patients receiving brachytherapy treatment alone who have a shorter length of treatment time may have nurse and peer contacts 2 and 3 combined. 
Each woman will be assigned a peer who will provide 3 or 4 telephone support sessions. Peers will be matched to the participants medical and personal circumstances. After nurse sessions 1 to 3, the peer will contact the patient one week after this contact with the nurse. In session 4, the peer will contact the patient at 4 weeks post-treatment. The nurse will provide the peer with a check list of the patients concerns and the individualised self-care plan. The patient can nominate particular concerns which she does not wish to discuss with her peer during the nurse consultation. Using a structured format, the peers role will be: (i) To provide psychosocial support to the patient, (ii) To encourage adherence to the recommended self-care strategies. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive standard care for women receiving radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer. This usually involves regular assessments by nurse and/or radiation oncologist throughout treatment.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary endpoint: Compared to the usual care group, the intervention group will report lower psychological distress.

Psychological distress will be assessed with the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total scale (HADS-T) in a Questionnaire. Rasch analysis shows that items comprising the HADS-T form a unidimensional construct of psychological distress. It has demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha=0.82 to 0.90) in patient populations including cancer patients and responsiveness in psychosocial intervention studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to follow-up at a) pre-treatment and b) 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months post-treatment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary endpoints: Compared to the usual care group, the intervention group will experience: 
i)	Lower informational and psychosocial supportive care needs and lower symptom distress.

The 34 item Supportive Care Needs Survey-short form (SCNS-SF) in a Questionnaire covers unmet needs from five domains: psychological; health system and information; physical and daily living; patient care and support; and sexuality. All domain subscales have high internal consistency (alpha=0.87) and good divergent and convergent validity. PI Schofield found this scale to be responsive to change in a recent RCT with cancer patients.

Symptom distress will be measured with the 32 item Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF) comprising three subscales (physical, psychological and global distress) and a total symptom distress scale. All scales have demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha=0.76 to 0.87), good convergent validity (r =-0.68 to -0.74), excellent discriminative validity based on known groups comparisons and sensitivity to change in a longitudinal setting.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to follow-up at 4 weeks post-treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>ii)	Better preparation for treatment

Cancer treatment-related information and support needs will be assessed by Questionnaire with the 25-item Cancer Treatment Survey (CaTS) which comprises two subscales for specific information and support needs domains: sensory-psychological concerns and procedural concerns. Both subscales have demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha&gt;0.90) and good divergent validity (with HADS: r&lt;0.26). Both were sensitive to change in PI Schofield's recent RCT.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to pre-treatment follow-up</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>iii)	Lower informational and psychological supportive care needs and psychosexual difficulties

The 34 item Supportive Care Needs Survey-short form (SCNS-SF) in a Questionnaire covers unmet needs from five domains: psychological; health system and information; physical and daily living; patient care and support; and sexuality. All domain subscales have high internal consistency (alpha=0.87) and good divergent and convergent validity. PI Schofield found this scale to be responsive to change in a recent RCT with cancer patients.

Self-report Sexual function and vaginal changes will be assessed with the 27-item Sexual function-Vaginal changes Questionnaire (SVQ) Questionnaire, developed for gynaecological cancer, comprising three scales for all patients (intimacy, sexual interest and global sexual satisfaction) and two scales for sexually active respondents (vaginal changes and sexual functioning). All five scales have demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha =0.76 to 0.83) and sensitivity to change longitudinally.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to follow-up at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>iv)	Higher quality of life

Cancer-specific Quality of Life will be assessed with the 27-item Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G) Questionnaire. The FACT-G comprises four subscales for specific quality of life domains: physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being and functional well-being. Its scaling and unidimensionality of subscales have been confirmed by factor and Rasch analyses. All subscales have demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha=0.72 to 0.90), good convergent (r&gt;0.51), divergent (r&lt;0.22) and discriminative validity in cancer patients and responsiveness in psychosocial intervention studies.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From baseline to follow-up at 4 weeks, 6 and 12 months post-treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>v)	Less vaginal stenosis

The participant's treating clinician will conduct a clinical vaginal examination. The LENT SOMA scale, objective criteria for vaginal/sexual dysfunction, will be used to measure vaginal changes. 

A purpose designed patient self-report Adherence Questionnaire (AQ) will assess adherence to the use of vaginal dilators/cylinders, moisturisers, lubricants and pelvic floor exercises.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Clinical assessments at 3, 6 and 12 months post-treatment.

Patient self-report AQ at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.</timepoint>

    <concealment>The clinician will identify patients who are capable of understanding the study and giving informed consent before approaching them about the study, based on their experience in treating them. The clinician will introduce the study to potential participants. If interested, they will be referred to the data manager who will provide them with the information sheet and consent form.  The data manager will further answer any questions the patient may have, and clarify that the patient understands the study and that is it optional, before obtaining consent. The participant will give written consent using the form provided. 

Site data managers will fax consenter &amp; decliner (non-consenter) details to the central site. Central randomisation will be made by computer to either the intervention or usual care arms.

To assess for consent bias, non-consenters will be asked if de-identified basic demographic and medical details can be noted. Attrition will be monitored and reasons for withdrawal will be recorded in each arm.</concealment>
    <sequence>A consecutive sample of consenting patients will be randomised 1:1. Participants will be stratified according to treating hospital, and treatment type: external beam radiotherapy (with or without brachytherapy); or external beam radiotherapy (with or without brachytherapy) plus chemotherapy; or brachythearpy alone. Minimisation will be used to balance the randomisation across the strata. Randomisation will be remotely and independently performed at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. The method of randomisation will be by a weighted-biased coin method. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>Those patients randomised to the control group will receive standard care as is usual for the study site. The trial adheres to CONSORT criteria and intervention procedures will be strictly monitored for protocol adherence. All other conditions between the two arms will be equivalent. Reasons for attrition will be recorded, and recruitment and dropout bias assessed. Intention to treat analyses will be conducted. Blinding of patients and providers cannot be achieved with this study design. However, outcome assessment will be by self-reported questionnaire, thereby obviating the need for researcher blinding.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to reduce the emotional, psychosocial and physical needs of women being treated with radiotherapy for gynaecological cancer. We are investigating the benefits of a new program which combines specialist nurse consultations with telephone peer support before, during, and after treatment, compared to current standard care alone. 

Who is it for? 
Eligible patients for this trial are 18 years or older, have a confirmed diagnosis of gynaecological cancer, speak and read English, and are scheduled to receive radiotherapy with curative intent to the pelvis. 
Eligible peer support volunteers are women who are 18 years or older, have received radiotherapy to the pelvis for a gynaecological cancer at least 2years ago, and can speak and read English.

Trial details: 
In this study, patients will be randomly allocated to either standard care currently offered at their hospital, or to standard care PLUS the trial support program involving nurse-led consultations and telephone peer support. The consultations and telephone support will focus on the physical, functional, psychological, sexual, informational and social needs of patients at four time-points: pre-treatment, mid-treatment, at the end of treatment, and post-treatment.
Patients randomly allocated to the new program will have a nurse consultation (face-to-face or over the phone) and peer support telephone call at each of these time-points. All participants will complete 5 surveys over 14 months, so we can assess whether the new program improves patient outcomes.
The first ACTRN relevant to this study is for the initial development &amp; pilot testing phase: ACTRN12609000312246. A second ACTRN is for the phase III trial for which this study was the initial development &amp; pilot testing phase has also been submitted: ACTRN12611000744954.
