      <outcome>Rate of Moderate or Severe COPD Exacerbations Per Patient Per Year - A COPD exacerbation is an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a worsening in the patient's baseline dyspnoea, cough, and/or sputum production beyond day to day variability sufficient to warrant a change in management. COPD exacerbations were categorized as follows: Severe=Requiring hospitalization and/or leading to death; Moderate=Requiring oral or parenteral glucocorticosteroid therapy. The defined number of days a patient was in the trial was divided by 365.25, in order to express the duration as a fraction of 1 year.</outcome>

    <summary>The objective of the REACT trial is to investigate the effect of roflumilast 500 µg tablets
      once daily versus placebo on exacerbation rate and pulmonary function in COPD patients who
      are concomitantly treated with a fixed combination of long-acting ß2-agonists (LABA) and
      inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS). In addition, data on safety and tolerability of
      roflumilast will be obtained. An additional objective is to further characterize the
      population pharmacokinetic profile of roflumilast and roflumilast N oxide and to further
      characterize their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship in terms of
      efficacy and relevant safety aspects.

      Patients to be included are required to have severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis
      and a history of frequent exacerbations and must be concomitantly treated with a fixed
      combination of LABA and ICS. Two parallel treatment arms (roflumilast 500 µg once daily and
      placebo) are included.</summary>
