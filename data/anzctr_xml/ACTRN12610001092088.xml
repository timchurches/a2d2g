  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The decrease in knee flexion in swing phase present in chronic stroke individuals contributes to the decrease in gait velocity found in this population. With the association of backward walk to sensory stimulation through the electro-stimulation in the hamstrings, it is believed there may be an increase in knee flexion during walking back and that these benefits are transferred to move forward . The objective was to evaluate the immediate results in forward walking after a short backward walking training on a treadmill combined with electro stimulation in the knee flexors. The subjects with chronic hemiparesis were shot with four bullets while walking on a treadmill in three conditions in the Bacward Walking ( before training,  During the ride back with electric stimulation and  10 minutes after training ) and two conditions of Forwad Walking (pre-trainig and after the training). The intervention was Backward Walking performed for 20 minutes on the treadmill at comfortable speed associated with Electric Stimulation in the knee flexors in the swing phase triggered by a sensor placed on the insole.</summary>
