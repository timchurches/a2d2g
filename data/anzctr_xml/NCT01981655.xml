  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objective of this trial to see whether:

      -Cardiac performance (cardiac index and secondary outcomes)can be improved in patients with
      acute heart failure (AHF) and symptoms and consequences of fluid overload (pulmonary and
      interstitial edema) and poor peripheral perfusion can be reduced by:

        1. Providing lactate as a substrate(Improve cardiac index)

        2. Simultaneously restoring optimal preload

      Optimal standard treatment will be achieved in both arms with the use of current best
      treatment protocol for AHF as per independent treating physician.

      4. To assess effects of 0.5M Na lactate (Totilac) on plasma and urine biological parameters
      (sodium, potassium, chloride, pH, bicarb, base excess, albumin)

      5. To assess effects of 0.5M Na lactate on morbidity and mortality.</summary>
