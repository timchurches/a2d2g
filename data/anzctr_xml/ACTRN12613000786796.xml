  <interventions>
    <interventions>Home exercise programs of 4 weeks duration presented using video recorded and played back on touch screen tablets (iPads) with electronic reminders.

The content of both the home exercise programs (for both the intervention and control groups) will be based on the recommendations from the Stroke Foundation Clinical Guidelines (2010), including techniques such as:
* Constraint-induced movement therapy in selected people
* Repetitive task-specific training
* Mechanical assisted training 
* Mirror therapy 
* Bilateral training

Home programs are typically recommended to be completed 2 times per day, but specific dosage is at the discretion of the managing therapist.  Reminders will be set to sound once at the recommended time of each prescribed session.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional paper-based home exercise instructions, using brief written descriptions and diagrams.  Content of the exercise sessions will be the same as the intervention group; only the mode of delivery will differ between groups.</comparator>

  <outcomes>

      <outcome>Exercise adherence - Clients from both the experimental and control groups will be asked to keep a log of the minutes spent per day on their home exercises and details of exercises completed.  These log books will be issued by and returned to the blinded assessor in an effort to minimise social desirability bias that may occur if the logbooks are managed by a treating therapist.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Upon admission to the Community Rehabilitation Program and once upper limb impairment have been noted by the treating clinician, written informed consent will be sought from patients who meet inclusion criteria to participate in the study.  Consent will be sought from carers of potential participants who have cognitive deficits, if the carer is intending to provide assistance with the patientâ€™s home exercise program and is willing to participate in the study.

Clients will be randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups using a block randomisation sequence with allocation concealed using sealed envelopes. The randomisation process will be managed from an independent off-site office to ensure that the randomisation is independent from the recruitment process.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 36 participants for each group will be recruited.  This sample size will allow detection of a moderate to large effect size on the primary clinical outcome, the Wolf Motor Function Test (above the minimum clinically significant difference of a 20% change in score) with alpha set at 0.05 and power of 0.8.

Outcome measures for upper limb function will be compared at discharge using Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA) with admission scores as a covariate.

Average daily and weekly time spent on home exercise program will be compared using independent samples t-tests or the Mann Whitney U-Test for non-parametric data.

Data from the satisfaction questionnaire will be analysed using a descriptive synthesis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allied Health professionals working in rehabilitation frequently prescribe home exercise programs for clients to complete independently between therapy sessions.  Written notes or pictures are commonly provided as reminders to clients when prescribing home exercises.  These paper based programs are sometimes difficult to follow, and growing collections of paper over the course of a rehabilitation program can become confusing and overwhelming for patients.  

Many new forms of technology are becoming increasingly accessible to people within the community. Smart technology applications for smart phones and touch-screen tablets are being adopted in rehabilitation settings for such things as: cognitive rehabilitation; cognitive compensatory strategies (such as memory aids); assisting with communication (using picture boards, for example); and improving fine motor skills.  However, these devices also provide easy access to other tools such as reminder functions and video recording that could be used to enhance rehabilitation programs.

This project aims to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using the video and reminder functions on touch-screen tablets as a support to prescribed home exercise programs for patients with upper limb deficits following stroke.  Specifically, we aim to determine whether patients receiving rehabilitation after stroke using this technology demonstrate greater adherence to prescribed home exercise programs and better functional outcomes when compared to traditional paper based exercise prescription.
