  <trial_identification>
    <studytitle>A cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of knowledge translation strategies for obesity prevention.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In Victorian local governments, does the implementation of knowledge translation strategies, compared to a comparison, increase use of evidence; access to, competence, confidence in using evidence, alter the influence evidence has in decisions, or alter organisational culture in using evidence to inform public health decisions.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a facilitated program of knowledge translation strategies that comprises skills development, networking, personal contact and other related activities that will strengthen the organisational context to enable use of research evidence.

Councils in the intervention arm will receive a facilitated program in addition to access to evidence summaries.  Councils in the comparison arm will receive evidence summaries alone.

The duration of the intervention will be 2 years.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase use of evidence. This will be assessed using a repeat of the baseline survey. The survey consists of a series of likert scale questions and will be administered online. This will be supplemented by key informant interviews and documentary analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years post randomisation at completion of 2 year intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase access to research evidence. This will be assessed using a repeat of the baseline survey. The survey consists of a series of likert scale questions and will be administered online. This will be supplemented by key informant interviews and documentary analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post intervention (2years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase competence in using evidence to inform decisions. This will be assessed using a repeat of the baseline survey. The survey consists of a series of likert scale questions and will be administered online. This will be supplemented by key informant interviews and documentary analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post intervention (2 years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase confidence in understanding and use of research evidence. This will be assessed using a repeat of the baseline survey. The survey consists of a series of likert scale questions and will be administered online. This will be supplemented by key informant interviews and documentary analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Post intervention (2years)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increase organisational support for use of research evidence and evidence-informed decision making processes. This will be assessed using a repeat of the baseline survey. The survey consists of a series of likert scale questions and will be administered online. This will be supplemented by key informant interviews and documentary analysis.</outcome>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All 45 councils who completed a pre-trial baseline survey will be invited to participate in the trial by the program coordinator responsible for program implementation.  Each intervention council will nominate a number of staff to particpate in the intervention.  Stratified block randomisation will be used to randomly allocate councils to intervention or comparison groups.  Strata will be defined by tertile of council annual budget.  Once participation has been agreed and a memorandum of understanding has been signed, the program coordinator will email the trial manager with the name and annual budget of the council.  The trial manager will then email the trial statistician with the stratum (but not name) of the council.  The statistician will allocate the council (blind to its identity) to intervention or control on the basis of a randomisation sequence generated and held by the trial statistician and concealed to all other parties.  The trial manager will log the group allocation on the trial database and inform the program coordinator.</concealment>
    <sequence>A seperate sequence will be generated for each of the 3 strata using a predetermined block size.  Computer generated random numbers will be used to determine each sequence using the permutations satisfying the criteria of equal allocation to group within the predetermined block size.</sequence>
