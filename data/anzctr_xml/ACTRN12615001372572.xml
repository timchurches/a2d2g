  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Renal colic due to renal stone is a most severe pain had been experienced, and is common cause of patient reference to health centers. Intravenous infusion of morphine sulfate is a common treatment, but its side effect is addiction. It has been mentioned that magnesium sulfate due to its calcium receptors antagonist effect and therefore muscle relaxation, was a pain relief especially in migraine headache.
this study compares effectiveness and side effects of intravenous infusion of morphine sulfate and magnesium sulfate in renal colic patient who were referred to shahid sadoughi educational hospital. This paper is double-blinded randomized control trial study. Eighty patients with renal colic divided in two groups: case group took 50 mg/kg intravenous infusion and the control group took morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg intravenous infusion.pain score and probable side effects( such as vomiting, nausea, low blood pressure, apnea and dizziness)  during zero, 15 and 30 minutes after infusion in both group recorded by a blinded person, and data analyzed by SPSS software.</summary>
