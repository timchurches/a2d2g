  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Approximately 5-10% of newly born infants receive assistance in the delivery room to establish regular breathing. Healthcare workers provide artificial ventilation using a manual ventilation device and a face mask to fit around the infants nose and mouth. Several factors can reduce the effectiveness of mask ventilation. These include poor face mask application resulting in leak or airway obstruction and spontaneous movements of the baby. Airway obstruction may be due to inadvertent manual compression of the soft tissues of the neck, tongue and thus the trachea, or hyperextension or flexion of the head. In addition, if the face mask is held on the face too tight, it may obstruct the mouth and nose. Using a simple device such as an oropharyngeal airway may reduce the prevalence of obstruction during mask ventilation and lead to more effective mask ventilation. This randomized trial is investigating whether for newly born infants requiring positive pressure ventilation in the delivery room, does the use of an oropharyngeal airway with a face mask reduce the degree of airway obstruction compared to using a face mask alone. Physiological recordings of the resuscitation will be made measuring delivered and expired tidal volumes, prevalence and degree of airway obstruction as well as oxygen saturations and heart rate. Data will also be collected and compared between the groups on common neonatal morbidities including duration of assisted ventilation in the nursery.</summary>
