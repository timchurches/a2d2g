  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) increases the chances of cure in patients with Her-2 overexpressing
      early breast cancer. Unfortunately, both the chemotherapy drugs used in this setting
      (anthracyclines) and trastuzumab are known to cause cardiac dysfunction in a proportion of
      patients. Patients who develop heart problems when taking trastuzumab might have to stop this
      treatment, which could jeopardise their chances of cure. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (NT pro-BNP) is a cardiac biomarker that is measured in the blood, the levels of
      which have been shown to indicate the presence of heart failure. Some early research has
      suggested that there may be a correlation between elevated NT pro-BNP and heart damage due to
      cancer chemotherapy and also trastuzumab. Troponin is another substance measured in the blood
      that can indicate heart damage. Finally, certain variations in an individual's genetic makeup
      (called polymorphisms) could put them at increased risk of heart damage from trastuzumab.
      Here we are studying whether any of these factors (NT pro-BNP levels, troponin levels, or
      certain genetic polymorphisms) can accurately predict who is at highest risk of
      trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity.

      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of NT pro-BNP as a predictive
      biomarker for the development of trastuzumab related cardiotoxicity (TRC). The investigators
      will also examine if single nucleotide polymorphisms in the HER2 gene or Fc-gamma-receptor
      genes predict for TRC.</summary>
