    <interventions>Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) consists in items have been shown to reflect the movement demands experienced by infants in naturalistic interactions with caregivers such as bathing, dressing and play. It is a test of posture and movement in infants by 42 items. The test includes a rattle, squeaky toy, bright red ball. The test consists in head control with lift the head briefly when held upright/right the head when tilted laterally in the upright position/lift the head to 45 degrees in prone; items to trunk control - push up to sitting from sidelying/rotate the trunk to turn to sidelying; responses to visual or auditory stimuli -turning the head to find a sound in prone/turning the head from side to side to follow a moving ball in supine; selectively move the ankles, fingers, hand to reach toward objects.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study consisted of the evaluation of the motor performance through the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP), being applied by 1 trained physiotherapist, of discharge hospital. The analysis of the results was carried out through measures descriptive and measured of accuracy. 69 premature newborns were studied  with age gestacional (AG) 32,61+/-2,69 weeks and birth weight 1207,00+/-380,14 g with predominance of the masculine sex (62 %). Of the studied population 56 newborns presented punctuation on the average, 7 presented punctuation below the average and 6 presented scores very much below the average. The newborns with punctuation inside the average they presented  AG 34,44+/-0,59 weeks, birth weight of birth 1355,50+/-294,26 g and remained on average 11,22+/-7,07 days in oxygen support. The newborns that obtained performance below the average they presented AG 32,00+/-2,59 weeks, birth weight  1180,00+/-334,16 g and remained 8,20+/-4,24 days under mechanical ventilation (VM); the newborns with punctuation very much below the average they presented AG 28,76+/-2,54 weeks, birth weigh 830,00+/-332,06 g and they remained on average 42,50+/-18,93 days in VM. The values of  sensibility was 54,5 % , 71,4 % especificity and values predict positive and negative of 75 % and 100 %. The premature newborns that presented worse motor performance were those who remained in support ventilat√≥rio prolonged.</summary>
