    <studytitle>The Early Detection of Acute Renal Failure</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A multi-centre logitudinal observational study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of novel biomarkers in the early detection of acute renal failure in intensive care unit patients when compared with conventional diagnostic tests following an acute kidney injury.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two centre observational study in which the sensitivity and specificity of novel urinary and plasma biomarkers will be compared with conventional indicators of acute renal failure. Biomarkers will be assessed with varying degrees of frequency. 6 or 12 hourly measurements of novel and conventional biomarkers will be undertaken for the first 24 hours after admission to the intensive care unit. Thereafter, samples will be collected on a daily basis for the next 6 days (or until the patient is discharged from the intensive care unit. Patients reaching a pre determined Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase (GGT)/Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) index will be enrolled in a second study (see entry for EARLY ARF 2).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study will be the early detection of acute renal failure using any one or a combination of the following biomarkers: Urinary creatinine, GGT, AP, Urea, Cystatin C, Kidney Injury Marker1 (KIM1), Inter Leukin-18 (IL18), Aquaporins (AQP) 1 and 2 and Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin (NGAL). The sensitivity and specificity of these measures will be matched against conventional diagnostic markers for acute renal failure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All of the above biomarkers will be measured, with varying frequency, over a period of up to 7 days.</timepoint>
