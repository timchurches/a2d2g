  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be asked to attend the falls and balance laboratory at NeuRA before and after a planned busy day and planned restful day, presented in a random order, at least one week apart.
For the busy day, participants will be asked to schedule several daily activities (based on their estimates of the busiest days they have) into the one day, between 10am and 4pm.
For the relaxing day, participants will be asked to schedule few daily activities (based on their most relaxing days), between 10am and 4pm. 
Participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor on each of the busy day and the restful day, to quantify the amount of time sitting, standing and moving.

    <statisticalmethods>50 older adult participants will be recruited. This sample size is consistent with previously published experimental
studies of fatigue in older people [1,2], including our own work, which found significant reduction in leg strength
(10%) associated with differences in gait control between pre and post fatigue assessments [3].

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fatigue can impair standing balance and functional task performance in older people. We have recently found that
general fatigue (induced by repeated sit-to-stand movements as fast as possibly until exhaustion) impaired movement control and foot positioning before and after negotiation of low-level obstacles in older people while walking. However, it is not known whether more ecological aspects of general fatigue may similarly impair balance and mobility and increase the risk of falling in older people. This study will determine whether a busy day of physical activity ("real world" fatigue) impacts balance and mobility measures in older people, compared to a more
restful day.</summary>
