  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sevoflurane is one of the widely used anaesthetic vapours for general anaesthesia. This vapour is delivered to the patients lungs through a breathing tube. It is known to alter the electrical activity of the heart. This manifests as a prolonged QTc interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG). One of the potential dangers associated with this phenomenon is the occurrence of a dangerous irregular heart beat. However, it is a very rare condition. 

People with diabetes mellitus are more prone to have a prolonged QTc interval due to various reasons. It is not known whether the diabetic patients are at an increased risk of QTc prolongation compared with non diabetics on exposure to sevoflurane anaesthesia.
This study tries to look at the impact of sevoflurane on the QTc interval in patients with diabetes mellitus. The primary outcome parameters  of interest are the Tp-e interval and Tp-e / QTc ratio of the ECG, as these measures are sensitive in predicting dangerous arrhythmias. The secondary outcome measures of interest are Qtc and QTcd values of the ECG.  </summary>
