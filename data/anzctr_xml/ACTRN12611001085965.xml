    <studytitle>Study of Ultrasound in Forearm Fractures versus Investigation with X-ray</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Investigation in the paediatric (under 16) population looking at the use of a focused ultrasound training package to enable doctors to diagnose or exclude forearm fractures. The results will be compared with the current gold standard of X-ray looking at the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ultrasound scan (USS) will be performend in the department by an emergency doctor that has undergone the on line training package designed for this trial. It will be a single USS and should take 10-15 minutes to complete. 
Following routine examination and USS the patient will then go on to have an x-ray which is the current gold standard in fracture diagnosis. The ultrasound will always be performed prior to the xray (this is why children with prior imaging are excluded) to ensure that the doctor performing the scan is not biased. As it is not a drug intervention there is no "wash out" period and the xray request will be made directly after the scan is complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>xray will be performed in the departmental xray room by the hospital radiologists as is the current practice when investigating for fracture. Only one xray is normally requested unless views are inadequate in which case specialists may request further (this is out of the departments direct control). Xray takes a matter of minutes to perform.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The ability of ultrasound to safely exclude a fracture of the forearm. 
This will be assessed by the doctor performing the scan filling in a data collection sheet reporting their findings and by capture of still annonomysed images for review by an ultrasound expert (for quality control purposes). The doctors assessment of wether there is a fracture will be compared to the gold standard xray that is routinely reported by a radiologist. The radiologist will not be aware of the ultrasound findings.</outcome>

    <concealment>children are identified as eligable from triage and are consented and enrolled by medical staff examining them. All children will be examined, ultrasounded and xrayed so there is no randomisation. It is an interventional trial as we are assessing a different method of diagnosis of fractures but also doing an xray as this is the current gold satndard.</concealment>

    <summary>This trial looks at the use of a focused educational learning package for paediatric emergency doctors training them in the use of ultrasound to detect forearm fractures. It will look to see if it is as sensitive and specific as the current gold standard of x-ray and also at the acceptability to patient and parent.</summary>
