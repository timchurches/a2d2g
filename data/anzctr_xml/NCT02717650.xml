  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise testing has become clinically important in the management and ongoing evaluation of
      patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) with higher rates of exercise tolerance and participation
      previously linked to lower mortality risk (1).

      Lower exercise capacity generally correlates with more severe lung disease (2,3) and landmark
      studies suggest that low exercise capacity as measured by peak oxygen capacity (VO2peak) and
      rate of decline in lung function (FEV1) are strong predictors of mortality (1,4). However not
      all studies have found pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to be reliable predictors of maximal
      exercise capacity (5), especially in relatively well preserved lung function (6,7).

      The wide distribution in physical capacity between fit individuals and end stage disease adds
      to complexity of assessment. Independent factors of age, genetics, habitual exercise,
      nutritional status and musculoskeletal conditions are all known to influence physical
      capacity in patients with CF (8,9).

      Maximal exercise testing places additional stress on cardiovascular, respiratory and
      peripheral systems providing more information around multiple influences on disease
      progression including degree of limitation in these major systems (10,11) and is useful for
      assessment of exercise desaturation, more common (but not always present) in advanced lung
      disease (5,12).

      With prediction of exercise performance and functional capacity from PFTs unreliable and the
      understanding that health status correlates better with exercise tolerance there has been an
      increase in maximal exercise testing for patient management (13). Many international centers
      now regard exercise testing as highly important with many assessing maximal exercise capacity
      annually to monitor disease progression, identify physical status and drive changes in
      medical, physiotherapy or nutritional management (14,15).

      The main vision is to develop a standardized incremental step test protocol suitable for
      adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), all ages, levels of fitness and disease state that is in
      line with current exercise testing recommendations (15). To develop a more useful field test
      to assess exercise tolerance and a more "user friendly" test than the currently available
      laboratory exercise test to allow for early detection of decline in physical function in the
      day-to-day clinical setting. To date no studies have been published in adults with CF where
      an incremental exercise step test has been investigated to assess exercise tolerance or
      determine maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max).</summary>
