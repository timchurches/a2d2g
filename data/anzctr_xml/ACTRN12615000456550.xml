    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Study Period 1: To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of two different dose regimes of a fixed dose paracetamol and ibuprofen combination (Maxigesic oral suspension) in children between 2-12 years of age inclusive by performing the plasma assay (blood samples will be taken during the first 6hrs after the loading dose). 
</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>During the screening, participant's eligibility will be checked.

Randomization will be stratified by age group (2-6 and 7-12 yrs) and the type of surgery (tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy). Eligible participant will be randomly allocated to receive either a low dose or high dose of Maxigesic oral suspension. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence will be generated by computer, by an independent statistician. The statistician will maintain a confidential schedule of patient numbers and drug allocation. 

The randomization will be balanced by using permuted blocks and stratifying by age group and the type of surgery. Each eligible participant will be assigned a unique identification number in sequential order. Participants discontinued after the randomization will not be replaced and the next available number shall be used to randomize a new participant. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The PK profile will be derived from the plasma concentration vs time data using non-compartmental methods. 

The mean time-adjusted AUC will be compared between two dose groups using ANOVA which includes randomization strata and randomized treatment as fixed effects Standard descriptive statistics including means, medians, ranges and 95% confidence intverals will be used to describe the values . 

Study power calculation from the results of a similar study in a pediatric population ( Merry et al. 2013) indicate that 100 participants per group would be required to detect as significant (2-sided alpha=0.05) a 10% difference in mean AUCt between treatment groups with 80% power. </statisticalmethods>
