  <interventions>
    <interventions>Ear-acupressure, once a week, eight weeks. The ear-acupressure is achieved by using commercial stainless steel press-pellet tapes. The pellet measures 1.2 mm in diameter and is attached to a round adhesive tape 7 mm in diameter in a tan colour which is close to skin colour. During the treatment, five pellets will be taped on the real or sham ear points on one of the participants ears. Once taped, the practitioner will press each pellet for 10 seconds or until the ear become red or slightly sore. There is no skin penetration in the treatment. In the following treatment session, the other ear will be used for taping. Thus, the two ears will be used alternately on a weekly basis. The participants will be instructed in the technique of how to press the five pellets three times a day. The pressing technique is to promote the desired stimulation on the AR-specific points in order to achieve the therapeutic effects. The real ear-acupressure treatment will be conducted on five specific ear points for AR. They are Shenmen (TF4), Neibi (TG4), Fei (CO14), Fengxi (SF1,2i) and Shenshangxian (TG2p). These five ear points are recommended to be used for the treatment of AR by the Chinese Standard of Auricular Points.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham ear-acupressure, use non-specific points as sham points.
The procedure of the sham ear-acupressure treatment is same as the real treatment. However, the sham ear-acupressure treatment will be conducted five non-AR-specific ear points. They are Lun2 (HX10), Jian (SF4,5), Suogu (SF6), Zhen (AT3), Ya (LO1). These five ear points are not specifically indicated for AR management according to the Chinese Standard of Auricular Points.</comparator>

    <concealment>The randomisation codes for all the subjects will be put into sealed, opaque envelopes, which are allocated by a central officer who is unaware of subjectsâ€™ characteristics. The subject will be asked to pick one envelop right before the first treatment and pass it to the acupuncturist to open. The acupuncturist will provide either real or sham treatment to the subject following the information in the envelop. The subjects, the data entry personnel and data analyst will not be aware of grouping details.</concealment>
