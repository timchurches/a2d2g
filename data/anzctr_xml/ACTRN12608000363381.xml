  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. pramipexole single dose 0.5 mg orally
2. sulpiride single dose 400mg orally

(1. and 2. administered 1 hr after study day begins = 10am, 1 week apart, in double-blind balanced crossover design).

3. social anxiety behavioural challenge

Three hours, and 3 1/2 hrs (respectively) after the ingestion of the drug, 30 minutes apart, the participants completed the following three minute duration challenges: (i) the subject was invited to give an impromptu speech to an audience on a topic related to work interests or hobbies (Verbal Task); and (ii) the investigator read aloud to the participant a script of a previous situation of intense social anxiety, as reported by the participant (Autobiographical Script). The order of the tasks was selected at random but kept the same for both study days. (The tasks are administered 30 minutes apart).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Serotonergic antidepressants (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder [SAnD], though there is evidence of dopaminergic system  dysfunction. 

We therefore investigated the effects of a single dose of a dopamine agonist (pramipexole) and a dopamine antagonist (sulpiride) on social anxiety symptoms in untreated and SSRI-remitted patients with SAnD, undergoing an anxiogenic challenge.

Our primary hypothesis was that the social anxiety (behavioral) challenges would be more anxiogenic under the dopamine antagonist (sulpiride) condition compared with the dopamine agonist (pramipexole) condition.</summary>
