Treatment: drugs - Dacarbazine
Treatment: drugs - Placebo matching Dacarbazine

Experimental: Nivolumab, 3 mg/kg - Participants received nivolumab, 3 mg/kg, solution administered Intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks until disease progression, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study completion. Eligible participants may switch to nivolumab at 480mg every 4 weeks until documented disease progression, discontinuation, withdrawal of consent or the study ends.

Active Comparator: Dacarbazine, 1000 mg/m^2 - Participants received dacarbazine, 1000 mg/m^2, solution administered IV every 3 weeks until disease progression, discontinuation due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study completion. Eligible participants may cross-over to nivolumab open label treatment, either 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 480mg every 4 weeks until documented disease progression, discontinuation, withdrawal of consent or the study ends.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - OS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death. For those without documentation of death, OS will be censored on the last date the participant was known to be alive.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization to date of death. For those without documentation of death, to the last date the participant was known to be alive, assessed to 17 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) Rate - OS rate is calculated as the percentage of participants who have not died divided by the total number of participants in the arm, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization to 6 months and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Investigator-assessed PFS is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documented progression, as determined by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who died without progressing were considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Those who did not progress or die were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Patients who did not have any on-study tumor assessments and did not die were censored on their date of randomization. Those who started any subsequent anticancer therapy without a prior reported progression were censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization to date of disease progression or death, assessed to 17 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Rate - The PFS rate at a time point is the estimated percentage of patients who have not progressed and are alive at that time point following randomization and is estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumor assessments beginning at 9 weeks following randomization and continuing every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death, assessed to 17 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective Response Rate (ORR) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) - ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with a best overall response of RECIST-defined complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized participants in each treatment arm. RECIST, volume 1.1 for target lesions: CR=disappearance of all target lesions; PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; stable disease=neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started; PD=at least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions, and the sum LD must have an absolute increase of =5 mm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumor assessments beginning at 9 weeks following randomization and continuing every 6 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or death, assessed to 17 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival by Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression Level - Overall Survival by PD-L1 expression level, which was defined as the percent of tumor cells demonstrating plasma membrane PD-L1-staining in a minimum of 100 evaluable tumor cells per a Dako PD-L1 IHC assay (referred to as quantifiable PD-L1 expression). Assessment of OS by PD-L1 expression as measured by a validated assay and comparing OS in patients with tumor PD-L1 expression =5% versus patients with tumor PD-L1 expression &lt;5%. Tumor tissue samples for PD-L1 testing were collected at screening from metastatic or unresectable sites prior to randomization.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of randomization to date of disease progression or death, as assessed to 17 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Scores - HRQoL is evaluated by mean changes from baseline in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) global health status/quality of life composite scale in all randomized patients. The QLQ-30 is a cancer-specific, self-administered questionnaire that contains 30 questions, covering global, functional, and symptom scales. Scores range from 0 to 100. Higher scores on global and functional scales indicate better quality of life (QoL), while higher scores on the symptom scales indicate declining QoL.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and every 6 weeks for 12 months and at follow-up visits 1 and 2, assessed up to 17 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
