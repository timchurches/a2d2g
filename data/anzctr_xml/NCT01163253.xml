  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 4 weeks after last dose (up to 67 months) that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. AEs included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Adverse Events (AEs) by Severity - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. AEs were classified according to the severity in 3 categories: a) mild: AEs did not interfere with participant's usual function; b) moderate: AEs interfered to some extent with participant's usual function; c) severe: AEs interfered significantly with participant's usual function.</outcome>

      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Physician Global Assessment (PGA) Response of 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear' - The PGA of psoriasis was scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), induration (I), and scaling (S) across all psoriatic lesions in participants. The severity rating scores (Erythema: 0= no evidence of erythema to 4= dark, deep red; Induration: 0= no evidence of plaque elevation to 4= marked plaque elevation, hard/sharp borders; Scaling: 0= no evidence of scaling to 4= thick, coarse scale predominates) were summed (E + I + S = total) and the average (total/3) was taken. The total average was rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA. The 5-point scale for PGA was: 0= clear; 1= almost clear; 2= mild; 3= moderate; 4= severe, where higher score indicated more severity of psoriasis. Percentage of participants with response of 'clear' (score of '0') and 'almost clear' (score of '1') were reported.</outcome>

Each component of severity, that is, erythema, induration and scaling was assessed separately for four body areas (head and neck [h], upper limbs [u], trunk [t] and lower limbs [l]) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0=no involvement, 1=slight, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked.

Higher score indicates greater severity.</outcome>

SF-36 evaluated 8 health-related aspects of an individual: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, social functioning, mental health, role emotional, vitality, and general health. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores indicating good health condition. Two summary scale scores were computed from the 8 health aspect scores: physical component summary score and mental component summary score. Score range for both summary scales ranged from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), with higher scores indicating good health condition.</outcome>

Each dimension was assessed on a 3-point scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems, where higher scores=worse health condition). The responses from the 5 dimensions were used to calculate a single utility index value. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigned a utility value for each dimension in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicated a better health state.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Answered Psoriasis Healthcare Resource Utilization Questionnaire (Ps-HCRU) - Ps-HCRU was a short questionnaire designed to assess healthcare resource use and the impact of psoriasis on work. In the first section, it assessed direct costs associated with healthcare resource use which included participant's interactions with healthcare providers such as general practitioners, dermatologists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists, surgeons and nurses. When taking the evening dose of tofacitinib, participants were asked to answer the Ps-HCRU questionnaire only if they had an interaction with a healthcare provider or their work was impacted by psoriasis on that specified day. In this outcome measure, number of participants who answered Ps-HCRU at any specified visits were reported.</outcome>
