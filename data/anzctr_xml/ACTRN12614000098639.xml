  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a phase I dose-response trial to find out how much physical activity, in the form of walking, can be prescribed for people with knee osteoarthritis in terms of safety and feasibility.
Groups of 3 participants will be individually supervised to walk at a prescribed level of physical activity over one week. This prescribed level of physical activity will not change for individual participants but may escalate for subsequent groups of participants. 
The walking doses will be in minutes per week, of at least moderate intensity, in a minimum of 10 minute bouts, so that the doses can be compared with the current physical activity guidelines. 
The dose level of prescribed physical activity will follow a modified Fibonacci scheme starting with an initial dose of 10 minutes per week of moderate intensity supervised walking  for the first group of participants.
Moderate intensity walking will be defined as a 3 on the modified Borg 0-10 perceived exertion scale, where 3 = I am still comfortable but am breathing a little harder.
Dose escalation will depend on the presence or absence of adverse incidents among the group of 3 participants.
Depending on the feasibility and safety of the prescribed dose of walking, the dose may or may not be escalated between subsequent groups of participants.
Dose escalation will start with early larger dose increments between groups which get smaller for higher doses until the guideline stopping value of 150 minutes of walking per week  is reached (i.e. 10, 20, 35, 50,  70, 95, 120, 150 mins)
The trial will stop when/if a group of participants can achieve 150 minutes of prescribed walking as this reflects physical activity guidelines.</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be no control group but the trial will involve dose comparison. The first group of participants will walk for 10 minutes per week. Depending on feasibility and safety, the dose of walking will escalate between groups of participants following a modified Fibonacci scheme of 10, 20, 35, 50, 70, 95, 120 and 150 minutes of walking per week.</comparator>

    <concealment>This is a non-randomised trial. The trial will be a phase I dose-response study using the 3+3 design (Gao et al 2008, Lin and Shih 2001).

Patients will be recruited consecutively and allocated to a prescribed physical activity dose.

The dose level of prescribed physical activity will follow a modified Fibonacci scheme starting with an initial dose of 10 minutes of supervised walking per week for the first group of participants, with early larger dose increments which get smaller for higher doses until the guideline stopping value of 150 minutes of walking per week is reached. Prescribed
walking doses will be 10, 20, 35, 50, 70, 95, 120, 150 mins.

Dose escalation will depend on the presence or absence of adverse incidents. 

150 minutes is the maximum minutes of prescribed walking per week because if this is achieved without incident it means that participants can safely meet physical activity guidelines for older adults.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The primary analysis of the maximum tolerated dose in terms of minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week will be based on the decision rules by Lin et al 2001. 

The primary analysis of the feasibility will be based on the proportion of participants that not able to complete the prescribed dose for feasibility reasons.  

The secondary analyses will describe the sample of participants in terms of pain levels, stiffness, activity limitation and physical activity associated with the prescribed doses and the maximum tolerated dose. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lack of physical activity is a major health issue for people with osteoarthritis of the knee leading to increased risks of
cardiovascular disease. Only about 1 in 10 people with knee osteoarthritis meets the current physical activity guidelines of at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity in minimum of 10 minute bouts each week. It is not known if it is safe or feasible to encourage these people to increase their physical activity level as recommended in the guidelines. This project will determine how much physical activity in the form of walking can be safely and feasibly prescribed for people with severe knee osteoarthritis in the community. Patients that attend the orthopaedic outpatients department at Eastern Health will be invited to participate. We will apply methods commonly used in drug trials to work out how much of a medication can be safely prescribed, but apply these methods to physical activity to work out the maximum tolerated dose of walking for people with severe knee osteoarthritis. The project will begin with prescribing small doses of walking, and measuring the participants responses to determine if the prescribed dose is tolerated safely. For example, the walking dose may cause substantial knee pain for the participant that does not settle quickly with rest. This response is termed an adverse or undesired event. If there are no adverse events, the prescribed dose of walking will be escalated in the next independent group of participants until the maximum tolerated dose is reached. This is a phase I dose response trial to characterise the safety profile of a treatment. The outcome of this study will provide evidence for the level of physical activity that can be safely tolerated by people with knee osteoarthritis, and assist health professionals to prescribe safe amounts of walking. </summary>
