    <studytitle>A randomised controlled trial of an online healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid for women experiencing domestic violence (I-DECIDE)
</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>I-DECIDE: A trial to determine whether an online intervention encouraging users to self-inform, self-reflect and self-manage can increase self-efficacy and reduce depressive symptoms in women who have experienced fear of a partner and/or partner abuse in the past 6 months compared to a standard website.</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Women will complete a brief screening questionnaire to determine eligibility (age 16-50, female, experienced fear of a partner and/or emotional, sexual or physical violence over the past 6 months). Eligible women randomised to the intervention group will be emailed to confirm their participation in the study, and will receive the link to the intervention website. After logging in and completing the introductory study questions, women will proceed to the intervention home page, which consists of three modules, focusing on relationship health, safety, and weighing up priorities for their relationship. The modules contain questions and exercises to encourage reflection and raise awareness. On completion of these modules, women who indicate that they are unaware of being in an unhealthy relationship will be directed to a motivational interviewing exercise designed to help them reflect on the positives and negatives of the relationship. Women who have a greater level of awareness will not complete this module. Women will then proceed to the "Action Plan" which is an individualised list of strategies for safety and wellbeing tailored to the woman's priorities, level of danger, and whether or not she has children. She can explore a longer list of all available strategies if she wants more information or does not like the ones selected for her. The final step is a goal-setting exercise where women are invited to workshop a chosen strategy by exploring the options available to help them enact it, and the pros and cons for each. The overall aim of the intervention is for women to self-reflect, self-inform and self-manage in a safe and private space. The website on average will taken women around 30 minutes to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>Women will complete a brief screening questionnaire to determine eligibility (age 16-50, female, experienced fear of a partner and/or emotional, sexual or physical violence over the past 6 months). Eligible women randomised to the comparison group will be emailed confirming their enrolment in the study and will receive a link to the comparison website. The comparison website is a standard website, and will consist of the study questions, a standard emergency safety plan and links to domestic violence services and resources.</comparator>

    <concealment>Women will click "Be A Part of the Project" from the study homepage, which will direct them to an online eligibility screening questionnaire and information about the study. Once they have filled in the eligibility screens, their personal details, and consented to participate, their information is sent to a registration database for enrolment. The database automatically randomises them into the intervention or comparison group, and an email is sent to them containing the appropriate website link and their login details. As the websites are identical in design, but differ only in content, women's allocation to a particular group will be concealed.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A final sample size of at least 141 women in each of the two groups will be required to detect differences of a third of a standard deviation between group means on the primary outcomes at 6 and 12 months, with at least 80% power (alpha 5%, 2-sided test). This means that, based on an attrition rate of 30% by the 12 month follow-up time point, at least 404 eligible women will need to be recruited to the baseline phase of the trial (202 women in each group). The attrition rate is based on previous studies with this population. 

Characteristics of participants in each of the two study arms will be summarised using means and standard deviations (or percentiles) for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. Characteristics of participants in the two study arms will be compared at baseline to ensure that the randomisation was effective. Subsequent analyses will adjust for any baseline imbalances between groups strongly associated with the outcomes. Mixed effects linear regression will be used to compare scores between the two study groups on continuous outcomes. Marginal logistic regression using Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE) will be used to compare results for the two groups on binary outcomes. All regression models will adjust for baseline outcome measures and for any baseline imbalances strongly associated with the outcomes. Analyses will also take into account repeated measures over time where appropriate. A two-tailed alpha level of .05 will be used throughout analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the I-DECIDE trial is to evaluate an online healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid for women experiencing domestic violence. The study will investigate whether the I-DECIDE intervention can be effectively delivered online, and whether it can overcome some of the barriers encountered in face-to-face interventions. The intervention is designed to provide tailored information, resources, and feedback that enables women to self-inform, self-reflect, and self-manage. 

It is hypothesised that using I-DECIDE could increase women's self-efficacy and reduce their depressive symptoms when compared to a standard website. Secondarily, it is anticipated that I-DECIDE could increase the number of actions for safety and wellbeing that women engage in and reduce their level of fear while remaining cost-effective.</summary>
