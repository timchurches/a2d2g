  <interventions>
    <interventions>One hundred twenty intensive care patients who were intubated and mechanically ventilated were enrolled in the study.  Patients were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of 30 patients.Group I: Control group: Supine position,Group II: 10 degree Trendelenburg position,
Group III: 50 degree passive leg elevation position,
Group IV: 10 degree Trendelenburg position plus 50 degree passive leg elevation position.  For all patients, transverse and vertical length, depth, and surface of the internal jugular vein were measured first in the supine and then in the intervention position.Anterior-posterior and transfer diameter, cross sectional area (CSA) and depth were calculated by the same anesthesiologist from the recorded internal jugular vein images. CSA was calculated by the planimeter method. 
For depth measurement, the distance from the skin surface to the anterior wall of IJV was measured.After giving the position for the intervention (internal juguler vein catheterization)  the chronometer was started. If the time to the vein puncture was more than 20 minutes or any complications occurred during the procedure, that patient was not included in the study. </interventions>

To determine the extent of the increase in internal jugular vein (IJV) size(Anterior-posterior and transfer diameter, cross sectional area (CSA) and depth ) in the patients who received the Trendelenburg position, passive leg elevation, or both for  is assessed via  USG. IJV size were calculated by the same anesthesiologist from the recorded internal jugular vein images. CSA was calculated by the planimeter method.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to establish the change in the size of the right internal jugular vein by placing the patient in the Trendelenburg position, assuming a passive leg elevation, or both, as well as the success of this change and its effect on mechanical complications.One hundred twenty intensive care patients who were intubated and mechanically ventilated were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly divided into four groups, each consisting of 30 patients. For all patients, transverse and vertical length, depth, and surface of the internal jugular vein were measured first in the supine and then in the intervention position.Group I: Control group: Supine position
Group II: 10 degrees Trendelenburg position,
Group III: 50 degrees passive leg elevation position,
Group IV: 10 degrees Trendelenburg position plus 50 degrees passive leg elevation position. Intervention was performed in the supine position in the control group and in the latter in other groups. The change observed in the vein size, along with the positional change and the success of this intervention and its effect on mechanical complications were determined.
