  <interventions>
    <interventions>The BEST audio-visual tool in a culturally and linguistically appropriate education video that describes how to successfully complete an EST. The 5 minute language intervention tool will be played to patients by the researcher 10 minutes prior to the patients undergoing the EST in the waiting room. Those allocated to intervention will view the content using a hand held tablet computer (iPad) or a DVD in English or one of several local Aboriginal languages. The preference for language will be determined by subject self-selection.

</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be shown a placebo audio visual tool developed by the National Heart Foundation. The educational video is titled: 'Warning Signs of a Heart Attack'. This resource will only be available in English and runs for approximately 10 minutes.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>This study aims to increase conclusive Exercise Stress Testing results amongst testing subjects at the Alice Springs Hospital.

The criteria for inducible ischaemia is as follows: 
                               -ST segment depression &gt;2 mm (Horizontal or down-sloping) in contiguous leads - with or without symptoms 
                               - deep T inversion - with or without symptoms
                               - ST segment elevation of 1 mm in chest leads or 2 mm in limb leads  with or without symptoms
                              - Transient LBBB

           Equivocal EST  requiring further evaluation:
                              - ST depression 1-2 mm (Horizontal or down-sloping) with or without symptoms
                              - Transient T wave changes
                              - Abnormal BP response.
                              - Reproducible symptoms (subjective) with no abnormality on ECG or Haemodynamic response or ECG and Haemodynamic abnormalities not qualifying as Positive EST
                              - Increasingly frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVC) during exercise - suggestive of ischaemia
                              - Frequent PVCs in recovery period

           Negative EST: 
-	No or &lt;1mm ST segment depression despite achieving 85% of maximal age-predicted HR
-	Up-sloping ST depression only

    <concealment>Once informed consent is obtained eligibility will be reassessed and if the patient is suitable they will be allocated a sequential unique study identification code. Only once this code is allocated will the research open a double sealed envelope which matches this identification code containing the subject allocation to active or control intervention. The order of allocation will be pre-determined using a random list generated by the Stata statistical package ‘runiform’ command. </concealment>
    <sequence>Stata to generate a random balanced allocation will have for approximately every 10 participants will be 5 control and 5 intervention.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This study will comprise a piloting prior to anticipated extension to other sites. Whilst it would require the enrolment of 206 Aboriginal people to detect a reduction in the proportion of inconclusive tests from 50% to 30% (compared with 20% for non-Indigenous Australians) (assumed alpha 0.05, beta 0.2, power 0.8) this study will commence with the aim of enrolling 100 patients undergoing an EST, 50 randomized to the active intervention and 50 to the control intervention, with equal numbers of Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australian participants. Currently Alice Springs Hospital conducts approximately 270 ESTs per year.
Statistical analysis will be undertaken using Stata 13 (StataCorp, Texas, USA). Analysis of the primary endpoint will be undertaken using the Chi square statistic. Factors associated with a conclusive as compared with inconclusive test will be investigated using standard bivariate techniques and multivariable logistic regression. A p value less than 0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance and all tests will be two-sided.

    <summary>1.	To develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate patient education tool to inform conduct of EST in Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australians
2.	To evaluate this tool to determine if it can reduce the proportion of inconclusive EST results

Hypothesis:

A culturally and linguistically appropriate audio-visual resource will be associated with reduced inconclusive EST results in Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australians undergoing investigation for possible CHD.
