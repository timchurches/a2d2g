  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will use a questionnaire that will be sent to all private and public hospitals who provide cardiothoracic surgery in Australia and New Zealand. Physiotherapists who treat patients post coronary artery bypass graft surgery in these hospitals will be invited to participate in the study

The aims of the questionnaire are to determine:1. How much pain do physiotherapists believe post coronary bypass graft surgery patients are experiencing each postoperative day? 2. Do they believe patients pain management is adequate? 3. Do physiotherapists believe patients pain limit their walking abilities post CABG? 4. The basis for future research regarding pain management and physiotherapy management post CABG 

The questionnaire is to be returned after 1 month after it is mailed out. If the questionnaire is not returned after 1 month, respondents will be invited again to participate in the study

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapy treatment for patients undergoing Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery  involves pre operative education, and post-operative breathing exercises and coughing, early mobilisation and musculoskeletal exercises to prevent pulmonary complication and to aid in discharge from the hospital and return to activity in timely manner.  
Pain post CABG may be from surgical trauma, multiple cannulas including chest drains, and harvesting of internal mammary arteries (IMAs).  Ferguson et al reported that health professionals often underestimate pain the post CABG patients experience. The most common area the patients experience pain post CABG is the chest, where there is surgical wound, and also where chest drains have been. 
Studies have shown that CABG patients have limited ability to cough and perform breathing exercises, general activity and ambulation due to severe pain post surgery. 
There have been six surveys studying physiotherapy practice in Australia and New Zealand, Sweden, the UK and Canada, however, none of these surveys provided information on physiotherapists perception of patients pain post CABG, or whether physiotherapists believed pain was a limiting factor for patients to reach walking milestone and what guidelines were used to establish milestones for distance to mobilise patients  
This study will enable the investigators to collect data on physiotherapists perception of CABG patients pain post surgery in Australian and New Zealand hospitals. The survey will also identify whether physiotherapists believe pain limits patients walking distance and whether they believe pain management post CABG is adequate.

Hypothesis: Physiotherapists perceive that patients undergoing CABG surgery experience significant pain, therefore it impacts on their walking distance in Australia and New Zealand hospitals.
