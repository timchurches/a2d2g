  <interventions>
    <interventions>This group is to receive both the passive positioning intervention and the prescription of home exercises intervention.  The passive positioning intervention is to be provided twice a week for two consecutive weeks.  Following each passive positioning treatment intervention,  supervision of prescribed home exercises is to be undertaken.  Additionally, participants are to be instructed to perform the home exercises independently twice per day in a pain-free range. 

For the passive-positioning treatment intervention, a digitally tender point (DTP) is to be treated by passively positioning the participant (that is, the participant does not assist the investigator in positioning the participants body) such that there is a two-thirds reduction in tenderness at the DTP (Jones, Kusunose et al. 1995).  Kusunose (Kusunose 1993).  Participants are to be asked to consider that their initial DTP tenderness is 10 on a verbal analogue scale where 0 is no tenderness.  Appropriate passive positioning is to be assumed to have been reached when the participant rates tenderness at 3 or less on the scale with intermittent probing at the DTP.  In addition to reported tenderness with intermittent probing, perceived tissue tension is to be used to guide the experimenter to the appropriate passive position.  The participant is to be passively maintained at this point by the experimenter for 90 seconds before being slowly and passively returned to a neutral position (Kusunose 1993) (Jones, Kusunose et al. 1995).  A DTP is to be considered successfully treated if a reduction of greater than 70% tenderness is achieved (Kusunose 1993).  Experimentally, this is to be determined by asking the participant to again rate their tenderness at the DTP, following passive positioning, with reference to the verbal analogue scale.  If tenderness is rated at 3 or less then the DTP is to be considered successfully treated.  

For the home exercise prescription intervention, exercises are to include: 
1) Side-lying abdominal bracing (activation of deep abdominal stabilisers).
2) Supine (on back) alternate knee to chest holds.
3) Supine lumbar rotation (keeping knees together while rolling them side to side).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is to receive only the prescription of home exercises intervention.
Home exercises are to be supervised by the investigator twice a week for two consecutive weeks for this group.  Additionally, participants are to be instructed to perform home exercises independently twice per day in a pain free range.

Home exercises are to be the same as those performed by the passive positioning intervention group.  That is, they are to comprise three exercises:
1) Side-lying abdominal bracing (activation of deep abdominal stabilisers).
2) Supine (on back) alternate knee to chest holds.
3) Supine lumbar rotation (keeping knees together while rolling them side to side).</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants are to contact the physiotherapy departments of one of two public hospitals for treatment of their low back pain.  After initial assessment and confirmation that they meet inclusion criteria, they are to be invited to participate in the study.  After reading participant information forms and signing informed consent forms they are to select an envelope in which their group allocation is concealed.  Assignment to either the treatment or control group is to remain concealed from the participant.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapists sometimes use passive positioning of the body (positioning of the patients body by the physiotherapist without the patient helping) to treat for pain and loss of movement.  When using such a passive positioning technique, Strain-Counterstrain, digitally tender points are used for assessment and treatment (Jones, Kusunose et al. 1995).  This technique has not been researched and so there is little support for its continued use.  The aim of this study is to examine the effect of passive body positioning treatment for low back pain in a clinical population. Subjects are to be randomly assigned to either a treatment group or a control group.  The treatment group are to receive passive-positioning treatment (Strain-Counterstrain) in addition to exercise instruction while the control group is to receive only exercise instruction.  Interventions are to be provided twice in a week for two weeks.  Treatment and control interventions are to be provided within half an hour on each occasion.  To find digitally tender points and assess these  during treatment interventions,  it will be necessary for the experimenter to press gently with thumb or forefinger at sites in the lower back, loin, buttock, abdominal, anterior pelvic and pubic areas (Jones, Kusunose et al. 1995) (Kusunose and Wendorff 1990).  Subjects may be required to lie on their back or stomach for up to 15 minutes at a time.  In this study there is little or no risk of injury if subjects have met the selection criteria for entry into the study.  Subjects in the treatment group may experience some temporary discomfort at digitally tender point sites that are pressed during assessment and intervention.  Approximately a third of clients have been found to experience a muscle-ache type of discomfort in the day following passive body positioning.  Subjects may experience a reduction in low back pain as a result of participating in this study.  The study may provide evidence for the effectiveness of passive positioning treatment for low back pain.</summary>
