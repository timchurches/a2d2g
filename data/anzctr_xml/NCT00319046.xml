             Day 1.

          7. History of significant lactose intolerance.

          8. Clinically significant diarrhea (&gt;3 liquid stools per day for &gt;7 days) without
             definable cause within 6 months prior to Day 1, or a history of clinically relevant
             gastrointestinal disorders.

    <summary>Although miglustat has been approved as a treatment for mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher
      disease in patients who are unsuitable for enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), more data are
      required to establish the long term efficacy, safety and tolerability of miglustat in
      maintaining diseases stability after a switch from ERT.</summary>
