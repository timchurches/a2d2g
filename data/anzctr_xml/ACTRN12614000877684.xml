  <interventions>
    <interventions>All men will undergo both the NaF PET/CT as well as the Bone Scintigraphy (BS) only once (at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis). These will be done within a three day period and most likely on two consecutive days; both scans cannot be done on the same day. 
The PET/CT uses the radio-active marker 18F NaF which is injected intravenously. The patient will then be scanned, roughly 45-90 minutes later. This scan picks up abnormalities within bone, but is more sensitive than the Bone Scintigraphy.
Within the next two days, the patient will then undergo the Bone Scintigraphy. </interventions>
    <comparator>Bone Scintigraphy (BS) is a nuclear scanning test used to pick up abnormalities in bone. It involved the intravenous injection of Technetium (99mTc) medronic acid. It is a very common investigation and is the standard staging modality for prostate cancer. Each scan takes around one hour and for this study, will be undertaken just once.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Investigate the incremental management impact of staging with 18F labelled NaF PET/CT in patients with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer. This will be done by using an assessment of impact proforma which denotes high, medium, low and no impact to a management regimen based on certain changes in management intent and modality of therapy.Surgeons will record the management plan and goals of treatment (cure/palliative) upon viewing of the BS. At this stage they will be blinded to the PET/CT. Upon documentation, the PET/CT will become available for viewing and the surgeon will be asked to record their management plan and goals of treatment with the information gathered from the PET/CT</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the management impact of staging with a diagnostic scan known as 18-F Sodium Fluoride PET/CT compared to bone scintigraphy in men with prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged at least 18 years with newly diagnosed, untreated, biopsy confirmed, intermediate to high risk prostate cancer. Study details: All participants in this study will undergo two different diagnostic tests. The first test is called 18-F Sodium Fluoride Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT), and this involves the injection of a small amount of radioactive tracer into your veins. You body is then scanned to look for areas of tracer-uptake which may suggest cancer in your bones. The second test is called bone scintigraphy, and this involves a different radioactive tracer. Surgeons will first view the bone scintigraphy and use this to record a management plan and treatment goals. They will then view the 18-F Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and record a separate management plan. It is suggested that 18-F Sodium Fluoride PET/CT can pick up prostate cancer that has spread to the bone better than Bone Scintigraphy (BS). We wish to assess whether having access to 18-F Sodium Fluoride PET/CT actually changes the surgeons intended management of men with intermediate to high risk prostate cancer, and whether the detection of bone metastases (cancer spread to bone) is different between tests.</summary>
