  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twenty five diabetic foot ulcer subjects residing in rural areas will receive 20-minute standard of wound care (sharp debridement and normal saline dressing). It will be administered by a local nurse fortnightly for 3 months in liaison with podiatrist and endocrinologist at The Townsville Hospital linked via dedicated T1 line on the Queensland Health telemedicine to advice on ulcer healing and opinion on treatment of wound infection respectively.  Wound ulcer healing will be monitored electronically using a specialized 3-D camera.</interventions>

    <sequence>The randomization list will be prepared by an independent statistician by the method of computer-generated random numbers for each treatment. Patients in each stratum will be assigned numbers using a central stratified randomization scheme designed to provide 1:1 of patients in the 2 groups. Patients will be randomized to usual or telemedicine group. An interim analysis will be performed after recruiting 50% of the proposed study participants. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Clinical and biochemical data of the subjects will be represented as absolute numbers and percentages while chi-square test will be performed to test for association between two categorical factors. For continuous data that are not normally distributed Mann-Whitney U test will be performed using SPSS version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Results will be considered statistically significant at a p value less than 0.05. 

Cost-effectiveness will be expressed as an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which will be calculated as incremental costs divided by incremental effects. The results will be presented in cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Furthermore, prospective cost-savings from use of telemedicine in rural areas will be analysed using a one-way sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of findings in net savings. Savings in this model will be attributed to: (a) avoiding travel by the patients and escorts to a tertiary centre; and (b) avoiding overnight accommodation for patients and escorts in Townsville. Savings from avoiding travel by patients to a tertiary centre will be calculated by multiplying return travel cost for two people (the patient and one escort) by the number of consultations as determined and fully reimbursed by the Queensland Health Patient Subsidy Scheme (PTSS).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Diabetes foot ulcer (DFU) is a serious complication of diabetes that leads to prolonged hospitalisation and &gt;80% of diabetes-related lower limb amputations (1). Although a number of health disparities exist between rural and urban areas in Australia, management of diabetes foot ranks as one of the most significant health concerns (2). Compared to Australian major cities, rural/remote areas experience two to three times higher rate of hospitalisation and limb amputation due to diabetes (3). Despite high prevalence of diabetic foot complications in rural/remote areas, there are surprisingly no special programs aimed at reducing the burden of the disease. Significant challenges such as access to the health care centres and staffing limitations have made quality of care comparisons between rural and urban centres difficult. Currently subjects with DFU living in rural/remote areas in the region have to travel long distances to Townsville Hospital Diabetes Centre (THDC) on weekly basis for wound care. The annual Medicare cost for care in patients with diabetes who have foot ulcer is 3 times that of patients with diabetes who do not have ulcer, with inpatient care accounting for 70% of ulcer care costs (4). A program that effectively manages foot ulcers and reduces hospital admissions could substantially reduce costs of care in diabetes. Use of telemedicine may help solve the scarcity of specialist diabetes wound care in such underserved communities in our region. 

Objectives: to assess clinical and economic impacts of telemedicine in management of foot ulcers in rural/remote areas of North Queensland.
