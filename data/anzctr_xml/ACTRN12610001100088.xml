  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twice daily, progressive mobilisation of up to 30 minutes each day, performed one on one with a physiotherpist until discharge from hospital, unless contraindicated. All participants (including the intervention and control groups) will receive standard care.

Initial assessment comprises a timed 10m walk test, and the Human actvity Profile questionnaire.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care comprises individual education about physical activity for heart failure, with in-hospital and home exercise. All patients will receive standard care.</comparator>

    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion criteria:
New York Heart Association Classification: IV (shortness of breath at rest)
Terminally ill
Poor cognition or reduced ability for self care as deemed by treating medical team
Orthopaedic or other limitations that prevent mobility
Awaiting therapeutic cardiovascular procedure or hospitalisation for surgery 
Presence of heart failure secondary to significant uncorrected primary valvular disease (except for mitral regurgitation secondary to LV dysfunction), new onset atrial fibrillation, anaemia
Obstructive and restrictive cardiomyopathies (diastolic heart failure)
Pacemakers which do not permit adequate heart rate response to exercise
Inability or refusal to sign informed consent

Safety criteria
Participants will not undergo mobilisation if they: 
Are haemodynamically unstable
Show signs of recent heart attack including such as new/recurrent chest pain in the past 8 hours, rising troponin levels
Show new signs of uncompensated heart failure (such as dyspnoea at rest)
Show signs of heart electrical conduction problems (e.g. 3rd-degree AV block)
Have uncontrolled irregular heart rhythms (e.g. recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, fast heart rate &gt;110 beats per minute)
Have a resting systolic blood pressure &gt;200mmHg or resting diastolic blood pressure of &gt;110mmHg
Have a resting systolic blood pressure of &lt;90mmHg patient will be reviewed  by the medical team prior to mobilisation
Have poorly controlled symptomatic postural or low blood pressure (drop of &gt;20mmHg with symptoms)
Resting oxygen saturation: &lt;92%
Clinical judgement by the exercise specialist that patient clinical presentation is such that it would preclude safe mobility</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Initial contact will be made with potential participants on the ward. Participants will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  All participants will have medical clearance to be involved in this study. An information sheet will be provided to participants, and an opportunity to have all their questions answered by a member of the investigative team. Informed consent will be signed. Following the initial blinded assessment, patient allocation to the intervention and usual care groups will be undertaken via randomisation using a computer generated program by a person not involved in the recruitment and assessment of the participants. Participant allocation will be concealed using closed envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Following the initial blinded assessment, patient allocation to the intervention and usual care groups will be undertaken via randomisation using a computer generated program by a person not involved in the recruitment and assessment of the participants. To ensure approximate equal numbers in each group, a permuted block randomisation will be used.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Each participant will receive physiotherapy treatment involving one-on-one education about physical activity for heart failure, including guidelines for walking and exercise while an inpatient at The Prince Charles Hospital. A walking and exercise program for home will also be provided before discharge. 

In addition, those in the walking group will receive twice daily walking supervised by a physiotherapist. Treatment will take up to 40 minutes each day to complete and will be carried out each day until discharge. 

All participants will undergo an assessment prior to discharge involving a walking test to measure walking capacity in 6 minutes and activity levels. Soon after discharge activity levels will again be monitored and all participants will receive surveys looking at quality of life and return to everyday activity in the community.</summary>
