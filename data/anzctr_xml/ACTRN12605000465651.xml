  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible subjects enter a run-in phase and receive open label Seretide Accuhaler 500/50 ug twice daily for 4 weeks. An Electronic Diary Card (EDC) is used twice daily to capture spirometry measurements (PEF &amp; FEV1), asthma symptoms and medication use. Subjects who do not suffer an exacerbation and demonstrate satisfactory use of their EDC will be randomised to receive either flucticasone proprionate (FP) 500 ug twice daily alone or in combination with salmeterol (Seretide) for 8 weeks. 

Four weeks after randomisation, subjects will return to the clinic (Visit 3) for assessment of their level of asthma control, using the Total Asthma Score (TAS).The TAS is based on asthma symptoms, frequency of Ventolin (salbutamol) use and electronic spirometric monitoring over 4 weeks preceeding a visit. Subjects will then enter the down titration phase of the study and visit the clinic every 8 weeks for 11 months (Visits 4-9).  At each visit their eligibility for a step down to a lower dose of FP will be assessed using the TAS. Subjects will be eligible for a dose reduction if their TAS is stable or lower than at the previous visit.  Subjects who complete week 52 will be considered to have completed the study.</interventions>
