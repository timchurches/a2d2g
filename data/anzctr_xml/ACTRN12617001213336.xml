  <interventions>
    <interventions>Schools allocated to the intervention group will implement a program to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in students, using a whole schools approach by adopting strategies across the three arms of the Health Promoting Schools Framework. The intervention will run for approximately three school terms from Term 4 2017 to Term 2 2018 (one school term runs for approximately 10 weeks).

Curriculum and teaching:
Students will participate in two nutrition education lessons conducted in the second term of the intervention, relating to SSB that will be incorporated into schools Personal Development, Health and Physical Education (PDHPE) classes which are compulsory up to Year 10. These lessons will cover topics such as the sugar content of SSB, health effects of excessive SSB consumption, and swapping to healthier options. Additionally, as part of the lesson, students are able to obtain individualised feedback and information on monitoring their own SSB consumption (by linking students to an external Drinks Calculator webpage), as well as learn to support their peers. The lesson plans will be created by the research team with consultation from secondary school teaching professionals, and disseminated to the school teachers to use during the second term of the intervention.

Students will receive fortnightly push notifications in the second term of the intervention and monthly push notifications in third term of the intervention via the Skoolbag app. Push notification will provide advice on reducing their SSB consumption and suggestions of healthier drink alternatives. The adverse health effects of excessive SSB consumption will also be presented as well as reminders to be physically active and tips on eating healthy. A total of eight push notifications will be drafted by the research team in consultation with a marketing and communications expert and sent out by the school.

A school-based one month challenge for students to eliminate SSB from their diets will be carried out and led by a student committee in each school that will plan the details on marketing and activities for their school. Funding and resources will be provided by the research team on the completion of a grant application. Following a Launch Day, students will be encouraged to participate in a pledge to not consume SSB during the month, and inter-class competitions to reduce SSB consumption will also be held. Strategies and activities will focus on increasing awareness and motivation, and foster peer support to reduce SSB consumption. Parents will be informed of the challenge through the newsletter and encouraged to take part by doing the pledge at home with their children.

Ethos and environment: 
The Healthy School Canteen Strategy (NSW Canteens) includes a continued ban on sugary drinks. It is compulsory in DET schools and strongly encouraged to be adopted in CSO schools. Intervention schools will be advised of the policy that all SSB are not to be sold in NSW public schools, and additional guiding principles will be provided for a whole school approach. These guiding principles will be discussed with the schools to fit into the schools management plan and local procedures but will contain the key messages of the intervention. These will be established with the school principal at the start of the intervention.

School canteens (or other food outlets) will have their drinks menu audited at the start of the intervention by a dietitian and feedback provided via a canteen feedback report to intervention schools. The report will contain advice on reducing the sale of SSB specific to their canteen characteristics and a meeting will be arranged with the canteen staff to provide feedback on the report. Canteens will be advised to lower the availability of SSB in the canteen by removing sales or cutting down on SSB options. Drinks in the canteen will be labelled with Everyday, Occasional and Banned/ Never Sell as per the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy. SSB that are still sold in the canteens will be removed from display and concealed under the counter. SSB will also receive an increased price mark-up compared to their current selling price at baseline and occasional drinks will be encouraged to have a price mark up as well, while ensuring that all SSB and Banned drinks are more expensive than Occasional drinks, and all Occasional drinks are more expensive than Everyday drinks. The goal by the third term of the intervention is to remove all sales of SSB in the school. Two further canteen reports will be provided during the second and third term of the intervention to continue helping canteens work towards that end goal. 

Similarly, a dietitian will audit the drinks vending machines at the start of the intervention by requesting a photo of the front of the vending machines with the drinks displayed. Feedback will be provided via a vending machine feedback report to intervention schools. The report will contain advice on reducing the sale of SSB specific to their vending machines characteristics and a meeting will be arranged with the relevant staff to provide feedback on the report.  Schools will be advised to lower the availability of SSB in their vending machines by removing or cutting down on SSB. Drinks in vending machines will be labelled with Everyday, Occasional and Banned/ Never Sell as per the NSW Healthy School Canteen Strategy. Placement of drinks in the vending machine will be altered so that Everyday drinks appear at the top of the vending machine, followed by Occasional, and finally Banned/ Never Sell. SSB will receive an increased price mark-up compared to their current selling price at baseline and occasional drinks will be encouraged to have a price mark up as well, while ensuring that all SSB and Banned drinks are more expensive than Occasional drinks, and all Occasional drinks are more expensive than Everyday drinks.  Again, the goal by the third term of the intervention is to remove SSB from sale in the school. Two further vending machine reports will be provided during the second and third term of the intervention.

Two water stations will be placed on school grounds in each intervention school to encourage water consumption to displace SSB. These water refill stations will be sourced and installed by DEC Assets Management. Water bottles will be distributed to all students as a supplemental resource. Flow meters will be added to the water refill stations to monitor the amount of water consumed by students.

Partnerships and services:
Parents will receive fortnightly push notifications in the second term and monthly push notifications in third term via the Skoolbag communication app.  Push notifications will provide advice on reducing their own SSB consumption and availability in the home environment, and provide suggestions of healthier drink alternatives, as well as the importance of role modelling on their childs health behaviours will be covered. The adverse health effects of excessive SSB consumption and tips on how to reduce the parents own SSB consumption will also be included. By linking parents to an external Drinks Calculator webpage, they can also monitoring their own SSB consumption. A total of eight push notifications will be drafted by the research team in consultation with a marketing and communications expert and sent out by the school, coinciding with the push notification to students.

A short snippet will be included in the school newsletter at the start of each school term to provide updates on the intervention, including the school-wide challenge. Summarised results of the study will also be published in the newsletters. These newsletter snippets will be drafted by the research team and sent out by the school at the start of each school term. A total of three newsletter snippets will be drafted.

Additionally, evidence-based support strategies will be used to facilitate the implementation of the pilot study. These strategies have been proven to be effective in facilitating the adoption of school-based nutrition interventions and have been listed below.

Communication and marketing: Promotional material such as newsletters and posters will be placed within school grounds and push notifications with key messages will be sent out to parents and students.

Staff information: A presentation at a staff meeting as well as online staff professional development session will be provided to staff to equip them with the skills and knowledge. The staff meeting will be conducted by a project officer/ dietitian and will run for 20 minutes. The online staff professional development session will take approximately ten minutes to complete and will be hosted on the resources website for the program, describing the roles and responsibility of staff members to assist with bettering the school nutrition environment. A project officer/ dietitian will also have regular meetings with the canteen manager to provide the feedback and support required to execute the action plans for the environmental changes to the schools onsite food outlets.

Resources and promotional incentives: Resources such as lesson plans, canteen and vending machine pictograms, posters, newsletter and push notification will be provided to the intervention school. Incentives related to the intervention such as kitchen equipment to make healthy drinks more available, water bottle refill stations and water bottles will be provided to the schools as well.

School champion and student committee: These will serve as change agents in schools by actively supporting and advocating the key messages of the intervention.

Website: A website will be created to contain resources for the school, students and parents for easy access.

Cultural appropriateness: The proposal and materials is being reviewed by an Aboriginal Advisory panel and approval will be established before being disseminated to schools.</interventions>

    <concealment>A convenience sample of schools meeting the eligibility criteria will be sent a letter with an invitation to participate in this pilot study. One to two weeks following the letter, a member of the research team will contact the school principals to invite the school to the study. A face to face meeting will also be offered. Recruitment will occur until up to six or eight schools have been recruited. Signed consent forms from principals will be sought to confirm school participation.


Students in Year 7 to 9 of participating schools will be given an information statement describing the study but not group allocation, and a consent form to be handed to their parents requesting permission for their child to participate in data collection time points. A newsletter snippet and Skoolbag app post will be distributed simultaneously to inform parents of the study.  One to two weeks following the distribution of the letter, parents who have not returned a consent form or indicated that they do not wish to be contacted, will be phoned by staff employed through the education sector to ask if their child can participate in the data collection. Signed consent forms from parents will be sought to confirm child participation.

Schools that consent to participate will be randomised following baseline data collection, into the intervention or control group using a computerised random number function in Microsoft Excel by an independent statistician not involved in the recruitment, intervention or assessment. The statistician will be blinded to group allocation at the time of data analyses. The ratio of intervention to control schools will be 1:1 and schools will be randomised once baseline data collection is completed to reduce interviewer and participation bias.

School principals will then receive a letter from the research team informing them of their group allocation. A meeting with the school’s key stakeholders including the principal, canteen committee and school champion will be arranged to provide a brief on the key intervention components such as the guidelines, canteen strategies and lesson plans.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation was based on the required detectable difference for changes in SSB consumption to make a difference of clinical significance. Evidence from the literature indicates that a reduction of one serving of SSB per day, equating to a reduction of around 250mL of SSB, significantly decreases the risk of negative health outcomes and behaviours (1,2,3). With a total of 6 schools, assuming 100 students per school year (4) and a 70% consent rate from students in Year 7 to 9, an ICC of 0.02 (based on the recommendation from a review on school-based nutritional interventions (5) to account for potential school clustering effect, a standard deviation for SSB consumption of 0.9 servings (approximately 225mL) (6), this would allow the study to be sensitive enough to detect a daily SSB consumption difference of 81.05mL with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05. This was justified against estimations of a realistic reduction from results from a previous SSB trial that was effective in reducing SSB consumption in adolescents by 1.0-1.5 servings (approximately 250-375mL) per day (6,7,8).

The analyses will be undertaken by an independent statistician blinded to group allocation. The statistician will have no other involvement in this study. The primary outcomes are the mean overall daily energy (kJ) intakes and mean overall daily sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (mL). Both outcomes will be calculated from the student FFQ. Between-group differences at follow-up will be assessed through linear mixed models to account for school level clustering, controlling for baseline values. The study will use an intention to treat approach by including all students with completed FFQ at baseline and dealing with missing data at follow-up by using multiple imputation methods. Subgroup analyses will also be carried out with the data collected from the students when appropriate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in secondary schools in the Hunter New England and surrounding regions to reduce sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in students. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a school based nutrition intervention targeting sugar sweetened beverages in reducing daily sugar sweetened beverage consumption and daily percentage energy from sugar sweetened beverages of secondary school students. We hypothesise that a school based nutrition intervention targeting sugar sweetened beverages will be effective in these aims.

Convenience sampling methods will be used for recruitment whereby information letters will be sent out to invite principals to participate. A week will be given to the principal to consider the matter and then a phone call will be made to verbally invite the principal to participate their school in the program. A meeting will be arranged to explain the intervention to school staff should the school consent. The trial will run for three school terms and consists of a whole school approach towards encouraging the students to reduce SSB consumption in up to four intervention schools compared to an identical ratio of control schools that will continue with their usual school activities.

The intervention is guided by the Health Promoting Schools framework and consists of five evidence-based practices designed using the Behaviour Change Wheel to address student barriers to reducing SSB. These practises include nutritional education to students, building peer support, school guidelines, school nutrition environment modifications, and providing information to parents. More specifically, the intervention will involve providing nutritional education and notifications to students, a schoolwide challenge to reduce SSB consumption, implementing school guidelines to limit access to SSB, canteen and vending machine changes in the school, adding a water refill station in each school, and parental involvement through newsletters and notifications.

Primary outcomes are daily SSB consumption in students and daily percentage energy contributed from SSB in students' diet. Secondary outcomes include investigating the average daily SSB consumption of students in school, mediators of student SSB intake, average daily energy intake of students, and changes in mean student BMI. Data collection involves anthropometric measurements for BMI, a validated online food frequency questionnaire (Australian Child and Adolescent Eating Survey) and an online student survey.

Process evaluation: Regular audits will be conducted via observation at intervention schools to ensure the fidelity of the intervention. Parent usual dietary consumption will be assessed through a short diet survey at baseline, mid-point and follow up.  If parents consent, they will be invited to answer a short diet survey using questions extracted from the validated Australian Eating Survey for adults (AES).</summary>
