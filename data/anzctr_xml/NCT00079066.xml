  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can target tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Best
      supportive care is the use of drugs and other treatments to improve the quality of life of
      patients. Combining cetuximab with best supportive care may slow the growth of the tumor and
      help patients live longer and more comfortably. It is not yet known whether cetuximab
      combined with best supportive care is more effective than best supportive care alone in
      treating metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying cetuximab and best supportive care to
      see how well they work compared to best supportive care alone in treating patients with
      metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer.</summary>
