  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety of xenotransplantation of NTCELL as measured by the incidence of adverse events related to treatment - Adverse events can result from, for example, abnormal clinical laboratory tests (including xenogeneic viral analysis), abnormal physical examination findings, any abnormal findings following review by an infectious disease physician.

    <summary>To assess the safety of xenotransplantation of NTCELL [immunoprotected
      (alginate-encapsulated) choroid plexus cells] in patients with Parkinson's disease, assessed
      over the duration of the study, by monitoring the occurrence of adverse events and serious
      adverse events, including clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection in
      transplant recipients and their partners/close contacts. Subsequent safety follow-up will
      include lifelong monitoring for clinical and laboratory evidence of xenogeneic infection.

      be quantified by testing the secondary endpoints of the trial as described below (see
