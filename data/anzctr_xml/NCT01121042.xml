  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) - The PANSS is a widely used, drug-sensitive, valid and reliable measure of psychopathology in schizophrenia. The PANSS is a formal interview, from which 30 symptoms are rated along a 7 point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). Schizophrenia symptom severity will be assessed with the PANSS and monitored to determine change in total, positive, negative, cognitive or general psychopathology symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At screening visit and at three monitoring visits (week 4, week 8, week 12)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Montgomery Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) - The MADRS is a 10 item semi-structured clinician-rated interview of depression where each item (depression symptom) is rated of a 7 point scale ranging from 0 to 6. The MADRS will be used to monitor the participant's experience of depressive symptoms and severity across the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline visit and at three monitoring visits (week 4, week 8, week 12)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood Test= C-Reactive Protein (CRP) - CRP to determine changes in baseline levels in systemic and central nervous system inflammation)</outcome>

          3. Have been treated with a stable and standard dose (as determined by the PORT Treatment
             Recommendations for schizophrenia [33]) of an atypical antipsychotic agent (not

             cognitive dysfunction, as evidenced by at least 15 on the cognitive subscale. The
             cognition subscale used in this study, which included items of G10, G11, G12, P2, N5,
             and N7 from the PANSS were generated from previous studies.
