    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following hospital ethics committee approval, all elective patients undergoing a TKR at The Wollongong Hospital from July 2004 are given an explanation of research activity and a patient information sheet by an independent medical officer, the Anaesthetic Registrar, at the peri-operative clinic.  The patient's Anaesthetist on the day of surgery is to obtain written informed consent from the patient to enrol them in the trial.
Randomisation to occur in the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) by the nurse looking after the patient, who is not involved in the study.  The nurse is to draw the group allocation out of an opaque envelope in an area away from the patient, and prepare the appropriate PCA solution for the patient.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculations were based on a type I error of 0.05 and a type II error of 0.2, leading to a power of 0.8.  An initial sample size of 100 (that is 50 for each of the main groups) was selected arbitrarily to indicate size of effect.  Calculating Cohens D on this initial sample indicated a mean size of effect for Group 1 vs Group 2 (morphine vs morphine+ketamine PCA) of 17.6%, and for Group 1a vs Group 2a (morphine+NSAID vs morphine+ketamine+NSAID) of 17.0%.  Thus the aim was the recruit 530 patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Total Knee Replacements are associated with a frequent incidence of intense postoperative pain, particularly during early attempts at mobilisation.  This trial will investigate the effective of adding Ketamine to a Morphine Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) system in order to improve analgesic efficacy, focusing on the first 48 hours.  It will also measure side effects that might emerge from adding Ketamine to a Morphine PCA, the level of patient satisfaction with their PCA, and whether the addition of Ketamine leads to less PCA use.</summary>
