  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involved three 50 minute one-on-one weekly sessions of motivational interviewing enhanced CBT. Session one involved a discussion of a personalised feedback report which was based on the data gathered from assessment. This feedback was delivered in a motivational interviewing style which aimed to explore ambivalence and promote problem recognition and enhanced motivation to change.
Clinical sessions two and three focused predominantly on CBT skill building. Session two focused on understanding the concept of how situations, thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, emotions and behaviours interact and goal setting.  Motivational interviewing was used, when applicable. Session three primarily aimed to review prior skills learnt, examine homework outcomes, maintain/build motivation to change cannabis use behaviours, and train in additional coping skills (e.g. managing cravings, dealing with rationalizations, and relapse prevention).</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants were randomly allocated to an immediate treatment group (IT) commencing the week following the baseline assessment or a delayed treatment control group (DTC). The delayed treatment group was offered the treatment after the completion of the 3 month follow-up assessment.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants were initially screened for eligibility and referral into the study via the routine BMRI intake process. 
The numbers of those who were ineligible or who did not consent to be assessed for participation in a randomized 
trial were noted to enable adequate CONSORT reporting of participant flow through the study. Appropriate referral 
was provided as part of the standard BMRI intake procedure. 

At the first meeting between participant and clinician further screening was conducted to ensure eligibility. The
nature of the study (including the randomization process) was explained to the participant. Following the description of the study, the participant was taken through the participant information and consent form which 
detailed their rights as a participant, the voluntary nature of their participation and the limits of confidentiality. 
Participantâ€™s questions were answered and written informed consent obtained. Randomisation then occurred through the use of a random number generation.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation envelopes were prepared by an independent researcher with the aid of random number

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aimed to evaluate a brief intervention for a young population of cannabis users with comorbid mental health disorders. It was intended that this would serve as an adjunct to treatment-as-usual for the mental health disorder, with the goal to reduce cannabis use behaviour and to reduce disability associated with cannabis use. The intervention involved a motivational interviewing (MI) enhanced CBT treatment. The brief MI-enhanced CBT intervention was evaluated by comparison to a delayed treatment control (DTC) condition. The DTC group was offered the treatment after the completion of the 3 month follow-up assessment. Approximately one week after baseline assessment, the treatment group commenced their first of three weekly sessions, which lasted approximately one hour. Session one involved a discussion of a personalised feedback report which was based on the data gathered from assessment. This feedback was delivered in a motivational interviewing style which aimed to explore ambivalence and promote problem recognition and enhanced motivation to change.
Clinical sessions two and three focused predominantly on CBT skill building. Session two focused on understanding the concept of how situations, thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, emotions and behaviours interact and goal setting.  Motivational interviewing was used, when applicable. Session three primarily aimed to review prior skills learnt, examine homework outcomes, maintain/build motivation to change cannabis use behaviours, and train in additional coping skills (e.g. managing cravings, dealing with rationalizations, and relapse prevention). Follow-up assessments were conducted at 1- and 3-months post-baseline. These follow-up interviews were conducted by an independent research officer. The DTC group was offered the treatment after they completed the 3-month follow-up.</summary>
