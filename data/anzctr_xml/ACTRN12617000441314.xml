  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either active oxytocin or placebo nasal spray twice daily over a period of 12 weeks. Participants randomly allocated to receive active oxytocin will administer 16 IU of nasal spay twice a day (1 x 8 IU spray per nostril), receiving a total of 32IU per day of oxytocin.

Prior to randomisation to either active treatment or placebo, all participants will be requested to administer a placebo spray for 3 weeks in order to establish a baseline to control for expectancy effects. Participants will be unaware (masked) that they are receiving a placebo spray. Study staff will be aware that participants are receiving a placebo spray during this 3-week period.


Caregivers will be requested to complete a twice-daily check of treatment adherence, on a compliance and side effects monitoring sheet which will be provided to them at the outset of the study. Treatment compliance will also be assessed by a study staff member during a follow-up phone call to participants' caregivers which is to be placed 6 weeks after the initiation of either active oxytocin or placebo nasal spray administration.</interventions>

    <exclusivecriteria>Participants will be excluded if they are known to be hypersensitive to the preservatives in the nasal spray (E216, E218, and chlorobutanol hemihydrates). Participants with severe nasal obstruction/blockage will be excluded as this is likely to reduce the efficacy of the nasal spray medication. Further, participants whose caregivers report that they have a serious medical condition from one of the following categories will be excluded (evidenced through medical examination):
 1. severely compromised cardiac function
2. severely compromised hepatic function
3. severely compromised renal function 

These categories relate to common side-effects reported in previous oxytocin studies and recommended contraindications from product information for the nasal spray and intravenous formulations of oxytocin that have been marketed previously.</exclusivecriteria>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All data analyses will be performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Partial eta squared will be used to measure effect size. We will employ an intention-to-treat analysis with last observations carried forward. All eligible participants who have been randomised to oxytocin or placebo will be included in our analyses, regardless of treatment actually received or withdrawal from the study. For participants with missing baseline data, analysis for that measure will be excluded listwise. Level of significance will be set at p&lt;.05 and Bonferroni adjusted p-values used for multiple comparisons. Any deviations from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the protocol. Prior to analysis, scatter plots and box plots with outlier and normality statistics will be generated for all variables to identify outliers and issues with variable distribution. Extreme outliers (beyond 3 z scores in either direction) will be checked against source data and testing notes to verify whether they are the result of an error in data entry or a specific issue during testing (e.g., equipment failure), and any errors rectified. If they are not the result of an error in data entry, outliers will be curtailed. 

Mixed MANOVA will be used to model change in all primary outcome variables (length of eye-gaze, fixation count; ADOS; RBS-R; SRS; DBC; CGI) over time as functions of treatment (OT, Placebo). Power for the detection of drug effect will depend on the outcome measured and numbers retained in the trial.  The study will enroll 160 young children with ASD. The present research design incorporates four measurements. For all measures, we will analyse results based on parents treatment guess (whether they believed their child was on OT or placebo), because we have found in previous research that parents perceptions of which treatment their child received moderate treatment outcome for parent-report questionnaires. We will also look at age-related effects. With a regression based longitudinal analysis there will be power of .99 to detect treatment-related differences in eye-gaze length 50% as large as those previously found in healthy subjects, after allowing for effective sample size reduction to 130 due to dropout. (Power analysis parameters: linear multiple regression model with power of .20, sample size of 160, 10 predictors and an alpha level of .05).

For MRI data: all volume measurements between the two groups; pre-treatment scan against post-treatment scan for amygdala normalisation and increased social brain FA hypothesis; responders compared to non-responders for neurobiological markers hypothesis, will be compared using Student's t-test (independent-samples t-test). An analysis of covariance is used to compare the two groups on brain region measurements while controlling for age and total brain volume (TBV). Two-tailed statistical significance level is set at p &lt; 0.05 for all analyses. Given that the age of the children in both groups span 9 years, during a time of major maturational change and development, age-related effects will be examined with volume-age Pearson correlations for each group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with ASD aged 3 to 12 years will take a placebo spray for 3 weeks, followed by being randomised to a course of twice-daily nasally-administered oxytocin or placebo for 12 weeks in a double-blind, placebo-controlled between-subject design. We hope to identify children with ASD who benefit from this treatment and the associated cognitive and neurobiological markers that predict such changes.</summary>
