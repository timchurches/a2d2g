  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects who met the inclusion criteria will randomized into 4 groups. Neurodynamics intervention (group 1). Myofascial soft tissue treatment (group 2). Neurodynamics and myofascial soft tissue treatment (group 3). Sham intervention (group 4).
Each group received 6 sessions by a qualified physiotherapist. The sessions distribution was two sessions per week during the first two weeks and one session per week during the last two week. Each session took between 10 and 15 minutes. 
Group 1: Neurodinamics techniques with different kinds of mobilization: craniocervical flexion mobilization, cervical lateral glide and jawbone opening. Previous to all the mobilization the shoulder will be depressed and the elbow extended. It takes 10 minutes maximum to complete intervention exercises.
Group 2: Myofascial manual treatment of; sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius, suboccipitalis, temporal and masseter muscles. Every muscle took two minutes maximum to finish the treatment. It takes 10 minutes maximum to complete intervention exercises.
Group 3: subjects in this group will receive a condensed version of both treatments (the neurodynamics and myofascial techniques specified for Group 1 and 2). It takes 15 minutes maximum to complete intervention exercises.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group 4: subjects in this group will receive a sham treatment which consist in a very soft massage in the mid-thoracic area. 10 minutes</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness of the treatment protocol. Neurodynamics techniques and/or myofascial soft tissue techniques to reduce tension type headaches related symptoms, was assessed by the use of algometry at supraorbital nerve, masseter and temporal muscle.

      <outcome>Effectiveness of the treatment protocol. Neuroyinamics techniques and/or myofascial soft tissue techniques to reduce tension type headaches related symptoms, was assessed by the use of Headache impact test questionnaire </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness of the treatment protocol. Neurodynamics techniques and/or myofascial soft tissue techniques  to reduce tension type headaches related symptoms, was assessed using a headache diary, where they anote the pain perceived every day (three times a day at 09:00, 14:00, 21:00 aprox.) using a 100mm visual analogue scale to calculate intensity and we use this data to calculate the frequency </outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patients who do not fulfill the ICHD-II criteria for frequent episodic or chronic tension type headache will be excluded as well as if other primary or secondary headaches criteria are fulfilled.
There will be excluded those patients who can not undergo manual physiotherapy treatment due to biological, metabolic and psychological causes and those that have ever received physical therapy for headache, in order to avoid subjects-expentancy bias.
Those patients who have taken prophylactic medications for headache two month prior to the beginning of the research will be excluded to avoid masking the effects of treatment protocols.</exclusivecriteria>
