  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Periodontitis is a chronic infection, which is mainly associated with Gram-negative bacteria. The aim of the systematic periodontal therapy is to reduce the number of periodontal pathogens to avoid a further progression of the disease, thus to avoid further attachment/bone loss. Systematic periodontal therapy involves, after completion of the initial hygiene phase, debridement of the exposed root surfaces by means of scaling and root planning (SRP). However, some periodontal pathogens have shown to be very resistant to the conventional treatment of periodontitis: SRP and/or surgical periodontal therapy. Even the additional use of systemic and/or local antibiotics has not been able to completely eliminate the pathogens or to maintain periodontal health over a longer period of time so far.
In recent times a novel approach, the so called Air Polishing (Ap) has been developed for the removal of subgingival biolfim during SPT with the use a fine powder delivered via a commercially available injection abrasive water jet. Due to the small particle sizes of the powder the damage to the root surfaces compared to sonic, piezoelectric ultrasonic and magnetoconstrictive ultrasonics, is considerably lower.
The aim of this study is to investigate whether an adjunct use of a recently introduced Erythritol Powder (Ep) could further improve the clinical and/or microbiological parameters in patients with a mild or moderate type of chronic periodontitis who already received initial therapy (SRP) but are still showing probing pocket depths (PPD) of greater than, or equal to 5mm including bleeding on probing (BOP).
