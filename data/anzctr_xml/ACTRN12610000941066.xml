    <interventions>Intensive Exercise Physiology Intervention.
Each case will be classified retrospectively into the intensive or low intensity group. The classification will be based on the number and length of sessions the participant spends with an Exercise Physiologist. The intensive group will consist of those participants who spend a total of hours with the exercise physiologist greater than the mean for the entire sample population over the intervention period.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Exercise Physiologists are a relatively new allied health profession. The exercise physiologist provides exercise counselling with the objective being to improve various health related parameters for the client. However to date there is virtually no research available to confirm or refute the efficacy of the exercise physiologist in producing meaningful improvements in the health of an individual. A number of studies have reported exercise training leads to positive health outcomes in type II diabetes. An issue with these studies is that they are highly controlled. While this is desirable from the point of view of determining effects, it is often not reproducible in an applied setting and may not readily transform to patients continuing the exercise in a less controlled setting such as occurs in clinical practice.

The study will follow the changes in health markers in approximately 500 type II diabetics who undergo exercise physiology counselling in a clinical practice setting. A range of measures of physical function, participation in physical activity, quality of life and clinical prognosis will be measured on commencement in the study and after six months of treatment. The number of sessions with an exercise physiologist and whether or not patients received treatment with another allied health professional will be used as co-variates in the statistical analyses.</summary>
