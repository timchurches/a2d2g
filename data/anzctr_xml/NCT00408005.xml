  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of combination chemotherapy with vs without nelarabine - "Intent-to-treat" analyses (i.e. based on the regimen to which patients are initially randomized) will be the primary approach used to assess treatment efficacy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 10 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Efficacy of high-dose methotrexate (with leucovorin calcium rescue) and mercaptopurine vs escalating-dose methotrexate (without leucovorin calcium rescue) and pegaspargase - Analyses will be performed regularly to assess the possibility of an interaction effect (using a Cox regression likelihood ratio test) which will assess the four individual treatment regimens in the 2 x 2 design to see if a non-proportional hazards effect occurs for the combinations of the two main effect factors. Since the comparison of the methotrexate regimens utilizes a selection type analysis, no futility testing will be used for that comparison.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 10 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Event-free survival (EFS) after initial remission - This outcome can be modeled reasonably well by a linear decreasing hazard rate with no appreciable risk of failure after completion of year 4. EFS events include any type of relapse, death in remission or second malignant neoplasm. "Intent-to-treat" analyses (i.e. based on the regimen to which patients are initially randomized) will be the primary approach used to assess treatment efficacy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 4 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of toxicities of combination chemotherapy with vs without nelarabine as assessed by NCI CTCAE version 4.0</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of toxicities of high-dose methotrexate (with leucovorin calcium rescue) and mercaptopurine vs escalating-dose methotrexate (without leucovorin calcium rescue) and pegaspargase</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 3 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nelarabine toxicity assessment by National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 - Compared directly to their randomized control not receiving nelarabine with additional examination of the comparison within the separate methotrexate regimen subsets. These comparisons will focus on grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicities. The overall incidence of selected neurologic toxicities will also be monitored since these represent an important target category for nelarabine toxicity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to week 43</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of CNS relapse - Examined for various treatment regimen comparisons, and in the subset of patients who will not receive XRT CNS prophylaxis.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  T-ALL patients must be enrolled on AALL08B1 prior to treatment and enrollment on
             AALL0434

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed T-ALL or T-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-NHL)
             stage II-IV; B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma will not be eligible for this study; a
             diagnosis of T-ALL is established when leukemic blasts lack myeloperoxidase or
             evidence of B-lineage derivation (cluster of differentiation [CD]19/CD22/CD20), and
             express either surface or cytoplasmic CD3 or two or more of the antigens CD8, CD7,
             CD5, CD4, CD2 or CD1a; if surface CD3 is expressed on all leukemic cells, additional
             markers of immaturity, including transmission disequilibrium test (TdT), CD34 or CD99
             will be assessed for expression; cases with uncertain expression will receive
             additional review within the appropriate Children's Oncology Group (COG) reference
             laboratory

          -  T-NHL PATIENTS:

               -  For T-NHL patients with tissue available for flow cytometry, the criterion for
                  diagnosis should be analogous to T-ALL; for tissue processed by other means (i.e.
                  paraffin blocks), the methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic analysis to
                  establish the diagnosis of T-NHL defined by the submitting institution will be
                  accepted

          -  Prior therapy restrictions

               -  Patients shall have had no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy with the exception of
                  steroids and/or IT cytarabine

               -  IT chemotherapy with cytarabine is allowed prior to registration for patient
                  convenience; this is usually done at the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or
                  venous line placement to avoid a second lumbar puncture; (Note: the CNS status
                  must be determined based on a sample obtained prior to administration of any
                  systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, except for steroid pretreatment); systemic
                  chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours of this IT therapy

               -  Patients diagnosed as having T-NHL or T-ALL with respiratory distress or
                  hyperleukocytosis may require steroids prior to the initiation of additional
                  systemic therapy; they are eligible for AALL0434 and will be stratified, based on
                  the initial complete blood count (CBC); steroid pretreatment may alter the risk
                  group assessment; if the T-ALL patient's clinical status precludes a lumbar
                  puncture within 48 hours of the initiation of steroid therapy, T-ALL patients
                  CANNOT be classified as low risk and will be Intermediate or high risk based on
                  the results of the day 29 marrow as above; patients with T-NHL who receive
                  steroid pre-treatment will be classified as high risk; the dose and duration of
                  previous steroid therapy should be carefully documented

               -  For the management of airway compromise, patients who have received emergent
                  chest irradiation up to 600 cGy will be eligible for this study

          -  Patients with a prior seizure disorder requiring anti-convulsant therapy are not
             eligible to receive nelarabine; in addition, patients with pre-existing grade 2 (or
             greater) peripheral neurotoxicity, as determined prior to Induction treatment by the
             treating physician or a neurologist, are not eligible to receive nelarabine; these
             restrictions in eligibility are designed to prevent excessive nelarabine-induced
             central and peripheral neurotoxicity in at-risk patients; for the purposes of this
             study, this includes any patient that has received anticonvulsant therapy to
             prevent/treat seizures in the prior two years</inclusivecriteria>

               -  B-precursor lymphoblastic lymphoma

               -  Morphologically unclassifiable lymphoma

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying different combination chemotherapy regimens and
      their side effects and comparing how well they work in treating young patients with newly
      diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is
      more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia or T-cell lymphoblastic
      lymphoma.</summary>
