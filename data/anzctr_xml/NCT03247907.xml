  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A study undertaken to investigate mouth leak for airway discomfort/dryness while using CPAP.
      This study will also measure how much humidification is required to treat subsequent upper
      airway discomfort/dryness from mouth leak by utilizing different levels and types of
      humidification.</summary>
