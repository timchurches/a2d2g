  <interventions>
    <interventions>Multifaceted tailored intervention during a 6 month-period targeting the potential cause(s) of dizziness identified during a baseline multidisciplinary assessment. Established interventions will include the Otago home exercise program (strength and balance training exercises for 30min 3 times weekly and 2 walks of 30min weekly for 6 months; the program will involve home visits and phone contact with an exercise physiologist) to target poor balance, a vestibular rehabilitation program (over 8 weeks (within the 6months period) with a vestibular physiotherapist; the duration of the session will be about 30min) to target vestibular asymmetry, a booklet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (5 lessons including a weekly homework assignment (approximately 4 hours per week) over 8 weeks (within the 6-months intervention period) and telephone support by a clinical psychologist) to target depression disorders, comprehensive geriatric assessment and medication review with a geriatrician.</interventions>
    <comparator>the control group will receive no intervention. However, as part of our duty of care, if significant vestibular, postural hypotension, mental illness or high-fall risk problems are identified in control group participants at the fortnightly case conference meetings we will immediately provide the control participants (and their GPs with participant permission) with reports of these findings</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Choice stepping reaction time, a composite measure of reaction time, strength and balance. This is measured using a 'dance-mat' which displays 4 pressure-sensitive arrows (front left, front right, left, right) and is connected to a computer screen displaying the same arrows' arrangement. In this test the participant is required to step as fast as possible on the arrow on the mat which corresponds to the arrow lighting up on the computer screen. The participant performs 20 trials with the arrows displayed in a random order.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tilt table test of orthostatic hypotension: a decrease in systolic blood pressure greater than 20 mmHg, or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure greater than 10 mmHg or a decrease of systolic blood pressure to less than 90 mmHg after 3min of 70degrees head up tilt compared to lying, defines orthostatic hypotension whether or not symptoms.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brief summary: 	Between 10-30% of older community-living population report dizziness often leading to functional disability and psychological distress. The multifactorial aetiology of dizziness combined with a lack of validated diagnostic tests, and a tendency of clinicians to rely on poorly described symptoms and familiar assessments, are significant barriers to objectively establishing a successful diagnosis and implementing effective interventions. Thus, despite effective treatments being available, up to 40% of older people with reported dizziness remain undiagnosed and untreated. A multidisciplinary assessment battery, with new validated assessments of vestibular impairments is required for diagnosing and treating older people with dizziness. This project will aim to conduct a randomized control trial of a multifaceted dizziness intervention based on a multidisciplinary assessment. We hypothesize that a multidisciplinary assessment (tests of balance, inner ear function, blood pressure, mental health etc) followed by a tailored intervention (exercise program, vestibular rehabilitation, comprehensive geriatric assessment and medication review) will improve diagnosis, reduce self-reported dizziness, enhance postural stability and improve quality of life in older people suffering from dizziness.</summary>
