  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those patients that meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria, wishing to participate in the study will be asked to sign the consent form and a study participation number will be assigned. Only for those patients who require foot orthoses (FOs) intervention (as per inclusion criteria) will be allowed to take part to the study, and they will be asked to agree to wear the FOs for twelve months. Any participant may withdraw from the study at anytime without giving any reasons. 
Following gait analysis examination, those in the trial group will receive a unique customised semi-rigid pre-formed functional device with the same Dual Opulex performance 1.5mm material made from a neoprene base and a stretch nylon top cover (same as control FOs). The prescription of the FOs will be customised according to each individual biomechanical need, and supplied on the same day of the initial assessment. To customise the foot orthoses the research clinician will conduct a full biomechanical analysis that will involve both walking gait analysis and physical examination of lower limb joints, particularly of the foot and ankle. Once information is gathered to justify what type of customisation is needed, the same research clinician will use an on-site orthoses lab to make the necessary modifications.
One chief investigator (PhD student + 2 years experience as clinical podiatrist) will be responsible for the prescription of the trial intervention during the data collection period. All participants will be required to wear the FOs for 12 months, with follow-up consultations of 3 and 6 months. At 12 months participants will only be required to complete primary outcome assessments. These are self-assessed and do not require a research consultation. To monitor adherence to the intervention the chief researcher will check the integrity of the top-cover (at follow-up intervals) which will give an indication of compliance as it starts to produce a dynamic foot pressure indicative of usage after approximately 1 week of wear. 

The prescription of the trial foot orthoses will occur at any of the following sites:

- Sydney Children's Network Hospital (Randwick and Westmead)
Randwick - High Street Randwick NSW 2031
Westmead - Cnr Hawkesbury Road and Hainsworth Street, Westmead

- John Hunter Children's Hospital
Kookaburra Circuit, New Lambton Heights NSW 2305</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will receive a flat insole without rearfoot or forefoot corrections, and without any modifications that may impact on plantar pressure distribution.The control device top cover will be made from Dual Opulex performance 1.5mm material consisting of a neoprene base and a stretch nylon top. The base of the control device will be made from a 1mm leather board.
The top cover is representative of standard insole appearance regularly supplied by podiatrists.
With regards to compliance the top-cover will also give an indication of compliance as it starts to produce a dynamic foot pressure indicative of usage after approximately 1 week of wear. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)

The 100mm VAS will be used as one of the two primary outcomes in this RCT. Participants will be asked to rate their level of pain by drawing a vertical line on a 100mm horizontal scale. The left end point of the scale represents no pain, and the right end point represents the worst pain imaginable. The higher the score indicates more pain and vice versa for a lower score.
The participant's pain levels will be scored out of 100 each time it's measured. A clinically important difference is considered when there is a difference of more than 8mm between each interval.

with change in quality of life in children with rheumatic disease. Arthritis Rheum
2002;47:5015.


</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain will be measured using the VAS for the following follow-ups:
1. Baseline, prescription/allocation of foot orthoses 
2. 3 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses 
3. 6 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses. 
4. 12 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life is the second of the two primary outcomes assessed in this study. Quality of life will be measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Questionnare (PedsQL), a validated tool for use in children with arthritis and their parents/guardians. There are two PedsQL questionnaires that can be used for children with rheumatic disease. These are the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales which measures physical, emotional, social and school functioning; and the other is the PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module scales which is more specific for children with JIA by measuring their pain and hurt, daily activities, treatment, worry, and communication. In this clinical trial only the PedsQL 3.0 Rheumatology Module will be used. Both participants and parents are required to complete this questionnaire. The PedsQL questionnaire is scored out of 100 points.  A clinical important difference is considered when there is a 5 point difference between time intervals. Unlike the 100mm VAS pain score, a higher score on the PedsQL indicates a better quality of life, and therefore a more favourable outcome. The PedsQL will be self-reported by both the participants and parents/guardians, therefore assessors will be blinded to this outcome. In addition to the PedsQL 3.0 questionnaire, the Juvenile Arthritis Foot Disability Index (JAFI) will also be used to measure quality of life. The JAFI questionnaire comprises of 3 sections (27 responses) focusing on foot related questions regarding impairment, activity limitation and participation restriction. The JAFI is only completed by the child or adolescent with JIA. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain will be measured using the VAS for the following follow-ups:
1. Baseline, prescription/allocation of foot orthoses 
2. 3 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses 
3. 6 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses. 
4. 12 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The first of the secondary outcomes measured in this study will be the count of swollen and tender joints. No research currently exists that explores the effectiveness of a mechanical therapy alone in the reduction of lower limb swollen and tender joints in children with JIA. The assessment tool that will be used to measure swollen and tender joints will be the tool that was developed by Helliwell et al (2007) for the assessment of swollen and tender joints in adult rheumatoid arthritis. This tool will be modified and will include the: hip; knee; ankle; sub-talar; talo-navicular; calcaneo-cuboid; metatarsophalangeal; and finally the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. Each side of the lower limb will have twenty individual joints to count for both swelling and tenderness. Joint count for swelling and tenderness will be recorded at baseline, 3 and 6 month follow-up assessments. </outcome>
      <timepoint>1. Baseline, prescription/allocation of foot orthoses

2. 3 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses

3. 6 months post prescription/allocation of foot orthoses</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gait Analysis

For both groups, secondary outcome data (gait analysis) will be collected at baseline, 3 months and 6 months using F-Scan insole and HR Mat (Tekscan Trademark, Boston, USA). Both systems are equipped with exactly the same sensors resolution allowing for data analysis comparison.
A randomised sequence of the gait analysis state will be recorded, amongst barefoot, shoes alone, and shoes and control/trial FOs. This procedure will account for fatigue potentially exhibited by symptomatic JIA children during acquisition of gait data in both groups.  
The equipment will be set up according to the manufacturer instructions before the start of the trial. The equipment will be calibrated before each recording is taken for each participant.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>POWER CALCULATION 
Power calculations were based on the outcome of pain measured on VAS, for which the minimal important difference is 8mm (Dhanani et al. 2002). No data is currently available for the minimal important differences for assessing swollen/tender joints All data collected during the study from baseline, 3 months and 6 months will be represented graphically using the histograms and/or box-plots and a Shapiro-Wilks test will be carried out to test for normality. A series of group analysis will be carried out. For a 5% 2-sided t-test with a=0.05 and power 80% for a RCT design with baseline and 2 post-intervention observations, and a moderate effect size, it was estimated that a total of 46 subjects would be required (23 controls and 23 trial) (Noordzij et. al 2010; Cohen 1988). The study will be overpowered to an estimated 30 subjects per group to allow for dropouts during the 6 months data collection period. Analysis will be done by intention-to-treat.

DATA ANALYSIS - Comparison between Control Group and Trial Group
In order to test the hypothesis the control group will be compared with the trial group. Pair wise statistical analysis will be carried out using an unpaired t-test or Mann Whitney. U-test depending on the distribution of the data. 
At the end of the study, data will be processed and statistically analysis will be carried out using SPSS (IBM, statistical program). Final comparisons will be made between the two groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised control trial will aim to explore the effectiveness of pre-formed, semi-rigid, customised foot orthoses (FOs) in reducing pain; improving quality of life; reducing swelling and tenderness; and improving gait parameters in children suffering from active lower limb involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).
HYPOTHESES: 
1. Pre-formed FOs will reduce swelling of lower limb joints in children with JIA by visual inspection and palpation.
2. Pre-formed FOs will reduce tenderness of lower limb joints in children with JIA by palpation.
3. Pre-formed FOs will reduce lower limb pain using visual analogue scale (VAS) in children with JIA.
4. Pre-formed FOs will improve quality of life in children with JIA using a questionnaire for both children and parents.
5. Pre-formed FOs will have an effect on gait characteristics in children with JIA when barefoot, with shoes alone, and with shoes and FOs.

Participant's who are eligible and consent to partake in the research based on the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised into two groups. Thirty participants will be allocated to the trial intervention group, and the remaining thirty will be allocated to the control group. The trial group will receive a pre-formed, semi-rigid, customised foot orthoses, while the control group will receive a placebo device made from basic materials. The control orthoses will be made to resemble standard innersoles in athletic-style footwear. To help prevent participant's on knowing their allocated interventions, the top covers of both the trial and control groups will be made from the same materials.

The participant's will be required to wear their allocated interventions for a maximum of 12 months. Primary outcomes will be completed at baseline, 3,6 and 12 months, while secondary outcomes at baseline,3 and 6 months.
Please note that one previous study was done with a similar methodological approach.(which was given a Clinical Trial ID with Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02001844) [1]. This particular randomised control trial is unique to this previous study as it will investigate the effectiveness of foot orthoses in the treatment of swollen and tender lower limb joints. It will also be the first study to investigate any type of foot orthoses beyond 6 months in children with JIA.
