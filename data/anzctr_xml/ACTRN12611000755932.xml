  <interventions>
    <interventions>The prognosis group will have a number of measures made, to predict their potential for recovering hand and arm function after stroke. These measures include simple bedside tests of movement, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measures.  The simple beside measures of hand and arm strength will be made within 1 week of stroke. The neurophysiological measures involve using transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the pathways from the movement area of the brain to the weak arm muscles. These measures will be made within 2 weeks of stroke. The neuroimaging measures involve a short magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which will take place within 2 weeks of stroke. This information will be provided to therapy teams and to the patients, to guide rehabilitation planning and goal-setting. Standard rehabilitation therapies will be provided, though the intensity and duration of these therapies may be modified by prognosis information.</interventions>
    <comparator>A benchmark group will be used for comparison. The prognosis measures will also be made in this group, but this information will not be used to plan rehabilitation. This group will be made up of patients recruited in the first 18 months of the study. In the second 18 months of the study, recruited patients will form the prognosis group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability. In this project a team of clinicians and scientists will evaluate the benefits of a new process for prescribing rehabilitation after stroke, called Targeted Rehabilitation, Improved Outcomes (TRIO). The project will implement an algorithm for determining individual patients potential for recovering hand and arm movement, and setting appropriate rehabilitation goals. This algorithm uses a combination of simple bedside tests, neurophysiology and neuroimaging, to measure the amount of damage to key pathways in the brain. The research team will evaluate the benefits for patient outcomes of using this algorithm as part of rehabilitation prescription.</summary>

    <publicnotes>This study found that using the PREP algorithm to predict how well the hand and arm would recover after stroke modified the therapy delivered and helped patients to leave hospital one week sooner, on average.
