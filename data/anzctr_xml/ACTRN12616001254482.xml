  <interventions>
    <interventions>CarFreeMe TI support and education group, adapted to include modules relevant to complex trauma injuries, will be delivered and evaluated in community settings in South Australia. The intervention will include up to 8 participants per group and involve 6 sessions that will be facilitated by an Occupational Therapist, Sessions will be conducted once a week and each session will be 2.5 hours in duration. Session will include content on adjusting to losses and changes; experiences of stopping driving; alternative transport; lifestyle planning; and advocacy and support.. Session content will be adapted to be relevant to the goals identified by group members and additional individual sessions will be considered if required for specific goals. Group sessions will be interactive and encourage information sharing, using peer leaders and guest speakers where appropriate. Practical outings will provide an opportunity to trial alternate transport methods, for example public transport, and this will be included within the designated weekly sessions. A record of attendance will be completed at each session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will receive standard information related to transport options available. This will be in the form of a one page written information sheet sent out to them.
The control group will receive the intervention also, once the group sessions are completed for the first intervention group. Once randomised, the control group will have an 8 week waiting period before receiving the intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participation in the community through use of a GPS to record location and number of outings from home. GPS units will be worn for 7 day periods at three time points during the study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>GPS data collection will occur at three time points during the intervention cycle. These time points will be at Week 1-2 (prior randomisation), Week 9 (following completion of intervention by intervention group) and Week 16 (following completion of intervention by wait-list control group).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life, assessed using AQOL



</outcome>
      <timepoint>AQoL questionnaire will be completed at three time points during the intervention cycle. These time points will be at Week 1-2 (prior randomisation), Week 9 (following completion of first intervention group) and Week 16 (following completion of second intervention group).</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Confidence with ability to adjust to driving cessation, assessed using Community Mobility Self-Efficacy Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Community Mobility Self-Efficacy Scale will be completed at three time points during the study. These time points will be at Week 1-2 (prior randomisation), Week 9 (following completion of first intervention group) and Week 16 (following completion of second intervention group).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health related quality of life, assessed using EQ-5D-5L</outcome>
      <timepoint>EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be completed at three time points during the intervention cycle. These time points will be at Week 1-2 (prior randomisation), Week 9 (following completion of first intervention group) and Week 16 (following completion of second intervention group).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Modes of transport used and subjective satisfaction, assessed using CarFreeMe TI Transport Questionnaire. This is a composite secondary outcome.</outcome>
      <timepoint>CarFreeMe TI Transport questionnaire will be completed at three time points during the intervention cycle.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size is based on a study using GPS as an outcome for community mobility in amputees where the mean number of community participation visits over the course of a continuous week for amputees classified as having limited mobility was 7.2, and for those with basic to normal activity was 13.7.  Using the group SD of 10.9, and assuming a power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05, a sample size of 45 would be required to detect a similar difference.  Assuming a 20% drop-out, we will therefore recruit 54 participants. 
Data Analysis: The obtained data will be subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS software to determine the:
1. baseline differences between the groups using independent t tests.
2. Primary outcome measure is difference in community participation between groups at week 9 via a GLM ANOVA with allocation and time as factors. 
3. significance between groups uses independent sample t tests for all questionnaires.
Cost-utility analysis: An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to establish the difference in costs between the study arms. Utility values will be generated for individual responses to the AQOL and EQ-5D-5L, instruments for the measurement and evaluation of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), by applying the Australian general population scoring algorithm. The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) score for each participant over there 16 weeks of their follow-up will be estimated using the area under the curve method.  An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted to establish the difference in costs between the study arms. The unit of outcome will be the incremental cost per QALY gained (incremental costs divided by QALYs).
