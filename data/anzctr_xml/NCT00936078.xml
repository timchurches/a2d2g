  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Living kidney donors and non-donor controls will be studied before and after the living donor
      transplant. The donor and non-donor will be followed for up to 5 years. The purpose of this
      study is to see if there are any differences between the two groups in regards to blood
      pressure, rate of hypertension, kidney function and psychological well being and economical
      status.</summary>
