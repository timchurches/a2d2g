  <interventions>
    <interventions>Mindfulness smartphone application, developed by Headspace and commercially available. The application takes the user through daily guided mindfulness meditations lasting approximately 10 minutes each, for 60 days. Participants will be asked to complete one guided-meditation exercise per day during the day time, and will be explicitly instructed to not use the application as a method to fall asleep. For the first 30 days of the intervention, participants will learn basic mindfulness skills. For the next 30 days, participants will undertake an extension of mindfulness skills designed specifically for the area of improving sleep. Data on app usage (e.g. amount of time per day, number of days per week) will be remotely recorded by Headspace.</interventions>
    <comparator>Progressive muscle relaxation smartphone application. This application was developed specifically for research purposes as an active control program. The application takes the user through daily guided muscle relaxation lasting approximately 10 minutes each (e.g. "tense up your calf muscles, hold, and relax them as you breathe out"). Participants will be asked to complete one exercise per day during the day time, and will be explicitly instructed to not use the application as a method to fall asleep. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>A mixed-design ANOVA will be conducted to determine the effects of mindfulness versus control before and after the intervention on self-reported and actigraphy-measured sleep, pre-sleep arousal, mood, cognitive functioning, trait mindfulness, mindfulness skills, and metacognitive beliefs. We plan to recruit 80 participants for the study, who will be followed up 60 days after commencing the intervention. Sample size is calculated assuming a Cohens d of 0.92 on total wake time (TWT) as measured by sleep diary over 8 weeks for MBT-I (Ong et al., 2014). G*Power analysis indicates that we need a total of 32 patients in each group to detect an effect size of 0.92, assuming beta = 0.80 and a = 0.05. We estimate 20% attrition; therefore we will recruit 40 participants in each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insomnia is considered a public health concern associated with economic burden, reduced quality of life, and poor mental and physical health. Insomnia is characterised by complaints of dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity associated with difficulties initiating sleep, difficulties maintaining sleep, or early-morning awakenings with an inability to return to sleep. In addition to sleep disturbances, insomnia may be associated with a number of daytime complaints such as cognitive difficulties and mood disturbances, and is often characterised by heightened physiological and mental activation known as hyperarousal. 

Insomnia can be treated with pharmacotherapy; however, patients often report adverse side effects and a preference for non-pharmacological interventions. Increasing attention has therefore been paid to behavioural and psychological interventions, as well as complementary and alternate medicines such as mindfulness.  

Mindfulness incorporates awareness, of present experience, with acceptance.  Current theoretical models suggests that mindfulness improves insomnia by changing the relationship that individuals have with negative sleep-related thoughts such as "I need 8 hours of sleep to function the next day", and  by non-judgmentally observing and accepting spontaneously occurring physical and psychological processes that often inhibit sleep. 

Uncontrolled and controlled studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of group mindfulness-based interventions in improving self-reported sleep (e.g. Ong, Shapiro, &amp; Manber, 2008; Ong, Manber,  Segal, Xia, Shapiro, &amp; Wyatt, 2014). Emerging research has also demonstrated improvements in pre-sleep arousal, insomnia severity, mood, stress, and objectively measured sleep, though the effects of mindfulness on these variables remain less clear.  

Research to date has not investigated the effectiveness of self-help mindfulness-based interventions for insomnia. Self-help interventions, such as the use of a mindfulness-based smartphone applications, may therefore provide a promising avenue in which to increase the access to, and use of, psychological interventions. Mindfulness-based smartphone applications have become increasingly accessible to the general public, though very few applications have been empirically evaluated and no research to date has been conducted within insomnia . If mindfulness-based mobile applications are found to be effective, the number of individuals obtaining psychological support could increase considerably.

The proposed study therefore aims to examine the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based mobile application 'Headspace' for improving self-report and objective measures of sleep, pre-sleep arousal, cognitive performance, mood, and mindfulness skills in those with symptoms of insomnia.</summary>
