  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of balance and step training delivered through a novel home-based step-training system (smart +/- step). The system involves a computerised training mat measuring approximately one square metre with eight step panels and connected to a visual display (television or computer screen) that displays training instructions and game-based stepping exercises. The exercises will be tailored to the participant's abilities for the duration of the trial. 

STUDY PROTOCOL
* During an initial home visit, a trained researcher (exercise physiologist or physiotherapist) will set up and demonstrate the 'smart +/- step' step-training system, ensuring the participant can use the equipment safely on their own. This visit is expected to take approximately 60-90 minutes.
* A follow up home visit will be scheduled approximately four weeks following the initial home visit to ensure participant safety during exercise, progression of the training and to discuss any issues relating to use of the program. This visit is expected to take approximately 30 minutes.
* Dose of exercise training will be at least 120 minutes per week during the 6-month intervention period. Participants are able to determine the frequency and duration of each exercise session according to their preference.
* Participant adherence (training volume, frequency) will be monitored through automatic data transfer to a server, and will be examined weekly. Participants not engaging in the minimum weekly training dose for 2 consecutive weeks will be contacted by telephone to discuss any issues and to encourage adherence during the 6-month intervention period.
* Phone support will be available and additional home visits will be offered as needed/requested for the entire duration of the study.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses will be conducted with an intention-to-treat approach. The number of falls per person-year will be analysed using negative binomial regression to estimate the difference in falls rates between the two groups. General linear models will be used to assess the effect of group allocation on the continuously scored secondary outcome measures. 

Based on the fall rate from our current study we estimate a fall rate in the control arm of this study will be 50%. We further estimate that the intervention will
reduce the number of fallers in relative terms by 30% in this period (or 15% in absolute terms). Consequently, accounting for dropouts (10%), a power of 80% and a 5% significance level, a total sample size of 500 is required</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Falls are common among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). About 60% of people with MS (PwMS) experience at least one fall each 6 months and about 30% have multiple falls.
Increased fall risk and fear of falls have been shown to significantly affect quality of life
and curtail activities among people with MS. Therefore, effective interventions to reduce
fall risk in PwMS are urgently needed.

Fall prevention and treatment strategies in MS are still at an early stage. Studies on falls in
MS reveal important balance, coordination and cognitive determinants of falls. Based on
these results, we propose a randomised single-blind controlled trial (RCT) to
evaluate a step training intervention designed to prevent falls in PwMS. The proposed
trial will enrol approximately 500 PwMS over a period of 36 months. Recruitment will initially take place in NSW and will be extended to other Australian states if required.

It is expected that if the research confirms effectiveness of treatment strategies,
implementation of clinical interventions will contribute to reduced fall rates in PwMS and
associated injury-associated costs, reduced fear of falls and improved quality of life for
PwMS.</summary>
