  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Unity Total Knee System is a fixed bearing total knee replacement system that consists of a femoral component, tibial insert, tibial tray and all-polyethylene patellar component for use in primary total knee arthroplasty.

The Unity Total Knee System is provided in two variants, Cruciate Retaining (CR) and Posterior Stabilised (PS) and is intended for cemented, single use only. The system also provides augment components including femoral augments, tibial augments stem extensions, and offset connections.

The Unity Total Knee System is intended for use in skeletally mature patients, to provide increased mobility and reduce pain by replacing the damaged knee joint articulation where there is evidence of sufficient sound bone to seat and support the components.

The approximate duration of the surgical procedure of both the CR and PS surgical techniques is 60 to 90 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Corin Unity study is designed as a prospective, randomised study. Performance of the Unity Total Knee System will be compared to other prostheses outlined in the Australian Joint Registry and prostheses currently investigated at the International Musculoskeletal Research Institute (IMRI) site. 

The surgical technique for implantation of this prosthetic system will be either through the Cruciate Retaining technique (CR) or the Posterior Stabilizing technique (PS). Patients will be evenly randomised into one of two groups which will determine the surgical technique they receive. Neither of the two surgical techniques is considered to be a study control.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The anticipated enrolment of clinical study participants is 150 participants from the General Repatriation Hospital. 
As per standard practice at the International Musculoskeletal Research Institute (IMRI), study investigators will authorise Clinical Research Assistants to identify patients who meet the inclusion criteria. The recruitment process will involve a review of the Orthopaedic Waiting List at the Repatriation General Hospital, with recruitment commencing following Ethics approval and SA SSA governance approval. Patient status on the waiting list is in no way effected by participation in this study. 

Patients considered suitable for potential study enrolment will be contacted by the IMRI research team to ascertain their level of interest in participating in the study. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>
    <sequence>Prior to recruitment, the study numbers from 1 to 150 will be randomised to either the CR or PS group using Excel randomisation software. Further randomisation using Excel randomisation software will randomly select a cohort of 100 study participants (50 Cruciate Retaining and 50 Posterior Stabilising) to have RSA. After informed consent is given by the patient for inclusion into the study, the patients will be allocated a study number according to their chronological time of inclusion. This randomised number will determine which surgical technique the patient will receive, if the patient will have RSA and provide anonymous identification of the patient on study documents (or databases) from there forth. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Selvarajah et al. (2009) evaluated the effect of joint line position in a posterior cruciate ligament-retaining, mobile bearing TKR for a single surgeon series of 76 consecutive patients at a minimum of 2.5 years post-operative. Pre-operative and post-operative weight-bearing x-rays were compared. The joint line was defined as the line through the distal aspect of the femoral condyles (femoral condyles overlying each other), where the position of the joint line is the distance from the proximal tip of the fibular to the joint line. The change in joint line position (JLP) was the difference between the pre-operative and post-operative joint line position. The average range of motion was 108.2 degrees, and no knee had a significant fixed flexion deformity. All polyethylene bearings used were 10 mm thick. The joint line position averaged 15.5 mm pre-operatively (SD = 5.6 mm) and 16.6 mm (SD = 4.6 mm) post-operatively. This was a change in joint line position of an average of +1.1 mm (SD = 4.1 mm) (P = .017). The range of variance between the pre-operative and post-operative joint line position was -11 mm to +10 mm. Figgie et al. (1986) stated that a change in joint line of eight millimetres or less represented a range of neutral alignment while Cross et al. (2013) found that 4mm change in joint line leads to mid-flexion laxity in a well-balanced knee following TKA and more recently, 2mm change in joint line has been proposed.  For purposes of this study, a change in joint line of 2mm is used in the primary endpoint.

Assessment of the joint line will be completed with the knee in flexion and extension. 

Primary endpoint:
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the change in medial joint-line position (JLP) of patients implanted with the Unity Total Knee System in both flexion and extension from preoperative to six months postoperative, as measured via CT imaging assessments. A comparison of the change in JLP of patients having received the Posterior Stabilised versus the Cruciate Retaining surgical technique will be conducted. 

Using a conservative estimate of increase in post-operative joint line which may have a significant impact on clinical outcomes, the primary efficacy hypothesis for this study is formulated based upon the estimate representing the proportion (or probability) of Unity devices expected to achieve (|change in JLP|) &lt; 2.  

Assumption: if change in JLP  (Selvarajah, 2009) is approximately normal with mean equal to 1.1 mm and standard deviation equal to 4.1 mm, then proportion (|change in JLP|&gt;2 mm) = 0.94.

The recommended sample size for the primary analysis group is 105 subjects before accounting for lost to follow-up.  
In order to achieve this target enrolment, the number N=105 is divided by 0.85 to account for 15% potential losses-to-follow-up.  Therefore, 124 subjects will be enrolled to account for loss-to-follow up. 

To provide clinical data for both variants of the Unity TKR system, both cruciate retaining (CR) and posterior stabilized (PS), study subjects will randomized between the 2 groups.  An oversample will be enrolled such that 75 subjects will be randomly assigned to the CR group and 75 subjects will be randomly assigned to the PS group. 

Study group:
CR cohort = 75 subjects
PS cohort = 75 subjects

The analysis for the primary endpoint will evaluate a change in joint line by comparing the 6 month post-operative CT to the pre-operative CT.  An increase in joint line of less than 2 mm is expected to have no impact on clinical outcomes. Results for the primary endpoint will be compared to the literature.
	
Secondary outcome measures include pain symptoms, improvement in general knee function, quality of life improvement, adverse events and radiographic evaluation based upon the assessments described above. 

Data produced from both primary and secondary objective measures will undergo descriptive analyses where frequency, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum/maximum values and any further suitable descriptive test will be calculated. Inferential analyses to be run on both the primary and secondary objectives may include, but need not be limited to t-tests, ANOVAs, Chi-squared tests and regression models. Demographic data, along with all adverse events and radiograph results will be tabulated and summarized.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is a prospective, randomised clinical study. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the change in medial joint-line position (JLP) of patients implanted with the Unity Total Knee System, in both flexion and extension, from preoperative to six months postoperative. A comparison of the change in JLP of patients having received the Posterior Stabilised versus the Cruciate Retaining surgical technique will be conducted. Secondary objectives are to track clinical outcomes, functional results and imaging assessments of patients implanted with the Unity Total Knee System over a 5-year follow-up period. 

The study will require 150 participants, equally randomised to receive either the Posterior Stabilised (PS) or Cruciate Retaining (CR) surgical technique. Both PS and CR techniques are reasonable standards of care employed on the basis of surgeon preference. RSA analysis will be performed on a randomised cohort 100 study participants (50 CR and 50 PS). Participants will be assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at discharge, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 2, 3 and 5 years.

All Corin Unity Study procedures adhere to the standard operating procedures at the International Musculoskeletal Research Institute Inc.
