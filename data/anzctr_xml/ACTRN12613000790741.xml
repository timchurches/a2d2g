  <interventions>
    <interventions>The low FODMAP diet (a nutritive oral diet therapy, for the mother) will be provided to investigate if there is any relief of colicky symptoms such as wind/gas, drawing up of knees, back arching, excessive fussing and crying.  The low FODMAP diet refers to Fermentable, oligo-, di-, mono-saccharides and polyols (short chain carbohydrates) which are commonly malabsorbed by the gut and in some people problematic, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, wind/gas, distension, altered bowel habits of diarrhoea, constipation or both.  The low FODMAP diet reduces the intake of such carbohydrates which are shown to reduce the symptoms in up to 80% of adults and this diet is being trialled on infants who are colicky and unsettled, who display similar symptoms to adults with IBS.  The diet consists of various foods from all the main food groups and is a well balanced nutritious diet meeting the energy requirements of a breast feeding mother - all foods (meals and snacks) are provided for consumption by the mother, for a period of seven days by the researcher who is also an accredited practicing dietitian (APD).  Adherence is monitored by food diaries however 100% compliance is guaranteed if the participants only consume foods that have been provided for the intervention period of seven days. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduction in crying times. This will be assessed using a validated record chart (Barr Diary) where parent's will be recording infant's crying and fussing times (stopwatch provided and record charts provided) at baseline for a total of 3 days and also on days 5,6 and 7 while on the study diet (The low FODMAP diet). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and seven days. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Breast milk samples will undergo HPLC analyses for short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) and will also be tested at CSIRO for bacteria composition - these tests will be performed for both baseline and intervention samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and seven days.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in faecal samples. Descriptive information will be sourced from the mother regarding infant faecal frequency, consistency and colour. Photographs will also be taken by mothers prior to collection of faecal samples (collected using specific stool specimen containers). pH tests will also be performed on all faecal samples at baseline and at day six-seven of intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at seven days</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Infantile colic is estimated to affect 25% of infants and occurs equally in breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Infantile colic increases the risk of post-natal depression, shaken baby syndrome and the cessation of breastfeeding. Therapeutic approaches have included changing infant formulae or the diet of nursing mohters however scientific evidence to support advice is lacking. Infantile colic presents with similar symptoms to adults with IBS. The low FODMAP diet is the only dietary approach with a high level of evidence for efficacy in adults (75%-80%) and hence this study hypothesizes that a low FODMAP diet (short-chain CHO's) in the diet of breast-feeding mothers of infants with colic will reduce the no. &amp; duration of crying episodes.
