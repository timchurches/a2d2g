  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study whose primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of several doses of GS-7340. This study will evaluate the safety, viral kinetics, and antiviral activity of each of four doses of GS-7340 over 28 days of therapy.  In addition, the study will evaluate the antiviral activity of an optimal dose of GS-7340 versus TDF 300-mg over 28 days of therapy. 
Approximately 50 eligible subjects with chronic HBV infection who are naïve to anti-HBV treatment will be randomized 1:1:1:1:1 to receive treatment with GS-7340 8-, 25-, 40-, or 120-mg or TDF 300-mg orally once daily. 
Subjects may be HBeAg+ or HBeAg-. Enrollment will be stratified by HBeAg status with approximately a 1:1 distribution resulting in approximately 25 HBeAg+ and 25 HBeAg- subjects. 
All subjects must be followed for safety for 30 days after the 28-day treatment. 
Optional blood samples may be obtained for exploratory biomarker and pharmacogenomic discovery research at any time during the study or at a separate post study visit, if necessary. Subjects who agree to have blood drawn for pharmacogenomic research will sign a separate informed consent form.</summary>
