    <studytitle>A randomized, wait-list controlled trial of a physiotherapy and behaviour change intervention to increase physical activity through meaningful participation for children with cerebral palsy and their caregiver</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In children with cerebral palsy aged 8-12 years, what is the effect of an 8-week physiotherapy and motivational interviewing intervention delivered to the child and their primary caregiver, as compared to a wait-list control receiving usual care, on child participation in active leisure and sports, and habitual physical activity levels?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Dosage and Location:
Participating child-parent dyads allocated to the intervention group will be present for a 1-hour intervention session with a physiotherapist once weekly over an 8-week intervention period. The majority of intervention sessions will take place in the participant's home environment with the physiotherapist travelling to the participant. There is an 8-week follow-up period where no treatment will be provided at the conclusion of the intervention period.
Intervention:
The intervention is a novel integration of goal-directed, family-centred physiotherapy with a behaviour change counselling technique called motivational interviewing. The intervention is individualised to each child-parent dyad based on their reported barriers and facilitators to participation, and therefore not every possible intervention element will apply to all dyads. The common elements are: collaborative goal-setting, motivational interviewing, action-planning, and provision of information and advice. Other elements likely to be delivered include: motor-learning approach physiotherapy, home exercise programs, equipment suggestion, problem-solving, and communication with stakeholders.
Adherence:
Participants will be sent text message reminders about their scheduled appointments. Parents will be directed to individually relevant internet and media resources to view in their own time. Child-parent dyads must participate in the development of a maintenance plan, which outlines how progress in physical activity participation will be continued or maintained, at the end of the 8-week period.
Other:
Participants may continue their usual care therapies (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, psychology etc.) during the intervention and follow-up period, although episodes of care must be recorded in a usual care diary.</interventions>
    <comparator>Dosage and Location:
Participating child-parent dyads allocated to the waitlist control group will be present for 3 1-hour sessions in total - at the first and last weeks of the 8-week intervention period and at the conclusion of the 8-week follow-up period.
Control condition:
Child-parent dyads will participate in goal setting and goal performance evaluation during the sessions one-one individual sessions with the physiotherapist. No other treatment will be provided for the 8-week intervention and 8-week follow-up periods. The participants will receive the study physiotherapy and motivational interviewing intervention at the conclusion of the entire waitlist period (intervention and follow-up periods, approximately 16 weeks).
Other:
Participants may continue their usual care therapies (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, psychology etc.) during the waitlist period, although episodes of care must be recorded in a usual care diary.</comparator>

    <designfeatures>The COPM and GAS goal outcomes are administered by the treating therapist as part of the intervention, and therefore they cannot be blinded. However, an independent person will also rate the goal outcomes attained and the ratings will be compared.

Participants are allocated to an intervention group or a wait-list group. The wait-list cohort receives the study treatment when the matched intervention cohort has finished their treatment and follow-up periods. There is no comparator or follow-up outcomes for the wait-list cohort during their treatment (pre-post outcomes only).</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary outcome of the intervention will be assessed using generalised estimating equations for longitudinal analysis to evaluate differences in continuous data at post-intervention and 8-week follow-up assessments, on an intention-to-treat basis. This method takes into account the repeated measures on each participant and the potential for missing data. For the COPM performance score, the co-variables will be time (3 level  0, 8, and 16 weeks) and group (immediate treatment and wait-list), with a group*time interaction (which will test for the differences between groups at different time points). Further analyses using t-tests will compare outcomes between groups at the primary (8 week) and retention (16 weeks) endpoints for the secondary outcome measures. The GAS goal attainment scores will be analysed on a within-groups basis with Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests for the whole cohort at end-intervention (GAS scores will not be normally distributed). Statistical significance will be set at p&lt;0.05 with adjustments for multiple comparisons where relevant. Validity of results will be checked using baseline and general descriptive information available for all eligible families. This includes comparing key characteristics of families who completed the study with those who enrolled in the study but did not complete, and those who did not enrol using the best available information from current population-based statistics.

The sample size calculation is based on adequate power for comparison between ParticiPAte CP and usual care on COPM goal performance at the primary endpoint (T1, 8 weeks, immediately post intervention). A change score difference of 2 points on the COPM-performance subscale would be clinically meaningful. A previous pilot study utilising the COPM as an outcome measure for activity and participation goal attainment in six children and youth with physical disabilities yielded standard deviations between 1.4 and 1.7 for COPM-performance. Based on a conservative estimate using a mean change of two points (STATA 13.1, power 0.8, two-tailed, p&lt;0.05), we require 22 parent-child dyads (11 per group). Allowing for 20% drop out and missing data on actigraphy, a total of 36 parent-child dyads (18 per group) will be recruited.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many children with cerebral palsy participate in fewer physical activities than peers without a physical disability.  Some studies have tried to increase participation in physical activities for children with CP through programs that develop their physical skills and remediate physical impairments like low muscle strength. Participation depends on many things however, not just the presence of physical limitations; participation is related to environmental barriers like lack of accessible venues, and personal factors like self-efficacy. This project will test whether a new integration of physiotherapy and a positive counselling technique called motivational interviewing can increase the participation of children with cerebral palsy in physical activities, compared to a control group who receive usual care. We think the intervention will work because it primarily focuses on environmental and personal factors, and because it may help parents to be supportive of their child's autonomy (making choices).</summary>
