Intranasal lignocaine / phenylephrine spray is available proprietary product which contains the active ingredients of lignocaine hydrochloride 50 mg/mL and phenylephrine hydrochloride 5 mg/mL. It is administered by a pump actuated topical spray. 

The nozzle spray attachment provides 100 micolitres per spray. This results in each spray providing 5mg lignocaine and 0.5mg phenylephrine.

Placebo spray (0.9% sodium chloride)
Prepared and packaged in an identical manner to study drug (lignocaine / phenylephrine)

Dosing schedule for blinded administration of intranasal lignocaine / phenylephrine or saline placebo.(1, 2)

* 6 kg  12 kg 1 spray per nostril
* &gt;12 kg 2 sprays per nostril


Medication preparation, storage and use-monitoring 
Spray bottles will be prepared and checked in a clean area by manufacturing service pharmacists in the pharmacy department at MMC Clayton. 

Lignocaine / phenylephrine spray bottles will be made by transferring 2.5mL of CoPhenylcaine Forte into a spray bottle. This will then be labelled and kept in a sealed plastic bag until use.

Placebo spray bottles will be made by transferring 2.5mL of sodium chloride 0.9% for irrigation into a spray bottle. This will again be labelled and kept in a sealed plastic bag until use.

Spray bottle numbers, constituents, their batch number, expiry will be recorded by sterile manufacturing and clinical trials pharmacy. A prescription marked with the corresponding spray bottle number will be included in each bag - for return to pharmacy for study accountability.

The study spray bottles will be given an expiry of one month from manufacture. Twenty spray bottles will be prepared monthly by pharmacy. Each month unused spray bottles will be deemed expired and destroyed by pharmacy. Spray bottle numbers not used will be documented and later re-made (with the same allocation) until all 100 spray bottle numbers are accounted for. If recruitment of patients is in excess of 5 per week, spray bottle number production will be reviewed and may increase up to a maximum of eight per week.

Labelling
In order to avoid administration errors in the emergency department, the drug will be prominently labelled with Not for injection, for intranasal use only.

Each spray bottle and outer bag will be labelled with the spray bottle number and instructions for dose and usage as follows:

CoPhenylcaine (lignocaine 5mg/spray and phenylephrine 0.5mg/spray) OR Placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) [MMC project no: XXXXXX] 2.5mL

Administer spray from study weight / dose table, using supplied spray bottle and nozzle.
Spray bottle no:.............. Batch:.............................. Expiry:......................


Storage
CoPhenylcaine is a Schedule 2 (S2) medication. As such, the study medication will be stored in a locked drug room in the paediatric emergency department. 

Prescriptions will include the study drug and number of sprays to be administered.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome measure
- Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) Scale during the procedure.
- The FLACC score was originally designed for assessment of post-operative pain in young children, and has been recommended in various reviews as a procedural pain score for preverbal and early verbal children.(1) It comprises five separate items (face, legs, activity, cry, and consolability), each of which is scored from 0 to 2. The five scores are then added to arrive at a score out of 10
- This will be assessed by a member of staff not directly involved in the insertion of the nasogastric tube at four times during the study

    <concealment>Recruitment 
Emergency Physicians and trainees working in the ED will recruit a convenience sample of patients requiring a nasogastric tube that meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The recruitment target will be100 within 1 year. 
Consent process
Written, informed consent will be obtained from parents or guardians before enrolment. 
Parent information statements include references to possible side effects, including tremor, palpitations, or a bitter taste in the mouth.
 
Randomisation:-
It is expected to enrol 100 patients in the study, thus 100 spray bottle numbers will be randomly allocated to either lignocaine / phenylephrine or placebo.  Randomisation will be made following a block randomisation table as described by Altman and Bland (1999).

Allocation will be concealed using numbered spray bottles
Each spray bottle number will be manufactured as allocated and this number will be recorded on the patient prescription accompanying the spray bottle.

Spray bottles will be prepared and checked in a clean area by manufacturing service pharmacists in the pharmacy department at MMC Clayton. 

Lignocaine / phenylephrine spray bottles will be made by transferring 2.5mL of CoPhenylcaine Forte into a spray bottle. This will then be labelled and kept in a sealed plastic bag until use.

Placebo spray bottles will be made by transferring 2.5mL of sodium chloride 0.9% for irrigation into a spray bottle. This will again be labelled and kept in a sealed plastic bag until use.

Spray bottle numbers, constituents, their batch number, expiry will be recorded by sterile manufacturing and clinical trials pharmacy. A prescription marked with the corresponding spray bottle number will be included in each bag - for return to pharmacy for study accountability.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical Analysis
Baseline variables such as sex and age will be presented as number and percentage or median with interquartile range, and compared using either chi square or Mann Whitney tests as appropriate.
Primary and secondary outcome scores

FLACC scores and VAS scores will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Non-normally distributed scores will be compared using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and normally distributed data using a t test. Categorical data will be analyzed using a Fishers exact test.

Sample size
Assuming a standard deviation of 2.5, an alpha of 0.05, and a power of 90%, 35 patients per treatment arm are required to demonstrate a difference in FLACC score of 2 points. This difference has previously been considered the minimally clinically significant difference using this scoring system.(1) Allowing for attrition and other factors, a total of 100 patients is required (50 in each group).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nasogastric tube insertion is consistently rated as one of the most painful and distressing procedures undertaken
in the emergency department. Multiple adult studies have demonstrated that use of local anaesthetic prior to
insertion markedly reduces this pain and distress, however, the only study undertaken in children did not show any
benefit.
We plan to undertake a randomised trial in children aged 6 months to 5 years of age. The trial will compare the
effects of a spray of salty water (saline) to a spray of local anaesthetic (lignocaine and phenylephrine) into the nose
prior to insertion of the nasogastric tube.
An observer will measure pain and distress experienced by the child before, during and after the procedure. The
child's carer will also be asked to rate the child's pain and distress.
Insertion of a nasogastric tube usually takes approximately 5-10 minutes. The anticipated duration of the study is 20-30
minutes, including time for explanation and consent.
Approximately 100 children will need to be recruited to complete the study
We hypothesise that lignocaine / phenylephrine spray and intranasal placebo spray will be equally effective in the prevention of pain and distress associated with nasogastric tube insertion in children
