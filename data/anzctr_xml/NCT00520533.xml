  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Chimeric monoclonal antibody cG250
Treatment: drugs - Sunitinib malate

Experimental: On Study - Treatment (cycle 1):
cG250 10mg/m² IV weekly x5 doses (1st &amp; 5th doses trace-labelled with ¹²4I)
Sunitinib 50 mg/day orally x 4 weeks commencing day 8
Followed by two week break
Treatment (cycle 2 - investigator discretion):
cG250 10mg/m² IV weekly x4 doses
Sunitinib 50 mg/day orally x 4 weeks (commencing concurrently)
Followed by two week break


Other interventions: Chimeric monoclonal antibody cG250
First Cycle: cG250 10 mg/m² intravenous infusion, weekly for five weeks, followed by a two-week break. 1st &amp; 5th dose will be trace-labeled with a radioactive substance detectable on a PET scanner (¹²4I-cG250)
Second cycle (investigator discretion): cG250 10 mg/m² intravenous infusion, weekly for four weeks followed by a two-week break. No ¹²4I-cG250 will be used in the 2nd cycle.
Up to 2 cycles available.

Treatment: drugs: Sunitinib malate
First Cycle: Sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for 4 weeks (starts 8th day of 1st treatment cycle), followed by a two-week period off sunitinib.
Second cycle (investigator discretion): Sunitinib 50 mg orally daily for 4 weeks (starts on 1st day of 2nd treatment cycle), followed by a two-week period off sunitinib.
Up to 2 cycles available on-study.
