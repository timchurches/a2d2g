  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the effects of ritonavir plus darunavir daily to raltegravir twice daily on post prandial lipid responses over 24 weeks - Fasting samples will be taken for total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Repeat lipid samples will be collected before a high fat meal is consumed. After the meal is completed , blood will be collected at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours at baseline, week 4 and week 24 visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>safety - Safety parameters will be assessed by measurement of urea and electrolytes, LFTs, urine protein to creatinine ratio</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Other metabolic parameters - Fasting metabolic parameters will be assessed. Study staff and participants will be blinded to the results fo these tests until completion of the study or parameters become sginificantly abnormal</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a research study into the effects of three drugs used to treat HIV infection. Some
      drugs used to treat HIV have been associated with changes in blood fats such as cholesterol
      that could be harmful over the long-term, because these blood fat changes have been
      associated with a small, increased risk of heart disease and stroke in some studies of adults
      with HIV. Now that HIV can be controlled for long periods in most patients, and because heart
      disease is one of the biggest causes of illness and death in the general population, it is
      important to develop new HIV treatments that control HIV effectively but do not cause
      abnormal blood fats.

      Hypothesis: That Raltegravir will result in less post-prandial lipid disturbances than
      ritonavir-boosted darunavir.</summary>
