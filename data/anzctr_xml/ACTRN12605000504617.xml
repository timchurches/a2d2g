    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The random allocation sequence was implemented by allocating a beta blocker according to the numeral generated by a random number generator. If a patient was initially on carvedilol  then an even number would prompt a change to metoprolol and an odd number a change to bisoprolol. If a patient was initially on metoprolol, an even number would prompt a change to bisoprolol and an odd number a change to carvedilol. If a pateint was initially on bisoprolol, an even number would prompt a change to carvedilol and an odd number a change to metoprolol.  The next change of beta blocker would simply be to the last of the 3 beta blockers in the study. This sequence was concealed until the interventions were assigned.</concealment>
    <sequence>A random number was generated by using an internet based random number generator at http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm .The stratification is outlined in the previous answer to allocation concealment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare 3 beta blocker tablets routinely used in treating patients with heart failure.  There are theoretical reasons for differences between the tablets (particularly with respect to lung function and blood pressure changes), although this has not been tested in head-to-head comparison.</summary>
