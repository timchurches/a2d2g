    <summary>Background
Proponents of minimally invasive knee replacements argue that retracting rather than everting the
patella results in quicker postoperative recovery and improved function compared to the standard
approach. We aimed to investigate this in a group of patients undergoing knee arthroplasty using a
standard medial parapatellar approach.
Methods
In a prospective randomized double-blinded study sixty-six patients undergoing total knee
arthroplasty through a standard medial parapatellar approach were assigned to either retraction or
eversion of the patella. An independent observer assessed the Oxford knee score, the SF12 score, visual
analog pain scores and range of motion data preoperatively, at three months and at one-year post
surgery.
Results
Early (3 month) follow-up showed no difference in Oxford knee scores, SF12, visual analog pain scores
or flexion. A statistically significant improvement in extension was found in the retraction group but
this was not thought to be clinically significant. There was no difference in any outcomes at one year.
There were two partial divisions of the patella tendon in the retraction group, but no patella related
complications in the eversion group
Conclusions
Retracting rather than everting the patella during total knee arthroplasty results in no significant
clinical benefit. There is an increased risk of damage to the patellar tendon, and reduced visualization
of the lateral compartment.</summary>
