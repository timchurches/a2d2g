  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the independent and combined effects of Pioglitazone and Fish Oils (Omacor) on Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) transport in metabolic syndrome subjects.  VLDL transport will be used as an assessment tool of triglyceride transport.  VLDL transport will be determined and compared between groups.  All analysis will be carreid out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences(SPSS). Differences between the four groups prior to randomization will be determined by one-way Analysis of Variance(ANOVA), after logarithmic transformation of skewed variables. Main and interactive treatment effects will be examined using general linear modelling adjusted for baseline covariates. Associations between kinetic estimates of lipid and lipoprotein, liver fat and other metabolic variables will be examined using simple and multiple linear regression methods. Compartmental analysis will be used to develop and fit models to lipid and lipoprotein tracer data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>VLDL transport time points are baseline, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60mins, 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 hours following administration of D3-Leucine and D5-Glycerol stable isotopes on 2 occasions i.e. at the beginning and end of the treatment period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the independent and combined effects of Pioglitazone and Fish Oils (Omacor) on VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production in metabolic syndrome subjects.  VLDL-apoB production will be used as an assessment tool of apoB transport.  VLDL-apoB production will be determined and compared between groups.  All analysis will be carreid out using SPSS. Differences between the four groups prior to randomization will be determined by one-way ANOVA, after logarithmic transformation of skewed variables. Main and interactive treatment effects will be examined using general linear modelling adjusted for baseline covariates. Associations between kinetic estimates of lipid and lipoprotein, liver fat and other metabolic variables will be examined using simple and multiple linear regression methods. Compartmental analysis will be used to develop and fit models to lipid and lipoprotein tracer data.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine the independent and combined effects of Pioglitazone and Fish Oils (Omacor) on liver fat in metabolic syndrome subjects.  Liver fat content will be used as an assessment tool of fat storage in the liver.  Liver fat will be determined and compared between groups.  All analysis will be carreid out using SPSS. Differences between the four groups prior to randomization will be determined by one-way ANOVA, after logarithmic transformation of skewed variables. Main and interactive treatment effects will be examined using general linear modelling adjusted for baseline covariates. Associations between kinetic estimates of lipid and lipoprotein, liver fat and other metabolic variables will be examined using simple and multiple linear regression methods. Compartmental analysis will be used to develop and fit models to lipid and lipoprotein tracer data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Liver fat will be measured by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy on two occasions i.e. at the beginning and end of the treatment period.</timepoint>

    <inclusivecriteria>Non-smoking men aged 18-75 years and post menopausal women aged =75 years will be recruited.  In this study we will define the metabolic syndrome on a composite of published criteria: waist circumference &gt;94cm for men and &gt;80cm for women, triglycerides &gt;1.7mmol/L and/or High Density Lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol &lt;1.0mmol/L, and Homeostais assessment (HOMA) score &gt;2.5 (&gt;75th percentile of a reference range). To define hepatic steatosis, we will select only metatbolic syndrome subjects with Alanine transaminase (ALT) levels &gt;20U/L.</inclusivecriteria>

These exclusions have been defined to limit factors that may influence lipoprotein metabolism and introduce error in testing the hypothesis.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to examine the independent and combined effects of Pioglitazone and Omacor (fish oil) on VLDL transport in metabolic syndrome subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD, which afflicts 20-30% of our population, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is related to a higher prevalence of insulin resistance, obesity and dyslipidaemia, key characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. Eligible participants will be randomised to one of 4 groups: Pioglitazone alone, Omacor alone, combined Pioglitazone and Omacor, or usual care, that is, no additional treatment or placebo.</summary>
