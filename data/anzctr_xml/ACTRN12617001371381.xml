  <interventions>
    <interventions>The oral treatment will be an orthodontic treatment. This treatment will be according to the needs and characteristics of the patient (could be brackets or a removable treatment). A dentist will deliver the intervention with minimum 5 years´ experience. 

The foot treatment will be an insole.Type of Insole: Custom-made insoles will go to make with EVA material with the shore of 18 and 180 kg/cm3 and resins of PVC and manufactured by Formthotics, with an extension of 3/4. It will be in contact with heel and plantar arch. A podiatrist will be a supervisor of the intervention with minimum 5 years´ experience. 

Assessment will be taken the first day(baseline), and the reviews will be at 6 months and 12 months. 

We will have 3 arms of Treatment. 

Arm 1: the treatment  will be an oral treatment (orthodontic treatment) and a custom-made foot orthosis 
Arm 2: the treatment  will be only an oral treatment (orthodontic Treatment
Arm 3: the treatment will be only a custom-made orthosis 

The variable to measure in each review will be the variables of foot posture index in the foot and the Angle´s dental classification at baseline, at six months and at twelve months. And we will compare with the last reviews

The Treatment of Foot orthosis will be used at least 8 hours per day and 5 days per week and only they could rest one week in all time of the study and the oral treatment will be using a length of the study.These treatments (orthodontic treatment and foot insole) will be worn for the 12 months of the study.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be active. The treatment will be only an oral treatment (orthodontic Treatment) that it is the standard care in this case.

The foot posture will be assessed by the foot posture index (FPI), measured by a podiatrist with experience in the use of this tool, and blinded to the oral results.</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria will be healthy children, to be between 6 to 9 years, have a dental malocclusion II or III in the Angle classification, and have a pronated or supinated foot by the criteria of Foot Posture Index. The parents will accept that the kid will be in the study and sign the informed consent. If the kid has the inclusion criteria will be randomized to one of them arms

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determinate the association, if any, between foot posture and dental malocclusions in the sagital axial, in children.
we will have 3 groups of children:
Intervention A: with orthodontic treatment and plantar support..
Intervention B: Only with orthodontic treatment.
Intervention C: Only with support plantar.
All the groups will be measure at the baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after intervention commencement.</summary>
