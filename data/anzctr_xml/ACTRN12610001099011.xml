  <interventions>
    <interventions>Normal standing postural sway is recorded on the laptop software linked to the Nintendo Wiiboard via bluetooth. Gait speed is calculated from 4m walk test time. Melbourne edge test for visual contrast sensitivity. Falls efficacy scale questionnaires for fear of fall quantification. All the tests will be conducted in 1 session post doctor consultation or during public screening. The session duration is 20 minutes</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Singapore population is "greying" with a rising prevalence of falls amongst older adults aged 60 years and above. The most common consequence of falls is fractures associated with significant disability and hospitalisation. Conceivably, from the societal perspective, hospitalisation of older adults incurs significant healthcare cost. When assessing the risk of falls, centre of pressure (COP) measures  assessed using laboratory-grade forceplates  have been shown to be sensitive in detecting fall risks; however, these forceplates are costly and non-portable. In this context, one of the investigators has recently harnessed a novel device (Nintendo Wii Fit board) to measure COP using customised software. The concept of using the Wii balance board to quantify balance is novel and it has not been investigated in the community. This device will be useful in early detection of decline in the older population that subsequently results in frailty. Early management can then be recommended to prevent the rapid decline with increasing age.</summary>
