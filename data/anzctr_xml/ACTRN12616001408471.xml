    <interventions>GLOBAL PELVIC MANIPULATION

Manipulation focused on sacroiliac joint (SIJ) and L5-S1. Used to improve the local movement in those joints. It will be applied bilaterally, with a high speed and low amplitude impulse.

The manipulation will be applied by a Phisiotherapist, with a manual intervention on massage table. 

The phisioterapist will manipulate each SIJ once time before training. That intervention will not be repeated.
</interventions>
    <comparator>PLACEBO. Using a not terapeutic intervention to the subject.

Same position of the manipulation without high speed and low ampitud impulse. The football player will be only on the massage table, lying on his side, without physiotherapist intervention.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research paper aims to evaluate the effects of global pelvic manipulation (GPM) on football players with asymmetric rotation in the coxofemoral joint.
We are seeking to evaluate limitation of the hip joint as a suitable indicator for injury prognosis. We will determine if coxofemoral limitation engages the sacroiliac joint (SIJ), and how this involvement will affect unspecified pain in the pubis, pyramidal syndrome and/or reduction of the hamstring musculature.
During the preliminary phase we will study the range of coxofemoral joint rotation in each member of the clubs first team, reserve team and the three junior teams (a total of 115 players between ages 15 and 36).
Following the preliminary study, we will identify those subjects with a difference between the internal and external range of hip rotation. These subjects will make up the study group.
To carry out the study we will first take an initial series of pre-intervention measurements to determine pyramidal trigger point 1 (TP1) and pain in the pubic ramus using algometer, pyramidal elasticity and hamstring musculature using an inclinometer.
We will divide the sample into two groups: the intervention group (IG) on which we will apply GPM, and a control group (CG) on which we will apply a placebo manipulation.
We will carry out a new evaluation of the parameters post-intervention, and will reevaluate the effect of training on all the values.
Additionally, we will develop a statistical evaluation of the results, comparing recorded values pre-intervention and post-intervention, post-training. We will identify any differences between the intervention group and the control group in order to define the effectiveness of the manipulation on the parameters of study.</summary>
