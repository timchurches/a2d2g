  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The eligibility criteria for index cases will be:

          -  Internet access

          -  Informed consent

          -  Resident in Australia

          -  Prepared to answer some simple baseline questions about health

          -  Prepared to return to the site on up to two occasions over the following 8-16 weeks to
             answer some brief follow-up questions, and

          -  Not referred to the site by a friend of a relative already enrolled in the study
             (since they would then be a 'friend or relative' - see below).

        A friend or relative of the index cases will be required to fulfil the same eligibility
        criteria except that they:

          -  Will be provided with a modified information sheet and consent form congruent with
             their level of participation in the study

          -  Will have been referred to the service by an index case, and

          -  Will only be required to visit the site on one more occasion (after 8 weeks) to answer
             some brief follow-up questions.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to find out if a special website might help people discover if
      they have high cholesterol and then enable them to manage their cholesterol more
      appropriately. The primary aim of this trial is to determine the effects on consumers' use of
      cholesterol lowering therapy of an online service that provides automated, individually
      tailored, advice about eligibility for cholesterol lowering treatment. The primary null
      hypothesis being tested is that the service will result in no change in the use of
      cholesterol lowering treatments by consumers that use the service.

      The secondary aim of the trial is to see if it is possible to improve the cholesterol
      management of the friends or relatives of consumers that use the I-CAT service. The
      corresponding secondary null hypothesis being tested is that the I-CAT service will result in
      no change in the use of cholesterol lowering treatments by the friends or relatives of the
      consumers that use the service.</summary>
