  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are three study arms.
Arm 1 (face-to-face counselling): Participants will receive 5 face-to-face visits with an exercise physiologist (EP) over a 3 month period from randomisation. The EP will conduct a fitness assessment at the first visit (1-hour)and a written exercise plan will be negotiated in consultation with the patient. At follow-up sessions (30 minutes), the EP will work with the patient in setting and reviewing goals, motivaton, and discussing barriers and ways to overcome these.
Arm 2 (face-to-face and telephone counselling): Participants will attend the same initial 1-hour face-to-face appointment with an EP as Arm 1. Follow-up will be via 4 telephone calls by the same EP. The visit and calls will occur within a 3 month period from randomisation.
Arm 3: Printed materials giving physical activity advice on one occasion at randomisation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The usual care comparison group involves the provision of generic print material designed to promote physical activity.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>* Primary care patients
* Aged 18 years or older
* Insufficiently active, defined by 7 days of step counts with average step count of less than 7000 steps per day
* Fluent in English
* Able to give informed consent
* Telephone access
* Planning to live in greater Newcastle/Hunter region or Inner West Sydney areas for the next 12 months </inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>* Too frail/disabled to benefit from either of the interventions (as measured by Timed Up and Go 3 metre test). Participants need to be able to complete the test within 19.9 seconds to be eligible. This is used as part of the initial screening, prior to randomisation.
* Deemed unsafe to exercise following exercise physiologist assessment (post-randomisation).</exclusivecriteria>

  <trial_design>
    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited at General Practitioner (GP) clinics. Interested patients will book an appointment time with a Research Assistant (RA) at the clinic. During this appointment, patients are provided with an information statement and consent form, and can discuss the trial with the RA. If the patient consents to take part, they will complete a Timed Up and Go assessment to confirm they are not too frail to participate. 
Eligible and consenting patients will be given a baseline survey, and movement recorder to wear for 7 consecutive days, movement recorder log sheet, paper tape measure to measure waist circumference, as well as a reply paid envelope to return materials to the research team.
Once these materials have been returned via mail, the Research Manager will determine if the patient is insufficiently active (and therefore eligible to continue with the study) based on their average daily step count. The Research Manager will be responsible for informing patients of their study group allocation (by letter). 
Allocation will be by a 2 stage randomisation procedure conducted by an independent statistician. Firstly by simple randomisation to control or intervention group, in a ratio of 1:2. Secondly for those allocated to intervention group, participants will be stratified by gender, and by their choice of EP location then randomised equally to arm 1 and arm 2.
Allocation will be unknown to the GP and to the RA at the time of recruitment. </concealment>
    <sequence>The sequence for the first stage of randomisation (i.e. active treatment or control) will be generated using a randomised block design stratified by gender.  Allocation in the ratio of 2 to active treatment for each 1 to control will occur at a centralised location by an independent statistician.

The sequence for the second stage of randomisation (i.e. face to face or telephone counselling) will be generated using randomised block design stratified by participant gender and the location of the intervention service.  Allocation in the ratio of 1 to 1 to each active treatment arm will occur at a centralised location by an independent statistician using appropriate software.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A randomised controlled trial will be conducted to determine the efficacy of two physical activity (PA) counselling strategies on PA behaviour over a 12 month period amongst insufficiently active adults attending general practices in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Hunter, and Inner West Sydney areas of New South Wales. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of 3 groups: a) face-to-face counselling by an exercise specialist; b) one face-to-face visit followed by telephone counselling by an exercise specialist; or c) receive generic print materials in the mail promoting PA. The primary outcomes will be pedometer steps at 12 months.</summary>
