    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Volitinib

Experimental: Volitinib(HMPL-504) - There are six dose cohorts,including 100, 200, 400, 600,800 and 1000 mg/day, HMPL-504 will be administered orally to patients once daily for each dose cohort.
An alternative dosing schedule of twice every day (BID) may be investigated if pharmacokinetic studies indicate faster than anticipated clearance of Volitinib(HMPL-504).


Treatment: drugs: Volitinib
Volitinib(HMPL-504) is a tablet in the form of 25 mg ,100mgand 200 mg,oral,once daily.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of HMPL-504 administered to patients. - The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504. The safety and tolerability variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including serum chemistry, hematology(Maximum Tolerated Dose) , and urinalysis (with detailed sediment analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms (ECGs) in triplicate,Incidence and nature of DLTs(Dose-Limiting Toxicity),To determine the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).</outcome>
      <timepoint>up to 20 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic Assessments for area under curve (AUC), Cmax and Tmax . - In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics(PK) profiles of HMPL-504 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HMPL-504 on Day 1 to Day 3. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5,2,4,6,8 hour time points on days 1,15,21of dosing in the first 21-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2,8,16,and 22 of the first 21-Day cycle of therapy</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Volitinib (HMPL-504) is a novel, highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of
      c-Met kinase. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong in vitro and in vivo activity
      against c-Met kinase and its downstream signaling targets and inhibited tumor cell growth.
      This first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary
      anti-tumor activity of HMPL-504 at single doses and multiple doses.</summary>
