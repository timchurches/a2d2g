Experimental: Part 1(Cohort 1): GSK2118436 225 mg - GSK2118436 (3 capsules of 75 mg) will be administered orally at the dose of 225 mg BID from Day 1 to 7 (and single dose on Day 8) under fasted conditions, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.

Experimental: Part 1(Cohort 2): GSK2118436 300 mg - GSK2118436 (4 capsules of 75 mg) will be administered orally at the dose of 300 mg BID from Day 1 to 7 (and single dose on Day 8) under fasted conditions, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. If 225 mg BID is not tolerated in Part 1 /Cohort 1, then Part 1/Cohort 2 will not be initiated and 150 mg BID will be used in Part 2.

Experimental: Part 2: GSK2118436 300 mg (or highest tolerated dose) - Subjects will receive a single dose of GSK2118436/placebo (4 capsules of 75 mg/highest tolerated dose) orally on the first 2 days of the study followed by 2 doses daily for 6 days and a single dose on the 9th day. There will be 1 day when a placebo will be given. All doses will be administered under fasted conditions, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.


Treatment: drugs: GSK2118436 75 mg
Each capsule contains 75 mg of GSK2118436A as the mesylate salt, micronized particles as active equivalents.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Matching placebo capsules will be administered in Part 2 of the study.

    <summary>This is a Phase I, multicenter, 2-part study with Part 1 designed as a safety lead-in and
      Part 2 designed to evaluate the effect of GSK2118436 on cardiac repolarization (corrected QT
      interval [QTc] duration) as compared with placebo in subjects with V600 BRAF
      mutation-positive tumors.

      Each part of the study will consist of screening (14 days prior to the start of the study
      treatment), treatment and follow-up period (14 days).

      In Part 1 in Cohort 1 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 225 mg twice a day (BID) on study
      days 1 to 7 and a single 225 milligram (mg) dose on morning of Day 8. Based on the safety
      data of subjects in Cohort 1 subjects will be enrolled in Cohort 2 and the dose of GSK2118436
      will be escalated to 300 mg BID. If the 225 mg dose of GSK2118436 is not well tolerated in
      Cohort 1 (i.e., 2 or more dose-limiting toxicities [DLTs]), then Cohort 2 of Part 1 will not
      be initiated and a dose of 150 mg BID of GSK2118436 will be administered in Part 2 of the
      study. In Cohort 2 six subjects will receive GSK2118436 300 mg BID on Study Days 1 to 7 and a
      single 300 mg dose on the morning of Day 8. Based on the safety data of subjects in Cohort 2
      subjects will be enrolled in Part 2. If the 300 mg BID dose level of GSK2118436 is not well
      tolerated, then the highest tolerated dose will be selected for Part 2 of the study.

      In Part 1 of the study the decision to proceed to the next cohort or Part 2 of the study will
      be based on the safety data of at least 6 evaluable subjects (&lt;=1 DLTs during the 14 days
      following the first dose of GSK2118436).

      In Part 2 of the study eligible subjects will receive a single dose of GSK2118436/placebo (4
      capsules of 75 mg/highest tolerated dose) orally on the first 2 days of the study followed by
      2 doses daily for 6 days and a single dose on the 9th day. There will be 1 day when a placebo
      will be given.

      In both the parts of the study serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis for
      GSK2118436 and its metabolites (GSK2285403, GSK2298683 and GSK2167542) will be obtained at
      the same time points on the first and last day of dosing (2nd day of dosing also included for
      Part 2). Safety electrocardiogram (ECG)s will be performed at several timepoints during the
      study. In Part 2 Holter ECG monitoring will be performed for 24 hours on the 1st, 2nd and 9th
      days of dosing.</summary>
