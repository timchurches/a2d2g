  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of osimertinib and gefitinib for the treatment of EGFR-T790M mutation positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with EGFR-T790M mutation positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer which has acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs).

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will begin with induction therapy which involves taking an osimertinib tablet once per day for eight weeks. Participants will then move onto the alternating phase, which involves alternating four-weekly cycles of treatment with gefitinib and osimertinib (i.e. four weeks gefitinib then four weeks osimertinib) until disease progression or unacceptable side effects. Following progression, some participants may be eligible to continue with osimertinib treatment until further progression, depending on whether your doctor believes that this would be of benefit to you.

All patients will be reviewed up to every four weeks by blood samples, CT scans and side effect assessments.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on whether alternating treatment with osimertinib and gefitinib is feasible, safe and effective for the treatment of EGFR-T790M mutation positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.</summary>
