  <interventions>
    <interventions>1cc volume of  topical 30% lidocaine in Lipothene gel (Treatment).

This was a split body design such that for each patient, one side of the face received the treatment gel and the other side of the face received the placebo gel. 

Both the treatment and the placebo gel was applied over prominent veins on the infra-orbit and/or lateral temporal area using a cotton tip applicator.

Only veins identified by the surgeon and patient undergoing the treatment was treated with the intervention. 

The intervention and placebo gel remained on the patients face for 15 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>1 cc of placebo (lubricating gel) applied topically. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure was pain  as assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue scale. This study utilized the definition of pain based on International Association for the Study of Pain. 

Specifically, we defined pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Patients were advised to rate their pain based on their experience during the examination only. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation was concealed from both the patient and assessor during the treatment and trial. The individual who was responsible for enrolling patients was not aware of group allocation. Allocation was concealed from both patients and observes by storing allocation on a secure computer. 

Subjects were asked not to communicate any subjective differences in sensation until after the treatment was complete to ensure the treating physician remained blinded to the treatment sides.  If a patient noted a subjective difference any. This allocation data was stored on a secured computed in the clinic and was not available until completion of the trial. </concealment>
    <sequence>A computerized random number generator (Research Randomizer 10 Online) was utilized by the research coordinator to randomize the patientsâ€™ side to each intervention group. The random number generator generated a unique number for each patient, and if an even number was generated, the treatment was applied to the right periorbital/temporal region, while odd numbers resulted in the treatment being applied to the left periorbital/temporal region. All patients received both the treatment and placebo. Once randomization was performed, there was no change to randomization after beginning the trial. </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size calculation was conducted to determine the minimum sample required to answer the primary objective. Based on a previous pilot study 1,3 we estimated a minimal difference in pain between treatment and control of 2 cm (2/10 on a VAS) with a standard deviation of 2 cm. Based on this data, this study required a minimum of 10 patients to achieve the desired power of 80% at an alpha of 0.05.

For Data Testing

All statistics were analyzed using MINITAB (version 16.1.1; Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) statistical software.

Non-parametric testing was used for all outcomes. A Wilcoxon sign-rank test was used to compare treatment and control sides. We defined a significant difference as a p&lt;0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Some individuals have cosmetically un-pleasing prominent blue veins under their eyes or in their temporal regions. Although there are a number of methods to treat these, a simple, effective and safe method is using a type of laser called ND:YAG which targets the blue pigment in the vein. Unfortunately, patients often describe this as uncomfortable or painful. 

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine if using a lidocaine gel prior to treatment will result in a reduction in pain. </summary>
