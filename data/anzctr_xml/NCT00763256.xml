  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>HbA1c Levels in Blood - Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is a form of hemoglobin which is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. In this study, blood is taken from each subject and HbA1c levels were measured at 12 months by Queensland Health Pathology Scientific Services (QHPSS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>High Sensitivity CRP (C-Reactive Protein) - CRP is a protein found in the blood and is a marker for inflammation in the body. Inflammation plays a role in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular disease. Blood is taken from each subject and CRP levels were measured at 12 months by Queensland Health Pathology Scientific Services (QHPSS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>C-Peptide - C-Peptide levels in blood indicate whether or not a person is producing insulin. This peptide is usually found in equal levels to insulin. C-peptide levels measured as a means of distinguishing type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Blood is taken from each subject and C-Peptide levels were measured at 12 months by Queensland Health Pathology Scientific Services (QHPSS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gingivitis Score (GI) - Units on a scale 0 to 3 (0 = no inflammation,
1 = Mild inflammation-slight change in color and little change in texture 2 = Moderate inflammation-moderate glazing, redness, edema and hypertrophy. Tendency to bleed upon probing. 3 = Severe inflammation-marked redness and hypertrophy. Tendency to spontaneous bleeding)</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>P. Gingivalis - Subgingival plaque samples were collected from all interproximal (mesial) sites and pooled prior to assessment. The samples will be analysed for the presence of P. gingivalis, using real time PCR to quantitate the numbers of bacteria. P. gingivalis is a non-motile, gram negative, anaerobic, pathogenic bacteria. It is linked to periodontal disease and causes collagen degradation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months</timepoint>
