  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to measure the acute (2-hour) effects following consumption of wheat whole-grain foods differing in processing treatment on obesity-related measures.   This study hypothesises that the grain products that have undergone selected additional processing will contain greater nutrients and bioactive compounds and have favourable outcomes on postprandial measures compared with regular whole-grain products.</summary>
