  <interventions>
    <interventions>Preoperative tailored regimen of exercise with dietary advice.

Exercise will involve up to 12 sessions (maximum of three, 1-hour, small group sessions per week for 4 weeks supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist) of combined strength/cardiovascular/balance exercise in the 4 weeks prior to surgery.

Each exercise session will consist of:
- 5 mins warm-up (treadmill/mobility)
- 30 mins of circuit based combined strength/cardiovascular &amp; balance exercises as follows = 2 sets of 8-12 reps per exercise (50% of predicted 1RM) of chest press, seated row, bicep curl, triceps extension, squat, &amp; leg curl; AND 3-4 sets (1 min per round) of single leg balance (eyes open/closed)
- 20 mins of aerobic interval exercise (walking) based of high and low intensity at a ratio of 1:1 (1 min of higher intensity exercise [e.g. 50% heart rate reserve] interspersed with 1 min of lower intensity [e.g. 25% heart rate reserve]
- 5 mins cool down (treadmill/mobility)

Generic dietary advice will involve a single 1-hour, one-on-one educational session with a allied health professional.

All participants will maintain a diary of all exercise activities during the study. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this feasibility pilot study is to examine the efficacy of an exercise regime and dietary advice prior to colorectal surgery in frail older adults.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 50 years or older, are considered frail, and are scheduled to undergo major colorectal surgery. You will also need to be willing and able to attend exercise and dietary advice sessions in the Townsville area.

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either usual care prior to their surgery, or to receive a tailored exercise regime from exercise physiologists. Regimes will be tailored to each individual's level of fitness and health, but will all include elements of strength, aerobic and balance training to be carried out during a maximum of three, 1-hour sessions per week for 4 weeks.

It is hoped that the findings of this pilot study will inform researchers primarily as to whether the exercise and dietary advice intervention is feasible and effective in this patient group.</summary>
