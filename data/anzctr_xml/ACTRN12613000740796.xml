  <interventions>
    <interventions>All randomised participants will receive usual care, which involves receiving routine clinical advice from the Heart Transplant Nurse Practitioner for patients identified as experiencing psychological distress as well as a letter to the participants General Practitioner advising them of the severity of psychological symptoms and their participation in the study. Participants randomised to the intervention group will also receive:
i) one telephone-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy sessions per week for 8 weeks, of about 60 minutes, delivered by a Masters in Clinical Psychology student (with supervision from one of the Associate Investigators who is an accredited Clinical Psychologist); followed by
ii) communication between the Heart Transplant Nurse Practitioner, a psychologist and the participants General Practitioner regarding the implications for on-going psychological care in light of response to the course of cognitive behaviour therapy.
Following is a brief summary of the anticipated content of counselling sessions.
Week 1
Orientation to therapy, goals and expectations of therapy
Week 2
Identifying automatic thoughts in difficult situations during the previous week and practice reframing
Weeks 3-6
Continued analysis of negative thoughts, identification of core beliefs, problem solving and coping strategies
Week 7
Self-therapy guide and relapse prevention
Week 8
Termination, review self-therapy guide and accomplishments of therapy

The structure of the sessions will be standardised. During the initial part of a session, a mood check will be performed, the agenda for the session will be set collaboratively between the patient and the therapist, the therapist will obtain an update from the patient, review their progress with cognitive and behaviour tasks and prioritise the agenda. The main component of the session will involve working on specific problems, including instruction on cognitive behaviour skills for that particular context. Cognitive and behaviour tasks will then be identified. Participants will be encouraged to perform these tasks in the time between their counselling sessions in order to reinforce learnt skills. At the end of each session, the therapist will either provide, or elicit from the patient, a summary of the session. Also, the therapist will review and reinforce the importance of completion of the identified cognitive and behaviour tasks and elicit feedback from the patient. A manual, including agenda templates and symptom assessment forms to assist with mood checks (Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory), will be used to guide the counselling sessions. The use of this manual will aid fidelity of the intervention.
As surgical recovery will not be a focus of the intervention, any questions or concerns related to the clinical aspects of heart transplantation that may arise during counselling sessions will be directed to the Heart Transplant Nurse Practitioner for clarification.
Following the course of cognitive behaviour therapy, the Research Nurse will invite the participants General Practitioner and the Heart Transplant Nurse Practitioner to participate in a case conference. The objective of the case conference is to discuss the patients case, their current symptoms, problems they will face and how the problems and symptoms can be managed, with particular attention paid to identifying who will be responsible for particular courses of action. The Research Psychologist who performed the counselling, as well as Dr Judith Sheridan, who will be the Clinical Supervisor for the student, will also attend the conference. It is anticipated that the case conference would take about 20-30 minutes. As this process is part of patient care, the General Practitioner would be eligible to claim the GP Multidisciplinary Case Conference Medicare item. Both the patient and each participating health care provider will be forwarded a summary of the case conference.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of telephone-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy followed by case conferencing with specialist and primary care services in improving psychological and clinical outcomes for heart transplant recipients. Assessment of feasibility includes recruitment issues, likely attrition rates and acceptability of interventions (measured by dropout rates due to the nature of intervention during the study), which are important considerations in planning a larger clinical trial. It will also help determine the effect size for sample size estimation to adequately power a future larger clinical trial.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the accuracy of brief, self-administered tools to screen for anxiety and depression in heart transplant recipients. Receiver Operating Characteristics with the MINI as the criterion will be calculated to assess accuracy of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 results. The Youden Index will be the metric used for cut-off decisions.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Process Data: All counselling sessions will be tape recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis. These data will be used to: (1) document the frequency with which various strategies were used and the perceived effectiveness and satisfaction with the strategies; (2) identify common themes that reflect issues impacting the intervention, including environmental, situational, patient-related, or intervention-related factors. By providing qualitative data about intervention processes, these data act as a check on compliance with the study protocols, as well as an assessment of the perceived effectiveness of intervention procedures. After the completion of each intervention session, the Research Psychologist will respond to a structured list of questions, which assess: duration of the intervention; topics discussed; strategies used; patient responses to strategies used; the effectiveness of each strategy used; environmental issues perceived to be impacting the intervention; and other issues arising from the intervention. </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>An experienced research nurse will liaise with clinical staff on a regular basis to identify potentially eligible inpatients or outpatients using a standard screening assessment sheet. Clinicians will be asked to identify potentially eligible patients. 

Prior to their consultation with the Nurse Practitioner, all consenting participants will complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and questionnaires to evaluate quality of life (Short Form-36 [SF-36]), and transplant-specific self-care (Transplant Care Index [TCI]). The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 results will be made available to the Nurse Practitioner during the clinic visit so that usual clinical advice and referrals for patients experiencing psychological distress can be actioned. Participants with scores over 5 on the GAD-7 or PHQ-9 (indicating at least mild anxiety or depressive symptoms) will be randomised to the intervention or control group. After the clinic visit the Research Psychologist will perform a structured interview with each participant using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). This interview will be conducted as soon as possible after the clinic visit via the phone in order to identify participants that fit DSM-IV criteria for current psychological disorder.

Participants who score more than 5 on the GAD-7 or the PHQ-9, which indicates at least mild symptoms of anxiety or depression, will be randomised to the intervention or control groups.  Allocation involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be located at the central administration site.</concealment>

    <summary>This pilot study will assess the feasibility of undertaking a larger study to determine if telephone-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy followed by communication with on-going specialist and primary care providers is a successful and sustainable treatment option for adult heart transplant recipients with anxiety or depression. Additionally, this study will also help determine the accuracy of simple, self-adminsitered questionnaires to screen for anxiety and depression.</summary>
