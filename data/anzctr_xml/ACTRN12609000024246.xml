  <interventions>
    <interventions>10-20 mg/kg intravenous L-carnitine after each dialysis session for 6 months. Dose will be based on patient dry weight such that patients weighing &lt;50kg will be administered 0.5g L-carnitine; patients weighing 50-100kg will be administered 1g L-carntine; and patients weighing &gt;100kg will be administered 2g L-carnitine. Patients will dialyse, on average, 3 times per week. It is therefore anticipated that, on average, a 50-100kg patient will receive a dose of 3g/week, equating to an overall exposure of approximately 78g during the trial.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Carnitine is found in all mammals and is required for energy production. A large proportion of carnitine within the body is obtained from the diet and a lesser amount is made by the kidneys and liver. Carnitine deficiency is common in haemodialysis patients due to their low protein diet and abnormal kidney function, and also because carnitine is easily removed by the dialysis procedure. Carnitine is administered to dialysis patients in the United States and other countries for the treatment of dialysis-related carnitine deficiency.
This study is being conducted to investigate the effect of carnitine administration on a number of common problems associated with dialysis, including muscle fatigue, anaemia and symptoms such as muscle cramps.</summary>
