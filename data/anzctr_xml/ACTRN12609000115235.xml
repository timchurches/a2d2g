  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease  that is endemic in developing countries such as our country. The incidence of leishmaniasis is more than 400,000 cases  annually and the prevalence of all form of leishmaniasis is more than twelve millions.
Although cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a self- healing disease , the duration of the disease is long and requeries several months and somtimes years before complete recovery , depending on the species of the infecting parasite . After recovery, a disfiguring scar can be left , which may destroy underlying structures like the nose or ear or cause psychological suffering of patients.
The first line drug for treatment of CL., according to WHO recommendation , is the pentavalent comounds such as meglomine antimoniate (Glucantime )
Other treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis are intralesinal injection of meglomine antimonate, terbinafine , paramonycin ointment ,   and physical treatment including cryotherapy (cryosurgery) .In recent researches,zinc  sulfate was studied in the treatment of this disease.But there are some contravesies.The aim of this study is the comparision of intralesional injection of zinc sulfate with intralesional glucantim in the treatment of cutaneou leishmaniasis.</summary>
