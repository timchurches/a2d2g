  <interventions>
    <interventions>Remote home monitoring  of clients vital signs by a nurse will be undertaken.  The monitoring equipment is installed in the clients home. The client is trained in the use of the equipment to measure their vital signs which will include:
a) Blood Pressure
b) Weight
c) Heart Rate
d) Oxygen Saturation Levels
In addition, clients response to questions regarding their general state of health or specific to their condition, such as the type of cough they are experiencing or the colour of their sputum. Readings take approximately 20 minutes for the client to complete and occur on a daily basis for a period of 6 months.
Readings are transmitted to a central point where any deviations from the norm are reviewed by a nurse and interventions introduced where required.  Those interventions can be a telephone call by the clinician to retake the tests or a recommendation that the patient visit their General Practitioner.</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual care plus provision of information on self monitoring.
Usual care consists of the provision of oxygen and the monitoring of the clients condition by their respiratory physician and/or general practitioner (GP) as required. The provision of oxygen includes an initial clinican visit to set up the client on oxygen followed by visits at 3 months and 12 months for review.</comparator>

      <outcome>Cost savings of home monitoring compared to usual care accounting for equipment, telephone costs, monitoring costs, hospital admissions, emergency department visits, other medical visits. First, average unit costs for equipment, hospital separations, accident and emergency occasions of service, general practitioner visits, specialist visits and post acute community care services using West Australian Department of Health and Australian Department of Health and Ageing reported figures and Silver Chain unit costs.  Unit costs for monitoring and liaising will be similarly derived.  Next, the data collected for the control and intervention groups will be used to estimate service utilisation that can be averaged for various sub-groups defined in terms of, inter alia, age, gender and Quality of Life (QoL).  The incidence of monitoring and liaising for the intervention group will be averaged across the number of clients.  Finally, unit costs will be applied to the service utilisation figures for the control and intervention groups to estimate total average costs for each group.  The total costs of monitoring and liaising will be added to the total cost of services for the intervention group.  A sensitivity analysis that refers to parameters used to estimate the savings in other studies identified in the literature review will be undertaken.</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Clients meeting the selection criteria and identified using Silver Chain’s data management system Com Care, will be invited to participate in the research by letter.  The letter will explain that a Research Officer will telephone them in the next few days to discuss the research project with them.  Should the client be interested in participating the Research Officer will make an appointment to visit the client in their home at a mutually convenient time and send them an information sheet about the study, a consent form, and a reminder of the appointment date and time.  When the Research Officer visits they will refer to the information statement about the project and encourage the client (or family) to ask any questions they may have.  When certain the client and family have asked all their questions and are still wishing to participate, the Research Officer will ask the client to sign the consent form. 

Following completion of the baseline data collection when the client is allocated a study number (these are allocated sequentially), the envelope indicating which group the client’s study number has been allocated to, will be opened and the client duly informed.  

Prior to the commencement of recruitment, 80 cases will have been randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group (40 in each group), by the Senior Research Officer.  Envelopes will then be made up which have the study number written on the outside and contain a slip of paper with the group assignment for that number.  An electronic master list of the study numbers and group allocation will be kept on a password protected computer and will not be accessible to the Research Officer doing the client recruitment. 

When a client is recruited their GP and/or Specialist will be informed as to which group the client has been randomly allocated to.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a randomised controlled trial of telehealth self monitoring of clients with COPD and CHF. Clients in the intervention group will be provided with and trained to use telehealth equipment with which to monitor clinical vital signs which are then transmitted to Silver Chain. Deviations from the norm are reviewed by a nurse and interventions introduced where required. It is expected that cost saving will be seen as a results of fewer hospital admissions, shorter hospital stays and fewer emergency department visits when compared to a control group.</summary>
