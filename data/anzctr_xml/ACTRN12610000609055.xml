  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve clinicians referring participants to an Active Exercise Program, which comprises individual and small group supervised sessions and individual home-based physical activity. Participants will initially undertake a one-on-one session with the exercise physiologist, which will include a discussion on the needs of the participant, physical activity preferences, goals, and strategies for overcoming any barriers to performing physical activity. A 12-week program will be undertaken comprising a combination of supervised individual and small group physical activity sessions and home-based physical activity. Within the supervised, the exercise program will be adapted to suit the ability of the participant. The exercise physiologist will lead the small group sessions two times per week and the participant will be advised to undertake their home-based program for a further one day per week. Each supervised session will last approximately 50 minutes and participants will be encouraged to socialise following the sessions. The program will also account for co-morbidities, health conditions, physical limitations and individual preferences. The Australian Association for Exercise and Sport Science recommends that cancer survivors participate in low to moderate intensity physical activity, with regular frequency (3-5 times/week), for at least 20 minutes per session, involving aerobic, resistance or mixed exercise types.</interventions>

    <concealment>On completion of active treatment, prostate cancer patients will be considered for the study at their three-12 month follow up consultation. Eligible patients will be identified by the health service nurses prior to presentation to either the public health service outpatient clinic or private health service rooms for their follow up consultation. The primary investigator will randomly assign clinicians to one of two study arms using computer generated random numbers. Clinicians in the intervention arm will follow a standardized script to refer participants to the physical activity program and will provide patients with a referral slip to the program.  Patients of clinicians assigned to the control arm will receive usual advice regarding physical activity. During clinic sessions, members of the research team will approach eligible patients and introduce the study to the patient, provide an information package and seek verbal approval to follow them up within 48 hours regarding their interest in participating in the study. Once the consent form has been returned, the project manager will arrange for the participantâ€™s first physical activity session. Allocation is not concealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is evidence that engaging in physical activity improves the physical health of prostate cancer survivors. Despite this evidence, men who survive prostate cancer do not engage in recommended levels of physical activity. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential influence clinicians could have on increasing physical activity levels among prostate cancer survivors, by referring cancer survivors to a physical activity program, with expert involvement from exercise physiologists. The participants will be 220 survivors of prostate cancer, defined as men who have completed active treatment (hormone treatment exempt) for prostate cancer three-12 months prior. The study has been designed as a randomised controlled trial to test the efficacy of an intervention (i.e., a clinicians referral to a physical activity program) to generate a) behaviour change by increasing physical activity levels that is sustained over time and b) improve psychosocial and quality of life outcomes among prostate cancer survivors. The patients treating clinicians will be randomised to either the intervention arm or control arm of the trial. The intervention will involve clinicians referring participants to an Active Exercise Program, which comprises 12 weeks of small group sessions and individual home-based physical activity. Patients of clinicians assigned to the control arm will receive usual advice regarding physical activity, given the information and consent form, and invited to be involved in the study by the clinician. The main outcomes that will be measured in this trial are participation in physical activity, cancer-specific quality of life, anxiety relating to prostate cancer, depressed mood, and objective physical functioning. Measurements of these outcomes will be made using standard questionnaires. The questionnaires will be administered baseline (T1), on completion of the intervention (T2), and at six-(T3) and 12-months post-recruitment (T4). Objective physical functioning will be measures at baseline (T1) and on completion of intervention (T2). This study will inform the development of a physical activity program for prostate cancer survivors which could become available across Victorian YMCA facilities and ultimately across Australia.</summary>
