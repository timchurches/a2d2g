  <interventions>
    <interventions>Advance Care Planning (ACP) refers to the process by which patients, families and health professionals (HPs) discuss and establish future goals of care in accordance with the patients values and preferences.
ACP provides a formal means of informing health professionals and family of the patients wishes.  If patients become too ill to make decisions, documentation of their preferences regarding End of Life (EOL) care will enable patients to receive the care they would have chosen.   Moreover, ACP can relieve the burden of decision-making for family members. ACP is patient-centred in that it promotes shared-decision-making, supports substitute decision-making where appropriate and aims to achieve good EOL care. For this trial ACP will be administered in a face to face meeting by a specially trained nurse. The session will take between half an hour to 3 hours over 1 to 3 visits to complete, depending on patient preferences.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care. 
EOL discussions occur relatively rarely and often very close to death. Patients with metastatic incurable cancer under the care of medical oncologists in Australia rarely complete advance care directives. </comparator>

      <outcome>Costing and health care use both patient and nominated family or friend. We will collect detailed resource use data on study participants consisting of of Commonwealth Medicare and PBS records which provide detailed accounts of medical service use and pharmaceutical consumption.  We will seek consent to access state based records on hospital admissions and emergency department visits, for example through the Centre for Health Record Linkage (CHeReL) in NSW, and similar in other States.  In addition, we will directly ask patients about their health care use of services and products that are beyond the scope of the administrative datasets such as their use of (and expenditure on) over-the-counter medication, alternative therapies, community and allied health services. This will be collected by a short series of questions on health service use as part of the telephone interview.  Costs will be obtained by using a standard schedule of prices, including MBS fees, PBS costs, hospital activity funding prices (to be introduced in 2012) and self-reported out-of-pockets checked against common prices. The cost of advanced care planning will be estimated based on a time-and-motion study from a sample of patients in the study.  We observe the length of time taken to undertake advanced care planning as well as recording associated activities (including training) of the health professional involved.

    <statisticalmethods>Assuming a baseline rate of EOL wishes at 30% based on a previous trial in non-cancer patients, and believing a doubling to 60% would influence clinical practice, two study groups with 63 patients will result in the study having 90% power to detect a between-group difference with 95% certainty. A conservative estimate of mortality at 12 months is 50%. To allow for 25% of patients not to complete ACP within 2 weeks of enrolment or the initial 6 week assessment and patient/carer loss to follow up of 10-20%, we propose a sample size of 334 patients-carer dyads (668 participants in total).

Statistical methods: The primary outcome is knowledge of and adherence to EOL wishes which will be assessed by using chi-squared tests for categorical outcomes and t-tests for continuous outcomes. Outcomes which are measured repeatedly will be analysed with mixed models, to assess patterns over time as well as differences between group at specific time points.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to evaluate the effect of a formal advance care planning intervention (ACP) on the documentation of patient wishes, compliance with known end of life (EOL) wishes and the quality of death of patients with progressive incurable cancer on first line chemotherapy. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with an incurable cancer with disease progression on first line chemotherapy. Eligible patients must be able to nominate a family member or friend who is willing to participate in the study who is 18 years of age or over. Study details Patients and their family/friend/carer will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive standard end of life care. Participants in the other group will receive standard care plus a formal advance care planning intervention. All patients and family who request information on life expectancy will be provided with typical, best case and worst case scenarios for survival time. The intervention aims to promote discussion between patient and family and the health care team and to promote documentation of the patients preferences for continuing and EOL care. The intervention involves the patient plus a family member or friend meeting with a specially trained nurse to have conversations about their goals, wishes and needs for care now and in the future, as well as how these matters will be shared with their doctor and health care team. For those patients allocated to the group who receive the intervention, this program will take between half an hour to 3 hours over 1 to 3 visits to complete, depending on patient preference.  Patients will be asked to complete some questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter to evaluate quality of life and satisfaction with care. The patients family/friend/carer will also be asked to complete some questionnaires at baseline, 6 weeks, every 3 months until the patients death, and then at 3 months after bereavement to evaluate their perceived quality of death and the impact of death on surviving family. The costs of care will also be assessed.</summary>
