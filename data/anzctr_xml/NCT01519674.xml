  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial is conducted in Asia, Europe, Oceania and South America. The aim of this clinical
      trial is to generate data demonstrating how to intensify diabetes treatment using BIAsp 30
      (biphasic insulin aspart 30) by adding or substituting BIAsp 30 to sitagliptin in various
      regimens for type 2 patients inadequately controlled on sitagliptin and metformin (with or
      without other oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs)).

      The trial is conducted as a phase 4 trial in the majority of the participating countries.
      However, in some countries the trial is conducted as phase 3b.</summary>
