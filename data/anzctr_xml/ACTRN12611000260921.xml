    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children referred to Waitakere Hospital Paediatric Outpatients (a General Paediatric Clinic) with Eczema will be offered a place in the trial.

Treatment with bleach or water will allocated at random in plain numbered bottles of either bleach or water to be added to the bath.  Because bleach has a smell, we cannot blind the patient and their parents to the treatment they have been allocated to.  Medical and Nursing staff following the progress of the children will be blinded to the child's treatment allocation.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A trial to compare twice weekly dilute bleach baths with water baths in children with eczema.  The hypothesis is that bacterial colonisation may be less after the bleach baths and so the eczema should improve.  Bacterial swabs will also be taken at the start and after six weeks of baths to assess bacterial colonisation rates before and after the dilute bleach baths.  The amount of bleach used is 1 ml per litre of bath water (giving Sodium hypochlorite 0.004% in the bath water).  All participants will also have standard eczema treatments with moisturisers and steroid creams as required.</summary>
