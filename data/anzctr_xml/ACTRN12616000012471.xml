  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to specifically target on patients with diabetic macular oedema who are poorly responsive to current anti-VEGF therapy  (bevacizumab or ranibiznumab), and evaluate whether changing the therapeutic agent to intravitreal ziv aflibercept injection would lead to improved functional and anatomical outcomes. The 48 week treatment duration is appropriate for a pilot study. 
The hypothesis of this study is that compounded intravitreal ziv Aflibercept injection may be effective in causing resolution of persistent sub or intraretinal fluid despite previous treatment with bevacizumab or ranibizumab by counteracting the effect of both VEGF-A and placental growth factor, with increased binding affinity.  At the very least, being as effective as previous treatment but with fewer treatments.</summary>
