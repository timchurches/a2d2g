    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Decitabine
Treatment: drugs - PDR001
Treatment: drugs - MBG453

Experimental: Decitabine and PDR001 - Decitabine in combination with PDR001

Experimental: Decitabine and MBG453 - Decitabine in combination with MBG453

Experimental: Decitabine, PDR001 and MBG453 - Decitabine in combination with PDR001 and MBG453


Treatment: drugs: Decitabine
Decitabine is a cytidine deoxynucleoside analogue that selectively inhibits DNA methyltransferases at low doses, resulting in gene promoter hypomethylation.

Treatment: drugs: PDR001
PDR001 is a high-affinity, ligand-blocking, humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody directed against PD-1 that blocks the binding of PD-L1 and PD-L2.

Treatment: drugs: MBG453
MBG453 is a high-affinity, humanized anti-TIM-3 IgG4 monoclonal antibody which blocks the binding of TIM-3 to phosphatidylserine (PtdSer).
