  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A phase I clinical trial completed in Melbourne in 2011 found the RV3-BB vaccine to be well-tolerated in adults, children and babies 6-8 weeks of age (ACTRN12610000525088). 
A phase IIa clinical trial in Dunedin (ACTRN12611001212943) was designed to assess immunogenicity of the vaccine.
The aim of this phase IIb trial is to determine the efficacy of the vaccine. Newborn babies are included in this trial to examine whether administering this vaccine at birth will offer the earliest and possibly greatest protection.
Each of the babies will be randomly assigned to groups, so that two thirds of the babies will receive 3 doses of oral RV3 vaccine and one third of the babies will receive oral doses of placebo. In total each babys involvement will include monthly visits and additional regular follow up until 18 months of age.</summary>
