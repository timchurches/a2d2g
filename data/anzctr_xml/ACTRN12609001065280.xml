  <interventions>
    <interventions>PICSI - a type of fertilisation technique which allows mature sperm to bind to a substance (hyaluronan) in a dish. Scientists then pick a sperm for use in ICSI from this select population of sperm. Selection is based on morphology and motility.
This intervention process takes 5-10 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>ICSI - routine injection of sperm into an egg with scientist picking the best sperm based on appearance of sperm. The duration of this procedure is 2-3 minutes per egg injected.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fertilization rates- the scientists check for fertilisation 24 hrs after the sperm is injected. They do this by looking under a microscope .</outcome>
      <timepoint>1 year following randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pregnancy rates. A pregnancy hormone test is carried out 14 days after the embryo is transferred into the uterus and if this is positive, an ultrasound of the uterus is performed 6 weeks later to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection is commonly used to aid fertilisation rates in men with low sperm counts , poor sperm mobility and high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation. The sperm used to inject into the egg is hand picked by the scientist, based on sperm appearance. However, a scientist is unable to detect poor DNA based on sperm appearance. The PICSI dish contains a substance called hyaluronan that normally exists around an egg. It is proposed that sperm with lower levels of DNA damage are more likely to bind to this hyaluronan. This allows the scientists to be more selective in the handpicking process. By handpicking only that sperm that has bound to the substance, they may be selecting the better sperm for injection into the egg.</summary>
