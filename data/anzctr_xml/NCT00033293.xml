Experimental: Arm I (chemotherapy, immunoglobulin therapy) - Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk neuroblastoma receive chemotherapy (including cyclophosphamide) according to the standard of care for the stage of primary neuroblastoma, beginning day 0. Patients with low-risk neuroblastoma (and not receiving other chemotherapy) receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hr on day 0. Treatment repeats every 4 wks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients receive oral prednisone twice daily for 3 mths and then every other day for 7-15 mths.
Patients receive therapeutic immune globulin IV on days -2 and -1, at wks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24, and then at mths 8, 10, and 12 after therapy. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with no response after 6 months go off treatment. In case of progression of opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) during evaluation, patient will be switched to another steroid, corticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH).

Active Comparator: Arm II (chemotherapy, observation) - Patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk neuroblastoma receive chemotherapy (including cyclophosphamide) according to the standard of care for the stage of primary neuroblastoma, beginning on day 0. Patients with low-risk neuroblastoma (and not receiving other chemotherapy) receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 0. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. All patients receive oral prednisone twice daily for 3 months and then every other day for 7-15 months.
Patients do not receive therapeutic immune globulin. Patients with unresponsive opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome after 2 months or progression after 6 months may cross over to arm I.

      <outcome>Number of Responders - A multi-stage design followed by a test of proportions between the treatment arms (chemo vs. chemo + therapeutic immune globulin (IVIG)) will be performed. The first stage of the multi-stage design will also function as an early stopping rule for insufficient activity of chemotherapy in OMA.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial is studying cyclophosphamide, prednisone, and immunoglobulin
      to see how well they work compared to cyclophosphamide and prednisone alone in treating
      patients with abnormal eye and trunk muscle movements (known as opsoclonus myoclonus ataxia)
      associated with neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Steroid therapy decreases
      inflammation. Combining chemotherapy and steroid therapy with immunoglobulin may be effective
      in treating abnormal muscle movement associated with neuroblastoma.
      Chemotherapy(cyclophosphamide), prednisone and intravenous gamma globulin all suppress the
      immune system which may be helpful in treating opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA).</summary>
