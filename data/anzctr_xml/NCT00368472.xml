  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Non-serious Adverse Events (AEs) and Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) - An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered an investigational product. A SAE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening (ie, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred; this did not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death), required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or was as a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a participant who was exposed to the study drug). In this study, treatment emergent AEs (defined as an AE (serious or non-serious) that started/increased in severity on/after the first dose of study medication up to 30 days after the final dose of study medication) were assessed. The data is presented in the safety section of the results.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From date of first dose of perampanel up to 30 days after the last dose of perampanel or up to approximately 8 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent Change in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days Relative to Pre-Perampanel Baseline - Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The seizure frequency per 28 days was calculated as the number of seizures divided by the number of days in the interval and multiplied by 28. The percent change in 28-day seizure frequency from baseline was assessed for all partial-onset seizures types. For participants who had been assigned to treatment with perampanel (previous treatment), pre-perampanel Baseline referred to the Prerandomization Phase of the Core Double Blind study. For participants who had been assigned to treatment with placebo (previous treatment), pre-perampanel Baseline was computed from all data during the Core Double Blind study (including Prerandomization Phase) prior to treatment with perampanel.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 221</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Experienced a 50% or Greater Reduction in Seizure Frequency Per 28 Days Relative to the Pre-perampanel Baseline - Seizure frequency was derived from information (seizure count and type) recorded in participant diary. The percentage of participants who experienced a 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to the pre-perampanel Baseline (responders) was assessed. For participants who had been assigned to treatment with perampanel (previous treatment), pre-perampanel Baseline referred to the Prerandomization Phase of the Core Double Blind study. For participants who had been assigned to treatment with placebo (previous treatment), pre-perampanel Baseline was computed from all data during the Core Double Blind study (including Prerandomization Phase) prior to treatment with perampanel. The data is presented as percent responders.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>KEY INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Have completed all scheduled visits up to and including Visit 8 in the E2007-A001-206
             (NCT00144690) study or Visit 9 of the E2007-G000-208 (NCT00416195) study.

             can record and report the events.

          3. Females of childbearing potential must continue practicing a medically acceptable
             method of contraception (e.g., abstinence, a barrier method plus spermicide, or
             Intrauterine device (IUD)) and for 8 weeks after the end of the OLE study. Those women
             using hormonal contraceptives must also continue using an additional approved method
             of contraception (e.g., a barrier method plus spermicide, or IUD).

          4. Are between the ages of 18 and 70 years of age, inclusive.

          5. Are at least 40 kg (88 lb) of weight.

          6. Are currently being treated with a stable dose of one, or a maximum of three licensed
             Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and are known to take their medication(s) as directed.

        KEY EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Show evidence of clinically significant disease (cardiac, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, renal disease, etc.,) that, in the opinion of the Investigator(s),
             could affect the participant's safety or trial conduct.

          2. Show evidence of significant active hepatic disease and/or bilirubin greater than 1.5
             mg/dL. Stable elevations of liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and
             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) due to concomitant medication(s) will be allowed if
             they are less than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

          3. Show evidence of significant active hematological disease. White blood cell (WBC)
             count cannot be less than or equal to 2500/microL or an absolute neutrophil count less
             than or equal to 1000/microL.

          4. Clinically significant ECG abnormality, including prolonged QTc (defined as greater
             than or equal to 450 msec).

          5. Presence of major active psychiatric disease. Participants taking a stable dose of
             selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant will be allowed.</inclusivecriteria>
