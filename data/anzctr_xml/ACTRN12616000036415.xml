  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised controlled trial design will be used for this study. Participants who are randomly to the intervention group will receive supportive text messages twice a day (morning and evening) for 4 weeks after discharge from an inpatient detoxification facility, Participants will also be asked to report their drug and alcohol use each week via text messages.

Text messages: 
Supportive text messages include material aimed at relapse prevention; asking for help, changing behaviour, avoiding triggers, managing cravings, increasing self-esteem, helping others, and planning for success. Material was sourced from a variety of sources, including messages used in previous studies, 12-Step programs, the positive affirmation literature and consultation with addiction experts..

Examples of the text messages for the participants in the intervention group are:
Keep recovery as a priority and you will reach your goals- Changing behaviour
"What will you do if you find yourself around alcohol unexpectedly? Take some time to develop new strategies to help you cope."- Planning for success
"Practise distraction techniques; do not give in to your cravings."- Managing cravings
"You are powerful and in control of your own future."- Increasing self-esteem
"Spend more time with like-minded, non-drinking peers."- Asking for help
"Try to limit your time spent with friends or family who are heavy drinkers."- Avoiding triggers

Weekly alcohol and other drug use self-report prompts
Each week, participants in the intervention group will also receive a text message prompting them to report their weekly alcohol and other drug consumption via text message. Specifically, every participant who underwent alcohol withdrawal will receive a text asking:
How many days in the last week did you consume alcohol? Please reply with a number between 0 and 7," and every participant who underwent withdrawal for an illicit drug will receive a text asking:
How many days in the last week did you use the drug that has caused you the most concern? Please reply with a number between 0 and 7."


</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group of this study receive the standard aftercare planned for them, as well as a weekly text message for 4 weeks that prompts them to contact DirectLine if they need assistance: Hi from the Wellington House SMS study team. We hope you are well, remember If you need assistance, please call DirectLine on 1800 888 236. 

Participants in the control group are also required to report their weekly alcohol and drug use via text message for the 4 weeks that the study runs.

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size calculation based on the reported effect size for differences in percentage days of abstinence in a similar earlier study (Agyapong et al, 2012), indicates a requirement of 30 per condition (a= .05, power=.90). Allowing for attrition (typically 30%) the required sample is 37 per condition. We will aim to recruit 100 patients in total (n=50 per condition) to ensure we have ample power. Given that Wellington House would treat approximately 550 patients in a 15-month interval this should be easily achieved.

Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0.
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups will be summarised by reporting frequencies (n) with percentages (%) for categorical data and using chi-square to explore group differences and reporting  means and standard deviations (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous data. For the outcome data , the statistical significance of observed differences in proportions (e.g. abstinence rates at follow-up) between the intervention and control group will be examined using Pearson chi-squared or Fishers exact tests. Continuous data (e.g. number of days of continued abstinence, days of use in the past month, AUDIT, DUDIT scores) will be presented as means (standard deviation) with group comparisons explored using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the treatment condition (supportive text messages v. no supportive text messages) as the independent variable, and any variable that differs between the groups at baseline e.g K-10 entered as a covariate.  Tests will be two-sided with p-values of less than .05 considered significant. Effect sizes (Cohens D) will be calculated between-groups based on the pooled standard deviation of the change in mean scores between baseline and follow-up. For participants with missing data the last observation carried forward (baseline measures) will be used to impute missing data thus attempting to correct for any potential bias caused by missing data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to examine whether supportive motivational text messages can serve as ongoing support to reduce relapse rates and extend the duration of continued abstinence among patients recently discharged from in-patient alcohol or other drug (AOD) withdrawal. To achieve this 100 patients who have completed detoxification at
Wellington House will participate in a randomised controlled trial of the intervention (study design).

Patients will be notified by nursing staff that the study is taking place during admission. Those deemed eligibility by the resident doctor will be approached and invited to participate towards the end of their stay. Eligibility criteria are: (i) owning a mobile phone with credit (ii) familiarity with sending and receiving text messages (iii) available for a
telephone follow-up interview 1 month after discharge. If interested the doctor will provide information and oversee the consent taking process if they wish to participate. The consent process will include a request for permission for the researchers to access their screening and assessment data. The resident doctor will complete the client locator form so they can be contacted for a one-month follow-up interview. Once this documentation has been faxed to the research team, the study coordinator at Turning Point (Dr Manning) will take the next sealed envelope which will contains the condition to which the participant is allocated. 

Commencing the day after discharge and for the subsequent 4 weeks, the intervention group will receive twice daily motivational SMS and the control group will receive no motivational SMS and only one message a week providing them with the telephone number for Directline should they require support/assistance. Both groups of participants will continue to receive the usual care planned for them prior to discharge from Wellington House for the duration of the study.

Baseline and outcome measures for this project are: (i) The AUDIT and DUDIT for substance use severity and (ii) the K10 to measure psychological distress (from the routinely completed screen and assessment). Additional measures at the one month telephone interview will be the Timeline Followback to establish alcohol and drug use in the past month. The follow-up interview will take approximately 30 mins to complete over the phone with a researcher. 

Participants will be sent a weekly SMS asking them to report (via reply SMS) the number of AOD using days for that week.</summary>
