  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Colony-stimulating factors, such as G-CSF, may increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects
      of chemotherapy. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Topotecan may
      make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy . Giving topotecan and G-CSF together
      with radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for brain stem glioma.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of topotecan when
      given together with G-CSF and radiation therapy and to see how well they work in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed brain stem glioma.</summary>
