  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing Total Hip Replacement (THR) will be asked to participate in the project. The posterior hip approach for THR involves division of trochanteric bursa, which is located superficially to the muscles and joint capsule. After completion of the hip replacement and closure of capsule and muscles, the bursa will be either resected (Group A) or preserved and repaired (Group B). Both procedures take less than 5 min and constitute a routine step of wound closure. In Group A the trochanteric bursa, which is routinely dissected during the posterior hip approach, will be simply excised. In Group B, the divided tissue will be repaired by using absorbable sutures. During the postoperative period and at the time of routine follow-up examination for THR, the patients will be asked if they have lateral thigh pain or if they can effectively lie on the operated side. Furthermore, a general functional hip score (Harris Hip Score) will be also evaluated. The collected data will be afterwards analysed. According to the result, the null hypothesis will be confirmed or rejected and an evidence-based conclusion regarding the role of trochanteric bursa in THR will be extracted.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trochanteric bursa is an anatomic element, which is usually divided during the commonly used posterolateral hip approaches in Total Hip Arthroplasty. So far, very little attention has been paid in the role of its preservation in major hip surgical interventions. Some surgeons prefer to simply resect the bursa as they believe that may be responsible for lateral thigh pain. Other surgeons advocate that preservation of the tissue may add a protection layer to the hip joint. The purpose of the study is to compare the clinical results of either resecting or repairing the trochanteric bursa after Total Hip Arthroplasty. Therefore, the tissue will be resected in half of patients and repaired in the other half. The patients will be evaluated in terms of lateral thigh pain and hip mobility. A comparison will be made in each group between the preoperative period and serial time points at the postoperative period. The two groups will be also compared each other.</summary>
