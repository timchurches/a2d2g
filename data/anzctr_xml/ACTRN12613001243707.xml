    <concealment>Patients will be identified and enrolled in the pre-anaesthetic ward. Verbal and written consent will be obtained after a thorough explanation of the trials significance and purpose. Patients will be randomized preoperatively using a computer generated random number generator into one of the four intervention groups, using opaque sealed envelopes. 
The attending anaesthetist, patients, recovery nurses, staff collecting the data and investigators will be blinded to the group assignment until all of the data has been collected. This will be done by the annotation of “study drug” in the patient anaesthetic record. If clinical problems arise, the drug can be re-identified by comparison with the patients study number.
The drugs will be provided in syringes labelled "study drug". Study drugs will be administered post induction of anaesthesia by a 30-minute infusion of either ibuprofen or placebo, and a stat push of parecoxib or placebo. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 252 with 63 patients per group achieves 84% power at alpha level 0.05 to detect a reduction in pain scores of 2 between treatment groups based on a standard deviation of 2.06 from a similar surgical population (PAINFREE study figures). To allow for withdrawals, the sample size per group will be increased to 70 for a total sample size of 280.
Six pairwise comparisons will be made: Placebo vs. Ibuprofen, Placebo vs. Parecoxib 40mg, Placebo vs. Parecoxib 80mg, Ibuprofen vs. Parecoxib 40mg, Ibuprofen vs. Parecoxib 80mg, Parecoxib 40mg vs. Parecoxib 80mg. An intention to treat analysis will be performed. Descriptive statistics will be median, interquartile range (IQR) and range or mean (standard deviation [SD]) as appropriate. Categorical outcomes will be summarized using frequency distributions. The Chi-square test or Fisher exact test will be used for comparisons of categorical outcomes between groups. Comparison of continuous outcomes between groups will be based on Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance assuming lack of normality. Duration until first analgesic rescue will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities and log-rank test for group comparisons. P-values of &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will compare three intravenous anti-inflammatory regimens against placebo in women undergoing hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) as a day case surgery. It will compare the effectiveness of pain relief immediately post surgery and during the subsequent 24 hours. It will also compare the incidence and severity of side effects of pain relieving drugs including nausea and itch, and overall quality of recovery from surgery using a well validated questionnaire.</summary>
