1. Sample Size
We anticipate enrolling 30 patients over 4 years. The primary endpoint is CTL safety, and sample size was considered on the basis of the following safety projections. Mortality at 3 months is anticipated to be approximately 10%, and the composite of mortality, graft failure or acute grade 3-4 graft versus host disease, is anticipated to be approximately 25% at 3 months. Based on these projections, 95% confidence intervals were calculated, and estimates of power were provided relating to probability of exceeding thresholds for mortality and composite event rates for sample sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40. A sample size of 30 was felt to offer the best balance of ability to recruit in a timely manner, with reasonable power to assess safety particulary considering mortality and composite mortality/graft failure/GVHD endpoints. The study is highly powered (&gt;80%) to detect a mortality rate greater than 40%, and composite end points at a rate of greater than 50%, and moderately powered (&gt;60%) to detect a mortality rate greater than 30%. Stopping guidelines are in place in the event that the mortality exceeds 10% or the composite endpoint exceeds 25-30%
2. Analysis of feasibility of generation of CTLS
Feasibility of generation of specific CTLs will be determined by analysing the success of cell generation according to pre-established quality control guidelines. All consenting donors will be included on an intention to treat analysis irrespective of subsequent events including virus specific cell infusion.
3. Analysis of feasibility of cell infusion
Patients consenting to participation in the study may become ineligible on the basis of subsequent development of exclusion criteria, voluntary withdrawal, unavailability of a matched virus-specific CTL product or death. To determine what percentage of patients who initially consenting to participation receive treatment as planned, an intention to treat analysis of consenting patients will be performed. Reasons for failure to receive virus specific CTL will be documented on CRFs.
4. Statistical analysis of data
We will illustrate viral reactivation and infection rates by plotting Kaplan-Meier virus-free survival curves. A Cox proportional hazards model will be adjusted for co-variates. Peak viral load measurements post infusion will be graphed and compared with peak viral loads in control patients not receiving cell therapy. For parameters of virus specific immune reconstitution we will plot individual patient profiles and use mixed effects models to model any pattern over time and to examine the effects of other covariates such as drug administration. Use of anti-viral pharmacological agents will be tabulated and presented as type, dose and duration of required therapy. Infusion toxicities will be tabulated and presented according to severity and duration. Graft versus host disease incidence will be tabulated according to most severe grade of acute GVHD and site. For chronic GVHD, the extent of disease (limited or extensive) and sites of involvement will be tabulated. Rates and sites of GVHD will be compared with a historical group of identically treated patients.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To assess the safety and efficacy of providing partially HLA matched, third party donor-derived, EBV/CMV/adenovirus-specific cytotoxic t-cells, to allogeneic stem cell/marrow transplant patients who have developed post-transplant viral infections unresponsive to standard therapy. It is hypothesised that virus-specific t-cells infusions will improve or restore the virus-specific immunity of the transplant patient in a safe manner without precipitating graft versus host disease.  </summary>
