    <studytitle>Effect of Gum-chewing on Postoperative Recovery of Gut Functions: A Randomised Controlled Clinical Trial</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In adults following surgery involving gastric or bowel resection, with or without primary anastomosis, does the addition of regular gum-chewing in the immediate postoperative period compared to standard postoperative care alone reduce recovery time and length of hospital stay?</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Commercially available sugar-free chewing gum in peppermint flavour.  One piece is administered four times a day and the participants in the treatment arm are asked to chew the gum for 15minutes each time.  Treatment is commenced as soon as practicable following the surgery (usually on admission to ward) and continue until post-operative day 14 or discharge, whichever occurs earlier.</interventions>
    <comparator>standard postoperative care which includes being kept nil by mouth on the day of the operation and high protein-high energy fluids are commenced on postoperative day 1.  High-protein-high-energy fluid is continued until post-operative day 2 and if tolerated, solids are commenced on day 3.  Postoperative analgesia are determined by patient needs and may include parenteral or enteral narcotics if required.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially suitable patients are identified from the hospital's elective operation list 3-4 days prior to the planned operation.  Patients are invited to participate in the study on the day of their operation at the time of admission.  Medical records review and physical examination of the patients are performed to ensure patient meet the eligibility criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  Patient information is given and informed consent is obtained.  Once the patient has consented, the trial secretary is contacted to obtain the randomisation sequence and the patient is allocated into the arms of the study accordingly.  The randomisation sequence is stored in the locked office of one of the main investigators who is not involved in the process of subject recruitment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Study subjects are stratified into 3 groups of equal sizes and a computer generated sequence of random numbers are produced.  The overall balance between treatment and control within each stratum is checked for approximately even distribution.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Postoperative impairment of gut function following gastrointestinal surgery is a major cause of delay in resumption of normal oral intake and discharge from hospital.  Gum-chewing as a form of sham-feeding (the act of chewing without swallowing) is thought to have a stimulatory effect on the normal reflexes associated with bowel movement.  The purpose of this study is to examine whether this simple and cost-efficient treatment helps to improve recovery time following surgery to the gastrointestinal tract.</summary>
