  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To decrease the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. A Pretest screening will be done by a qualified professional on the CAPS (PTSD test); Alcohol survey; Mini-Plus (Co-morbid conditions with PTSD tested) and Qol-Bref tests (Quality of Life Survey).  Results will be recorded and this should show a decrease in symptoms of PTSD, depression and alcohol abuse.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During the course a self-administered PCL-M (PTSD checklist) will be done every days and a self administered CES-D test (depression test) at the beginning and the end of the course.  An alcohol log will also be kept by each participant. The intervention will be performed for the next six weeks once a week and a PCL-M (PTSD check list) and a CES-D (Depression scale) self administered will be done.  After the six weeks a qualified professional will re-administer the pre-screening tests.</timepoint>
