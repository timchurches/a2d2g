  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>ReCharge is a food supplement which contains two milk bioactive components, milk fat and lactoferrin. The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of ReCharge in preventing chemotherapy induced diarrhoea (CID). To find out if ReCharge works this study compares ReCharge ice cream (the study product) with an inactive ice cream product (called a placebo). The inactive ice cream looks and tastes just like the ReCharge icecream. Participants will be allocated to one of these two products with equal chances of each product being the one received. Neither the participants nor doctors will know which product participants will be receiving. During the study participants will complete a daily gastrointestinal symptom diary and Quality of Life questionnaire and dietary habits questionnaire at study visits.</summary>
