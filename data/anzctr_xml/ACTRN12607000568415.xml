  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clomiphene citrate (CC) is traditionally given from the 3rd-5th day of the cycle for five days as an ovulation induction drug. The mechanism of CC in stimulating ovulation is unknown but is believed to be related to its anti-oestrogenic properties. As a feed back mechanism, it stimulates the secretion of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). When serum estradiol reaches a certain level, an leutinizing hormone (LH) surge is released. Of the cycles stimulated by CC and or human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), an endogenous LH surge was observed in more than 15% of the patients shortly prior to the HCG injection. In animal experimental studies, CC prevented the positive effects of estradiol required to induce an LH surge.
In a recent pilot study by Branigan &amp; Estes 2006, CC was able to suppress LH surge in human IVF. The hypothesis behind this study is that if CC is given after hMG, the anti-oestrogenic effect will suppress LH surge.</summary>
