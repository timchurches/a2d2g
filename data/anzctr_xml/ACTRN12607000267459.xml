  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eligible subjects will receive either 0.95% NEO101, which will be administered twice daily by topical application to the inside of each nostril, for a 7-day treatment course.  A 14-day safety and efficacy assessment period will follow the treatment period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and local tolerability of twice-daily topical nasal application of NEO101 in adult subjects with stable nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and local tolerability will be assessed during the 7-day treatment course and through the 14-day follow-up period.  Assessments will be made on a daily basis.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) to make a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of twice-daily topical nasal application of NEO101 in the reduction or eradication of nasal carriage of S. aureus;</outcome>
      <timepoint>These evaluations will be based on quantitative microbiologic determinations of S. aureus before, during and after treatment.  Cultures for S. aureus will be performed during screening and on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15 and 22.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) to make a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of NEO101 in the reduction or eradication of specific strains of S. aureus, including methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strains.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These evaluations will be based on quantitative microbiologic determinations of S. aureus before, during and after treatment.  Cultures for S. aureus will be performed during screening and on Days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15 and 22.</timepoint>
