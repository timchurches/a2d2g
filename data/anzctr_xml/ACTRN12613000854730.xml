  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves 10 weekly (half-hour) programmes broadcast over the radio as we have 10 topics to get through. There will be one new program a week with a repeat later that same week as well as a podcast of the program available if participants have missed the program. The weekly programs are: 1. Preparing to quit; 2. Advice on stop smoking treatments (e.g. NRT patches, gum, lozenges; mouthspray, Champix, National Quitline, E-cigarettes)  ; 3. Provide information of withdrawal symptoms; 4.   How to cope after quitting; 5. Explain Carbon monoxide monitoring; 6. Talkback session; 7. Strengthen ex-smoker identity; 8. Talkback 9. Talkback; 10. Talkback

Participants in the intervention group will have a Workbook where they will record whether they have listened to the programs.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group of smokers will not be required to do anything. Some of them are likely to quit smoking "cold turkey" and this unassisted quit rate will be our control quit rate to compare with the intervention rate.</comparator>
