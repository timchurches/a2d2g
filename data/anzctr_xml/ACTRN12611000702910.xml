  <interventions>
    <interventions>26 exercises from the COGPACK package, a suite of exercises that are largely based upon well-established neuropsychological tests and principles. Multiple exercises will be used to target the one generic cognitive domain and exercises will include both verbal and visual modalities. Training will be administered in three 1-hour sessions every week for a total period of 12 weeks (i.e. a total of 36 hours), supervised by a member of the research team.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Research suggests Brain Training may be effective for improving the brains ability to store and process information, and imaging studies suggest Brain Training may also lead to positive changes to brain structure and function .
However, most of the research to date has simply measured effects by comparing data before and after a period of Brain Training. The effects of Brain Training during the training period has yet to be properly examined. We would therefore like to answer three main questions:
1. What is the minimum duration of Brain Training required to produce cognitive benefits?
2. By what rate do any positive cognitive effects decay after the cessation of Brain Training?
3. How do different brain changes (as revealed by brain imaging) develop over time?</summary>
