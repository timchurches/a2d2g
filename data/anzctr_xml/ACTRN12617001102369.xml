  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Clarity Autoscan ultrasound system allows radiation therapists to track the position of the prostate in real time by the application of an ultrasound probe against the perineum during treatment delivery daily. An alert is generated if the prostate moves beyond a pre-specified parameter, allowing the radiation therapist to suspend treatment and take
corrective action to ensure accuracy is maintained. The Clarity Autoscan system is non-invasive and does not utilise any additional radiation. In this study, all patients (both control and intervention groups) will have fiducial markers inserted as per standard practice, in addition to the Clarity Autoscan monitoring. 

In the radiation therapy treatment of the prostate with Clarity Autoscan, the margin around the prostate for treatment delivery will be reduced to 5mm (with 3mm in the posterior). The prostate shall be monitored for any motion using ultrasound by qualified radiation therapists during treatment delivery, and if it moves greater than the defined margin (i.e. 5mm, with 3mm in the posterior), the treatment will be paused and the patient position corrected for. This will occur for all daily treatments (up to 39). </interventions>
    <comparator>All patients (control and intervention) will have both fiducial markers inserted and Clarity Autoscan for radiation therapy treatment. The control group will be treated with a margin around the prostate of 10mm (with 7mm in the posterior). The prostate shall be monitored for any motion using ultrasound by qualified radiation therapists during treatment delivery, and if it moves greater than the defined margin (i.e. 10mm, with 7mm in the posterior), the treatment will be paused and the patient position corrected for. This will occur for all daily treatments (up to 39). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of side effects during radiation therapy treatment and at follow up after radiation therapy treatment completion. This will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) gradings. Side effects (such as urinary incontinence/retention, nocturia, proctitis, diarrheoa) will be assessed through patient interview, physical examination and medical/pathology tests as required. This will be completed by the radiation oncologist or registrar at weekly treatment review appointments and follow up appointments, and entered into MOSAIQ oncology information system.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline; every 2 weeks while on treatment (8-9 weeks total); post radiation therapy treatment follow up at 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, and annually up to 5-years. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the cost effectiveness of reduced margins against standard margins, with comparison to other existing intrafraction technologies. This will be assessed through a  Health utilisation questionnaire completed by the patient, and hospital chart records to ascertain costs. This questionnaire has been designed by the investigators specifically for this study. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>At one year follow up (after completion of radiation therapy treatment). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore the patient acceptance of Clarity (with respect to pain/invasiveness). This will be assessed through a "Procedures Experience" questionnaire, where patients rate various aspects of both procedures (such as pain, discomfort, embarrassment) on a likert scale. Additionally, patients will be invited to participate in a qualitative semi-structured interview. This questionnaire has been designed by the investigators specifically for this study. 	</outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 week of treatment commencement</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To explore patient preference for prostate motion monitoring  a once-off surgically
invasive insertion procedure, or a daily non-invasive but potentially personally invasive
procedure for 39 treatments. This will be assessed through responses and themes emerging from the qualitative semi-structured interviews. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Within 1 week of treatment commencement. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Extrapolation from similar research where interventions have increased accuracy and/or reduced rectal dose indicates that a reduction in toxicity greater than or equal to 2 of 20% in the intervention group relative to the control group is realistic 1618. With 90%CI and alpha = 0.05, a total of 260 participants will be required to demonstrate this reduction in toxicity of 20% in the intervention group relative to the control group (Altman 1991). The sample size for this study will be calculated again after the completion of the first 20 patients treatment because of the lack of prior data on which to calculate size. This will allow for the collation of acute toxicity data, which will more accurately inform the sample size. It will again be revisited at 50 patients to ensure appropriateness, with power calculated based on the 50 patients data.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, clinical outcomes, patient preferences and economic benefits of reduced margins for radiation therapy for prostate cancer, with the use of the Clarity Autoscan ultrasound system.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 50 or over and have been diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which you are scheduled to commence radiation therapy treatment.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either a reduced margin around the prostate during radiation therapy of 3-5mm, or to receive the standard margin of 7-10mm. All patients, regardless of allocation will have fiducial markers inserted prior to commencement of treatment, and will have the Clarity Autoscan ultrasound monitoring prostate motion throughout treatment, increasing the accuracy of treatment. The allocated treatment protocol will continue for all radiation therapy treatment sessions (up to 39).

Researchers will ask participants for their preference regarding monitoring during radiotherapy, and the acceptability of the Clarity Autoscan system. Participants will also be followed up for up to five years post treatment to assess side effects and for one year to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the motion monitoring.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial can be used to inform a health technology assessment reviewing the safety, efficacy and cost-efficacy of reduced margins during radiotherapy for prostate cancer using the Clarity Autoscan system.</summary>
