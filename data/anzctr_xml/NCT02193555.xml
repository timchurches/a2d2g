    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Etafilcon A, Senofilcon A

Other: Non-presbyopic group - Non-presbyopic group: age ranging from 7 to 39 years
At each scheduled lens fitting visit, subjects will be allocated one pair of CLs to correct their refractive error. One pair of control (Acuvue 1- Day Moist, etafilcon A) or prototype (Iteration X, etafilcon A) CLs will be allocated for each lens fitting/assessment visit. Lenses will be worn for approximately 1 hour per visit.
For each fitting visit, lenses will be fitted bilaterally.

Other: Presbyopic group - Presbyopic group: age 40 and above
At each scheduled lens fitting visit, subjects will be allocated one pair of CLs to correct their refractive error. One pair of control (Acuvue Oasys for Presbyopia, senofilcon A) or prototype (Iteration X, etafilcon A) CLs will be allocated for each lens fitting/assessment visit. Lenses will be worn for approximately 1 hour per visit.
For each fitting visit, lenses will be fitted bilaterally.


Treatment: devices: Etafilcon A, Senofilcon A
1 pair of either test or control lenses will be fitted on the subject for up to 1 hour of lens wear per visit (total of 2 fitting visits).

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by
             signing a record of informed consent.

          -  Be at least 7 years old, male or female.

          -  Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by
             the Investigator.

          -  Have ocular health findings considered to be "normal" and which would not prevent the
             participant from safely wearing contact lenses.

          -  Correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better with both eyes with contact lenses.

          -  Be suitable and willing to wear contact lenses.</inclusivecriteria>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Both males and females</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>Yes</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>-  Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including infection or
             disease) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact lens
             fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses.

          -  Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves'
             disease, and auto immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis,
             Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic
             hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants.

          -  Use of or a need for concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment
             and/or during the clinical trial.

          -  Use of or a need for any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter
             normal ocular findings / are known to affect a participant's ocular health /
             physiology or contact lens performance either in an adverse or beneficial manner at
             enrolment and/or during the clinical trial.

          -  Eye surgery within 12 weeks immediately prior to enrolment for this trial.

        NB: Systemic antihistamines are allowed on an "as needed basis", provided they are not used
        prophylactically during the trial and at least 24 hours before the clinical trial product
        is used.</exclusivecriteria>
