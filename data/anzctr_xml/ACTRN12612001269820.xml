    <inclusivecriteria>All children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, born in Victoria between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2005; and in Queensland between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2009.
We define cerebral palsy a a group of permanent disorders of movement and posture that attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. The characteristic signs are spasticity, movement disorders, muscle weakness, ataxia and rigidity.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This prospective, population based longitudinal study of children, with cerebral palsy, aged 18 months to 5 years will track early motor development and will utilise magnetic resonance imaging to determine the anatomical pattern and likely aetiology and timing of the brain lesion.  This will help predict the likely need for, type and timing of interventions(spasticity management, rehabilitation, orthopaedic surgery) and their associated costs, this study will enable more informed resource planning for cerebral palsy in young children for the future.</summary>
