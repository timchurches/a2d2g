  <interventions>
    <interventions>Recruited participants will randomly be assigned to either receive the study drugs of Meropenem or Piperacillin-Tazobactam in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomisation list prepared in advance. The intervention treatment for this study is the administration of the drug Piperacillin-Tazobactam 4.5 grams administered every 6 hours intravenously over a 30 minute period. The duration of treatment with this drug will be for a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 14 days. The duration of the therapy will be determined by the treating clinician.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment for this study is the administration of the drug Meropenem 1 gram to be administered every 8 hours intravenously over a 30 minute period. The duration of treatment with this drug will be for a minimun of 4 days and a maximum of 14 days. The duration of the therapy will be determined by the treating clinician. </comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria will be approached by the study team and given clear concise information about the trial in the form of verbal communication and a patient information form. Once the subject or their ethics committee approved proxy give written informed consent, they will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drugs of meropenem or piperacillin-tazobactam. Patients will be randomly assigned to either Meropeneum or Pipercillin-Tazobactam in a 1:1 ratio according to the randomisation list prepared in advance.</concealment>
    <sequence>Recruited subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam in a 1:1 ratio according to a randomisation list prepared in advance (the radomisation list will be centrally radomised by a computer). Random sequence will be generated using random permuted blocks of unequal length. Four strata will be used. Subjects will be stratified according to the bacterial genus identified in the blood culture and the likelihood of death, as defined by the following high-risk features-any of: a) likely source of infection other than urinary or biliary tract, b) Pitt score greater than 4, c) presentation with severe sepsis or shock. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella are bacteria which are common causes of infections in your blood stream. Patients with bloodstream infections due to either E. coli or Klebsiella, can commonly be treated with antibiotics called third generation cephalosporins, such as the antibiotic ceftriaxone. When the blood stream infection is resistant to these antibiotics, the antibiotics meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam have been shown to be effective alternatives for treatment.
The purpose of this study is to work out whether these two other antibiotics, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam, are equally effective in the treatment of these antibiotic resistant bloodstream infections. These antibiotics have never been compared head to head in order to establish the best available treatment for these serious infections. This research project has been designed to make sure the researchers interpret the results in a fair and appropriate way and avoids study doctors or participants jumping to conclusions.
