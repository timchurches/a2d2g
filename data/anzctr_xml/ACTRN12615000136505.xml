  <interventions>
    <interventions>Thirty minute Swedish Massage therapy. once a week for five consecutive weeks. The same qualified, experienced massage therapist worked with each subject for 5 weeks. Massage was applied while subject was seated. The same protocol of Swedish Massage was applied to back, neck and arms for each of the 5 sessions per subject. All massage therapists were female.</interventions>
    <comparator>20 randomly assigned people with spinal cord injury received Guided Imagery (GI). GI was an active placebo and was conducted for 30 minutes once a week for 5 consecutive weeks. GI consisted of the same script read out by same experimenter for each session for each subject. GI started with instructions for deep diaphragmatic breathing, then talked through each of the 5 senses while subject visualised being in their favourite, relaxing place. Finished with deep breathing and then instructed to gently return to here and now.</comparator>

Consent forms were sent</concealment>
    <sequence>Once signed Consent forms were received, subjects were assigned a code to de-identify individuals. A piece of paper was randomly taken from a bag that had either C for Control or I for Intervention. Subjects were assigned to that group with their code</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Repeated measure ANOVA to determine differences between groups as a function over time and interaction effects between intervention and time. A Fisher LSD post hoc test was conducted where significant differences between groups and/or over time and /or interactions were found. Twenty subjects in each group provided statistical power of 50%  and allowed a moderate effect size. Sample size was limited by availability of people with SCI with inclusion criteria and able to participate. </statisticalmethods>
