  <interventions>
    <interventions>ENCHANTED is a package of 2 linked randomised controlled trials, arms [A] and [B]. Patients will be included in arm [A] only, arm [B] only, or both arms [A] and [B], based on their eligibility and attending clinicians level of uncertainty as to the balance of benefits and risks of the investigative treatments in an individual patient. 
Patients included in arm [A] will be randomised to receive low-dose 0.6 mg/kg (15% bolus and 85% infusion over 60 minutes) or standard-dose 0.9 mg/kg (10% bolus and 90% infusion over 60 minutes) i.v. rtPA (Actylise). 
Patients included in arm [B] will be randomised to receive intensive BP lowering to a target systolic BP range 130-140 mmHg within one hour and to maintain this level for at least 72 hours (or until hospital discharge or death if this should occur earlier) or guideline-based BP lowering to a target systolic BP of &lt;180 mmHg post-rtPA. Standardised locally approved i.v. BP lowering agents such as clevidipine, labetolol hydrochloride, metoprolol tartrate, hydralazine hydrochloride, glyceral trinitrate and phentoloamine are to be used. 
Patients included only in arm [B] are eligible if they receive non-study i.v. rtPA (Actylise) as usual care. </interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients with clinical diagnosis of acute ischaemic stroke confirmed by brain imaging within 4.5 hours of onset who fulfill local criteria for use of i.v. rtPA are potentially eligible if they have a sustained systolic BP level of 185 mmHg or below. 
The attending clinician is required to sequentially consider their level of clinical uncertainty over the balance of potential benefits and risks pertaining to the appropriate dose of rtPA and the level of BP control in each particular patient, as outlined below. 
Arm [A]: no definite indication/contraindication for either dose of rtPA; and able to pay for a 50mg vial of rtPA if in a fee-paying health system.
Arm [B]: will or has received thrombolysis treatment with rtPA, either randomised dose within the trial or physician decided dose rtPA outside of the trial; sustained elevated systolic BP level, defined as 2 readings 150 mmHg; able to commence intensive BP lowering treatment within 6 hours of stroke onset; able to receive either immediate intensive BP lowering or conservative BP management</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Unlikely to potentially benefit from the therapy (e.g. advanced dementia), or a very high likelihood of death within 24 hours of stroke onset; other medical illness that interferes with outcome assessments and follow-up [known significant pre-stroke disability (mRS scores 2-5)]; specific contraindications to rtPA (Actilyse) or any of the blood pressure agents to be used; participation in another clinical trial involving evaluation of pharmacological agents; need for following concomitant medication, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Patients are randomised via a central internet-based system developed by The George Institute, Sydney, Australia, either direct or via a specially developed IVRS (only in China).
Most patients will be eligible for arm [A] as the overall inclusion criteria is eligibility for rtPA, but only a proportion (~60%) of patients with acute ischaemic stroke are anticipated to have elevated BP and thus eligible for arm [B].  Investigators have the choice of randomising patients into 1 or 2 treatment arms.</concealment>
    <sequence>Assignment to a treatment group is determined by a computerised algorithm which runs on the central database and uses the minimisation method.  The stratification factors are country, site, time from onset (&lt;3 vs 3 hours or longer) and NIHSS (&lt;10 vs 10 or more).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> ENCHANTED is an independent, investigator initiated, international collaborative, quasi-factorial randomised controlled trial involving a package of 2 linked comparative randomised treatment arms, which aims to address 4 key questions in patients eligible for thrombolysis in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. (1) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) provide equivalent benefits compared to standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) rtPA? (2) Does intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering (130-140 mmHg systolic target) improve outcomes compared to the current guideline recommended level of BP control (180 mmHg systolic target)? (3) Does low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) intravenous (i.v.) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) reduce the risk of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH)? (4) Does the addition of intensive BP lowering to thrombolysis with rtPA reduce the risk of any intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)? </summary>
