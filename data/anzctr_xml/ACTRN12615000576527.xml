  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention(s) will be made, but we will take tumour tissue sample from participants either by biopsy, or use archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from previous surgery, in addition to a blood sample.  A single sample of each blood and tumour will be taken at the time of consent.  We will perform a comprehensive genetic screen with a next-generation sequencing panel to help us identify changes in the genes and proteins within the cancer. Initially, our work will focus on getting a better understanding of the specific types of changes in ovarian cancer. Over time we hope to use that information to design and implement better treatments for women with ovarian cancer.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to identify changes in the genes and proteins within the ovarian cancer tissues. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above presenting at Royal Women's Hospital or the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (including peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers), regardless of histological subtype. Study details: All participants in this study will be required to undergo a biopsy procedure on a single occasion to obtain a tumour tissue sample, or have archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour tissue retrieved from pathology laboratory archives.  A blood sample will also be drawn. The samples will then be analysed using a next generation sequencing panel targeted to ovarian cancer. Initially, our work will focus on getting a better understanding of the specific types of changes in ovarian cancer. Over time we hope to use that information to design and implement better treatments for women with ovarian cancer. No treatments will be administered as part of this study. This study was designed to enable women with advanced ovarian cancer to be rapidly selected for clinical trials of targeted therapies.</summary>
