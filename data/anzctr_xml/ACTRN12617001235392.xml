    <interventions>Prostate Artery Embolization. This procedure is performed as a day case in Interventional Radiology under conscious sedation using fluoroscopy. A very small urinary catheter is placed into the bladder and filled with contrast medium. The prostate artery is accessed using the Seldinger technique into CFA. Guidewires and catheters are introduced through the sheath and Embozene microspheres are injected into the left and right side of the prostate artery. The procedure takes approximately one hour and is performed by a specialist Interventional Radiologist. The catheter is removed 4 hours post procedure and the patient is discharged home</interventions>
    <comparator>TURP group. This is the gold standard treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia. It involves pre admission checks, ECG and anaesthetic assessment, bloods for CBC, renal, LFT and group and hold. The patient has TURP under either general or spinal anaesthetic and the procedure can take 1 -3 hours. There is significant post operative discomfort. Usually the patient has a 3-4 day hospital stay with a large urinary catheter, bladder irrigations. Patients can be discharged without or with a catheter in situ if unsuccessful trial of void immediately post op</comparator>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>numbers of patients recruited are based on a power calculation. For the primary endpoint, changes in IPSS at 3 months will be compared using a one sided t-test with significance level 2.5%. A non-inferiority margin has been set aside at -3. The targeted standard deviation was estimated at 3.5. If there is truly no difference between the TURP and PAE in terms of the improvement in IPSS score, the 44 patients (22 in each arm) are required to be 80% sure that the lower limit of a one sided 97.5%  confidence interval (or equivalency a 95% two-sided interval) will be above the non-inferiority limit of -3. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous embolization of the prostate arteries as a minimally invasive image guided procedure for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostate hyperplasia with a prostate volume of more than 40g. Benign prostate hyperplasia is a significant health problem in New Zealand affecting over 50% of men older than 60 years. This leads to lower urinary symptoms (LUTS) eg weak urine stream, urgency and leaking and even acute urinary retention. Symptoms are initially treated with medication but many patient do need surgical intervention. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the standard treatment for prostates smaller than 80g whereas larger prostates may require open surgical resection. Both operations are not without risk and many elderly patients are not good candidates for surgery. Percutaneous embolization of bilateral prostate arteries aims to mimic the effect of TURP or open resection of the prostate without exposing the patients to the risk of operation and anaesthesia. PAE decrease the blood supply to the prostate gland and causes the gland to shrink. This trial aims to assess the safety and efficacy of PAE and in the future offer patients another treatment option for BPH</summary>
