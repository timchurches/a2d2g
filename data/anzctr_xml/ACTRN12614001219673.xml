Patients will have standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Patients participating in this study will have a multiparametric MRI at the following four time points:
1. Prior to chemoradiotherapy
2. During the second week of treatment
3. During the fourth week of treatment 
4. At 6-8 weeks post treatment

A Multiparametric MRI incorporates standard morphological as well as diffusion weighted and dynamic contrast enhanced sequences. Each MRI takes approximately 45 minutes. All sequences will be performed on all patients at each of the 4 time points. 

Observation post treatment is for 6 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This observational study aims to explore the use of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (dCE-MRI) in predicting treatment outcome in patients with anal cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) managed with definitive chemoradiotherapy with concurrent Mitomycin-C and 5-FU.

Study details
All participants will continue their standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy as planned. Patients participating in this study will have multiparametric MRI's performed at the following four time points: 1) prior to chemoradiotherapy, 2) during the second week of treatment, 3) during the fourth week of treatment, 4) at 6-8 weeks post treatment. Each scan involves the use of an injected contrast agent and is of approximately 45 minutes length. Participants will be followed-up for 6 months to determine treatment outcomes. Correlations between the different types of MRIs and tumour response will determine whether DW-MRI and dCE-MRI can predict tumour response and treatment outcome.</summary>
