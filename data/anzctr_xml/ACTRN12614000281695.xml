  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the Acu-TENS group will get be educated on breathing techniques in management of dyspnoea prior to their discharge.And besides this,they will have two small electrodes placed on the skin on two acupoints (called Ding Chuan) on either side of the spine at the base of the neck (spinal level C7). The points will be identified by an experienced research assistant who is trained in traditional Chinese medicine as well as western medicine, specialized in management of respiratory conditions.  The skin over the acupoints will be cleaned with an alcohol swab. TENS electrodes (3M Registered Trademark) will be pressed against the skin at the acupoints. The electrodes wires will then be attached to a TENS unit (ITO320) and a pre-set stimulation protocol (Burst Modulation,Frequency 2Hz,Pulse duration 200 microsec)will be activated. Participants having Acu-TENS should expect to feel a strong but comfortable tingling sensation at the site of the electrodes; it must not be painful. The duration of the stimulation will be 45 minutes in a relaxed sitting position only once. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants who are randomized to the control group (no Acu-TENS) will be asked to sit in a relaxed position for 45minutes </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduce symptoms of breathlessness in people with COPD presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of the Gold Coast University Hospital (GCUH) 
Baseline heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) - continuously recorded by a pulse oximeter. 
Respiratory rate (RR) will be recorded by observation.
Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) will be recorded using a Wright peak flow meter</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 45 minutes when Acu-TENS treatment has been completed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reduce the need for hospital admission
The physician in charge will examine the patient at the end of the 45 minutes. Discharge destination (ward, home) from AED will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 45 minutes when Acu-TENS treatment has been completed</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The levels of Beta-endorphin and interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)analysis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate if Acu-TENS is able to reduce symptoms of breathlessness in people with COPD presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) of the Gold Coast University Hospital (GCUH) and if it is enough to reduce the need for hospital admission. We will also try to clarify the brain and nerve system (neurochemical) pathways whereby Acu-TENS relieves breathlessness - this will be assessed by blood samples. </summary>
