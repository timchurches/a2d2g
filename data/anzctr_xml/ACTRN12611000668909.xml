  <interventions>
    <interventions>micro-needling is a procedure used to stimulate collagen synthesis. It consists of a handheld device with protruding fine needles which pentrate the skin inducing regeneration. Selected wounds will have the microneedling device. This occurs once during the study at baseline. Similar symmetrical wounds will be chosen. One of the pair will be randomised to have the active treatment (microneedling), the other will have the placebo (microneedling device without needles). This will occur at baseline and then both wounds will be measured to determine which heals faster. This is not a cross-over trial.</interventions>

    <concealment>Patients with a diagnosis of RDEB-HS will be recruited for the study. This study will be offered to patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. For each enrolled patient, two to eight symmetric wounds on each side of the body (arms, chest/abdomen, legs) of approximately the same size (at least 4 cm2 as measured accurately by the Visitrak wound measurement system [Smith &amp; Nephew Healthcare Ltd., Hull], difference should not be more than 15%) will be identified by a study dermatologist. These symmetrical wounds will be randomised to either treatment or placebo. 'Allocation is not concealed'</concealment>
