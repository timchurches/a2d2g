    <studytitle>Hyperbaric oxygen for hearing loss and tinnitus</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>For adults with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, with or without tinnitus, and with an onset within the past 14 days, does the application of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, in addition to the standard therapy of oral steriods, result in an improvement in hearing, tinnitus or quality of life?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). Daily sessions Monday to Friday for 2 hours at 2.0 ATA (202.6 kPa) while breathing 100% oxygen. Total number of treatments 15 over three consecutive weeks.
Participants will also take the standard medication (see below) starting on the same day as the first hyperbric oxygen session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Prednisone orally, 50 mg daily for ten days and then tailing off by 5 mg per day until no further dose. Total 21 day course.
Participants will recieve a sham hyperbaric exposure involving 15 sessions on the same schedule as the HBOT group, but breathing air. These participants will be compressed to approximately 1.3 atmospheres at the start of each sham session to simulate the 'real' treatment. They will then be slowly returned to 1 ATA for the majority of the session time. The compression to 1.3 atmospheres will then be repeated at the end to simulate decompression.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All adult patients (&gt;18 yrs) presenting with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL), with or without tinnitus and where the first hyperbaric session can be administered within 14 days of the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis will exclude other causes of sudden hearing loss historically (e.g. Menieurs disease, barotrauma, noise-induced hearing loss, ototoxic drugs) and by a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the affected side to exclude an acoustic neuroma or other tumour.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Patient refusal (HBOT will not be offered to those who refuse to participate), 
Contraindications to HBOT including inability to equalise the middle ear or respiratory sinuses, claustrophobia, pneumothorax, previous bleomycin administration or severe respiratory disease with carbon dioxide retention, presence of hearing decrement (documented) for greater than two weeks.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation will be the responsibility of a single central research officer not otherwise involved in the trial or in treatment of patients in any of the participating centres.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation officer will use a random number generating program provided at the ‘research randomiser’ site (http://www.randomizer.org/). We will ensure approximately equal numbers of participants in each treatment group at each participating centre by using a separate randomisation schedule at each centre and permuted blocks. There will be three separate randomisations schedules for mild hearing loss (&gt;10 to 30dB hearing loss at any frequency on pure tone audiometry), moderate hearing loss (&gt;30 to 90dB) and severe hearing loss (&gt;90dB) in order to examine the effect of HBOT at different levels of severity.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we aim to show whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is beneficial for patients with sudden onset of hearing loss (with or without a ringing in the ears) where no cause can be found for the hearing loss.</summary>
