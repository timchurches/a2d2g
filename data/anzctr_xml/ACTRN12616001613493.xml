  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who have had an allograft will be eligible for this trial.  Minimal residual disease (MRD), performed by flow cytometry will be assessed at 1 month pre-allograft and 1, 3 and 6 months post-allograft. MRD is residual leukaemia that is undetectable by conventional microscopy.  Our current gold-standard for identifying disease is based on microscopy. However, several studies have demonstrated the presence of MRD by immunological methods using a flow cytometer is predictive of relapse and overall survival. Flow cytometry (FCM) is a test where protein expression is tested on or within leukaemic cells.  
The primary endpoint is to compare, in a prospective setting, the time to morphological relapse (TTMR) between patients who are MRD+ at that time point, and those who are MRD- at that time point. The cut-off values for MRD positivity is 0.1% ie. our detection sensitivity threshold is validated to 1 in 10 000 white blood cell events.  Follow-up is for 12 months.  

MRD testing will require a bone marrow biopsy sample.  The bone marrow biopsy and MRD testing is a procedure performed routinely, irrespective of clinical trial participation.  MRD testing by flow cytometry will be performed in accordance with standard procedures by the treating hospital and additionally by the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre for the sole purpose of assessing inter-observer variability.  Only the results performed by the treating hospital will be made available to the treating physician/patient in accordance with standard of care.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>It is planned to enter 120 patients (20 patients per centre per year, with 3 centres - Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre,, the Alfred Hospital and Westmead Hospital) in this trial. Accrual is expected to be completed in 24 months. This initial accrual number predicts 100 pts available for 12 month follow-up.  The predicted accrual number is based on the number of transplants performed for each centre in previous years.  The following power calculation, based on the primary objective, assumes the following parameter values for the trial. 
* a 2 year survival rate of 75% in the MRD- (i.e. 4.8 year median survival) 
* a 2 year survival rate of 45 % in the MRD+ (i.e. 1.7 year median survival)
(which corresponds to a hazard ratio of 2.78 )
* an available sample size of 100 
* a 60:40 (MRD- vs. MRD+) ratio
* a 2 year accrual period
* a 1 year follow-up period after accrual of the last patient
* a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.05
Then assuming a constant hazard within each group the resulting power is 0.86.

Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models will be built to determine the time to morphological relapse and overall survival.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the flow cytometric residual disease (MRD) test can effectively predict relapse in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) who are undergoing an allogenic stem cell transplant (SCT).

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged over 18 years and have been diagnosed with AML for which you are scheduled to undergo SCT.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will have a bone marrow sample taken at 1 month prior to SCT and 1, 3 and 6 months following the SCT. The MRD test will be run on all of these samples.  Only the MRD results from your treating institution will be made available to your treating physician, which may be used to guide relapse-prevention therapy. This is in accordance with current standard of care.  The results of the MRD tests at each timepoint will be compared to the time of any relapses in AML which occur up to 12 months following the SCT.

It is hoped that this study will provide information on whether MRD can effectively predict relapse in AML following SCT, and whether it can help to guide preventative therapy prior to relapse.</summary>
