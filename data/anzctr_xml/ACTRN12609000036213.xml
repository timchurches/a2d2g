  <interventions>
    <interventions>Three methodologies of collecting sexual health data in the form of a diary are being compared - paper based, online, SMS (text message). Each will complete diaries weekly for 3 months (13 weeks).</interventions>
    <comparator>There are 3 different study arms, as described above.</comparator>

    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The number of diaries submitted by participants of the 13 expected (response rate) and completeness of all questions in each diary as determined by whether or not each question was answered.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Participants acceptability and opinions of diary use determined by a questionnaire giving a range of statements about the diaries for example "the diaries were easy to complete" "the diaries were convenient" which can be rated between strongly disagree and strongly agree</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparability and reliability of diary information to endpoint questionnaire. Determined by total number of partners, frequency of sex and frequency of condom use, over the sum of the diary period, correlated (using kendall tau) to the total number of partners, frequency of sex and frequency of condom use reported in the retrospective questionnaire (at the endpoint of the study, i.e. 3 months after baseline)</outcome>
