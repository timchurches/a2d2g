  <interventions>
    <interventions>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult males with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetic subjects; the two groups were age-matched. Within each group, half received GC811007 2400 mg/day taken once daily for the six day treatment period before breakfast, supplied as 300-mg capsules; and half received placebo. After the screening visit, subjects resided at the study site for a 6-day baseline period and a 6-day treatment period, during which all food and beverages were provided and measured to control intake of dietary Cu and other trace metals.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study was designed to explore the effects of GC811007 on trace metal metabolism in patients with T2DM and healthy non-diabetic subjects; specifically we wanted to investigate the effects of GC811007 on trace metal urine and fecal excretion under carefully controlled dietarty conditions in order to calculate trace element balance over a period of 6 days. We hypothesised firstly that baseline urine copper excretion would be raised in T2DM indicative of raised whole-body copper status which is a pro-oxidant status, and secondly that treatment with GC811007 would increase urine and fecal copper losses, and engender a negative copper balance.</summary>
