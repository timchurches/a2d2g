  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition in which a person stops breathing for several
      seconds at a time due to relaxation of the throat muscles. This can occur many times during
      sleep. It is known to cause sleepiness and poor concentration during the day. Research
      indicates that OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease due to its
      association with hypertension, stroke, heart attack and sudden death. The standard therapy
      for symptomatic OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP has been shown to
      effectively reduce snoring, obstructive episodes and daytime sleepiness and to modestly
      reduce blood pressure and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The overall aim of
      SAVE is to determine if CPAP can reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or heart failure for
      people with OSA.</summary>
