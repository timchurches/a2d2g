  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Morning Pre-dose Trough FEV1 at Week 24 - Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 24</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at Week 24</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Morning Pre-dose Trough FEV1 Over 24 Weeks - Change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) over 24 weeks. FEV1 was assessed at multiple time points post-baseline,and a modelbased average of all visits starting from Week 2 through week 24 inclusive was calculated. The change values reported in the table represent the change between the baseline and the average FEV1 post-baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Weeks 2 to 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Score - Change from baseline in the SGRQ total score. The SGRQ is a disease-specific questionnaire, self-completed by participants, used to evaluate the effect of GFF MDI, FF MDI and GP MDI on health-related quality of life as compared to placebo in subjects with COPD. The scores range from 0 (minimum, best possible health status) to 100 (maximum, worst possible health status). The SGRQ contains 76 items grouped into three domains (symptoms, activity and impacts). Change from Baseline at a particular visit was calculated as the SGRQ total score at that visit minus Baseline. Change from Baseline in total score of -4 units or lower is considered as clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rescue Ventolin Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) Use - Change from baseline in average daily rescue Ventolin HFA use</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Onset of Action as Assessed by FEV1 - Defined as the first time-point using the 5- and 15-minute post dose measurements where the difference in FEV1 from Placebo was statistically significant</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed for 5- and 15-minute post dose on Day 1</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peak Change From Baseline in FEV1 Within 2 Hours Post-dose - Peak change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) within 2 hours post-dose</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and at Week 24</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
