    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overview of Treatment-emergent All Causalities Adverse Events (AEs) in Escalation Phase - AE was any untoward medical occurrence with study drug/ device in a trial participant. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in death, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, life-threatening experience, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of study medication. AEs were reported from signing of informed consent until 28 days after the last dose of study medication. SAEs were reported after this time frame if considered to be treatment related. The severity of AEs were graded by the investigator using National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) v.4.02 and was assessed as Grade 0: no change from normal or reference range; Grade 1: mild; Grade 2: moderate; Grade 3: severe; Grade 4: life-threatening or disabling; Grade 5: death related to AE. However the below table included Grade 3, 4, and 5 AEs.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) in Escalation Phase - DLTs were those AEs which occurred in Cycle 1 of treatment in Dose Escalation Phase which may be attributed to study drug [combined Crizotinib (PF-02341066) plus Dacomitinib (PF-00299804)] without a clear alternative explanation and despite the use of adequate/maximal medical intervention as dictated by local institutional clinical practices or the judgment of the investigator. The following events were considered DLTs (using CTCAE version 4.02);1. Grade =4 hematologic events. 2. Grade =3 non-hematological events (except Grade 3/4 asymptomatic hypophosphatemia and Grade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout). Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea had to have persisted at Grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy. Grade 3 hypertension will be considered a DLT only if the event is unmanageable by standard approved pharmacologic agents or if the symptomatic sequelae are identified despite appropriate medical intervention.</outcome>

Participants were considered non-responders until proven otherwise. Thus, participants who: 1) Did not have CR or PR while on study, or 2) Did not have a post-baseline tumor evaluation, or 3) Received anti-tumor treatment other than the study medication prior to reaching a CR or PR, or 4) Died, in progress, or drop out for any reason prior to reaching a CR or PR, were counted as non-responders in the assessment of ORR. To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements in participants with responding tumors were confirmed by repeated tumor assessment that were performed 4 weeks after the criteria for response were first met.</outcome>

      <outcome>Expression Analysis of Tumor Biomarkers (HGF, EGFR, and c-Met ) at Baseline Using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Method - Tumor biomarkers such as HGF, EGFR, and c-Met were analyzed in tumor cells (neoplastic compartment) of tumor specimens from both expansion cohorts 1 and 2 by IHC. The H score was derived by summing the percentages of cells staining at each intensity multiplied by the weighted intensity of staining (0, 1+, 2+, 3+, where 3+ indicates the strongest staining, 2+ indicates medium staining, 1+ indicates weak staining, and 0 indicates no staining). Minimum calculated score of 0 to maximum calculated score of 300, where 0 correspond to no expression and maximum score of 300 indicates the strongest expression. However, the biomarker expression level (higher or lower) was not a predictor of outcome.</outcome>

      <outcome>Plasma Crizotinib and PF-06260182 Pharmacokinetic Parameter in Expansion Cohort 1 With or Without Co-administration of Dacomitinib - Tmax - Participants were evaluated for the effect of dacomitinib on steady-state PK of crizotinib. PK of crizotinib alone was evaluated on Day -1 (one day before C1D1 on which the combination treatment of crizotinib and dacomitinib started) after a lead in period of continuous BID dosing of crizotinib for approximately 12 days (±2 days). PK of crizotinib and dacomitinib in combination treatment was evaluated on Day 1 of Cycle 2. Blood samples for crizotinib full PK were to be collected on Day -1 and Day 1 of Cycle 2. The below table included PK data for Tmax. Tmax was observed directly from data as time of first occurrence.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Lung cancer tumors become resistant to the first generation epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR) inhibitors erlotinib or gefitinib by changing and increasing the activity of two cell
      signaling pathways: the cMET pathway and the EGFR pathway. Both resistance mechanisms can
      occur at the same time, in the same patient and even in the same tumor. This study combines a
      second generation EGFR inhibitor and a cMET inhibitor to block both these pathways in order
      to overcome resistance and treat this disease.</summary>
