  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the efficacy of 100 mg EMA401 orally twice daily for 28 days in reducing mean pain intensity score in patients with neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve injury, compared to placebo.

This will be assessed using patient pain scores (on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 = no pain and 10 = pain as bad as you can imagine).</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 28 days treatment</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of 100 mg EMA401 orally twice daily for 28 days on psychophysical measures of sensitisation in pain pathways in patients with neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve injury, compared to placebo.

This will be assessed by change in area of evoked pain from using brush, monofilaments, and thermal thresholds, patient pain scores, patient and clinician ratings of change, and patient questionnaires (specifically the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the Brief Pain Inventory)</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 28 days treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the potential efficacy of EMA401 using several alternate endpoints, including onset and maintenance of effect, responder rate, and time to 30% reduction in pain intensity</outcome>
      <timepoint>Over 28 days treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 100 mg EMA401 orally twice daily for 28 days in patients with neuropathic pain due to peripheral nerve injury.

This will be assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events, and changes and findings in laboratory parameters, physical and neurological examinations, vital signs, and ECG. All adverse events that occur will be measured by recording details of the event including description, start and stop dates, severity, seriousness, and relationship to study drug</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 28 days treatment</timepoint>

4.  Have previously received EMA401.

5.  Are known to be allergic to EMA401 or any of the excipients.

6.  Have a clinically significant history of systemic allergic disease (e.g., urticaria, atopic dermatitis).

7.  Have a history of an allergic reaction to previous medication that required management by a health care professional.

8.  Have non-peripheral nerve injury neuropathic pain component, or more than one cause or potential cause of pain symptoms.

9.  Have deafferentation pain (spinal root avulsion injury, lumbo-sacral root pain).

10.  Have intractable pain of unknown origin or active infection in the area of nerve injury.

11.  Have had extensive surgery for the treatment of their nerve injury.

12.  Have skin conditions in the affected area that in the investigators opinion could alter sensation.

13.  Have any history of clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias or the presence of clinically significant abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening.

14.  Have systolic blood pressure &lt;100 or &gt;150 mmHg, or a diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 or &gt;90 mmHg on two consecutive measurements at least 10 minutes apart.

15.  Have a resting pulse rate &gt;100 or &lt;50 beats per minute on two consecutive measurements at least 10 minutes apart.

16.  Have a calculated creatinine clearance (using Cockroft and Gault formula) of less than 50 mL/min at Screening.

17.  Have serum aspartate transaminase (AST), gamma glutamyl transaminase (GGT) or alanine transaminase (ALT) levels greater than 3.0 x the upper limit of normal or have total bilirubin concentrations greater than 2.0 x the upper limit of normal at Screening.

18.  Have current hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

19.  Consume more than four units of alcohol daily for a man or three units of alcohol for a woman (one unit = 300 mL beer, one glass of wine, one measure of spirits) or have a history of alcohol abuse/dependence.

20.  Other than the condition under study, have an active, uncontrolled medical condition, or psychiatric illness, or any other significant clinical disorder or laboratory finding that in the opinion of the investigator, precludes participation in the study or may interfere with the study objectives.

21.  Other than the condition under study, have had a clinically significant illness or operative procedure within 4 weeks of the Screening visit.

22.  Are known to be poor compliers or those unlikely to attend study visits.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripheral neuropathy is caused by damage to nerves. Current therapy needs to be improved as a significant proportion of neuropathic pain patients dont respond to current therapy and these treatments have dose-limiting side effects.

EMA401 is an angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist, a class of molecules that offers an innovative approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain. EMA401 has shown efficacy in a number of relevant models and good human safety and pharmacokinetics in Phase 1 studies. 

This study will look at whether EMA401 reduces pain in patients who have peripheral neuropathy caused by nerve damage, and whether it is well tolerated.</summary>
