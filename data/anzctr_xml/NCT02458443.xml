Sham Comparator: IHG 5% Un-medicated - Participants with high blood pressure (greater than 120/80) who are not medicated for blood pressure control will conduct isometric handgrip (IHG) exercise at 5% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Isometric resistance training will be conducted three times a week for 12 weeks, with participants conducting 4 x 2min IHG exercises at each session.

Sham Comparator: IHG 5% BB - Participants with high blood pressure (greater than 120/80) who are currently taking beta blockers for blood pressure control will conduct isometric handgrip exercise at 5% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Isometric resistance training will be conducted three times a week for 12 weeks, with participants conducting 4 x 2min IHG exercises at each session.

Experimental: IHG 30% Un-medicated - Participants with high blood pressure (greater than 120/80) who are not medicated for blood pressure control will conduct isometric handgrip exercise at 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Isometric resistance training will be conducted three times a week for 12 weeks, with participants conducting 4 x 2min IHG exercises at each session.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recent meta-analyses suggest isometric resistance training (IRT) may be superior to aerobic
      exercise for lowering blood pressure. The investigators intend to conduct the largest,
      longest, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled trial using isometric resistance
      training to reduce blood pressure to reduce hypertension.</summary>
