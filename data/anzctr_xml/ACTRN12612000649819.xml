  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants recruited in the study will receive the sleep hygiene education programme. The programme consists of a one-time sleep hygiene education intervention, a sleep education kit as well as ongoing support via telephone calls, text messages and get-together sessions. The initial intervention focuses on good sleep hygiene education via a multi-media presentation. The intervention lasts about 90 minutes and is delivered, in a private one-one session to the participant and one of their parents by the main researcher within a power point presentation with discussion centred on overcoming individual barriers to adherence. The sleep hygiene intervention instructions target three main areas of sleep:  1) nutrition conducive to good sleep; 2) sleep environment and 3) sleep routine. The programme is packaged as the F.E.R.R.E.T sleep hygiene programme; an acronym for Food, Emotions, Routine, Restrict, Environment and Timing, with each category consisting of three easy to remember sleep rules pertaining to their respective categories. The participants take home an individualised F.E.R.R.E.T flip-book containing the acronyms and rules in an easy reference format, and space to write notes down should they wish to. The F.E.R.R.E.T flip-book also had a compact disc (CD) containing the F.E.R.R.E.T multi-media presentation. Post-intervention support includes fortnightly telephone calls to the participant, a dedicated F.E.R.R.E.T cell phone number which participants could call or text any time with sleep issues, as well as one-one informal session (approximately 30 to 45 minutes) every at 6, 12 and 18 weeks post-intervention with the researcher to discuss progress and provide an opportunity for data collection.
	Outcomes are assessed at 6, 12, and 20 weeks post-intervention to follow changes over time.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adolescent Sleep Hygiene scale: The ASHS is a 28-item self-report questionnaire that assesses sleep-facilitating and sleep-inhibiting practices in adolescents along nine different domains: physiological, cognitive, emotional, sleep environment, daytime sleep, substances, bedtime routine, sleep stability, and bed/bedroom sharing. The ASHS shows concurrent validity associations with the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The ASHS will be administered  on 5 occasions: 1 and 2 weeks before the intervention and 6, 12 and 20 weeks post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): a 19-item self-report questionnaire which measures sleep quality during the previous month to discriminate between good and poor sleepers. The PSQI generates seven domain scores with each domain score ranging from zero to three. The domain scores are summed to produce a global score ranging from zero to 21, where a PSQI global score of greater than five is considered to be suggestive of significant sleep disturbance. The PSQI has good reliability with high internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha = 0.83) as well as test-retest reliability</outcome>
      <timepoint>The PSQI will be administered  on 5 occasions: 1 and 2 weeks before the intervention and 6, 12 and 20 weeks post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep Disturbances Scale for Children (SDSC): a 26-item parent-report questionnaire which measures sleep quality and disturbance in children and adolescents. The SDSC has high internal consistency (alpha = 0.79), test/retest reliability (r = 0.71)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The SDSC will be administered on 5 occasions: 1 and 2 weeks before the intervention and 6, 12 and 20 weeks post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anthropometry: Height and weight measurements will be measured within a clinic setting and BMI and BMI z-scores calculated. Height, to the nearest 0.1 cm, wil be measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer and weight, to the nearest 0.1 kg, was measured with shoes, jackets, sweatshirts and hats removed. Waist circumference (WC) will be measured, to the nearest 0.1 cm, at the level of the iliac crest just below the navel.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks before and 20 weeks post-intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Attention and vigilance: The Conners Continuous Performance Test II (CPT-II) will be used: an electronic attention and vigilance test used to assess sustained attention, and is often used in studies of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 weeks before and 20 weeks post-intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Energy Expenditure (EE): EE measured over a seven day/24 h period using an Actical accelerometer (Mini-Mitter, Respironics, USA). The Actical accelerometer is a small, water resistant motion sensor capable of sensing and recording omnidirectional acceleration and activity ranging from sedentary to vigorous movements.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Sleep hygiene (defined as the practices, habits, and environmental factors influencing sleep quality) is an important predictor of sleep quality in adolescents.
There are no standard sleep hygiene programmes available for children or adolescents. To address the lack of research programmes to aid the sleep of obese youth, we have developed a sleep hygiene programme in consultation with 22 youths and that requires piloting before going to a RCT that will focus on overweight/obese youth. We aim to pilot the effectiveness of this sleep hygiene intervention for children/adolescents with problems initiating and/or maintaining sleep. We hypothesise that improvements will be seen in sleep quantity (measured subjectively and objectively), sleep quality, and in daytime symptoms linked to problematic sleep.</summary>
