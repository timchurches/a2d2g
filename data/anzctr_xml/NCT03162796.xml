      <outcome>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) at Week 24 - SF-36 is a survey of participant health. It consists of 8 individual domains, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 domains are: vitality (VT), physical functioning (PF), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), Role-Physical (RP), Role-Emotional (RE), social functioning (SF) and mental health (MH). Each of these 8 scales (domains) is scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Based on the scale scores, the summary physical component score (PCS) is derived. Scales contributing most to the scoring of the SF-36 PCS include the PF, RP, BP and GH. Other domains not noted contribute to the scoring but to a lesser degree. The scoring is derived based on an algorithm that has been developed in a software provided by the developer. The summary PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health.</outcome>
