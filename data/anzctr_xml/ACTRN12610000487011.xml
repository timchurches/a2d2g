  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard prehospital care plus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP).

Standard care consists of sublingual glyceral trinitrate, intravenous frusemide, intranvenous morphine, and nebulised salbutamol. Patients may receive any combination of the above on a case by case basis. In addition the intervention group will receive continuous postitive airway pressure using the Boussignac CPAP device at a therapeutic level of 10cm H2O positive end expiratory pressure, a therapeutic goods association (TGA) approved lightweight and portable CPAP system.  Patients randomised to this intervention group will begin receiving CPAP on scene administered by the paramedics.  CPAP will be continuously administered until arrvial at the emergency department or until the patient's clinical condition warrants cessation of the CPAP therapy</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard prehospital care alone.  Standard care consists of sublingual glyceral trinitrate, intravenous frusemide, intranvenous morphine, and nebulised salbutamol.  Standard care will be initiated on scene following randomisation and allocation to that group.  Standard care will continue to be administered according to ambulance service protocol until arrvial at the emergency department</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Continous postitive airway pressure (CPAP) is a proven therapy when administered in the emergency department.  The evidence supporting it's use in the preshospital setting is not definitive and consisits of surrogate outcome measures hence this trial, powered to detect a difference in the true outcome of mortality, should provide important evidence.  Our hypothesis is that adding continous positive airway pressure to standard care in the prehospial setting will decrease hospital mortality comparted to standard care alone.</summary>
