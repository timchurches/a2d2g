  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Nicorette® inhalator
Other interventions - P3L

Experimental: Nicorette® inhalator then P3L - Each subject will use the Nicorette® inhalator (15 mg) on Visit 3, and then use the P3L aerosol at nicotine dose levels of approximately 50 µg/puff, 80 µg/puff and 150 µg/puff on Visits 4, 5 and 6, respectively.


Other interventions: Nicorette® inhalator
Subjects will inhale the Nicorette® inhalator (15 mg) at the rate of one deep inhalation every 15 seconds on average, over approximately 20 minutes (80 inhalations in total).

Other interventions: P3L
Subjects will inhale P3L (50 µg/puff, 80 µg/puff and 150 µg/puff) at the rate of one inhalation every 30 seconds on average, over approximately 6 minutes (i.e., 12 inhalations in total).
