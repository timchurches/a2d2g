  <interventions>
    <interventions>Interactive, individualised, internet based cognitive behavioural intervention.  

The intervention aims to provide information and support to patients, to help them adjust to a diagnosis of cancer and reduce their cancer-related distress.  Topics will include stress reduction, problem-solving, cognitive challenging and enhancing relationship support. 
To deliver the psychological intervention, the application will include educational information and videos with self-management tools and interactive tasks tailored in response to users' needs as determined by their input.  The program has high levels of interactivity - self-assessment and monitoring tools such as quizzes and online diaries - to increase user engagement and systems to encourage use and self-management including personalised email reminders, follow up and feedback. 

The intervention will consist of six cores and will be metered (distributed), rather than provided all at once (like a static health information website).  Cores one and two will be available immediately after completion of baseline assessment. Subsequent cores (three through to six) will be released at seven day intervals.  Participants will be encouraged to complete the core within seven days of its release.  It is anticipated that each core will take approximately one hour to complete.  In addition to the six cores, the participant will have access to a library of information relevant to various challenges associated with cancer (e.g., managing fatigue, coping with treatment, managing conflict with a loved one).  Following completion of all six cores, participants will be encouraged to review the core information and utilise the library.  Participants will receive continued access to the intervention for the duration of the twelve month intervention period, to be accessed at their discretion.  
</interventions>
    <comparator>Patient education.

The control arm will receive access to a static website for the duration of the 12 month intervention period, to be accessed at their discretion.  The static website will contain currently available best practise and evidence-based resources.  Topics will include stress management skills; problem solving approaches to cancer-related concerns; and patient education about a healthy lifestyle to promote wellness and optimise quality of life.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified through the (1) the Queensland Cancer Registry (QCR); and (2) Cancer Council 131120. For QCR recruitment, patients who have been diagnosed with melanoma or colorectal cancer in the last 6 months will be identified through pathology records held by the QCR. The diagnosing clinician on the patient's pathology record will be contacted, seeking their consent to contact the patient. Where the doctor has given permission to contact, research staff will then send a letter to the patient (signed by the patient's doctor) inviting them to participate in the study. Informed written consent will be obtained before completing the baseline assessment. 

For recruitment through Cancer Council 131120, callers who meet selection criteria will be offered entry into the study by the 131120 operator at the time of the call, and will be contacted by project staff for consent to be in the study, and to complete baseline assessment.

Randomisation to study condition will occur following the completion of baseline assessment. Allocation concealment will occur with randomisation being undertaken by computer at the central administration site. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will occur in blocks of 10, with each condition randomly generated 5 times within each block to ensure an unpredictable allocation sequence with equal numbers of participants in each group at the completion of each block.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on the number of incident cancers in 2009, and projections using population growth and aging, it is estimated that approximately 6,500 Queenslanders will be diagnosed with either invasive colorectal cancer or invasive melanoma in 2013.  Of these, about 5,450 will be aged 18-79 years at diagnosis (2,940 melanomas, 2,510 colorectal cancers) of which approximately 2,999 (55%) will be connected to the internet, and, of these about 50% (colorectal) and 30% (melanoma) will be defined as being distressed.  This leaves about 485 eligible melanoma patients and 690 eligible colorectal cancer patients.  Based on our previous studies, we anticipate that approximately 70% of doctors contacted will consent to their patient being approached.  Then approximately 60% of patients approached will consent to participate.  

Taking these response rates into account, the final sample of people diagnosed with invasive colorectal cancer will be 290 and for invasive melanoma will be 200, of which 245 (145 colorectal and 100 melanoma) will be randomised to the intervention and control groups.  This combined sample (245 per group) will provide 91% power to detect a small effect size (0.3) with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample t-test.

All analyses will be conducted on the basis of intention to treat.  The study is a multivariate, two condition randomised controlled trial with repeated measures across time.  We will use a multilevel model (MLM) to examine this design in which measurement occasions (level 1) are nested within persons (level 2) and in which program differences are represented as a fixed effect at level 2 whose interaction with time represents differential adjustment and distress trajectories for the two groups. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of an interactive web-based psychological intervention for people with cancer and elevated psychological distress. 

Who is it for?
Participants will be identified through notifications received by the Queensland Cancer Registry (QCR), or be referred through Cancer Council's Information and Support service 131120. Participants will be aged 18 years or above, live in Queensland, have been diagnosed with malignant melanoma or colorectal cancer within the past 6 months (QCR) OR have been diagnosed with cancer (131120), are experiencing elevated psychological distress and have phone and internet access. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will have access to an interactive, individualised, internet based cognitive behavioural intervention. The intervention aims to provide information and support to patients, to help them adjust to a diagnosis of cancer and reduce their cancer-related distress. The intervention will include educational information and videos with self-management tools and interactive tasks tailored in response to users' needs as determined by their input. Participants in the other group will receive access to a static education website, containing information on stress management skills, problem solving approaches to cancer-related concerns, and patient education about a healthy lifestyle to promote wellness and optimise quality of life. All participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 months, in order to assess their psychological distress and quality of life. </summary>
