    <studytitle>A study looking at whether or not a knee replacement moves inside the bone that it is inserted into and if it does move, this movement will be measured using x-rays.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Patients with non-inflammatory osteoarthritis requiring a partial knee replacement will have tantalum beads inserted at the time of surgery in order to reference implant movement over time and these results will be compared with results from the literature of others with partial knee replacements.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Partial knee replacement with the addition of between 5 and 9  Tantalum beads (metal beads 1mm in diameter) will be inserted into each of the proximal tibial and distal femoral bones.  These beads define rigid bodies in order to reference the implants to for measurement purposes.  The amount of time taken to insert the beads will be approximately 5 minutes longer than standard knee replacement surgery.  The number of beads inserted is determined by the need to be able to clearly identify them and increase measurement accuracy.  The majority of patients will have 5 beads inserted.</interventions>
    <comparator>Historical.  The participant results will be compared with unicompartmental tibial component roenten stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) studies published in the literature from 2005 - 2010.</comparator>

5. Patients who, as judged by the surgeon, are mentally incompetent or are reasonably unlikely to be compliant with the prescribed postoperative routine and the follow-up evaluation schedule
6. Patients with a physical condition (ie. weight exceeding 90kgs) or a neuromuscular deficit which interferes with the patient's ability to limit weight-bearing or places an extreme load on the implant during the healing period
7. Patients with other concurrent illnesses that are likely to affect their outcome such as sickle cell anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus or renal disease requiring dialysis</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Patients will be selected and enrolled by the Prinicipal Investigator at his department/practice.  The Investigator will inform the patient of the purpose of the study, the proposed duration of the study and the follow-up schedule.  All forseeable risks involved, as well as potential benefits that result from the joint reconstruction will also be explained.  If the patient agrees to join the study, they will be enrolled and given a copy of the Patient Information Sheet for their records.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the amount of movement, if any, of a metal backed partial knee replacement using x-rays taken at follow-up visits.  A computer program will be used to analyse the x-rays to measure if the replacement has moved and how much it has moved since it was put in or since the  previous follow-up visit.</summary>
