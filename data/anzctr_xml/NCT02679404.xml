    <summary>Multi-center, International, Prospective, Non comparative, Non randomized, Open label.

      5,000 patients to be enrolled approximately worldwide.

      The objective of this registry is to collect safety and clinical performance post market data
      related to the procedure and follow-up of the Sorin Group aortic valve devices in accordance
      with the Instructions for Use (IFU).

      This observational global registry is intended to collect data without requiring any
      deviation from the standard of care and IFU in each participating center. The participating
      centers shall include those patients that have provided their informed consent to participate
      in this registry in accordance with the local applicable regulations.</summary>
