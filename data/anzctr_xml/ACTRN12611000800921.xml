  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate whether treatment with the medication, fampridine, can help improve the ability to function in patients who have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).

Who is this for? 
You are eligible to participate in this study if you are ages between 18-80, have CIDP and currently suffer from fatigue and a decreased functional ability. 

Trial detials
In this studywith patients will receiving 12 weeks of Fampridine (active drug) at a dose of 10mg oral tablet twice daily, and 12 weeks of placebo (sham) treatment consisting of lacotse tablets, separated by a 4-week washout period.
During the trial, participants will not know if they are receiving active drug or the placebo. 

Participants will be assessed at basline foloowed by 4 weekly intervals to measure fatigue, functional ability and nerve function.</summary>
