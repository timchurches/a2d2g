  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgery to remove residual disease and continued treatment with imatinib mesylate. 
Patients allocated to the intervention arm will have surgery within 4 weeks of randomisation. The preferred surgery will be a midline laparotomy, but all abdominal incisions will be allowed.

    <concealment>After the patient has consented to participate in the study they will be screened to ensure that they meet the eligibility requirements of the study.
When the patient is enrolled, the treatment allocation will be randomly selected using an internet-based randomisation system. The treatment allocation is not blinded. The patient and their clinician will be informed of the patient's treatment allocation at the time of enrolment in the study.</concealment>
    <sequence>Treatment allocation is determined using minimisation. Stratification factors are institution, site of tumour origin and site of metastases.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study evaluates the effectiveness of surgery in treating residual disease in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal cell tumours who are responding to treatment with imatinib mesylate. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups. One group will receive surgery to remove residual disease and continue imatinib therapy. The other group will receive continued imatinib therapy only. Participants will be monitored twice in first 6 months, then every 3 months for the first 5 years, and then every 6 months until any progression of disease.  

Who is it for?
-Patients with metastatic GIST.
-Patients who have taken 6-12 months of imatinib mesylate.
-Patients with either stable disease or tumour regression since the start of imatinib mesylate.</summary>
