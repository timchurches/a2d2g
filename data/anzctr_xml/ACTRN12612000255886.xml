  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behavioural: All participants will be randomised to one of three web-based surveys (Groups A, B or C). All participants will answer the same questions on lifestyle behviours including socialisation, fast food intake, drinking and physical activity. Group A will be told they are completing a Lifestyle Survey while Group B will be told the focus of the survey is alcohol intake.  Group C will also be told the focus of the survey is alcohol intake but they will answer  a series of extra questions about the impact of alcohol on their behaviour and lifestyle before answering the same lifestyle questions as Group A and B.  All surveys will take less than 10 minutes to complete.  All participants will be asked to complete a second, follow-up survey 4 weeks later and this will take less than 5 minnutes to complete.</interventions>

    <concealment>Students will be invited to participate via an email sent to their student addresses by each participating university. This email will contain a hyperlink to a webpage with study information sheet and a registration box for their email address. Once they have entered their email address, which is taken as consent to partiicpate in the study, an email is sent by the research team to them with a link to the survey. Clicking on this link will randomly assign participants to one of three different surveys groups A, B or C. Randomisation will occur without their knowledge.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be effected automatically by computer using a random number generator.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to test two experimental hypotheses:
1) A comparison of awareness and lack of awareness of study focus, and
2) Assessment of awareness versus non-awareness of monitoring behaviour. 
The focus is on whether answering specific questions within the research assessment questionnaire causes participants to think differently about their behaviour, and to subsequently act upon it.</summary>
