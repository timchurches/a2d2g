  <interventions>
    <interventions>The LiFE program is a structured approach to improving the balance and strength of people at high risk of falls. The program is designed in such a way that participants incorporate the 8 balance and 7 strength activities into their daily lives and routines to gradually form habits (Clemson, Munro, Fiatarone Singh 2013). Lally and Gardner (2011) argue that habit formation is largely dependent on repetitive behavior being conducted in a consistent environment. Participants of the LiFE program are taught these activities within their own home thus maintaining the consistency of the environment (Clemson et al 2012; Lally and Gardner 2011). Additionally daily routines provide the cue that participants need to promote the performance of the activity (Lally and Gardner 2011).
The balance activities are the tandem stand, tandem walking, one-leg stand, leaning from side-to-side, leaning forwards and backwards, stepping over objects, stepping over objects sideways and stepping in different directions. The strength activities aim to increase the load on the legs and include; bending knees, sit to stand, standing on toes and heels, walking up stairs, walking sideways and tightening muscles (Clemson, Munro, Fiatarone Singh 2013). These activities will be taught by Orientation and Mobility Instructors employed by Guide Dogs NSW/ACT. These instructors are familiar in working with the vision impaired population and will thus appropriately tailor these activities to the needs of the participants. The LIFE program will be adminstered over 5 home visits (with one each week) as well as 2 booster visits and 2 phone calls (one each fortnight as the participant becomes more familiar with the program) over the course of 3 months. It is expected that each of the 5 home visits will be conducted over an hour, whereas the booster visits and phone calls should not take longer than half an hour. 
Overall the duration of the program is 3 months. However there will also be a follow up assessment at the end of the 3 month period and at 12 months from the baseline assessment, to measure any improvements to the participants balance and strength abilities. Thus the total duration of the study is 12 months. </interventions>
    <comparator>A control group of Guide Dogs NSW/ACT clients will receive only usual care from the Orientation and Mobility Instructors, and will also be assessed at baseline and 3 and 12 months.
Usual care consists of  an orientation and mobility program which is available to all Guide Dogs clients. Such a program usually involves training in how to successfully navigate and travel to a location for a desired activity, for example catching a bus to the shops.  By definition and orientation and mobility program will provide instruction that can help you develop or relearn the skills and concepts you need to travel safely and independently within your home and in the community. It is goal specific.  "Orientation" refers to the ability to know where you are and where you want to go, whether you're moving from one room to another or walking downtown for a shopping trip.  "Mobility" refers to the ability to move safely, efficiently, and effectively from one place to another, such as being able to walk without tripping or falling, cross streets, and use public transportation.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>As fall rates will be compared between groups using incidence rate ratios (IRR) from negative binomial regression models, we conducted an analysis of statistical power using the R software package. A total of 500 participants (250 per group) will be required to provide 90% power to detect as significant, at the 5% level, a 30% between-group difference in fall rates (ie IRR = 0.70).  For the power calculation we used coefficients from the previous trial of falls prevention in people with low vision.  Alpha (a measure of over-dispersion in the negative binomial regression model) was assumed to be 0.8. We assumed the control group rate of falls would be the same as that found in AI Gleesons study in the same population 0.1242 falls /person month over the 12-month follow-up period.  We will recruit 588 participants, to allow for 15% drop-out.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Visually impaired older people are increasing in number and have significant ongoing morbidity including risk of falls, but are neglected in regard to falls prevention programs. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the Lifestyle approach to reducing Falls through Exercise (LiFE) program to prevent falls and improve function in older people with vision impairment compared to usual care, delivered through specialist Orientation and Mobility Instructors. Secondary aims are to establish the cost-effectiveness of the LiFE program compared to usual care and to identify determinants of the success of the LiFE program and implementation issues in the vision impaired population. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial evaluating the LiFE program in older people with visual impairment in NSW and ACT in collaboration with Guide Dogs NSW/ACT, a leading community service organisation for people with vision impairment.
A total of 588 participants will be recruited through Guide Dogs client database, and randomized to receive either the LiFE intervention or usual care (control group). Guide Dogs' Orientation and Mobility Instructors will receive training in delivering the LiFE program, which will be delivered to those in the intervention group. Social and demographic characteristics  and visual and physical status and will be assessed at baseline, and physical status reassessed at 12 months to characterise the study cohort.. Falls will be self-reported on a monthly basis. Physical activity will be measured using actigraphy at baseline, 3 and 12 months. A sample of 30 participants in the intervention group will be interviewed after completing the program to determine how well the LiFE program concepts are integrated into daily activity.
An economic evaluation will be modeled from a health service provider perspective, with data collected on costs to deliver the LiFE program, in-patient hospital admissions, emergency department presentations and other health and community service contact, The primary outcome measures will be the rate of falls over the 12 months following randomization and the Late Life Disability and Function Index.. The secondary outcomes will be falls requiring medical care and the rate of falls per steps taken.</summary>
