    <interventions>This is a prospective, single arm observational study of FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) -directed targeted therapy in newly diagnosed and previously treated patients with CUP. Patients will be consented and have FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) comprehensive molecular profiling completed. Other molecular assays are permitted for treatment assignment, but adequate tumor  tissue must remain to perform FoundationOne (Registered Trademark). FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) profiling is required as part of this study. If the FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) has not already been conducted, a tissue sample from the patients biopsy will be sent to Foundation Medicine for testing. Adequate tumor tissue must remain to confirm genomic alterations in enrolled patients. Results from the FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) may provide information about patients cancer that may help physicians make decisions about patients treatment. Previous FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) profiling is also allowed and is not required to be repeated. All patients will be followed approximately every 3 months until death.
Upon distribution of the results, physicians will decide with patients the appropriate treatment regimen. Patients may be treated on clinical trials of targeted therapies or may receive TGA approved therapies, including off-label agents, as available.

4. Previously untreated brain metastases. Patients who have received radiation or surgery or brain metastases are eligible if therapy was completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry and there is no evidence of central nervous system disease progression, mild neurologic symptoms, and no requirement for chronic corticosteroid therapy. 
5. Enzyme inducing anticonvulsants
6. Pregnant or lactating.

    <statisticalmethods>The design of this trial assumes that approximately 25% of 500 enrolled patients will have genomic alterations identified as listed in the study protocol (Class 1, 2, and 3 alterations as defined at the time the patient was initiated on treatment) where targeted agents could be employed, and assumes approximately half of these patients will receive therapies.
Therefore, 63 patients are expected to receive matched targeted therapy. With 80% power and an alpha of .10, we would be able to demonstrate an Overall survival of 18 months in this subgroup of the enrolled population versus an estimated control of 12.5 months.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the FoundationOne(Registered
Trademark) genetic profiling test for patients diagnosed with cancer of unknown primary, a cancer where the location of the cancer cannot yet be found.

Who is it for?
Patients may be eligible to participate in this study if they are aged 18 years or over and have been
diagnosed with metastatic or advanced unresectable cancer of unknown primary. In order to complete the
FoundationOne (Registered Trademark) testing, study participants must have adequate tissue available from a tumour biopsy.

Study details
All participants in this study will receive the FoundationOne(Registered Trademark) test. This test involves testing cancer cells from a sample of tumour tissue obtained during a biopsy. The results of the test will be discussed between each study participant and his/her treating physician, along with results from any other diagnostic tests performed, and a treatment plan will be agreed upon. The results of the FoundationOne(Registered Trademark) test may provide information that could help physicians decide which treatment could be the most beneficial in treating cancer of unknown primary.  Physicians will follow study participants approximately every 3 months and provide information about study participants status and treatment. The purpose of collecting the  Information from the FoundationOne(Registered Trademark) test and the results of the patients treatment(s) is to learn about the usefulness of the FoundationOne(Registered Trademark) test results for decision-making by treating physicians.</summary>
