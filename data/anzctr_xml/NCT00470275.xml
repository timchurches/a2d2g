    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Response - Any patient who is enrolled and receives at least one dose of cytarabine will be considered evaluable for response if (1) the patient demonstrates progressive disease while on protocol therapy or (2) the patient is observed on protocol therapy for at least one cycle. Patients who achieve a complete or partial response according to the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria will be considered responders for the study design. All other patients who are evaluable for response will be considered non-responders for the study.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cytarabine works in treating young patients
      with recurrent or refractory Ewing's sarcoma.</summary>
