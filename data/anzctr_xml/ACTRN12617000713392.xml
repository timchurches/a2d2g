  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a parallel randomized trial of two groups over seven-weeks. One group will consume two gold kiwifruit and 500mL carbonated water as a preload to breakfast each day (consumed within the 30 minutes leading up to breakfast). Prior to the intervention, participants normal breakfasts will be characterized by asking them to fill in weighed breakfast records for 7 days. The intervention will involve reducing breakfast by an amount equivalent to the carbohydrate contained in the gold kiwifruit preload. For example, if a person ate two slices of jam on toast for breakfast, one of those slices would be replaced by gold kiwifruit. This strategy may produce measurable benefit to metabolic markers over seven weeks; sufficient time for changes in lipids and glycaemic markers to occur. We will obtain breakfast records and train people how to substitute part of their breakfast with the gold kiwifruit. If the habitual breakfast contains fat, this will be removed propotionately with amount of CHO that is substituted with gold kiwifruit, providing a mechanism by which blood lipids would be affected. To monitor adherence we will record kiwifruit/carbonated water collection visits and  obtain diet records during the intervention period. This intervention will be conducted by a postgraduate student with a Master of Science in Human Nutrition as part of her PhD with supervision by senior university and Crown Research Institute staff.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparison group will consume 500 mL carbonated water as a preload to their habitual breakfast each day (consumed within the 30 minutes leading up to breakfast) to encourage compliance, while water is unlikely to have an effect on lipids and glucose.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Kiwifruit preloads to breakfast have been found to acutely modify the postprandial blood glucose response compared with a non-preload condition. Our aim is to test whether there is a longer-term effect of kiwifruit preload on metabolic markers over 7-weeks. The intervention group will consume 2 kiwifruit and a 500mL bottle of carbonated water 30 min prior to the remainder of breakfast whilst the control group will consume carbonated water in the 30min prior to breakfast. Main outcomes will be differences in fasting plasma glucose and insulin between groups adjusted for baseline. Secondary outcomes will be differences in fasting lipids and uric acid between groups adjusted for baseline.</summary>
