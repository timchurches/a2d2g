  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This trial will examine the efficacy of lithium in providing symptomatic relief from the
      withdrawal discomfort experienced by some dependent users of cannabis on cessation of regular
      use. Significant withdrawal may be a barrier to achieving abstinence in some clients and can
      be associated with marked disturbances in mood, sleep, hostility and aggression. Relief from
      such symptoms may be important in helping some clients achieve a period of abstinence and
      facilitate subsequent entry into a relapse prevention program.</summary>
