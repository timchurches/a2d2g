  <interventions>
    <interventions>Drug burden index is a tool used to quantify a persons total exposure to anticholinergic and sedative medications.  Drug burden index has been associated with physical and cognitive performance in older people. Drug burden index can be used to assess the risks and benefits of prescribing for older populations. 
This project aims to test the validity of the drug burden index and its association with functional outcomes in an Australian population of older people living in retirement villages. It will also assess the feasibility of drug burden index as a prompt for medication review.
The intervention will be conducted over 3 months and it will involve prompting General Practitioners to reduce those drugs contributing to drug burden index and potentially impairing the patients physical and cognitive function.
For the intervention group, a report including list of medications associated with drug burden index will be sent to the General Practitioner for consideration of possible withdrawal (dose reduction or cessation). The report will quantify the degree of functional impairment that may be associated with the participant's drug burden. 
For the control group, there will be no prompting about drug burden.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is active. The control group will receive standard care from their General Practitioners. There will be no prompting about drug burden.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study will provide important insight for identifying medications that may contribute to functional impairments and age related disability in older Australians. 
This study aims to describe the exposure of older Australians to medications with sedative and anticholinergic effects using the Drug Burden Index.  It will investigate the role of the drug burden index as a tool to guide prescribing in older Australians and whether changes drug burden are associated with changes in the physical and cognitive functional status.</summary>
