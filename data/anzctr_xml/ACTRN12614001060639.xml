  <interventions>
    <interventions>All of the sciatica subjects will be diagnosed by an experienced specialist for myofascial pain syndrome co-existence  gluteus minimus active trigger points presence based on Travell and Simons diagnostic criteria. Active trigger points (TrPs) were confirmed if spot tenderness, recognition of pain and digitally evoked referred pain pattern of the gluteus minimus were present. The localization of the most active trigger points or two most tender points (non-TrPs subjects) will be mark. After myofascial pain evaluation, all patients will be asked to define their pain level on the visual analogue scale and to draw their current pain pattern on a diagram. Then, infrared thermovision (IRT) camera side-to-side comparison of the painful area and the opposite extremity will be performed in the standing position. On the same day, patients will receive a dry needling session under infrared thermovision camera control regarding TrPs presence. The time of needling will be 5 minutes for every given point. During the whole procedure, the subarea of referred pain reported by the patient will be recorded. After the needling of the both marked points, further (6 consecutive minutes) thermovision imaging will be performed</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be subjects diagnosed as non-TrPs group. They will receive the same dry needling procedure but in neutral points (non-TrPs). The subjects will not receive the information about the trigger points diagnosis.</comparator>

    <concealment>Fifty Caucasian patients with subacute sciatica will be recruited into the study. The patients will be recruited consecutively from the University Pain Clinic. All of the subjects will be diagnosed by an experienced specialist for myofascial pain syndrome co-existence – gluteus minimus active trigger points presence based on Travell and Simons’ diagnostic criteria. Then the patiens will be divided into two subgroups: TrPs-positive and TrPs-negative</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>According to William Cochrans assumption for X2 test, to conduct the test the quantity of n=5 is required. It is assumed that in the examined group three subgroups will be present, namely:
Sciatica with trigger points co-existence
Sciatica without trigger points co-existence (needle silent)
Sciatica without trigger points co-existence (needle sensation)

Additionally, the subgroups will be analysed based on gender .
 As a result, the information about the minimal size of the sample will be obtained (3 features * 2 gender categories * the quantity of n=5 per subgroup; n=30). However, for the strong evidence of data the examined will be n=50 because the prevalence of trigger points among sciatica patients is unknown.
For the strong evidence of data presented, the significance level will be set based on the exact tests, not on the default asymptotic method. Exact two-way Mann-Whitney U tests will be performed in order to ensure that data are representative of the whole population of possible data values. Tests will applied to compare the differences for maximum, minimum and average skin temperature and the percentage size of expected autonomic phenomena for the state after dry needling and secondly for the post-observation  state. Pearson correlation with two-tailed significance test will be applied to define the dependency of the autonomic phenomenon occurrence. All comparisons will be completed, with trigger points co-existence being the differentiating criterion. 
Values, figures and tables in the text will be expressed as + standard error of the mean (SEs). Significance level will be set at p&lt;0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20".

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Short-term vasodilation after dry needling under IRT control of active TrPs was recorded in several cases and it is unknown whether noxious stimulation of every active trigger point can provoke vasomotor reactions. Moreover, the presence of trigger points in sciatica patients secondary to a primary lesion, e.g. a vertebral disc lesion, was suggested, but it is unknown how often they occur. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of active trigger points among subacute sciatica patients and response to dry needling under IRT control of TrPs positive and negative subacute sciatica patients.</summary>
