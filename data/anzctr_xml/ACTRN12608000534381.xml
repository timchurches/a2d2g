  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pioglitazone via oral route 30-45 mg/day for a period of 16 weeks.
At randomization Pioglitazone 30 mg/day will be given. At follow-up visits response to treatment will be assessed. Patient should be considered as non responder and it is suggested to be titrated to on higher dose (45 mg/day) when fasting blood glucose is &gt;140mg/dL.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group 1 for patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;27: Glibenclamide via oral route 5-15 mg/day for a period of 16 weeks.
At randomization Glibenclamide 5 mg/day will be given. At follow-up visits response to treatment will be assessed. Patient should be considered as non responder and it is suggested to be titrated to on higher dose (10 or 15 mg/day) when fasting blood glucose is &gt;140mg/dL. 

Control group 2 for patients with BMI&gt;=27: Metformin via oral route 850-2550 mg/day for a period of 16 weeks.
At randomization Metformin 850 mg/day will be given. At follow-up visits response to treatment will be assessed. Patient should be considered as non responder and it is suggested to be titrated to on higher dose (1700 or 2550 mg/day) when fasting blood glucose is &gt;140mg/dL.</comparator>

HbA1c will be evaluated at the start of a run-in period (one week before randomization), and 8 and 16 weeks after randomization.

      <timepoint>The parameters will be evaluated at randomization and 16 weeks after randomization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of the investigational study drug by adverse event recording  will be assessed and standard haematology and blood chemistry parameters and vital signs will be measured.
For example the decrease in the levels of liver enzymes will be evaluated by haematology parameters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Adverse events will be recorded at 4,8 and 16 weeks after randomization.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Besides its critical role in metabolic homeostasis, PPAR-gamma modulates several cellular responses involved in atherothrombosis, thus exerting a possible effect on inflammatory response of endothelium, vessel smooth muscular cells and monocytes-macrophages. These observations suggest that pioglitazone might positively influence the progression of the atherosclerotic process in diabetes and can be regarded as a new therapeutical approach to reduce cardiovascular events.</summary>
