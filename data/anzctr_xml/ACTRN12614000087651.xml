  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention:Conservative treatment tailored by the Continence Advisor to each individual. Recording of a bladder diary, of pad usage and volume leaked. The intervention includes pelvic floor muscle training, bladder re-training, life style interventions like increased physical activity, attention to fluid intake type and volume, and diet suggestions, performed by the individual and supervised daily by the carer , and by the Advisor every 2-4 weeks.  Treatment was for 12 weeks for each individual and hopefully advice continued via the carer indefinitely.  At the end of the 12 weeks further tests were run and costs measured.The study lasted for a year as the dates of recruitment was staggered.
Costs of the intervention were recorded for a cost efficacy analysis

    <concealment>Potential participants were women with incontinence identified by the clinical manager of each rest home.  Each was provided with information about the trial.  Those deemed possible were given a Minimental status questionnarie to complete.  Those with a score of &lt;20/30 were excluded.  No other exclusion criteria. Finally a consent form was completed</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Each resthome had only a limited number of suitable participants.
To detect a moderate difference of 0.5 SD using a paired t-test with an alpha =0.05 with 90% power needed 44, but as residents were clustered a design effect of 1.2 was allowed bring the numbers to 53.  To allow for non-response another 10% was added, and to allow for unforeseen withdrawal on health grounds in this elderly group we aimed for 70.  A mixed model was used, and analysed with Stata 13. </statisticalmethods>
