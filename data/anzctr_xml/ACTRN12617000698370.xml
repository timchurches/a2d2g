  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aiming to determine the effects of Ionix Supreme on stress, mood, energy and anxiety. Despite the widespread use of vitamins to compensate for the busy lifestyle and irregular eating patterns that often accompany busy modern lifestyles, there are few controlled trials directly investigating the relationship between dietary supplements on stress, mood, energy and anxiety. We will be measuring the effects Ionix Supreme compared to a placebo using assessments of mental performance, mood and stress measures, along with the collection of blood samples. A smaller group of participants will be invited to participate in a brain imaging component using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS).  These scans will allow us to assess the effects the supplement may have on the brain.
