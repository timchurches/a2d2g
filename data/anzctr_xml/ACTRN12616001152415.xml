  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients admitted to intensive care who fulfil Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria and are clinically thought to have sepsis will have a sample of blood taken to perform a thromboelastogram (TEG) both at admission and on discharge. These results will be correlated with blood culture results from samples that have been taken at clinically appropriate times - no additional blood culture samples will be taken.  The patient will not be clinically followed up after discharge for the purposes of this study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will examine if there are changes in coagulation which can be detected by TEG that occur in patients with a bacteraemia before it has been detected in blood cultures.  
The benefits of being aware of these potential changes may include earlier consideration of non-infective causes of SIRS and altered antibiotic prescribing practices.  In contrast, early identification of a potentially life-threatening infective process that is responsible for the SIRS presentation is essential to ensure ideal outcomes for patients (1). It is a common and important clinical challenge to distinguish between those patients who have sepsis and those who have SIRS.  A hypocoagulable state in sepsis is thought to be associated with increased mortality. Specifically, impaired fibrinolysis may be associated with a diagnosis of sepsis versus SIRS (2).  
On admission to ICU, patients generally have a set of routine admission bloods sampled; these may include full blood count, electrolytes, renal and hepatic function and a coagulation profile.  Routine blood tests may also include blood cultures if the patient is thought to be septic.  However, the routine coagulation profile sent to pathology is thought to provide limited clinical information when assessing in vivo hypocoaguable changes (2).  Research has demonstrated that TEG parameter changes throughout an episode of sepsis may provide some predictive value for mortality and risk of bleeding (3). Recent research has aimed to identify early TEG parameters that may predict a positive blood culture result (4).  
The aim of our study is to identify blood changes detected by TEG that may indicate whether a patient has sepsis or a non-infective cause for SIRS.
