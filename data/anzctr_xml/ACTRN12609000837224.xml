  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to identify problems and obstacles to conducting a larger randmoised controlled trial that investigates the effect of weekend physiotherapy (in addition to weekday) compared to weekday only physiotherapy for inpatient rehabilitation patients. It is hypothesised that patients who receive the weekend therapy may achieve their physical goals earlier and have a shorter hospital length of stay.</summary>
