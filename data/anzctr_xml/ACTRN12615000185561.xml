  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) less than 3 weeks will receive one intraocular injection of 100 micrograms Tenecteplase or sham injection. The procedure will be performed by the study investigator and will follow the Royal Australian and New Zealand College guidelines for intraocular injection. For the sham injection procedure, an empty syringe hub will be placed against the eye. The randomisation will be 1:1. Forty patients will be recruited to the study. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will be used to measure centre point foveal thickness in the macula and to estimate the volume of the intraluminal clot. Fluorescein angiography (FA) will measure retinal flow over the blockage. Retinal blood flowmetry will measure retinal blood flow in the area of the BRVO. Best corrected vision will be measured using an ETDRS Lighthouse 4 meter chart. Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) will be used to examine changes to the radial peripapillary capillaries and the deep capillary networks. At the Day 7 visit, anti-VEGF treatment will start. </interventions>
    <comparator>The sham injection procedure consists of an empty syringe hub been placed against the eye.

    <concealment>Patients presenting to ophthalmic clinics at Lions Eye Institute and the Ophthalmology Department at Royal Perth Hospital with a branch retinal vein occlusion less the 3 weeks in duration will be asked if they would like to participate in the study. The Investigator will discuss all treatment options with the patient. If the patient is interested in participating in the study, the investigator will give the patient a copy of the Participant Information and Consent Form to read and discuss with their family, friends and GP. The baseline visit will take place at Lions Eye Instutite. The participant will sign the consent form prior to performing any study procedures. The participant's vision will be checked (best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)), the eye will be examined and there will be a number of photographic procedures performed (OCT, colour photography, fluorescein angiography, OCTA and flowmetry) to determine eligibilty for the study. If the participant is eligible, they will be randomly assigned to the study treatment (100 micrograms Tenecteplase) or the sham treatment. The randomisation will be 1:1 using central computer randomisation as the allocation of concealment The injection procedure (treatment and sham) will take place at Royal Perth Hospital. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Patient demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarised for all participants to describe the study population and evaluate treatment group comparability. Continuous variables will be summarised by descriptive statitistics and categorical variables will be summarised by frequency distribution. 
2. The primary outcome will be the improvement in retinal blood flow at the site of the occlusion between the two groups at the primary endpoint 7 days. ANOVA will be used to determine whether there is a statistical difference between the treatment groups at the various time points. 
3. The secondary outcome regarding efficacy will be the percentage change in visual acuity and macular thickness measured by OCT at 7 days (primary end point) and 30 days (follow up time point). The measurement at these points will be compared with baseline to evaluate the final improvement in addition to the investigation trend. 
4. Logistic regression can be used for further explorative analysis of binary endpoints which will be considered during the data analysis stage depending on the nature of the data.
5. This study will use 20 participants for each group, this is based on the consideration of power of 0.80 and the alpha of 0.05. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to show that an injection of 100 micrograms of Tenecteplase (TNK) into the back of the eye will dissolve the clot and restore venous outflow within a week in patients who have recently suffered a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) (clot in a branch of the retinal vein). Laser treatment has been the standard treatment for BRVO, and is now superseded by injecting anti-VEGF antibodies into the back of the eye. The visual outcome in patients treated this way has improved, but vision does not always return and ongoing injections are often required. Attempts at breaking the clot have been tried using tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), but they have not been effective. TNK is a third generation thrombolytic developed to address some of the short comings of tPA. Our research has shown that TNK is less toxic than tPA, it has a shorter clot contact time to be effective and it is able to penetrate the retina. We have used TNK to treat sub-retinal macula haemorrhage in humans without any problems. In this study, forty patients with a BRVO of less than 3 weeks will be enrolled with a 1:1 randomisation to the TNK treatment (100 micrograms) or sham treatment. Patients will be recruited from the retinal clinics at Royal Perth Hospital and the Lions Eye Institute. At the Baseline visit, consent will be obtained before any study procedure occurs. The study procedures are: best corrected visual acuity examination, ophthalmic examination (eye examination), photography (includes fluorescein angiography, colour photos and optical coherence tomography (OCT)), optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and flowmetry. If eligible, the study participant will be randomised and treated at Day 0. The study procedures outlined above will be repeated at Day 2, Day 7,Day 30 and Day 90. All participants will start anti-VEGF treatment at Day 7; the current standard treatment. The Day 30 examination will determine if there is evidence of the clot reforming. We aim to show the resolution of the clot and improved retinal blood flow over the area of the blocked vein within a week of the TNK injection using the data from the fluorescein angiography, OCT and flowmetry. If the results are promising, then an application for NH&amp;MRC funding for a multicentre study will be sought. </summary>
