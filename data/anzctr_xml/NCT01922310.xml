    <interventions>Behaviour - Communication intervention

Other: Communication intervention - This study uses a single arm design with current 'controls' to explore an intervention, the procedure for providing information and requesting consent for donation, that uses new agreed best practice procedures led by specially trained intensive care health professionals. The study intervention is a staff education and training module intended to provide a framework and preparation for select critical care staff to conduct organ donation discussions in line with best practice.


Behaviour: Communication intervention
The intervention is a modification of current standard practice procedures for requesting consent for donation.
The intervention period commences when the possibility of organ donation is first raised with the family, and includes the time for families to make a decision. This time may last up to 72 hours.
