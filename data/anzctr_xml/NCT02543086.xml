    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - KAE609
Treatment: drugs - Piperaquine Phosphate

Experimental: Multiple Sequential Cohort - This study is divided in 2 parts (Part A and part B). Each participant in each of the cohorts will be inoculated with viable parasites of Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes administered intravenously. For Part A &amp; Part B, commencement of treatment will be determined by Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction results.
The First cohort of Part A (A1) will be dosed with a single dose of KAE609. During Part A, an additional second single-dose of KAE609 may be tested (~15 days after first dose of KAE609 but may vary) if sexual parasitemia is identified. Subsequent cohorts of part A (An) will be dosed based on the results of first cohort (A1).
Subjects enrolled in Cohort B will receive a pre-treatment with Piperaquine followed by KAE609 (~15 days).


Treatment: drugs: KAE609
Study drug

Treatment: drugs: Piperaquine Phosphate
Pre-administration of Piperaquine Phosphate will be done to eliminate the asexual form of the parasite and induce gametocytaemia before characterizing the activity of KAE609 in clearing sexual blood stage parasites from the blood of healthy subjects in the Induced Blood Stage Malaria Challenge model in Part B of study

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-center open label study conducted in multiple sequential cohorts using
      Induced Blood Stage Malaria infection in healthy volunteers to characterize the effectiveness
      of KAE609 against sexual and asexual blood stage forms of Plasmodium falciparum. This study
      is divided in 2 parts (Part A and part B). A total of 8 healthy volunteers per cohort will be
      enrolled. Based on the results of Part A, Part B will be undertaken to evaluate the effect of
      KAE609 following pretreatment with Piperaquine on sexual stage/gametocytemia and its activity
      as an inhibitor of onward transmission to mosquito vectors using experimental mosquito
      feeding assays.</summary>
