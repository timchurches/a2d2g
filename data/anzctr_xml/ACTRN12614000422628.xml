    <interventions>Online Education through a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC)

Participants will be enrolled into a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) titled: Physiotherapy Management of Spinal Cord Injuries. The course will run for 5 weeks. 

Participants will be asked to devote 3 hours per week to the course. Participants will be given 3 tasks each week, namely:
1. Complete 2 to 3  of the lessons within the physiotherapy module of www.elearnSCI.org   these are part of freely available web-based elearn modules created by the International Spinal Cord Society
2. Look at additional readings, videos and resources
3. Contribute to an online discussion run through a closed facebook group.

The aim of the course is to equip physiotherapy students with sufficient knowledge to manage a person with SCI. This includes assessing impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions, setting appropriate goals of treatment, formulating an evidence-based treatment plan, implementing treatment and evaluating its success.


Adherence to the course will not be directly supervised. However, participants will be emailed and encouraged to register and participate. </interventions>
    <comparator>Online Education through web-based elearn modules


Participants will be asked to devote 3 hours per week for 5 weeks to learning about the Physiotherapy Management of People with SCI. However, they will not be enrolled in the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).

Instead, they will be asked to move at their own pace over a 5-week period through the lessons within the physiotherapy module of www.elearnSCI.org  these are part of freely available web-based elearn modules created by the International Spinal Cord Society. This is the same module and same content that the experimental participants will be exposed to. However, in contrast to the experimental participants, the control participants will not be enrolled in the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and therefore will not look at additional readings, videos and resources, and will not contribute to an online discussion run through a closed facebook group. In addition, their movement through the content will not be paced.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge about physiotherapy management of spinal cord injuries

Participants' knowledge will be assessed at the beginning and end of the trial through a 20-item multiple choice test. The test will be administered online in an exam situation with teacher supervision. Pairs of similar questions will be devised by the investigators prior to the commencement of the trial. Each question in each pair will then be randomly allocated to either the pre-trial test or the post-trial test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction with the learning experience

Participants' satisfaction with the learning experience will be assessed at the completion of the trial by asking participants to rate 4 statement on a 11-point numerical analogue scale anchored at one end with "strongly disagree" and at the other end with "strongly agree". This assessment will be administered online in an exam situation with teacher supervision. </outcome>

      <outcome>Self-efficacy and confidence in providing physiotherapy services to people with spinal cord injury

Participants' self-efficacy and confidence in providing physiotherapy services to people with spinal cord injury will be assessed at the beginning and end of the trial by asking participants to rate 10 statement on a 11-point numerical analogue scale anchored at one end with "not confident" and at the other end with "highly confident". This assessment will be administered online in an exam situation with teacher supervision. </outcome>

    <concealment>2nd and 3rd year undergraduate physiotherapy students from the Bangladesh Health Professions Institute (BHPI) will be approached by their teachers and invited to participate in the study.
Allocation to groups will be concealed. So once a student is accepted onto the study and completes the baseline assessments, an independent person in Sydney will allocate each student to either the experimental or control condition. Each student will then be individually emailed and told their allocation. The teachers in Bangladesh will remain blinded to students' allocation. </concealment>
    <sequence>Students will be randomly allocated to one of two groups by an independent person. The allocation will be generated by computer using a stratified (2nd year student versus 3rd year student) and blocked randomisation schedule. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physiotherapy students require specialised knowledge and training in spinal cord injury (SCI). Physiotherapy education has traditionally occurred using face-to face teaching methods. Recently, online learning has become common in universities and teaching institutions worldwide. Online learning is popular with universities and teaching institutions because it is cost effective. It is popular with students because it is flexible and makes use of technology familiar to them. Despite widespread use little is known about the optimal mode of delivery for online learning. Many randomised controlled trials have investigated online education of healthcare professionals. Most of these trials have indicated that online learning is an effective mode of delivery. However none of these trials have occurred in a country like Bangladesh or involved physiotherapy students. Furthermore none of these trials have investigated Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) as a mode of delivery. Therefore the purpose of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of self-directed delivery of online learning with delivery via a Massive Online Open Course on student knowledge, self-efficacy and satisfaction. </summary>
