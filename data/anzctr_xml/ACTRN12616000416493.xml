    <concealment>To ensure subsequent unbiased randomisation and allocation concealment, the randomisation sequence will be developed by the manager of the PAH clinical trials service, who is independent of the study team. The trial manager will notify the team by email of the allocation of each patient only after baseline measures are taken. De-identified supplements will already be randomised prior to delivery to the recruitment sites and all staff involved in recruitment will be blinded to this randomisation. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>What the is aim of this study? The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of ginger supplementation for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. 
Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are aged 18 years or older, and are scheduled to begin your first regimen of chemotherapy using an agent classed as moderately or severely emetogenic, 
What does it involve? Participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either 1.2g ginger supplementation or a placebo per day in capsule form for five days of each of the first three chemotherapy cycles. Participants will complete a number of questionnaires relating to quality of life, control of nausea and vomiting and fatigue at baseline prior to commencing supplementation and five days after each of the first three chemotherapy cycles. 
It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on the efficacy of supplemental ginger for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting for cancer patients.</summary>
