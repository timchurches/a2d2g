    <interventions>Comprehensive training for GPs and practice nurses in the intervention practices, in the performance and interpretation of spirometry, and encouragement to integrate spirometry use into their asthma management.   The intervention will comprise a minimum of 6 hrs formal training, provided in the first 2 months after randomisation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>As general practice is the first point of contact within the Australian health system for patients with asthma, it is important that all available tools are used to provide the best care possible.  Accurate and reproducible measurement of airflow obstruction, as measured by spirometry, is a vital part of the management of people with asthma.  However the use of valid spirometry in general practice is low.  This study aims to examine the potential benefits to patients of using spirometry in the management of asthma in both children and adults, when GPs and staff have been properly trained in the best way to do it and to interpret the results.</summary>
