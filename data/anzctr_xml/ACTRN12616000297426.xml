  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will involve attending a single half day Herehere Aukati training hui (meeting).

   The training, which will be facilitated by expert traditional weavers, kaumatua (elders) and the Trial research team, will provide participants with a background to the Aukati restriction ritual  its traditional use, cultural application and how Aukati will be used to aid stopping smoking.  In the Aukati session, a brief Aukati karakia (incantation) will be taught to participants.  These karakia when recited on their target quit day will commence the Aukati for intervention participants.  The karakia will also be used as cessation tools to overcome urges.  The intervention per participant will be three months. 

Within these hui a background to the wristbands and their connection to symbolising not smoking will be given to participants.   Cultural considerations in weaving will be introduced and participants will learn to weave their own wristband to wear once they commence their Aukati.   
 
Treatment participants will be required to set a quit date no longer than 3 days following the training.  The ability to set a quit date within this timeframe will be a requirement of registration. 

Monitoring of the intervention will be briefly (less than 15 minutes) kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) for weeks 4 &amp; 12.  This will involve a one to one session with a member of the research team in which Carbon Monoxide monitoring will occur and a series of questions about their smoking status.  At 7 days from quit day and then fortnightly the research team will contact participants for followup by their nominated best method of contact .  The Trial will have an active Facebook page where participants will be able to also ask questions and provide support to each other.
   
The Treatment described here will, with improvement from process evaluation tasks undertaken in the Pilot be utilised in the Transferability testing.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome for the trial is the proportion of smokers with self- reported and verified biochemical continuous abstinence at 12 weeks from the quit date.  Abstinence will be defined by using the Russell Standard (that is: intention to treat analysis, only have smoked (if any) a total of five cigarettes from the quit date and biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence through an exhaled carbon monoxide device with a reading of less than 10 ppm (parts per million) </outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>In this trial, the inclusion criteria will include self-identified Maaori who self- identify as current smokers with an inhaled carbon monoxide machine reading of greater than or equal to 4ppm , aged 16 years or over (Perkins, Karlitz &amp; Jao, 2013).  Participants will be required to also complete the Fagerstrom Test for Dependence (Heatherton, et al., 1991).  The score must be equal to or greater than 5 for enrolement.  Smokers must be seeking support to stop smoking and agree to the set a quit date as per their allocated group guidelines.    
Pregnant and breastfeeding women can and will be included in this study as will people with severe illness, mental health, and drug and alcohol addictions.  Participants must be willing and able to provide consent, understand their role as a participant in the study and willing to comply with study procedures</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>People that were unable or unwilling to provide their own informed consent for their participation, non-smokers with a reading of less than 4 ppm, under the age of 16 years old and non-Maaori will be excluded from participating in the trial.  People unable to agree to setting a target quit day according to whatever group they are allocated to will be excluded also.   </exclusivecriteria>

    <purpose>Educational / counselling / training</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All potential participants that contact the research team to register will be assessed by the research assistant to see if they meet the inclusion criteria for the trial (age, smoking status, Fagerstrom Test for Dependence {FTFD} (Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, Fagerstrom, 1991)). Eligible participants will be asked to fill a demographic data survey (if not in person met, the research assistant will do this over the phone).  All participants that meet the inclusion 
criteria will then be enrolled in the study. and will be allocated a number on with 001 and ending at 150.
Participants will be randomised as soon as they are registered.  Participants randomised to control will be referred immediately to a provider of “usual care”.  The staggering of participants will ensure that services are able to logistically cope with the referrals.    
The intervention group will receive a panui (notice) no more than 3 days following their randomisation inviting them to attend the next available Herehere Aukati training hui.    </concealment>
    <sequence>    

Opaque sealed envelopes containing equal numbers of intervention and control have been created.  Envelopes contain no markings and will be shuffled by the research assistant prior to their use.  For each participant registration, the research assistant will open one envelope to reveal whether or not that participant will be allocated to either control or treatment.  Randomisation will be stratified minimally by sex and level of nicotine dependence.   </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The intention-to-treat principle will be followed for statistical analyses and the imputation method for missing data will be conservative whereby non-responders will be classified as smokers.   
Characteristics will be compared between the groups at baseline, 7 day point prevalence, fortnightly follow-up and testing at 4 and 12 weeks from quit day using independent t tests for continuous variables, or chi- square tests for categorical variables as appropriate.   
Preliminary analyses using models appropriate for the distribution of the variables will be undertaken to determine variables that differ between treatment groups, and between those with complete and incomplete follow-up data.   </statisticalmethods>
