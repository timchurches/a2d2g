  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will comprise an online intervention complemented with face-to-face and phone meetings with a dietitian and exercise physiologist.
The intervention group will complete an 8 week intervention comprising online education modules complemented with active components facilitated by health professionals. Each week there will be a module or active component to be completed. Each module will take approximately 1 hour to complete and can be completed in as many as sittings as they choose. After the first introductory module, each educational module will be followed in the next week by the complementary active component covering the same topic and the last week will be a revision module covering all content. 
The four online modules cover: 
-Dementia risk and protective factors, literacy around dementia and cognitive impairment; 
-Healthy eating and how to incorporate aspects of a Mediterranean diet into daily life; 
-The concept of cognitive engagement and how to maintain mental stimulation through hobbies and habits; and 
-What types of physical activity are required to reduce dementia risk and how to set and achieve goals.
These online modules are all based on evidence based dementia risk reduction.

Active components are started during the 8 week intervention period (during weeks listed below) and continued until the conclusion of the study (week 32):
-Diet (facilitated by a dietitian): Participants have a 1 hour dietitian consultation in week 3 about how to increase adherence to a Mediterranean diet. This is followed up by two, 30 minute phone calls at weeks 10 and 21. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be monitored the healthy eating quiz and a Mediterranean diet measure (full details under secondary outcomes).
-Cognitive Engagement (through online brain training website Brain HQ): From week 5 onwards participants complete two executive function tasks (Double Decision &amp; Freeze Frame) and two memory tasks (Memory Grid &amp; Syllable Stacks) for 30 minutes per task, per week (total 2 hours/week). Adherence to the cognitive engagement intervention will be monitored through the Brain HQ website (full details under secondary outcomes).
-Physical Exercise (facilitated by an exercise physiologist): Participants have a 1 hour exercise physiologist consultation in week 7. The exercise physiologist will create an exercise program with the participants, incorporating types of physical activity that the participant enjoys and are safe and appropriate for the participant's level of fitness and any medical conditions they may have. The eventual aim is to increase physical activity to 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. The exercise physiologist follows up the participant with two, 30 minute phone calls at weeks 10 and 21. Adherence to the physical activity intervention will be monitored by physical activity calendars to be completed by participants (full details under secondary outcomes).</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will undertake the same online modules as the intervention group: dementia risk and protection, literacy around dementia and cognitive impairment; healthy eating and how to incorporate aspects of a Mediterranean diet into daily life; the concept of cognitive engagement and how to keep more mentally challenged through hobbies and habits; and what types of physical activity are required to reduce dementia risk and how to set these goals and reach them.

The control participants will receive only the educational modules and none of the active components. </comparator>

This will retain 36 participants per group at the final follow-up. This sample size will enable the detection of a difference between groups at six months of 0.70 standard deviations for primary and secondary outcomes, which equates to approximately 4.2 units for ADAS-Cog and 4.0 units on ANU-ADRI.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Body, Brain, Life Program for Mild Cognitive Impairment (BBL-MCI) is an online lifestyle modification program for people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive decline (SCD). MCI is a condition in which there are cognitive deficits in memory and other areas of thought, but these deficits are not sufficient to meet the criteria of a dementia diagnosis. SCD is condition where people are aware of and are concerned about minor cognitive deficits in day to day life, most often memory. People with MCI and SCD are at increased risk of dementia and there is some overlap in these groups, both are being included in this project.
The aim of the study is to reduce dementia risk in these high risk groups and prevent further cognitive decline. The project will involve 4 online informational modules and 3 practical components. The online modules will be comprised of: A module on dementia literacy and risk factors; physical activity; diet and cognitive engagement. The practical components will enable participants to integrate physical activity, diet and cognitive engagement into their everyday lives. 
There are two research aims in this project:
(i) Evaluate the effectiveness of BBL-MCI in the prevention of cognitive decline in individuals with MCI/SCD
(ii) Evaluate the effectiveness of BBL-MCI to reduce overall risk for Alzheimer's disease and dementia as measured on the ANU-ADRI.</summary>
