  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and patient acceptance of High Frequency (HF) Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Main study endpoints will assess pain relief, functional capacity and quality of life improvements over a 12 month period.</summary>
