  <interventions>
    <interventions>A questionnaire including the K10, the general health question from the SF-36 and questions about the symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency will be self-administered (with the support of health staff) in their own language by newly arrived refugees from Bhutan, Afghanistan and Iran. Some participants will have Vitamin B12 deficiency (&lt;150pmol/L), some will have borderline Vitamin B12 (150-240pmol/L) and some will have normal Vitamin B12 levels. All participants will be treated according to usual clinical protocols with Vitamin B12 injections if they have deficiency, dietary advice if they have borderline levels and no treatment if theyhave normal Vitamin B12 levels. The questionnaire will be administered to all participants again after 4 months and those with low or borderline Vitamin B12 will have their levels repeated.</interventions>
    <comparator>The controls in this study are those participants with normal Vitamin B12 levels. Answers to the questionnaire will be compared in the three groups initially and after four months. Answers to the K10 will also be compared with those from the NSW Government Health Survey (2006) and the answers to the general health question will be compared with those from the ABS National Health Survey (2004-2005).</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, memory difficulties, unusual sensations in legs and feet and psycholgocial distress are reliable indictors of Vitamin B12 deficiency in newly arrived refugees. A questionnaire consisting of the Kessler 10 (K10) Psychological Distress scale, the general health question from the SF-36 and questions about the symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency will be asked. Blood tests fro Vitamin B12 levels will be taken</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Whether symptoms and perception of health change as Vitamin B12 normalises. A questionnaire consisting of the Kessler 10 (K10) Psychological Distress scale, the general health question from the SF-36 and questions about the symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency will be asked.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>High levels of Vitamin B12 deficiency were recently found in some refugee groups in studies in Australia and USA (Benson, 2010; CDC, 2011). The cause of the deficiency is unknown but is thought to be due to dietary deficiency in animal source foods or because of infection with helicobacter pylori. 
There is a well-known relationship of Vitamin B12 deficiency with depression and other problems such as fatigue, irritability, memory problems and unusual sensations in legs and feet (Oh, 2003). These symptoms are often used as indicators of Vitamin B12 deficiency however there have been no studies to date to determine if these are reliable indictors, or whether they are present in all refugees with Vitamin B12 deficiency. Many refugees have psychological problems, (Steel, 2009) as well as fatigue, irritability, dizziness and memory difficulties, but it is unknown whether these symptoms may also be linked to Vitamin B12 deficiency in this population. 
As refugees settle into a new country their diet and psychological health is likely to change. A control group will assist in adjusting for confounding factors.
This pilot study aims to identify:
1.	whether  symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, memory difficulties, unusual sensations in legs and feet and psychological distress are reliable indictors of Vitamin B12 deficiency in newly arrived refugees
2.	whether these  symptoms change as Vitamin B12 deficiency normalises 
3.	whether there is a difference in symptomatology and perceptions of general health in newly arrived refugees with and without Vitamin B12 deficiency.</summary>
