  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a recent series of studies performed by our group, we have shown that exposure to
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT) leads to an increase in insulin sensitivity in male subjects and
      that this improvement can be measured in all men, not just those with diabetes. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the time course of this effect and explore the mechanisms
      involved when exposure to HBOT induces an increase in peripheral insulin sensitivity.

      Aims:

        1. To determine whether the insulin sensitising effect of HBOT is apparent 24-hours after
           an HBO session.

        2. To examine mechanisms underpinning the increase in insulin sensitivity following HBOT.</summary>
