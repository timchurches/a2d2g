  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a phase 1, First-In-Human, open label study, trialing a new PARP inhibitor medication IMP4297 in participants with advanced solid tumour.  
Six different dosage cohorts 2mg, 6mg, 10mg, 20mg, 30mg and 40mg will be used to establish the maximum tolerated dosage. First participant  in each dosing cohort will be administered one dose of IMP4297 capsule, followed by a wash out period of at least 5 half-lives or 7 days.  Safety information such as pathology result or adverse events experienced will be collected following first dosing. This will be reviewed by the a safety review committee that is made up of the Principal Investigator, Medical Monitor, the study Sponsor and a representative from the Clinical Research Organisation, which will collectively determine if it is safe to proceed to continue with the next scheduled dosing cohort.  Participant will proceed with repeat once daily dose at the same dose level for 3 weeks.  Each repeat dose treatment cycle will be composed of 3 weeks (Day 1 to Day 21).  IMP4297 will be administered by participants at home. Participants will be instructed to bring unused IMP4297 capsules with them to each visit for trial staff to review and confirm amount of IMP4297capsules taken since the last visit. The administration of the IMP4297 capsules will be recorded. Study drug compliance will be assessed using these records in conjunction with a count of unused IMP4297 capsules. Participants who are benefiting from IMP4297 may have the possibility of treatment beyond 1 year at the investigator's discretion.  Participants who experience disease progression or unacceptable side effects, are not compliant with study protocol or in the opinion of the investigator will have IMP4297 administration discontinued and study participation will be terminated.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple doses of IMP4297 administered to participants with advanced solid tumors. This is assessed by the participating investigator through the results of ECG monitoring, pathology blood collection, vital sign monitoring and recording of adverse events in accordance to CTCAE version 4.03.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability will be assessed  and reviewed prior to opening the next cohort of dose escalation.  This is assessed by ECG and vital sign monitoring, adverse event recording and pathology blood collection on Single dose Day 1, Cycle 1 Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 of each cohort.  This will be reviewed at prior to each dosing cohort  by the Safety review committee to assess the incidences, natures  relatedness and severity of adverse events, changes in vital signs, changes in pathology blood tests, changes in ECG, changes in physical examination, changes in ECOG.  Dose escalation and opening of the next cohort will occur only after acceptable tolerability has been demonstrated throughout the entire Cycle 1. Participants may be required to stay overnight in hospital for observation of any side effects following first dose of each single dosing cohort.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The second composite primary endpoint for the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of IMP4297.  The Safety review committee will assess the incidences, natures  relatedness and severity of adverse events, changes in vital signs, changes in pathology blood tests, changes in ECG, changes in physical examination, changes in ECOG at each DLT assessment window (Single dose and Cycle 1 Day 1 to 21).  Dose escalation and opening of the next cohort will occur only after acceptable tolerability has been demonstrated throughout the entire Cycle 1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety and tolerability will be assessed  and reviewed prior to opening the next cohort of dose escalation</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single and multiple doses of IMP4297 in participants with advanced solid tumour</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pharmacokinetic (PK) pathology blood collection will be performed for every cohort during single dosing, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2.  
At single dosing cohort, PK pathology bloods will be collects pre dose dosing and post dosing at time points: 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 8 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 30 hours and 48 hours. 
At Cycle 1, PK pathology bloods will be collects pre dose dosing on Day 1, Day 2, Day 8, Day 15, Day 16 and Day 21. Post dose PK pathology blood collections will be performed on Day 1, 15 and 21 at time points: 30 min, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 8 hours. 
Pre dosing PK pathology blood collection will be collected on Cycle 2 Day 1.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study details: 
This clinical trial aims to establish the safety and tolerability profile of the drug IMP4297, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMP4297, and to evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of IMP4297 in study participants with advanced solid malignancy that has progressed on, or failed to respond to, at least one prior systemic therapy. The secondary purposes of this trial are to assess the distribution of IMP4297 at various time points (pharmacokinetics) and to also obtain preliminary information on the antitumour activity of IMP4297. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have histologically or cytologically documented, incurable, advanced solid malignancy that has progressed on, or failed to respond to, at least one prior systemic therapy. Patients with breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer are preferred. Study details Participants in this trial will initially receive a single dose of the drug IMP4297 to allow an assessment of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK). The drug is administered orally in a tablet form. If tolerated, participants will then proceed one week later to receive a daily dose of IMP4297 for 3 weeks. This treatment cycle will then continue until unacceptable toxicity is indicated, the disease progresses, or the study participant withdraws his/her consent; or the study participant meets any other criteria for withdrawal. Up to 6 dose levels are planned to investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IMP4297. This trial employs a stepwise dose escalation scheme which allows the safety and tolerability of each dose level to be evaluated before study participants are exposed to a higher dose level. Participants will be required to give blood samples and undergo regular clinical assessments in order to evaluate treatment safety and tolerability. </summary>
