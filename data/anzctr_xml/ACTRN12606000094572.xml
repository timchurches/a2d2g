  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cadexomer iodine dressing (Iodosorb)

Cadexomer iodine dressing (Iodosorb) is applied topically to the wounds. It is delivered according to the Iodosorb instructions for the wound whilst signs of infection and critical colonisation are evident in the wound. This time period may vary from wound to wound. The criteria for removing the client from the antimicorbial is consistent in the Iodosorb conditions. All participants will be monitored for a three month period.

Within the approved Iodosorb range of products the following dressings would be applied with the following frequency though clinical judgement is permited to alter this scheduled dependent on the wound characteristics (for instance to more frequent dressing changes for highly exudating wounds)
Idosorb Powder (9m/g Iodine) - three daily
Iodosorb Paste (0.9%w/w Iodine Ph. Eur) - three daily 

Potentially a study participant could become eligible to cease an antimicrobial 1 week and 1 day after commencing the trial as a minimum time they could receive the treatment with the maximum time a person could receive an antimicrobial being the full three month study period or 12 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat)

Nanocrystalline silver dressing (Acticoat) is applied topically to the wounds. It is delivered according to the Acticoat product instructions for the wound whilst signs of infection and critical colonisation are evident in the wound. This time period may vary from wound to wound. The criteria for removing the client from the antimicorbial is consistent in Acticoat conditions. All participants will be monitored for a three month period.

Within the approved Acticoat range of products the following dressings would be applied with the following frequency though clinical judgement is permited to alter this scheduled dependent on the wound characteristics (for instance to more frequent dressing changes for highly exudating wounds)
Acticoat Absorbant - three daily changes
Acticoat 3 - three daily changes
Acticoat 7 - once weekly.
The concentration of ionic silver released from Acticoat is 70-100 ppm.

Potentially a study participant could become eligible to cease an antimicrobial 1 week and 1 day after commencing the trial as a minimum time they could receive the treatment with the maximum time a person could receive an antimicrobial being the full three month study period or 12 weeks.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Wound size</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline wound size will be determined at recruitment using digital imaging software (AMWIS). Fortnightly wound photographs will be taken until the wound is healed or when the participant completes their three month time on the study.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Percentage of wound healing</outcome>
      <timepoint>Basline wound size will be determined at recruitment using digital imaging software (AMWIS). Fortnightly wound photographs will be taken until the wound is healed or when the participant completes their three month time on the study.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Time to healing - to be calculated at baseline and then fortnightly for the remainder of the 3 month study period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to healing was calculated from wound size measurements assessed using the Advanced Medical Wound Imaging System V2.2 (AMWIS) software. This software calculates the total surface area of a wound from calibrated digital photographs. Photographs were taken at recruitment (baseline) and at two weekly intervals for 12 weeks or less if the client healed. 
A daily healing rate was generated by determining the percentage change in the total surface area between wound size measures.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Wound characteristics -to be calculated at baseline and then fortnightly for the remainder of the 3 month study period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Wound characteristics were assessed using categorical questions regarding the presence of signs of bacterial burden collected at baseline and every 2 weeks for 12 weeks or until healing if this occurs first. The presence of tissue types in the wound was also assessed using the Advanced Medical Wound Imaging System V2.2 (AMWIS) software which allows tracing and sizing of the percentage of the wound represented by different tissue types such as necrotic tissue, slough, granulating tissue etc. Data were collected at recruitment (baseline) and at two weeks  for 12 weeks or less if the client healed.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>3. Bacteria type and quantity in wound. </outcome>
      <timepoint>To be determined at baseline and then when a client ceases or recommences the antimicrobial treatment baseline on a protocol of signs of infection and critical colonisation, at 6 weeks if the participant has not ceased the use of an antimicrobial and at 12 weeks in the participant is still using an antimicrobial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>4. Relationship of health status, medication use, and demographic variables with healing. </outcome>
      <timepoint>To be ascertained at baseline. Antibiotic use to be further monitored during fortnightly data collection.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>5. Cost of care and resource use to be calculated at baseline and then fortnightly for the remainder of the 3 month study period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Calculated for the total study period - 12 weeks or less if the wound healed</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>6. Client satisfaction regarding comfort, pain and impact of treatment. </outcome>
      <timepoint>To be determined via a survey administered when the participant completed their antimicrobial treatment or at the end of the three month study period if the client has not ceased the use of the antimicrobial.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will compare the effectiveness of two different ways of treating leg ulcers that are infected or slow to heal.  The treatments being compared are cadexomer iodine (Iodosorb® product range), and a silver impregnated dressing (Acticoat® product range). It is hypothesised that one of these treatments will lead to quicker healing and reduced cost compared to the other commonly used dressing.</summary>
