  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be rendomised pre sinus surgery to receive either a single spray of modified Moffats (adrenaline + cocaine) or dilute adrenaline as nasal preparation (active control).  

Modified moffats solution contains 100mg cocaine, 1mg adrenaline and normal saline made to a 10ml solution.  This is administered 5ml either side into the nose pre-surgry

Adrenaline contains 10 ml 1:10,000 (1mg) sprayed 5ml either side into the nose pre-surgery

Surgery will be carried out as normal</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control group will be patients receiving adrenaline containining 10 ml 1:10,000 (1mg) sprayed 5ml either side into the nose pre-surgery</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the amount and duration of systemic cocaine absorption administered by intranasal atomised modified Moffats solution during ESS (composite primary outcome)

Blood samples will be taken to assess cocaine plasma levels

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken at: baseline (pre administration of Moffats solution), 10mins, 20mins, 30mins, 60mins, 120mins, 6hrs, 12hrs</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether this systemically absorbed cocaine has an effect on depth of anaesthesia during ESS by comparing this with patients receiving only a dilute adrenaline spray.

This will be assessed using a a BIS Registered Trademark sensor to determine depth of anaesthesia. BIS Registered Trademark sensors monitor a patient's electroencephalogram (EEG) and using a proprietary algorithm give a number to represent the depth of anaesthesia. The BIS Registered Trademark monitor used for this study will be a bilateral sensor that will provide a spectral array of EEG.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The BIS Registered Trademark monitoring will be carried out during induction and entire anaesthetic given for the operation.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) requires pre-surgery medication applied into the nose to minimise bleeding.  At Monash Health we either use a solution called modified Moffats solution which contains cocaine, adrenaline and saline, or just adrenaline with saline.  Although acting inside the nose a small percentage of both adrenaline and cocaine may be absorbed into the blood.  The absorption may depend on the concentration, method of application and time in contact with the lining of the nose.  Overall there exists limited research looking at cocaine absorption in the context of sinus surgery.  Specifically, no studies have looked at modified Moffats solution sprayed into the nose. It is important that we determine how much and for how long cocaine is absorbed so we can advise patients appropriately after the operation.
 
Additionally, it is thought that cocaine may affect a brain chemical called dopamine, and this may in turn affect how much anaesthetic is required to keep you asleep. The study will aim to look at how deeply patients sleep after being administered either the Modified Moffats spray or the adrenaline spray.

Overall we will aim to enroll a total of 30 patients.  Half (15) will receive the modified Moffats solution prior to surgery and the other half (15) will receive the dilute adrenaline prior to surgery.

Blood samples taken during and after surgery will measure cocaine blood levels.</summary>
