The MID response is defined as a reduction = 5 points from Baseline in the weekly itch severity score. The weekly itch severity score is the sum of the daily itch severity scores over 7 days and ranges from 0 to 21. The daily itch severity score is the average of the morning and evening scores on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe).

The daily urticarial activity score is the average of the morning and evening urticarial activity scores and ranges from 0 to 6. The urticarial activity score is the sum of ratings on a scale of 0 to 3 (0=none to 3=intense/severe) for (1) the number of wheals (hives) and (2) itch intensity over the previous 12 hours, ranges from 0 to 6, and is measured twice daily (morning and evening). The Baseline score is the sum of the daily urticarial activity scores over the 7 days prior to the first treatment. A higher urticarial activity score indicates more urticaria activity.</outcome>

    <summary>The study is a global Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      parallel-group study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omalizumab administered
      subcutaneously as an add-on therapy for the treatment of adolescent and adult patients aged
      12-75 who have been diagnosed with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) who remain symptomatic
      despite standard-dosed H1 antihistamine treatment (including doses up to 4 times above the
      approved dose level), H2 blockers, and/or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA).</summary>
