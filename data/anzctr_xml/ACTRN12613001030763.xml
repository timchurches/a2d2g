  <interventions>
    <interventions>Each participant will be randomised to one of three conditions: 1) immersive application, consisting of a training program combined with an immersing story delivered via headphones, 2) non-immersive application, consisting of the training program only delivered via headphones, or 3) usual care, where participants will be asked to continue with their usual physical activities. The applications will be installed on participants iPod touch (Registered Trademark) or smartphones and will consist of an 8 week training programme (approximately 25 workouts, 3 per week, with a 35 minutes duration each) designed to improve their fitness and run 5km. An app diary/log will be used by participants to self-report the dates and time they use the app.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to the usual care arm will be asked to continue with their usual physical activities for the duration of the study. The applications will be added to their smartphones/ipods at the end of the trial. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Normative data (The President's Challenge Program, 2013) with percentile scores based on age and test scores for the one mile/1.6 Km run/walk test indicate an average time of approximately 10 minutes for adolescents aged 14-17 in the 25th percentile to complete this test. An improvement in the completion time of this distance equivalent to a shift from the 25th to 50th percentile corresponds to an average of approximately less 78 seconds (standard deviation = 11 seconds) to complete the distance. Based on these data, a sample size of 14 adolescents per group (42 in total) will provide at least 80% power at 5% level of significance (two-sided) to detect a 16 seconds difference in change in running time from baseline between the two groups at the end of the running program, assuming a standard deviation of 15 seconds. Due to an expected 20% loss to follow-up a total sample size of 51 participants will be sought.  All statistical tests will be two-tailed and a 5% significance level maintained throughout the analyses. Baseline characteristics will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be described as numbers of observed and missing values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be described as frequencies and percentages. Results will be presented for each of the treatment groups as well as overall. Outcome evaluation will be performed on the principle of intention to treat (ITT), using data collected from all randomised participants. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) regression model will be used to evaluate the main exposure effect on the primary outcome between groups, adjusting for its baseline measure, important demographics and other potential confounding factors (if they are statistically significant at 5% level). A similar approach will be used for secondary outcome measures.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Public health researchers have begun to investigate innovative approaches such as interactive technologies (mobile phones) to enhance delivery of behaviour change interventions. Even though there are a rapidly growing number of these new technologies available, particularly smartphone applications for health-related behaviour change, their efficacy and actual value still needs to be proven. A prospective randomised study will compare the effectiveness of two smartphone applications in improving cardiorespiratory fitness. Both applications were designed for beginners training to run a 5km distance. Each participant will be randomised to one of three conditions: 1) immersive application, 2) non-immersive application, or 3) usual care. The applications, which will be installed in the participants iPod touch - Registered Trademark - or smartphone, consist of an 8-week training program (approximately 25 workouts, each with a 35 minutes duration) designed to improve their fitness and ability to run 5km. </summary>
