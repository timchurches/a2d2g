  <interventions>
    <interventions>The researcher or research assistent will administer  one drop in each eye  of tropicamide  and phenylephrine in both eyes 60-90 min before the examination.
the ophthalmologist views the retina with the indirect ophthalmoscope, directing its light and optical paths through a hand-held condensing lens. The infants eyes, with pupils pharmacologically dilated, are held open by an eyelid speculum. A scleral depressor is used to indent the wall of the eye to visualize the retinal periphery. The examination takes about 5 minutes. 
We will install the electrodes in the heart of newborn premature chest to measure heart rate to measure heart rate. With the infant in the incubator, face  images will be recorded with a sony camera for further analysis facial during 5 minutes (baseline phase). Heart Rate will aso be monitored second-by-second by Biopac.Two patches / electrodes placed on the chest of the newborn baby while the baby is lying in the crib or incubator. After the instillation of 2 drops of citric acid into infants mouth, neonatal saliva sample will be collected 5-10 min before the start of eye examination. The infant will be transferred to a basinet and swaddle with a blanket. 2min before the eye exam 2ml of human milk will be administered by research assistent via oral using a syringe.The eye examination is performed by an ophthalmologist</interventions>
    <comparator>We wil compare with 0.5/kg sucrose 24% (control group) and 2ml of human milk (Intervention group).

For administration of sucrose or human milk will be used a syringe 3ml without needle, orally administered 2 minutes before the procedure. Sucrose is a lower dosage, it is hospital protocol dosage of 0.5/kg</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart Rate.

The heart rate will be measured through a device that measures heart rate  second per second called Biopac. For that electrodes will be installed to monitor the brand Red Dot 2258-3 chest of the newborn.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline ( before the procedure)-5 min before the eye exam
During the time of eye exam to diagnosis for retinopathy of prematurity. 
Recovery ( after the procedure) -5 min after the eye exam</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Salivary cortisol;</outcome>
      <timepoint>salivary cortisol will be three measures-Baseline (5 min before the eye exam), 30 min after exam (peak cortisol) and 60 min after the start of the eye exam;</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>NFCS - Neonatal Face Coding Systems</outcome>
      <timepoint>NFCS-20s baseline (before the eye exam), 20s final   of the eye exam and 20s final recovery (after the eye exam);</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>State of sleep and wakefulness

To assess the state of sleep and wakefulness follow states of deep sleep to crying, as follows: 1 = deep sleep, active sleep = 2, 3 = drowsy, quiet alert = 4, 5 = active alert, crying = 6. Such states were described by Prechtl (1974) in article The Behavioural States of the Newborn Infant ( A Review).

for baseline and recovery phases, will be coded 5 minutes early. if the phase of the procedure, will be coded continuously since the beginning of the instillation of topical anesthetic until the end of the exam.</outcome>

    <concealment>Only one research assistant will have information about the allocation of groups together with the statistics. The researcher will not know which infants receive human milk or sucrose.

Simple randomisation by using a randomization table created by a computer software.</concealment>
    <sequence>The allocation of premature infants in each group (sucrose-control group or human milk-intervention group ) will be random, using for such a computer program. The study will be blinded, as the principal investigator and others involved with management of research data will not be aware of the group in which each early fall. To this end, a third person will administer sucrose or human milk, using a syringe with 3ml wrapped matte paper.Simple randomisation by using a randomization table created by a computer software</sequence>
