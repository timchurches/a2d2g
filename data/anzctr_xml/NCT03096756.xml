  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GC4702 dry powder
Treatment: drugs - GC4702 lipid suspension
Other interventions - GC4419 IV
Other interventions - Placebo Dry Powder
Other interventions - Placebo lipid suspension
Other interventions - Fed Condition
Other interventions - Fasting Condition
Treatment: drugs - GC4702 lipid suspension - Part 2

Other: Part 1: Single Ascending Dose Escalation GC4702 - Serially increase dose escalation of orally formulated GC4702 or placebo (6:2 ratio), preceded by single dose of active comparator, GC4419 IV.

Experimental: Part 2: Food Effect Study - Following Part 1 dose find, single dose level of GC4702 administered under fasting for and fed condition.


Treatment: drugs: GC4702 dry powder
5 mg GC4702 mixed with approximately 270 mg of Prosolv 90 LM - SMCC (siliconized microcrystalline cellulose). Planned dose levels of GC4702 encapsulated dry powder formulation are 50, 100, and 150 mg

Treatment: drugs: GC4702 lipid suspension
112 mg GC4702 mixed with Miglyol 812 plus 0.5% by weight BHA plus 1% by weight of Aerosil 200. Planned dose levels of GC4702 encapsulated lipid suspension formulation are 112, 224, and 336, 448, and 560 mg

Other interventions: GC4419 IV
infused IV as a single dose of 27 mg (3 mL GC4419 at 9 mg/mL) in 247 mL normal (0.9%) saline, totaling 250 mL, over a 60minute period using a programmable pump.

Other interventions: Placebo Dry Powder
Product matches appearance of the GC4702 dry powder formulation. The Placebo will be 500 mg Miglyol 812 oil containing up to 1% of colloidal silicon dioxide in size 1 capsule.

Other interventions: Placebo lipid suspension
Product matches appearance of the GC4702 lipid suspension formulation. The Placebo will be 500 mg Miglyol 812 oil containing up to 1% of colloidal silicon dioxide in size 1 capsule.

Other interventions: Fed Condition
with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of tap water following a high calorie/high fat meal. Subjects assigned to the fed condition will receive a standard meal per U.S. FDA guidelines7 consisting of high calorie/high fat meal prior to dosing consisting of total calories of 800-1000 of which 150, 250 and 500-600 calories are from protein, carbohydrate and fat, respectively.

Other interventions: Fasting Condition
For the fasting condition, GC4702 will be administered following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, with 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. No food will be allowed for at least 4 hours post-dose. Water will be allowed as desired except for one hour before and after drug administration.

Treatment: drugs: GC4702 lipid suspension - Part 2
Two single doses of GC4702 (dose level to be selected based on Part 1 results), separated by a 7-day washout period

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A Phase 1 study will test the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
      GC4702 when given as an oral tablet. This study will compare capsules containing a dry powder
      or gel suspension of GC4702 when given orally to a similar drug called GC4419 which will be
      given as an intravenous infusion. This study will also assess the effect of food on the
      GC4702 effects.</summary>
