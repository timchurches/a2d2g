  <interventions>
    <interventions>Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is an advanced technique of therapeutic endoscopy for superficial gastrointestinal neoplasms. Three steps characterize it:injecting fluid (several fluids such as saline, glycerol and hyaluronic acid are usually combined with diluted epinephrine) into the submucosa to elevate the lesion,cutting the surrounding mucosa of the lesion, and dissecting the submucosa beneath the lesion.
The amout of fluid varies according to the size of cancer and the amount is appropriate when the fluid injected can make the cancer safe enough for endoscopists to cut it off.
This is a one-off treatment and the duration of ESD itself often varies from one hour to 3 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>Surgery treatment for early esophageal cancer is actually esophagectomy.
Esophagectomy is the removal of a segment of the esophagus; as this shortens the length of the remaining esophagus, some other segment of the digestive tract (typically the stomach or part of the colon) is pulled up to the chest cavity and interposed.
This is a one-off treatment and the duration of esopagectomy  itself often varies from 2 hours to 3 hours.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many articles have showed that ESD is a safe and effective alternative treatment for early esophageal cancer. But there is still no one,which is prospectively randomized and controlled , to compare ESD and surgery for early esophageal cancer .
So our purpose is to compare esd and surgeryfor early esophageal cancer in a prospectively randomized and controlled way.</summary>
