  <interventions>
    <interventions>Subjects will attend 3 visits in the duration of the trial. Exercise sessions will be one-on-one supervised by an exercise physiologist or physiotherapist. Visit 1 will determine each individuals maximum exercise capacity. Baseline assessment will be conducted on a recumbent bike. After a 5 minute warm up of cycling with no resistance, participants will begin to cycle at a low workload (30 Watts for MS patients, 50 Watts for controls). After each completed minute of exercise, workload will be increased by 10 Watts. Maximum workrate is defined as the wattage at the last completed minute of exercise. Visits 2 and 3 will occur on days 7 and 14, allowing a 7 day wash out period between experiments. Participants will exercise for up to 30 minutes at 65% of their determined maximum while wearing a cooling vest cooled to either 10 degrees or 21 degrees. The vest will be worn for 30 minutes seated resting prior to exercise and during warm up and aerobic exercise. All participants (both MS and controls) will take part in both conditions.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both MS and control participants will be randomly assigned their cross-over trial sequence in their 2nd and 3rd trial - cycling at 65% of maximal workload with 10 degrees passive cooling vest and cycling at 65% of maximal workload with 21 degrees sham cooling vest. The Cooling vest is placed in the freezer for 24 hours before testing.  In the sham condition the vest is not frozen, ie left at room temperature. As it is likely that participants will be able to tell if the vest is cooled or not, no placebo effect of sham cooling is anticipated.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Core temperature analysis
The subject will swallow a disposable silicon-coated pill (CorTemp, Human Technology International, Glendora, California, USA) 3 - 8 hours before the beginning of second and third experimental trial. Each pill transmits a harmless low frequency signal to an external receiver which monitors the changes of core body temperature every 5 seconds throughout the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Heart rate analysis
Participant will be wearing a heart rate transmitter strap during all the trials, allowing constant monitoring of the individual's heart rate from the beginning to the end of test (Polar, USA). Subject's resting heart rate, rate of changes of heart rate along the aerobic exercise and heart rate recovery time will be recorded for further analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Blood lactate
Immediately before, and after stopping exercise, blood lactate level will be tested via a finger prick. A drop of blood will be deposited onto a special testing paper and blood lactate concentration will be measured (AccuTrend Lactate, USA). Lactate response to endurance test should &gt;1 mmol/L over baseline if individual's exhaustion is due to cardiovascular fitness or &lt;1 mmol/L by MS induced fatigue (Schulz et al, 2004).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 2nd and 3rd visit (day 0, 7 and 14), pre and post exercise</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived exertion
The subject will rate their perceived exertion using the modified Borg Scale (RPE) (Borg, 1982) at each minute of exercise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived fatigue
Subjects will rate their fatigue levels on a Visual Analogue Scale immediately before, immediately after, and 24 hours after exercise.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Static standing balance test
Participants will stand on a force plate which will record their postural sway as a measure of static standing balance. Measurements will be taken into two conditions, (1) feet together (~0.5cm apart) with eyes open; and (2) feet together (~0.5cm apart) with eyes closed (Ramdharry et al, 2006). Each condition will be repeated 2 times. To ensure safety and prevent falling, there will be a close standby in this procedure and each condition will consist of 30 seconds test, and data will be collected by the force plates. The order of the two balance conditions will be randomized.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14), pre and immediately post exercise completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Reach Test (FRT)
The FRT can capture individual's margin of stability and postural control in balance over a fixed base of support by shifting the centre of gravity (Duncan et al, 1990).The participant will stand next to the wall with their dominant arm raised and out stretched beyond arm's length as far as possible with their hand in fist. The maximum distance of reaching forward from initial hand position to maximal leaning posture will be recorded as the change in position of third finger knuckle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14), pre and immediately post exercise completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>10-Metre Walk Test (10MWT)
This test involves the subject walking along a 10m path and the individual's gait speed will be measured. The subject will be instructed to walk at a comfortable and maximum speed. This will be repeated 2 times and the average time will be recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14), pre and immediately post exercise completion.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time Up and Go Test (TUG)
Performance on the Time Up and Go Test (TUG) is correlated with functional mobility level and risk of fall. All subjects will be seated, and then they will be asked to stand up from the chair, walk to the line on the floor (3 metres), turn around, walk back to the chair and be seated. Timing will start when instructors inform the test can be started and stop when subject is seated again (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). A practice trial that is not timed will be given before testing.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14), pre and immediately post exercise completion</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatigue Severity Scale
The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) (Krupp et al, 1989) is a self-score questionnaire to measure the impact of fatigue on daily function over the last 7 days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2nd and 3rd visit (day 7 and 14), pre and immediately post exercise completion</timepoint>
