    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited through advertising in local newspapers and community bulletin boards. Participants will contact researchers where they will be screened for eligibility over the phone to ensure they are eligible to participate in the study. Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment A or B once allocated a trial participants number.

Randomisation of participants to treatment groups will be determined by random allocation. All participants will be assigned to treatment group A or B using a computer generated random number generator by a disinterested third party. Eligible, recruited participants will be assigned a participant number. The treatment number that has been placed next to the participantâ€™s number will be the allocated treatment for that individual. Randomisation codes will be kept in a password protected computer file. 

Blinding will be achieved by enlisting a person outside of the project to code the treatments, conceal them in sealed opaque containers for dispensing and maintain the key to this code until data collection is completed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The general aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Executive B Stress Formula supplementation on mood and workplace stress in a healthy workplace sample. More specifically, a six month supplementation is expected to improve participants' experience of workplace stress, workplace variables, and mood in conjunction with biological measures.

The participant group will be 165 full time employees, who report feeling stressed in the workplace. These participants will be aged between 30-55 years, who are able to commit to two visits to Swinburne University to provide blood samples and complete computerised cognitive assessments. They will also be asked to complete online questionnaires on a monthly basis. Participants will be randomly assigned to take either Exectutive B tablets or placebo daily for 24 weeks. </summary>
