Experimental: FAR - Facial affect recognition training (with computer assistance)

Experimental: SEI - Stories of Emotional Inference


Behaviour: Facial Affect Recognition Training
A series of pictures of faces displaying various emotions are presented one at a time using a computerized training program.Participants are taught to recognize how emotions affect facial features such as the mouth and eyes.Participants are also taught how to recognize their own emotions.

Other interventions: Stories of Emotional Inference
Participants are presented with a series of short stories one at a time. Each story presents various contextual cues regarding the emotions the characters are likely to experience. Participants learn to connect the cues to specific emotions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of three training programs
      designed to teach persons with acquired brain injury (ABI) to recognize emotions. It is
      hypothesized that the training programs will enhance several aspects of emotion recognition
      in persons with ABI. Furthermore, it is expected that these effects will be maintained over
      time, and will positively influence participants' social behavior and integration.</summary>
