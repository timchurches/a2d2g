  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients allocated to the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) program would receive 8 weekly sessions of group therapy based on the MBCT treatment manual developed by Segal et al (2000).  Modules include an explanation of mindfulness meditation from a cognitive perspective and a series of meditation practices including a breathing meditation, a body scan meditation and mindfulness of walking.  Sessions are administered by a psychologist and last approximately 2 hours.  Participants allocated to this condition also receive written education material about bipolar disorder on a weekly basis for 8 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (TAU) (Standard Care).  The TAU group will receive their usual care from their usual practitioner but will also receive written educational material about bipolar illness on a weekly basis for 8 weeks.  The material will have the same content as those given to the MBCT condition.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatments that target the risk factors for relapse in bipolar disorder are vital if a better prognosis for this disorder is to be achieved. This study will investigate a novel approach to preventing relapse (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy). A randomised controlled trial will be conducted comparing two groups; Mindfulness based Cognitive Therapy and Treatment as Usual (which will include the addition of bipolar education material).</summary>
