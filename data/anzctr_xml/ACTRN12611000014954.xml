  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a observational study. The condition of a vaginal invagination will be described and its clinical presentation will be intraoperatively recorded.
The vaginal invagination will be released as required to proceed with the prolapse surgery. Patient will be followed up 6 weeks and 3 months postoperatively</interventions>
    <comparator>No control group is required. This would be the first description in literature of vaginal invagination.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Description and clinical presentation of vaginal invagination in women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery</outcome>
      <timepoint>A vaginal invagination can only be detected intraoperatively.
An audit will be held as routinely performed in women undergoing prolapse surgery 6 weeks postoperatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of the outcome of the surgical intervention. Patients will be examined according to the ICS POP-Q system (tool to assess the pelvic floor) and patient will be asked to complete the Queensland Pelvic Floor Questionnaire before and after surgery. All patients undergoing pelvic floor surgery are asked to complete this questionnaire and are examined accoriding to the ICS POP-Q system.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this observational project is to identify patients with a vaginal invagination and report the clinical presentation of a series of 20 patients undergoing prolapse surgery. This observational study is conduced to obtain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the vagina after repeat gynaecological surgery.
The hypothesis of this study is that women undergoing prolapse surgery who have had previous pelvic floor surgery are at high risk to present with a vaginal invagination due to incorrect restoring of the normal anatomy of the vagina. Vaginal invagination are likely to be caused by inappropriate surgical techniques and lack of awareness of this subsequent condition. By identification and in the following surgical releasing of the vaginal invagination this might create a better anatomical setting to perform further prolapse surgery. Furthermore it might have an impact on preexisting pain, dysparunia or shortend vagina.</summary>
