    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>After confirming eligibility, participants will be enrolled and randomised using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS). Treatments will be allocated using stratified minimisation. Treatment allocation is double-blind.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised using IVRS into one of three treatment groups and stratified according to:

PIB load 
Memory performance at baseline</sequence>
    <masking>Blinded (masking used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures />
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>For this phase II study, the proportion of successes in each of the randomised groups, together with the 95% confidence intervals will be reported. While there is no intention to make formal comparisons between the groups, exploratory comparisons may be conducted to obtain estimates of the plausible range of success rates in order to better inform any subsequent studies. For continuous variables, comparisons will be made using the t-test, and chi-squared tests will be used for categorical variables. Time-to-event will be described using the Kaplan-Meier and comparisons made using the logrank test. Exploratory analyses examining the impact of other variables will be performed using multiple regression (linear, logistic and proportional hazards) techniques. 

The variability of PiB readings is approximately 5% and based and an absolute improvement in the PiB score of between 2% and 4% would still be considered a success (as no PiB deterioration is considered clinically worthwhile). Currently, it is anticipated that 1% of untreated (placebo control) participants would demonstrate a success at 13 months. For the intervention to be considered worthwhile to evaluate further in a broader population or larger study, this proportion would be required to be at least 7%. The primary outcome of this study will be a success as measured by a 4% improvement in the baseline PiB score and the primary endpoint for the study will be the proportion of successes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study we propose to identify a cohort of 200 men who have a higher than normal PiB in the brain, who are experiencing Subjective Memory Complaints but are not symptomatic for Alzheimer's disease. These men will be treated with testosterone (intramuscular injection), with and without DHA (oral administration) over 56 weeks. The study will evaluate the ability of testosterone &amp; DHA to reduce the levels of LH, beta amyloid levels and subsequent impact on amyloid PIB load in the brain.  
This study will look at the effects of study treatment on brain images (MRI, PET scans), participants scores on psychometric tasks, neuropsychological questionnaires (measurement of memory loss and thinking ability) tests and the effect of treatment on different blood biomarkers.
