  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Small cell lung cancer is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumour that often presents with
      extensive (metastatic) disease. Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, with radiotherapy
      to the primary tumour. It is now part of care to also offer Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation
      (PCI) in order to prevent spread of the cancer into the brain.

      Cognitive impairment can result after cranial irradiation. Lithium is thought to be
      neuroprotective. It is hypothesized that lithium administration with PCI will be safe,
      tolerable and feasible, and can be studied to prevent or ameliorate the ensuing cognitive
      impairment.</summary>
