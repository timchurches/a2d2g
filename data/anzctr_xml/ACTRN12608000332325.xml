  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will consume a 60 mL fruit puree drink or placebo immediately before and after a 30 minute session of exercise on a rowing ergometer.  The fruit used is derived from commercial cultivars and the dosage does not exceed the equivalent dietary recommendations.  Plasma markers and salivary hormones will be monitored at several time points including before and after exercise and later that same day.  The exercise session will be repeated with the alternate drink/placebo following a washout period of one week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will consume 60 mL of a placebo drink containing 10% sucrose and 2 mg/mL food-grade ascorbic acid.  This will be consumed immediately before and after a 30 minute session of exercise on a rowing ergometer.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Allocation is assigned by a single fellow scientist who is not associated with the work. No participants or trial researchers are aware of the allocation. Allocation is held concealed until completion of the trial and analysis of the data is finalised.  The identification of kiwifruit and placebo drinks is concealed from trial researchers by labelling with letters.</concealment>
