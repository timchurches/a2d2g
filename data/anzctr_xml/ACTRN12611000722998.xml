    <scientifictitle>In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and feeding difficulties, is traditional operant conditioning intervention more effective than novel systematic desensitisation  intervention at improving dietary variety and nutrition, and decreasing maladaptive mealtime behaviours and parental stress?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm One: One-on-one behaviour modification therapy Run in an individual session for 1 hour per week over ten weeks (weekly schedule) or 10 times over one week (intensive schedule) Involves providing a verbal prompt to encourage consumption of spoonfuls of new food/s, with positive reinforcement (verbal and/or with toys etc) upon consumption of these foods. Parents initially observe from behind a one-way mirror and assist in collecting information about the behaviours they are observing in their child. As sessions continue, parents are transitioned into the room, and are trained to offer new foods and provide positive reinforcement by the end of the therapy block. Parents also receive standardised information about nutrition, behaviour management and feeding development. Arm Two: Systematic desensitisation therapy Run in an individual session for 1 hour per week over ten weeks (weekly schedule) or 10 times in one week (intensive schedule) Involves the child being exposed to gradually more challenging modelling and play with food (based on a sensory hierarchy of look&gt;touch&gt;smell&gt;taste). Parents initially observe the sessions from behind a one-way mirror with a second therapist and assist in observing transitions and reactions in their children. As the block continues, parents are rotated in and out of the room to assist in modelling play using the sensory hierarchy. Parents also receive standardised information about nutrition, behaviour management and feeding development.</interventions>
    <comparator>Natural control will be waiting for therapy. These children will either be offered input via an intensive schedule (as described above) or during a subsequent 10-week block. As recruitment for this study will occur in an ongoing fashion, there will be multiple opportunities to access therapy if it is not immediately available.</comparator>

Assessed via 3-day weighed food diary, modified Children's Dietary Questionnaire (Magarey et al. 1999)(food frequency questionnaire) and New Food Lists, where parents indicate in an ongoing fashion how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances or rejections</outcome>

      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime behaviours (% desirable vs undesirable behaviours; mealtime duration)

Measured via Behaviour Pediatrics Feeding Assessment (Adapted from Crist et al. 2001), and self-developed HELP study: Eating Skills and Behaviours Questionnaire. Questionnaires involve parent-rated likert scales (parents rate level of concern).</outcome>

      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime interactions between parent and child

Measured via Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (Revised) (Eyberg, 1994). A video-tape is taken of the parent interacting with their child in a non-food related activity, a parent offering their child a preferred food, and the parent offering their child a non-preferred food. All videos will be rated externally by the team psychologist who will not be working directly with the children involved.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in parental stress (overall and mealtime specific)

      <timepoint>Immediately post-intervention
3 months post-intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Increased interest in trying unfamiliar foods

Measured with Children's Picky Eating Questionnaire (Adapted from Carruth and Skinner, 2000) and New Foods Lists, where parents indicate in an ongoing fashion how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances or rejections.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical benefits, and cost-effectiveness of two feeding treatment programs for children with ASD and feeding difficulties, including a restricted range of dietary intake (&lt;30 foods across the food groups). Baseline assessment will include parent-completed questionnaires and on-site (Herston) feeding and growth assessments. There are two arms of intervention. Arm One is an individual behaviour modification program. Arm Two involves individual systematic desensitisation therapy. Both arms will involve  parent education regarding nutrition and behaviour management for children with feeding difficulties. Intervention will be provided over two phases. Parents will elect to participate in weekly intervention (10 sessions over 10 weeks) or intensive intervention (10 sessions over one week).</summary>
