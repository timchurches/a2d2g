  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Implantation of rigid iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) is considered as a promising alternative for high myopia. However, a conventional large sclerocorneal or scleral incision is commonly needed for this PIOL implantation because of the polymethylmethacrylate material. Thus, it involves much ocular tissue manipulation and surgical time, which should induce the postoperative astigmatisms and affect the rapid postoperative visual recovery. Although the foldable version of lens has been created recently, it is a rather new technique and long-term evaluation is not available. Therefore, the rigid PIOL is still a widely accepted and frequently used means for high myopia, especially in developing countries. Therefore, we present a novel surgical technique that is specially designed for rigid PIOL implantation and compare it with conventional scleral incision. This study aimed to compare the postoperative visual outcomes of these two incisions for the surgical correction of high myopia.</summary>
