  <interventions>
    <interventions>Culturally appropriate low back pain information presented as audiovisual scenarios. There are five scenarios, each 3-7 minutes long. they will be administered on a laptop computer, ipad or played on a TV screen. 
This is a crossover trial - participants will be randomised to intervention/control group and crossover after post intervention testing (time 1). Washout period will be minimal - 15 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional form of low back pain information - 'The Back Book'. The Back Book is a 23 page consumer information resource. It contains evidence based information about low back pain. It differs from the intervention in mode of delivery (brochure versus audiovisual) and style (the Back Book is information/fact based rather than presenting as an enacted scenario).  </comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Other interventions</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Low back pain beliefs - assessed using an adapted version of the Back Pain Beliefs Questionnaire (BBQ).  The BBQ has been adapted so the language is appropriate to the audience. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention and post interventions 1 and 2</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived self-efficacy to manage low back pain - measured using a single item low back pain self-efficacy question and rating scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-intervention and post interventions 1 and 2</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of scenarios watched and number of pagers read of traditional information - as reported by participants </outcome>
      <timepoint>Will be assessed after each intervention. This is a crossover trial so following the intervention and following the control i.e. time 1 and time 2.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>perceptions about information assessed qualitatively. Qualitative interviews will be used to determine perceptions about quality and usefulness of the resource and participant perceptions about low back pain management </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Best practice management of low back pain (LBP) includes  providing information that addresses misperceptions about LBP and encourages self-management. To date no LBP information has been developed for Aboriginal people. Our aim is to develop and evaluate LBP information tailored to meet the needs of Aboriginal people. We hypothesise that tailored information will improve the LBP beliefs and self-efficacy, and will be viewed more positively than a traditional form of LBP information recommended by guidelines.       </summary>
