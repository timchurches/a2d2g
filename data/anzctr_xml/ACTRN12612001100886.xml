  <interventions>
    <interventions>Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the heart (60 minutes duration) before chemotherapy, on completion of chemotherapy cycles (~3 months) and at 1 year after commencement of chemotherapy.We will use novel MRI sequences (T1 and T2 mapping) which aim to quantify specific magnetic properties of the heart muscle that related to myocardial edema (seen in inflammation) and fibrosis.</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy control group (observational). These subjects will also undergo 3 MRI scans at comparable times to patients (baseline, 3 months and 1 year).</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Not applicable</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Myocardial T2 time assessed using cardiac MRI at completion of chemotherapy (3 months) will be compared between those that develop significant LV dysfunction at 12 months (an absolute LVEF decline from baseline &gt;20%, or &gt;10% to below lower limit of normal (55%) or &gt;5% decline below 55%) with those who maintain normal LV function at 12 months (control group). LV function (LVEF) using cardiac MRI.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The change in magnitude of myocardial fibrosis from baseline to 12 months (change in T1 time) using cardiac MRI will be compared between subjects with and without &gt;10% increase in myocardial T2 signal (assessed by T2 mapping using cardiac MRI) at completion of chemotherapy (3 months).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The relationship of BNP and troponin (assessed by serum assay) with the results of tissue characterization by cardiac MRI (T2 and T1 mapping) and LV functional parameters including myocardial strain and strain rate (assessed by cardiac MRI and echocardiography).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 and 12 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in myocardial T2 (oedema), T1 (fibrosis), and early gadolinium enhancement ratio (inflammation) over 12 months will be analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and compared with change in myocardial strain/strain rate (assessed with 2D-speckle tracking echocardiography), and change in early diastolic tissue velocity (Em) and the E/Em ratio (LV filling pressure).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 3 and 12 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Contrast and compare levels of circulating fibrocytes and serum markers of collagen turnover between subjects who develop LV dysfunction and those who do not. The correlation between these markers and imaging assessment of myocardial fibrosis assessed by T1 mapping will be investigated.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 months</timepoint>
