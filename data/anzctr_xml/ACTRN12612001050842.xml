  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking at the safety of adding valproate and metformin to standard therapy used to treat patients with brain tumours called as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) or grade 4 glioma. 

Who is it for?
You maybe eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been newly diagnosed with grade 4 glioma or glioblastoma multiforme. You should have had a surgical resection/biopsy within the previous 7 weeks.

Trial details:
All participants undergo standard treatment with temozolomide and radiotherapy followed by 6 months of temozolomide. In addition to standard care, all participants will receive Valproic acid (upto 4000 milligrams per day mg orally and metformin upto 2000 milligrams per day administered orally. Participants will be regularly assessed for up to 12 months in order to determine treatment response, tolerability and safety.</summary>
