    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Cytisine

Treatment: drugs - Varenicline

Experimental: Cytisine plus behavioural support - 12-week course of cytisine capsules (1.5mg), with a decreasing dosing regimen (9mg/day for days 1-3, 7.5mg/day for days 4-12, 6mg/day for days 13-16, 4.5mg/day for days 17-20, 3.0mg/day from days 21-week 12).
Participants will be asked to reduce their smoking over the first four days of treatment so that they are not smoking at all by the fifth day, which will be their designated Quit date.
Participants will also withdrawal-orientated behavioural support (delivered by cessation advisors), in addition to brief cessation advice from the study-specific doctor (at the point that the prescription is provided) and community pharmacist (at the point the participant redeems their prescription).

Active Comparator: Varenicline plus behavioural support - 12-week course of Varenicline tablets (0.5mg/1mg), with an increasing dosing regimen (0.5mg/day for days 1-3, 1.0mg/day for days 4-7, 2.0mg/day for day 8-week 12).
Participants will be asked to reduce their smoking over the first four days of treatment so that they are not smoking at all by the fifth day, which will be their designated Quit date.
Participants will also receive withdrawal-orientated behavioural support (delivered by cessation advisors), in addition to brief cessation advice from the study-specific doctor (at the point that the prescription is provided) and community pharmacist (at the point the participant redeems their prescription).
