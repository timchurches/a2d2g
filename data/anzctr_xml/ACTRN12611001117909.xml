    <interventions>Nurse-led multidisciplinary Chronic Kidney Disease outpatient clinic
A Nurse practitioner will coordinate the clinic, review patients and refer to other members of the multidisciplinary team as appropriate.  Patients will follow a nurse-implemented, nephrologist-endorsed clinical pathway addressing key performance indicators.
Patients will be reviewed in the nurse led clinic at baseline and 6 months post baseline.  Additionally, the Nurse Practitioner will contact the patient by 'phone at 3 and 9 months post baseline. 
A written record of each visit will be sent to the patient's own nephrologist &amp;/or GP.</interventions>
    <comparator>Physician-led multidisciplinary chronic kidney disease outpatient clinic.
A nephrologist will coordinate the clinic, review patients and refer to other members of the multidisciplinary team as appropriate.  Key performance indicators will be addressed.
Patients will be reviewed in the nephrologist led clinic at baseline only.  
A written record of the visit including suggested treatment options will be sent to the patient's own nephrologist &amp;/or GP</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the economic implications of a single, nephrologist-led versus multiple, nurse-led multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for the management of chronic kidney disease stage IV &amp; V patients.
Economic benefits of both clinic methodologies will be assessed  via the improved patient outcomes including better prepared patients with timely insertion of dialysis access (thereby offsetting both the costs of temporary dialysis access and the increased hospitalization costs of complications related to temporary access), increased use of home therapies over hospital or centre-based therapies and potentially slowing the progression of CKD (thereby offsetting time on dialysis).  The NET economic benefit or lost of each MDCKD clinic will be derived from the difference between the estimated cost of the clinic (fixed staffing and hotel costs) and the calculated economic benefits that would be realized based on the key clinical outcomes from the clinics.
Econom ic implications are from the point of view of the hospital.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months post baseline visit</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the patient dialysis modality choice, including choice of home-based therapy or palliative care between the nurse- led and physician-led MD OP CKD clinics.

      <timepoint>12 months post baseline visit</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>comparison of conventional cardiovascular risk factors including lipid control, the use of anti platelet therapy &amp; statins between nurse-led &amp; physician-led MD OP CKD clinics.
Medication taken by patients in both groups will be recorded at baseline and at 12 months post baseline visit.  The proportion of patients in each group on nephro-protective antihypertensives - ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor blockers will be compared.  The proportion of patients on known risk-reduction strategies: anti-platelet therapy and statins will be compared between groups.</outcome>

    <concealment>Patients attending the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital CKD outpatient clinic will be invited to participate in the study and will be given a patient information sheet and consent form to read and sign if agreeable.  Patients will be randomized on a 1:1 ration, sub-stratified for CKD stage, diabetes mellitus and known coronary artery disease, to usual care in a nephrologist-led multidisciplinary CKD clinic or a Nurse led multidisciplinary clinic.  Randomisation will be performed by a nephrololgist not directly involved with running the CKD clinic within the Dept of Renal Medicine at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital to ensure concealment.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence will be generated using a random number generator on EXCEL with separate sequences for CKD stage, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The key clinical and psychosocial outcomes of our current, physician-led, multi-disciplinary CKD clinic (M-DCKD clinic) can be sustained by transitioning to a nurse-led, multi-disciplinary CKD clinic. Furthermore, while CKD patients will be reviewed once in the nephrologist-led clinic compared with 2 times in the nurse-led clinic, we propose that the nurse-led M-DCKD will be more economically viable. 
Aim: To test the above hypothesis in a randomised controlled trial of stage IV-V CKD patients attending a single physician-led multidisciplinary team outpatient clinic compared with attending multiple visits at a nurse-led multi-disciplinary team outpatient clinic. The key clinical outcomes are derived from clinical key performance indicators as well as psychosocial and economic analyses.</summary>
