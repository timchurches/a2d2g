  <interventions>
    <interventions>HealthELink is an online platform designed to facilitate effective and secure communication between patients and members of their care team (Nurses, Specialists and General Practitioners [GPs]).  This study aims to test HealthELink as a new model of care in the management of patients with chronic disease. HealthELink consists of simple disease assessment templates that allow GPs to streamline their medical history taking and initial investigations to better match a specialised condition like HCV. Furthermore, data collected is then used to populate automated treatment algorithms that are based on national consensus guidelines, enabling GPs to prescribe safety and effectively, in conjunction with a Specialist, through dedicated Specialist portals. HealthELink contains secure communication portals that enable patients and GPs to interact with their treating team and Specialist at any time, particularly between review appointments.
Arm 1: Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC)  Patients commencing direct antiviral therapy (DAA) as part of standard of care and meeting selection criteria will be invited to participate. Patients enrolled into Arm 1 will be briefed by their treating Specialist on how to use the HealthELink portal electronically for communicating with the Advanced Practise Nurse, in addition to their standard of care therapy.  Patients will be able to access HealthELink and communicate with their medical care team at any time and at any location with access to the internet, for the duration of the trial (6 months). Standard of care management will also be modified through cancellation of future face-to-face encounters by mutual agreement between patient and medical care team. These arms aim to test the effectiveness of HealthELink as a tool for improving communication between a patient and their medical care team, as well as patient management. 
Arm 2: Prisoners with CHC  Prisoners with CHC infection will be asked to participate in this study. If consented, prisoners commencing DAA therapy will be entered into HealthELink by their treating Prison Doctor. A sophisticated disease-specific algorithm will help determine the right evidence based DAA therapy for their patient. Once a draft treatment plan is formulated, this will be sent digitally via secure portals in HealthELink for Specialist approval. Once approval is granted and therapy is commenced, the Tertiary care team is able to remotely monitor patient progress remotely, including standard of care blood tests and testing. There will be no direct interaction between prisoners and HealthELink. This arm aims to test the effectiveness of HealthELink as a means of communication and data tracking between PMOs and Specialists.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to assess the feasibility of using an innovative web-based platform to unite patients, Specialist Nurses, General Practitioners (GPs) and Specialists and to improve multidisciplinary care for patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.
Who is it for?
You may be eligible for this study if you are aged between 18 and 85 years, have chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and have recently commenced therapy or are currently receiving ongoing monitoring and/or therapy.  You will also need to have access to internet to take part in this study.
Study details
All participants involved in this study will be enrolled into our electronic platform called HealthELink. Enrolment on to this platform will be in addition to your standard of care treatment for your condition. At the time of recruitment you will be trained by a qualified investigator to use HealthELink. 
Through this portal, you will be able to engage with your care team electronically. You will be able to send and receive messages about your health to and from your care team in real time. This includes your Specialist Nurse, Specialist and GP. This will enable you to be up to date with your necessary tests and appointments, as well as your medical information, including diagnoses and medications. Your usual care will continue, however, should you need to talk to a doctor, or a problem arises between appointments, you will be able to communicate with your Specialist care team and GP directly. 
Likewise, should you be well (including a lack of symptoms and normal blood results), you may forgo a scheduled face-to-face appointment provided you and your care team agree. Hopefully, through effective electronic communication we can avoid unnecessary hospital appointments. You will also be asked to provide feedback on HealthELink and how it has impacted on your care. 
We hope that the HealthElink platform will be able to improve the management of your care by enabling you to have electronic access to your health care team between appointments. Without compromising your care or Specialist supervision, we hope this will enable fewer unnecessary Outpatient Department appointments, hospital admissions and emergency presentations. Every element of your care will be recorded, thus providing quality control for the care delivered.
