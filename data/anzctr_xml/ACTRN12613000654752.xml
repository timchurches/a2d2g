  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a Marinova seaweed supplement in improving symptoms in participants with diagnosed osteoarthritis of the knee. The primary hypothesis is that the oral administration of the study medication over 12 weeks will result in a statistically significant decrease in osteoarthritis symptoms in comparison with a placebo.</summary>
