  <interventions>
    <interventions>Parturients were randomized into one of three groups with closed envelope method. All random numbers will conceal in sealed envelopes and assigned to a patient when entering the operating room by one anesthesiologist. Sequentially-numbered sealed opaque envelopes containing group allocation will  open by the anesthesiologist responsible for fluid transfusion. First group: preload (applying fluid loading before administering the intrathecal local anesthetic) 20 ml/kg  intravenous infusion Ringer's Lactate solution group  (n=20),  second group: preload 15 ml/kg intravenous infusion Ringer's Lactate solution group (n=20) (CONTROL GROUP) third group: coload (applying fluid loading at the after of administering the intrathecal local anesthetic) 15 ml/kg  intravenous infusion Ringer's Lactate solution group (n=20). Ringer's Lactate  preload solution administered during 2025 min, prior to commencing the induction of the spinal anaesthesia. Ringer's Lactate Coload solution over 20-25 min as soon as CSF was tapped. 

Patients were fasted over-night for at least 6-8 h. The patients did not receive intravenous fluid prior to entering the study. 

All patients will be monitored and the basal vital functions (HR, SpO2, NIBP and StO2) will be recorded with admission into the OR.

All patients will placed into a sitting position and spinal anesthesia will be performed with a median approach, at a level of L3-L4, with a 25 G Quincke type spinal needle and 2.0 ml hyperbaric bupivacaine. 

After succesful administration of anesthesia, all patients will be placed into supine position, monitored and administered oxygene via a venturi mask after administration of spinal anesthesia until the completion of surgery in  inspirated fractions (21%,) and all vital functions will be recorded (HR, SpO2, NIBP and StO2) after spinal anesthesia (in minute 1, 3 and 5), with the beginning of surgery (in minute 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40), after the end of surgery (in minute 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60) and in the 24th hour postoperatively

Beside this, hemoglobin levels will be evaluated preoperatively, during surgery and postoperatively in the 30th and 60th minute, by a noninvasive continuous monitoring device.

Spinal block levels, duration of surgery, APGAR scores, vasopressor consumption will be recorded.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pregnant women experience an increase in sympathetic versus parasympathetic activity, together with increased susceptibility to the effects of sympathetic block  a fact that can give rise to increased vasodilatation. Prolonged severe hypotension can have harmful effects including organ ischemia, loss of consciousness, cardiovascular failure and uteroplacental hypoperfusion. 

Spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension, which is pronounced in term parturients undergoing elective caesarean section, may be deleterious to both the mother and the fetus. For these reason  the mother and the fetus also causes decreased oxygen delivery to both uteroplacental hypoperfusion and fetal distress. It is necessary to prevent hypotension to prevent these negative effects. The amount of fluid givenand the time of administration to prevent hypotension  are important.

We aimed to investigate the effect of preload  20 ml/kg  Ringer Lactat , preload 15 ml/kg  Ringer Lactat and coload 15 ml/kg  Ringer Lactat supplementation on maternal tissue oxygenation in elective cesarean section (CS) under spinal anesthesia.</summary>
