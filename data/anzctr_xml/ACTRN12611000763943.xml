    <interventions>Fruit,Vegetables and Herbs
This intervention study (Bone Health, Vegetables, Herbs and Fruit) involves changing the fruit and vegetables intake of 100 women from less than or equal to 5 to 9 or more serves /day for 3 months. Another group called Diet and Metabolic Markers in Healthy Post Menopausal Women or DMM group will involve an additional 50 women. This group will be run concurrently and serve as a negative control group. Using a randomized parallel controlled design the women in the dietary intervention will be assigned to one of the two arms involved in increasing fruit and vegetable intake and including selected herbs. One arm, will be advised to consume a high fruit and vegetable diet (Diet IA) of 9 serves/day (low PRAL, general range of vegetables, fruit and herbs but avoiding those with Bone resorption inhibiting properties BRIPs), The second arm will also consume 9 serves/day but of the 9 serves, 4-5 serves will be selected from a range of BRIP vegetables, fruit and culinary herbs i.e. Diet IB (low PRAL including specific BRIP vegetables, fruit and culinary herbs). Brip vegetables include those from the cruciferous and allium family,fruits include citrus and herbs include those common culinary green herbs in culinary quantities only (.25tsp) such as sage. The negative control group C (DMM) will continue with their normal diet and receive no intervention.
We will monitor for changes in bone resorption and formation markers (serum C-telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) and procollagen 1 N-terminal peptide (P1NP), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and Parathyroid Hormone. We will also monitor changes in anti-inflammatory markers; adiponectin, c reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa binding (NF kappaB) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) as well as metabolic markers; triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, fibrinogen and PAI-1.</interventions>
    <comparator>Negative control group recruited separately consisting of post menopausal women with the same exclusion criteria as the intervention group.
This group to not share the same inclusion criteria as the intervention. They are the same in all respects except they do not choose to make the behaviour change to increase their intake of fruit and vegetables to 9 serves/day</comparator>

    <designfeatures>A negative control group has been recruited separately as this is a dietary and lifestyle intervention and we didnt want to rectruit women ready to make the behaviour change and then advise them not to.The 100 women in the intervention will be randomly allocated to two groups of 50 consuming differing veg,herbs and fruit.One group of the intervention will emphasise those foods (Fruit,veg and herbs) shown to be bone friendly in animals.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Parametric statistical analysis was done for normally distributed data otherwise non parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis Test) were used (potassium urinary excretion) or logarithmic transformations were applied prior to one way analysis of variance analysis (ANOVA). Log transformed values were back transformed for tables. ANOVA was used to compare inflammatory, bone and urinary mineral excretion data. Post hoc tests (Scheffe and Tukey-B) were used to determine group difference as well as student t-tests for within group differences. Two way ANOVA was used to determine interaction effects between groups and BMD groups on bone markers using MANOVA with adjustments for multiple comparisons (Sidak).The number of subjects required in each group was calculated to be 32 (minimum). This was determined using a power calculation based on demonstrating a difference of ~8% in the primary outcome variable C-telopeptides of collagen (CTx) with 80% power and alpha of 0.05 (2 sided test) and accepting 0.4 micrmeters/ml as mean CTx of this population (Kruger, M.C, 2010). To detect any differences between the 2 diets and allowing for withdrawals, non-compliance or maintenance (~ 25%) approximately 50 women were needed in each group. Since there were 2 different diets emphasizing different vegetables and fruit and a control group who consumed their usual diet (= 5 servings F/V/day), three groups of 50 participants were required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Bone health and fruit and vegetable intake are positively linked. This has been attributed to the varying micronutrients, phytochemicals and/or alkali precursors which reduce potential renal acid load (PRAL).Animal studies demonstrate specific vegetables, fruit and herbs possess bone resorption inhibiting properties (BRIP). Very few human intervention studies have been done with post menopausal women using a food specific approach to significantly reduce dietary PRAL and no study has included these specific vegetables, fruit and herbs to determine change in bone turnover and inflammatory markers, though several animal studies have shown beneficial effects on markers and bone density.

This intervention study (Bone Health, Vegetables, Herbs and Fruit) involves changing the fruit and vegetables intake of 100 women from less than or equal to 5 to 9 or more serves /day for 3 months. Another group called Diet and Metabolic Markers in Healthy Post Menopausal Women or DMM group will involve an additional 50 women. This group will be run concurrently and serve as a negative control group. Using a randomized parallel controlled design the women in the dietary intervention will be assigned to one of the two arms involved in increasing fruit and vegetable intake and including selected herbs.
