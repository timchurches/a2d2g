  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study is testing a new device that uses electrical stimulation of the brain for the treatment of epilepsy, The device is called the Medtronic Activa PC+S system. Two devices will be implanted per participant. The electrodes will be surgically implanted bilaterally into the hippopotamus and anterior nucleus of the thalamus, 

Participants that agree to be part of the study will be asked to remain in the study for a total of 2 years from the date of the device implantation. This will involve eight clinic visits: at 10 days post implantation,  2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 24 months post implantation. Each visit will last between 1.5-2 hours and will involve neurological examination by the participants doctor, all device calibrations will be conducted by the doctor and research team. The study coordinator or study doctor may also call participants to ask about seizure diary entries and participants can call the study coordinator/doctor at any time with questions or concerns. . At the end of the study the participant and their doctor can decide if they would like to have the device removed or if they would like to keep it in place. Participants can end participation in the study and have the device removed and any time for any reason, or for no reason.

Surgical implantation will be conducted with participants under general anaesthesia. During the surgery, the doctor will make an incision in the scalp (less than 1 cm) and drill four holes (3 mm diameter) in the skull. The electrodes will be placed in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the hippocampus. The incision will be closed and the leads will be placed under the skin behind the ear, down each side of the neck and then to the Implantable pulse generators, placed under the skin, just below the collarbone. 

In the recovery phase (2 months) of the study we will collect 30 second EEG snapshots recorded every 15 minutes.

Baseline phase:
Following the recovery period data will continue to be recorded to establish baseline data, There is no stimulation during this period. We require a minimum number of five seizures to occur during this phase. Expected duration is 2 months, no longer than 3 months. If it takes longer than that then participation may be discontinued. 

Probing phase:
Following the baseline phase, the devices will be used to electrically stimulate (probe) the thalamus continuously at a low frequency (2 Hz). EEG snapshots will continue to be collected. This period lasts for a minimum of 2 months and no longer than 3 months. We require at least 5 seizures that are well separated in time to have occurred to proceed to the next phase.

Probe calibrated Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) phase:
In this phase we explore 18 DBS parameter configurations (three stimulus intensities; 3,4,5 Volts, six different frequencies; 125 130, 135, 140,145, 150 Hz) during two of the clinic visits. Each DBS parameter configuration will be tested for 1 minute with 4 minutes between each configuration test. The probing responses will be used to optimise the DBS parameters for each participant. This phase of the study continues for 2 months.

The final phase of the study continues until the end of the study (2 years). During this phase the DBS parameters may be altered from the probing optimised parameters according to patient needs.

Comparing the number of seizures per patient, as recorded by Medtronic Activa PC+S system in the baseline  vs. probe calibrated DBS phase. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine if probing responses provide a seizure susceptibility measure.

Calculate probability of seizure in the near future given the features of the probing response shape during pre-ictal and inter-ictal periods on training dataset and then test predictive power on remaining data. Features defining the probing response shape will include peak amplitude and peak latency. Seizure occurrences will be determined by the Medtronic PC+S device.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this research project is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a surgically implanted device called the Medtronic Activa PC+S System in patients with medically refractory epilepsy (people who have seizures that are not completely controlled by medical therapy). The system sends small electrical pulses into a part of the brain called the thalamus to help control seizures. It sends this signal in regularly, regardless of if a seizure is occurring.  A different version of this device is already approved for the treatment of epilepsy in Australia. This study aims to use the brain's responses to single pulse electrical stimulation to measure the level of seizure susceptibility. We would like to show that this measure can be used to provide more effective deep brain stimulation therapies, to stop seizures.  </summary>
