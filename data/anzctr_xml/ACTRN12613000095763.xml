  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients presenting for renal transplant will be randomized to intra-operative standard fluid therapy(SFT) or intra-operative goal directed fluid therapy using the oesophageal doppler monitor(ODM). All patients will be asked for their duration of preoperative fasting, and time since last dialysis. All patients will be pre-warmed with a forced air warming blanket and intravenous access will be obtained. An arterial line will be inserted only if deemed indicated by the treating anaesthetist. 

Once monitored with standard monitoring, a general anaesthetic induction will be commenced with propofol, fentanyl and atracurium. Maintenance of anaesthesia will be with desflurane, fentanyl and an atracurium infusion. Routine immunosuppressive and antibiotic therapy will be administered as per institutional specific therapy. 

In ODM Group patients a  oesophageal doppler monitor will be inserted after intubation of the trachea and in the ODM group goal directed fluid therapy commenced as guided by the ODM. FTc&lt;350 Normal Saline 7 ml/kg initially then subsequently 3 ml/kg will be administered as a fluid challenge, to return FTc to &gt; 350, as per GUIDELINES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED RECOVERY PROTOCOLS (1) December 2009. FTc &gt;400 and MAP &lt;70 mmHg metaraminol (heart rate &gt;60 bpm) or ephedrine (heart rate &lt;60 bpm) shall be administered. For the SFT group fluid, vasoconstrictor and ephedrine administration shall be at the discretion of the treating anaesthestist. Total doses of vasoconstrictor and inotrope shall be documented for the intraoperative period for both groups.

    <concealment>  An independent investigator (research  nurse)  will then seal each allocation in an opaque envelope and ensure sequential numbering.  The number on the envelope will become the participants unique study number.  


Once a patient has consented to study participation and immediately prior to commencement of anaesthesia the assigned envelope will be opened by the treating anaesthetist who will then conduct fluid management in accordance with the group the patient is allocated to (standard or goal directed).   </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed in the groups to which patients are randomly allocated, ie, intention to treat analysis.  All continuous data will be analyzed for normality. Descriptive statistics including a measure of central tendency and dispersion (mean and standard deviation for normally distributed variables, median and interquartile range for skewed data) will be reported for all relevant variables.  Number (percentage) will be used as an alternative where appropriate.

Pearson chi square test will be utilised to analyse categorical data and the mean difference for continuous data will be measured by student t-test (normally distributed data) or Wilcoxon Rank sum test (skewed data).

Regression methods (Logistic regression will be used for categorical data and linear regression for continuous data) will be used to explore the relationships between the fluid strategy patients are allocated to and their perioperative course.  All of the perioperative factors listed in th outcomes will be considered by fluid strategy allocation.  Demographic and health factors which may impact on the duration of hospital stay will also be included in the model (Age, BMI, IHD, CCF, HLA match, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, pre transplant echo; PVD. Donor source (live vs deceased donor), cold ischaemia time, donor renovascular disease and number of arteries).  Co-variates from univariate analyses with p values of &lt;0.2 will be included in the multivariate regression analysis.  P values &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all analyses.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Accurate fluid management in the peritransplant period is crucial. In many cases the donor renal allograft will have established acute tubular necrosis due to prolonged cold ischaemic time and will therefore have delayed graft function. A common complication of transplant surgery is over aggressive fluid replacement in a patient who is essentially anuric which may precipitate pulmonary oedema requiring urgent dialysis. On the other hand, inadequate volume replacement in a renal allograft recipient who has immediate graft function can result in hypovolaemia and potentially delayed graft function. The ODM has been used in case series of renal transplantation demonstrating efficacy and safety. This prospective, randomized trial looks at goal directed fluid therapy using the oesophageal doppler monitor versus standard of care fluid therapy in renal transplant patients to determine if there is a reduced length of stay and reduced incidence of delayed graft function.</summary>
