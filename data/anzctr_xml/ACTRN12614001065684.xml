  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be provided with the CommunicAid Application on a tablet device. This is a communication aid that will assist the participant to make choices and convey their basic wants and needs (e.g. to select a drink or to request an item that they want). A family member will attend this initial session that is expected to last 90 minutes in duration. Participants will be introduced to the functions of the application and tablet device. The Tablet will be left with the participant to practice use with family and staff over a 5 week period. Individually tailored goals will be provided to each participant outlining when to use the device and how frequently (e.g. to use the device every morning tea time to request a drink). As such the frequency and duration will be clearly specified, but will vary across participants depending on their individual goals.
A pre- and post- assessment will be completed to measure communication outcomes following the five week trial. A post- treatment interview will be completed with staff and family to measure adherence to the intervention and use of the CommunicAid over the 5 week trial.</interventions>

    <concealment>Five residents with a diagnosis of early stage or mild dementia at Bethanie Group Inc will be invited to participate in this study. Staff and family members that routinely visit and work with these residents will also be invited to participate in the study. 
A nurse manager at each facility, in consultation with the residentsâ€™ GP or medical specialist, will identify residents that are eligible to participate in the study. This will include residents that are deemed able to give informed consent to participate based on recent cognitive test results and current level of function and participation. Eligible participants will be invited to participate and provided with an information sheet. The opportunity to ask questions about the study and to discuss it with a family member will be provided. Written informed consent will be obtained prior to enrolment in the study or release of personal details to the research team. 
The nurse manager will also be responsible for inviting staff and family members associated with the 5 residents to take part in the study. They will be provided with an information sheet and written informed consent will be obtained.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed proof of concept study aims to identify factors that influence successful use of the CommunicAid App within a residential aged care setting. Using a case series design the study aims to create five in-depth case profiles of CommunicAid App use, characterising individual client factors (e.g. communication profile, previous use of technology) and environmental factors (e.g. communication opportunities, available communication support, lighting and noise levels within the facility). Systematic analysis and interpretation of the individual case profiles will allow the critical factors to be identified that influence successful use of the App during everyday interactions. This will provide direction for the development of tailored training and communication support strategies to embed use of the App into routine care delivery. </summary>
