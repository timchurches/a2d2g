    <interventions>TDS Main Study
Treatment A: Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS (10 mg/day target dose), 105 cm2 active drug/skin contact area with 0.5 cm adhesive edge applied and worn for seven days.
Treatment B: Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS (10 mg/day target dose), 105 cm2 active drug/skin contact area with 1.0 cm adhesive edge applied and worn for seven days.
Treatment E: Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS, with adhesive overlay Type II (10 mg/day target dose), 120 150 cm2 active drug/skin contact area with 1.0 cm adhesive edge applied and worn for seven days.
Treatment F: Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS with adhesive overlay Type III (10 mg/day target dose), 120 150 cm2 active drug/skin contact area with 1.0 cm adhesive edge applied and worn for seven days.
Treatment G: Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS with adhesive overlay Type IV (10 mg/day target dose) 120 150 cm2 active drug/skin contact area with 1.0 cm adhesive edge applied and worn for seven days.

All formulations will be applied as one patch worn continuously for seven days, applied to the lower back (preferred location is vertically along the spine) by a trained member of site staff. 
Participants will remain in the study facility for the duration of patch application and will be constantly monitored to ensure compliance.
50% of the Treatment E, F or G subjects will be permitted to shower or bathe as long as the application site is not immersed or does not have consistent and constant contact with water such as water spraying over the patch application site (occasional splashes of small amounts of water are acceptable but should be avoided). Subjects will be asked to try to avoid splashing water on or allowing running water to contact the patch application area. A shower shield is not to be worn over the patch while showering. 
Subjects will be required to shower 1 to 2 hours prior to TDS application on Day 8. Subjects should avoid scrubbing or rubbing the potential application area and should not use soaps or lotions. The potential application area should be patted dry after the shower. On subsequent days, showers should occur following the first PK draws and 6 hours prior to the last PK draw of the day (on days where there is more than one PK draw). On Day 15 showers are restricted to 1 to 2 hours prior to TDS removal or after the skin residue sample is collected. 
The other 50% of the Treatment E, F or G Subjects will be permitted to shower or bathe providing the application site is not immersed and water is not directed immediately on the patch application site ; however water running down on the patch application site, and water splashing on the patch site is acceptable. A subject will be assigned to one of the shower methods based on subject order of enrollment and gender (example: first female and first male subject qualified for the study will be assigned to have a restricted shower and 2nd female and male screen will be assigned to have a flexible shower).


Treatment C: Lead-in Dose  5 mg donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept, 'Registered Trademark'), as daily oral dose, for seven days, will be used as a lead-in dose in the treatment period.

Aricept ('Registered Trademark') will be given to all participants as a 5 mg oral tablet once daily for the seven days prior to patch application.

Participants will be administered the first dose of Aricept ('Registered Trademark') in the study facility, and this will be documented on an accountability log kept at site. Site staff will instruct participants to retain the empty drug bottles to return to site at Day 7. When participants return to site on Day 7, site staff will check the number of empty drug bottles to ensure compliance. In addition to this, site staff will be making daily phone calls to participants who will be completing the lead-in doses at home to perform AE checks and compliance check to Aricept. This will be documented in subject source notes.

Oral sub-study (to commence after TDS Main Study):
Treatment C: Lead-in Dose  5 mg donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept, 'Registered Trademark'), as daily oral dose, for seven days, will be used as a lead-in dose in the treatment period.
Treatment D: 10 mg donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept, 'Registered Trademark'), as daily oral dose, for seven days, commenced after the lead-in dose with Treatment C.

Aricept ('Registered Trademark') will be given to all participants as a 5 mg oral tablet once daily for the seven days prior to commencement of 10mg Aricept ('Registered Trademark') dosing.

Participants will be administered the first dose of 5mg Aricept ('Registered Trademark') in the study facility, and this will be documented on an accountability log kept at site. Site staff will instruct participants to retain the empty drug bottles to return to site at Day 7. When participants return to site on Day 7, site staff will check the number of empty drug bottles to ensure compliance. In addition to this, site staff will be making daily phone calls to participants who will be completing the lead-in doses at home to perform AE checks and compliance check to 5mg Aricept. This will be documented in subject source notes. </interventions>

    <designfeatures>There will be up to five treatment groups in the main study to evaluate up to five TDS treatments as follows:
- TDS Treatment A (Treatment Group 1)
- TDS Treatment B (Treatment Group 2)
- TDS Treatment E (Treatment Group 3)
- TDS Treatment F (Treatment Group 4, not dosed)
- TDS Treatment G (Treatment Group 5, not dosed)
Subjects may participate in more than one treatment group. There will be a washout period of at least 14 days from removal of the previous TDS treatment before dosing in the next treatment group commences. Prior to commencement of Treatment Groups 2, 3, 4 and 5, an interim review of available tolerability and patch adhesion data from the previous treatment group will be conducted to determine the TDS treatment to be administered in the subsequent treatment group. Based on the preliminary tolerability and adhesion data, the Sponsor may decide not to evaluate all TDS treatments and therefore all five treatment groups may not proceed. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Pharmacokinetics</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>A maximum of approximately 80 subjects are to be enrolled in the main part of the study to enable a minimum of 12 subjects to complete each TDS treatment.
Up to 12 healthy volunteers my be enrolled in the Oral Sub-Study to enable a minimum of 6 subjects to complete.
This is considered adequate to provide an initial assessment of Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS adhesion and to assess Corplex ('Trademarked') Donepezil TDS delivery in vivo in human subjects. </statisticalmethods>
