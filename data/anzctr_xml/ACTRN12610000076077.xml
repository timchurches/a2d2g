  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. All patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who underwent surgical peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital (RBWH) and Rockhampton Base Hospital (RKH ) are  invited to participate in the study. These participants were not on PD before and will be starting PD for the first time.
2. Tenckhoff curled PD catheters are  inserted by the same surgical teams ( general surgery consultant /team) at each centre. 

 Participants were randomised to PD initiation interval, Group 1 (G1) commenced PD at one week, group 2 (G2) at two and group 3 (G3) at four weeks after insertion of PD catheter. Participants were also stratified by diabetic status.
All participants received formal PD training. Participants initiated PD with similar patterns of clinical practice apart from the randomised varying PD intervals. The PD catheter exit site and tunnel were examined according to standard clinical practice.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The planned study targets patients with end stage kidney disease who choose peritoneal dialysis for maintenance therapy. Current practice at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital is to wait four weeks after a Teckhoff catheter is placed before starting peritoneal dialysis . The literature lacks evidence of the optimal interval between peritoneal catheter insertion and start up of dialysis.  Consequently practice varies. They too support delayed use but do not test different delay intervals and can not tell us the optimal time. A few recent studies reported a very low leak incidence after using catheter 1 week post insertion , attributed to a tight catheter securing. Any delay in starting PD results in temporary haemodialysis in patients who require immediate dailysis.  Temporary haemodialysis requires a central venous access with attendant risk of complications.  Temporary haemodialysis is more expensive than peritoneal dialysis . Therefore guidelines bodies, such as CARI (Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment,), European Dialysis and Transplant Association-European Renal Association and  International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis suggest a two week delay. They can  can only publish suggestions based on the weak body of evidence, or lack thereof. CARI suggests randomised control trial as there is insufficient evidence for this to be a guideline.
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safest and shortest time interval between surgical placement of a Tenckhoff catheter and starting dialysis.  The hypothesis is that there is no difference in complication rates between one, two and four week time intervals. If equivalence is proven between one, two and four week time intervals, we could justifiably change practice.  Benefits for future patients include shorter exposure to haemodialysis treatments and their complications and shorter duration of haemodialysis catheter placement and its complications.  If the results show more complications in the one or two week time interval groups, then we would encourage re-visiting the guidelines. catheter placement and its complications.</summary>
