  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will use a single-blinded, repeated measures, parallel, RCT testing feasibility outcomes. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the self-efficacy education intervention [A] or routine care [B] group. Sequential sampling of all eligible patients from two surgical (orthopaedics) units will take place at The Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee (QEII) and Robina hospitals, both located in South East Queensland. The intervention involves pre-operative self-efficacy based education sessions of around 20  30 minutes delivered via a DVD. Based on the work of Marks and Allegrante (2005), the self-efficacy activities identified in the DVD include goal-setting and relaxation exercises (such as mindfulness and deep breathing exercises, listening to music and guided imagry), for participants to practice prior to and following surgery. Participants in the intervention group will receive the DVD at the booked pre-operative session at both research sites to take home with them. They will be asked to review this DVD within 72 hours and then on three other occasions prior to their admission for surgery. A research assistant (registered nurse) will call the participants at 72 hours and then again before admission to support participation. Participants in both groups will receive routine in-hospital pre- and post-operative care provided by both the Queensland Health hospitals. Post-operatively this will include all care provided by healthcare professionals in terms of nursing, wound care, physiotherapy and pain management.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Evaluate the feasibility of launching a full-scale multi-site efficacy trial, using pre-defined feasibility criteria for recruitment, retention, protocol fidelity.

For purposes of this feasibility study, researchers will recruit 100 participants (50 per treatment group). This will provide adequate information to answer the study aims. Current admissions data regarding the number of hip/knee replacements undertaken at the 2 hospital sites this year suggests that there is likely to be a total of 48 potentially eligible patients each month. We expect to recruit around 20 participants per month, thus suggesting a sample of 100 will be realistically achieved in about five months.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sample achieved (50 per group) within research time period (5 months).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Use pilot data to refine the protocol. Data will be collected using the following tools: 1. The Numeric Rating Scale for pain; 2. The State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Form Y for anxiety; 3. The General Self-efficacy Scale for self-efficacy; 4. The Total Quality Pain Management survey for patient satisfaction with nursing care; 5. The Use and Frequency of Pain Medication (via the participant and end-of-bed medication sheets); 6. The Health Service and Resource Utilisation Survey I; 7. The Health Service and Resource Utilisation Survey II; 8. The Relaxation Method Utilisation Survey</outcome>
      <timepoint>Sample achieved (50 per group) within research time period (5 months)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess whether pre-operative self-efficacy based education intervention holds promise on pain in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessment for the NRS will occur at 5 time-points: two to six week pre-operative (T0); day of surgery (T1); two days after surgery (T2); 10-14 days after discharge from hospital (T4), and 6 weeks after discharge (T5). The first data collection time-point (T0) will be at the routine pre-operative hospital appointment and before they are randomised into treatment groups. Once baseline data is collected treatment group allocation will be determined by telephoning an automated service at the university's independent CTCC. T1 and T2 data will in most cases, be collected whilst the participant is in hospital. If the patient is scheduled for surgery early in the morning for T1, they may be called at home the day before. T4 will be collected 10 -14 days post discharge via telephone and T5 will be collected via telephone 6 weeks following discharge from hospital.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A Research Nurse (ResN) will formally screen patients for eligibility face-to-face during the booked usual pre-operative education sessions organized and delivered by staff at both research sites. Participants will be provided with an information package giving clear details of the research. Each information package will include a Consent Form that participants will sign if agreeing to participant in the study.  The package will also include a Revocation of Consent Form, which participants can complete should they wish to withdraw from the research any time throughout its conduct. 
ResN will obtain a code depicting the group to which each participant will be randomly allocated by telephoning an independent automated service at Griffith University's Clinical Trials Coordinating Centre. Computer-generated random assignment will occur at the point of study entry, and each patient will be allocated to a numbered trial group. All members of the research team involved in participant recruitment, randomisation and data collection will be blinded to group allocation, as will nurses providing routine post-operative hospital care ensuring concealment.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will involve a 1:1 ratio with random variations in block sizes, stratified by hospital site. This will be achieved by the ResN who will obtain a code depicting the group to which each participant will be randomly allocated, by telephoning an independent automated service at Griffith University's Clinical Trials Coordinating Centre.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement experience different levels of pain and anxiety before and after their surgery. Providing education to patients on strategies to help them manage the pain and anxiety they experience could help improve patients physical and psychological outcomes after surgery. This study hopes to test whether education provided to patients before surgery can assist in their management of pain and anxiety while undergoing hip or knee replacement. Patients who agree to participate in this study, will be randomly assigned to either receive a DVD with self-efficacy information and activities to take home combined with the usual pre-operative education (the self-efficacy education intervention group [A]) OR receive the usual pre-operative education and care (without the DVD) only (the routine care group [B]). Participants who are allocated to receive the DVD are asked to view this and perform the activities (ie., relaxation, breathing and imagery exercises) within 72 hours and then on three other occasions until their booked surgery. A research assistant (registered nurse) will call the self-efficacy education intervention group [A] participants on the telephone after 72 hours and then again before admission to support their participation. All participants will be assessed for levels of pain, anxiety, self-efficacy at the first three time points (T0-2). Participants will also be asked to respond to a survey about their satisfaction with care in relation to pain management on the day of their discharge/day 4 post-operatively (T3). Ten to fourteen days following discharge (T4), patients will be contacted via telephone at a suitable time to rate their pain, anxiety and self-efficacy as well as their utilisation of health services and resources. Finally 6 weeks after surgery (T5), patients will be telephoned at a suitable time to rate their pain, anxiety, utilisation of health services and resources and utilisation of relaxation method(s). Apart from the day of surgery, all other time points (T0, T2-5) will record the use and frequency of pain medications via direct patient feedback or from the end-of-bed medication sheets. The time taken to complete the assessments at 6 time points will be approximately 10  15 minutes. The assessments will be in paper form, and participants will be required to respond to a series of questions.</summary>
