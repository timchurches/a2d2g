#MindinBody. An investigation into persistent pain from a psychobiological perspective: A mixed-methods intervention study.
The exposure treatment is Bikram Yoga classes. 
Participants' will be required to attend 3 group classes per week for a period of 8 weeks.
Exercise classes are being provided by various Bikram Yoga Studios sites throughout inner Melbourne.
Bikram yoga is a strictly standardized program across instructors and studio locations. Each Bikram yoga session is 90 minutes and consists of the same series of 26 postures with two breathing exercises and two resting postures and the room is held at a constant heat of 40 degrees and humidity of 40%. 
Participants will be provided with a 24 class to the Bikram Yoga service provider of their choice (Prahran, Richmond, or Hawthorn).
Attendance will be monitored through the membership database of the Bikram yoga service provider as attendees are required to check in for each class and with fortnightly telephone contact check-ins by the researchers</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment is Adrenaline HIT group fitness classes: 3 per week for 8 weeks (45 minute classes).
Adrenaline High Intensity Training (HIT) is an innovative functional fitness program designed to improve strength and conditioning in a focused, fun and social environment. Distinctly different from other types of group training, Adrenaline HIT focuses on functional movements in a small group setting. 10 to 15 participants work closely with a coach to perfect their form and technique, creating relevant real life results they can apply to everyday activities. Adrenaline HIT intensity is targeted towards approx. 70-80% HRmax but is ultimately defined by the individual and their ability to push themselves and has been developed to allow for an individuals conditioning to be gradually built up, appropriately strengthening the joints to tolerate the stresses.
Adrenaline HIT consists of 4 workout formats:
-Time; completing a circuit training course as fast as possible
-Tabata: interval training utilising 8 functional exercises followed by a cardio or body-weight burst
-Reps: do a maximum reps or load in a set time
-Box: 12 mins to complete as many rounds of the 4 cross-training stations followed by a cardio burst
Adrenaline HIT classes are being provided by various YMCA Vic. centres around Melbourne (Kew, Hawthorn, Northcote, and North Carlton) and classes are lead by specialist Adrenaline HIT personal trainers from each site 
The Adrenaline HIT classes have been chosen as the comparison group intervention because they provides an intense exercise program that is taken by an instructor and presented in a regimented format. Consequently it is anticipated to offer similar self-esteem and in group activity social situation gains to that of the Bikram yoga classes 
Participants will be provided with a 24 class to the Adrenaline HIT service provider of their choice.
Attendance will be monitored through the membership database at each of the YMCA Vic. sites as attendees are required to check in for each class and with fortnightly telephone contact check-ins by the researchers</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Persistent Pain levels
Persistent Pain is being assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).
The BPI provides an intensity/severity rating on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) for current pain intensity, and pain in the last 24 hours at its worst, least and average.
As well as an interference scale across 7 domains of quality of life ratings, on a scale of 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (interferes completely). Both intensity and interference scales are scored as the means of the four and seven items respectively</outcome>

Self-report Inventory for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES-SR). The SIDES-SR is a self-report measure that assesses the six dimensions of impairment in Disorders of Extreme Stress. These are; affect regulation, amnesia and dissociation, somatization, disruptions in self-perception, disorders in relationships with others, and disrupted systems of meaning. For each item participants are required to indicate yes/no for lifetime presence, and also to rate the current symptom presence and severity during the past month from 0 to 3

Life Stressor Checklist-Revised (LSC-R). LSC-R is a self-report measure that assesses traumatic and stressful experience across 30 life events, for example, death of a relative, natural disasters, and physical or sexual assault. If an event is endorsed then age when event began, age when event ended, belief that they were in harm (yes or no), and feelings of helplessness (yes or no). Participants are also required to report for each endorsed event; effect on life and how upsetting event was at the time on a five-point intensity scale (1 = not at all or never to 5 = extremely) and to identify the three events that currently have the greatest impact on them

Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ). The FFMQ is a 39-item self-report assessing multiple facets of mindfulness. Participants are required to rate each item on a 5-point scale where 1= never or very rarely true, and 5= very often or always true. The five main facets representing mindfulness are; observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience and non-reactivity to inner experience and combining the five factors provides a measure of multidimensional mindfulness as a whole

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size
The primary outcome measure is pain, which will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory severity component. Sample size was calculated to demonstrate a minimally clinical important difference in pain scores of 2.0, assuming a two-sided a=0.05, and using 2.35 as the standard deviation for the mean pain change scores between baseline and post-intervention (8 weeks), calculated from a range of previous pain studies utilising the Brief Pain Inventory measure in an allied intervention. A 26% dropout rate was also anticipated based on a previous Bikram yoga intervention study. Thus a total sample size of 60 participants randomized to either Bikram yoga or Adrenaline HIT interventions provides 80% power to demonstrate a minimally clinical important difference in pain scores of 2.0. 

Intervention Analysis
Repeated measures ANOVA analysis; to assess the significance of the change in the outcome variables across time. This analysis will be conducted for each of the cohort members across two time points,  immediately before intervention and immediately post intervention.
Repeated Measures ANCOVA analysis; to assess whether the post intervention means, adjusted for the pre-test scores, significantly differ between groups. This allows for a direct comparison in of treatment effectiveness between the two groups across outcome measures.

Baseline Analysis
Correlational analysis will be conducted to test for baseline associations between pain and traumatic stress outcomes 

Subgroup analysis
Will be conducted to examine if there are any trends within the data when the participant data is split into trauma subgroups, physical injury, psychological injury, for example.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>To investigate a psychobiological model of persistent pain in a mixed methods intervention study for women with persistent pain and a history of trauma, specifically:

To investigate the potential of Bikram yoga as a mind-body integrative persistent pain therapy. That is, to quantitatively assess the efficacy of an 8 week intervention (3 classes per week) of  instructor lead Bikram yoga classes, as compared to coached Adrenaline HIT group gym class, on pain levels and the associated underlying psychobiological mechanisms (dysregulated stress response outcomes). 
It is hypothesized that participants in the Bikram yoga group will show greater improvements in pain and stress dysregulation than the participants in the comparison Adrenaline HIT gym class group

To quantitatively assess a psychobiological model of persistent pain, that is, the relationship between trauma history, dysregulated stress response outcomes and persistent pain levels where it is hypothesized that greater stress dysregulation will be associated with increased levels of persistent pain
