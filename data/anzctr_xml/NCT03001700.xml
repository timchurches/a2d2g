          1. Lesion(s) located within the SFA and or popliteal arteries.

          2. Target lesion(s) has stenosis &gt;70% by visual assessment.

          3. Reference vessel diameter is between 4.0mm and 6.0mm, inclusive.

          4. One long or multiple serial lesions that are up to 10 cms, (total occlusions up to
             6cm) in length that can be covered by a single balloon.

          6. At least one below the knee artery patent to the ankle.

          7. Successful treatment of iliac inflow stenosis to the target limb. Stenosis can be

             of atherectomy is excluded. The inflow lesion(s) must be treated first, prior to

         19. Subject has other medical, social or psychological problems that in the opinion of the
             investigator would preclude them from receiving this treatment and the procedures and
             or participating in evaluations pre- and post-treatment.
