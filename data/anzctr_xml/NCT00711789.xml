  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Angiotensin II
Treatment: drugs - Saline placebo

Active Comparator: Angiotensin II - 

Placebo Comparator: Placebo - 


Treatment: drugs: Angiotensin II
Angiotensin II will be given by continuous infusion for 24 hours starting at a dose of 5ng/kg/min and then titrated to a maximum dose of 15 ng/kg/min according to a blood pressure based protocol

Treatment: drugs: Saline placebo
Saline placebo will be given by continuous infusion according to a blood-pressure base protocol. This protocol will also incorporate noradrenaline for blood pressure control (as is true in the active drug arm), such that blood pressure targets will be rapidly achieved in both arms of the study; the only difference being that in the active drug arm, at least part of the pressor effect will be provided by angiotensin II.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a systemic infusion of angiotensin II
      on haemodynamics and urine output in critically ill patients with severe sepsis/septic shock
      and acute renal failure.

      It will also help determine the feasibility of conducting a definitive and adequately powered
      randomised controlled trial of angiotensin II in such patients that would assess mortality
      and need for renal replacement therapy as endpoints.</summary>
