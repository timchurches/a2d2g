  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study was a randomized parallel design examining the effects of different exercise regimes on fasting measures and also changes in body weight, fat mass, dietary intake and psychological effects of exercise. Subjects were randomized to four different groups.  Group 1 (Control group) were not given any exercise intervention (placebo dietary supplement only). Group 2 (Aerobic group) performed 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, 3 days a week for the first two weeks then 5 days a week for the next 10 weeks for a total of 12 weeks, which consisted of treadmill walking. Group 3 (Resistance group) performed 30 minutes of resistance exercise, 3 days a week for the first two weeks then 5 days a week for the next 10 weeks for a total of 12 weeks using weight resistance machines. Group 4 (Combination group) performed 15 minutes of aerobic and 15 minutes of resistance exercise, 3 days a week for the first two weeks then 5 days a week for the next 10 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Participants were requested to keep their food intake and physical activity the same as before the study, except for those in the exercise groups who were instructed to do additional exercise as per their program.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical activity is a major modifiable environmental determinant of chronic disease. Epidemiological and clinical studies suggest that those who are physically active have lower serum cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentrations than individuals who pursue a sedentary lifestyle. Exercise training has been shown to have numerous benefits for health, both physiologically and psychologically. The Australian National Physical Activity Guidelines for Adults (NPAGA) recommend that for good health adults should put together at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days. However, it is not known if this recommendation is adequate for improvement in metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese individuals. In addition, as many people have difficulty finding time to exercise, it is important to better understand which mode(s) of exercise is the most effective and also easily accessible for the greater number of people. For example, what are the relative merits of aerobic exercise such as brisk walking compared with resistance weight training and does a combination of both modalities provide additional health benefits? The aim of this chronic study was to investigate whether twelve weeks of training with aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, or combined exercise at moderate intensity for 30 minutes, five days a week would induce and sustain improvements in the cardiovascular risk profile, such as improved fasting lipids, glucose and insulin and also weight loss and increased fat free mass in overweight and obese individuals compared to no exercise. We also compared the effects between the different exercise types on cardiovascular risk factors.</summary>
