    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation with alpha and beta set at 0.05 and 0.8 respectively and an effect size of 0.3 requires a minimum of 22 people per arm. We aim to enroll 60 participants (30 women and 30 men) to complete 25 participants in each arm (50 in total).
A multilevel repeated measures analysis will be undertaken over the 84 daily measurements and 2 doses using SPSS. The analysis will look at the total population and then women and men separately.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of this clinical research is to establish the effects of a standardised green-lipped mussel lipid extract (PCSO-524) in women and men with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study seeks to determine the effective dosage and will be conducted using an open-label design and is categorised as a Phase II clinical trial. Participants meeting the enrolment criteria will be randomised to either 200mg or 400mg daily for a 12 week period. The primary validated measurement will be the Comprehensive Osteoarthritis Test (COAT) which we developed in previous clinical trials on OA. The results will be used to inform a Phase III randomised controlled study.
