  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention includes:
4 modules on gross motor development - Body management  -trunk and lower limb, locomotion, Object Control -throwing, catching and kicking, Body sequencing,
4 modules on fine motor development - body management -trunk and upper limb, fine motor planning, object control -manual skills, hand skills, and
1 module on social/emotional development -promoting laughter and happy feelings, idenification of positive and negative feelings, breathing and relaxation strategies. 
The intervention is delivered by a classroom teacher over 10 weeks, with 15 minutes a day, 4 days a week for the gross motor modules; 15 minutes a day, 4 days a week for the fine motor modules, and 15 minutes a week for the social-emotional module.</interventions>

    <concealment>Schools are randomised. Pairs of equal size and socio-economic status (SES) were randomly allocated to control and intervention. Allocation was made once schools were deemed eligible to be included and control versus internvention decided by a coin toss -hence allocation was concealed.</concealment>
