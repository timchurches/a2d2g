  <interventions>
    <interventions>Those randomised to the experimental alternating arm will receive:
Imatinib 400mg (1 x 400mg tablet) orally daily for 21 to 25 days (washout period determined by treating investigator), then a 3 - 7 day washout period (no drug). In total, the days taking imatinib plus the washout period must be 28 days.  This is followed by regorafenib 160 mg (4 x 40mg tablets) orally daily for 21 days, then a 7 day washout period. This combination of imatinib, regorafenib and intervening washout periods will constitute 1 cycle of study treatment (imatinib plus washout period 28 days in total; regorafenib 3 weeks on, 1 week off; cycle duration 8 weeks in total). 
Treatment will continue until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.
A drug administration diary  will be provided to patients.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants randomised to standard therapy will receive treatment with 400mg (1 x 400mg tablet) orally daily of imatinib, with no washout periods. Treatment will continue until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine PFS at 24 months as calculated from the commencement of treatment to the date of progression as determined by RECIST v1.1
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Progression free survival is defined as the time from either (i) randomization (if patients have not yet commenced treatment) or (ii) commencement of therapy (if patients are randomized during the first cycle of imatinib). PFS at 24 months will be the proportion of patients potentially not progressing at 24 months.  Disease progression is defined according to RECIST 1.1.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine objective tumour response rate following 2 cycles of treatment
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tumour evaluation will follow the RECIST Version 1.1 guidelines and be used to determine response status (i.e. complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease) at each assessment time point. The OTRR will be calculated by summing the number of participants assessed as having a complete or partial response within the first 16 weeks from randomisation, and dividing this by the total number of participants evaluable for response (according to RECIST Version 1.1). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine clinical benefit rate (SD + PR + CR) following 2 cycles of treatment
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Clinical benefit rate will be calculated by summing the number of participants assessed as having a complete response, partial response or stable disease within the first 16 weeks from randomisation, and dividing this by the total number of participants evaluable for response (according to RECIST Version 1.1) within the first 16 weeks. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine complete response rate</outcome>
      <timepoint>The Complete response rate will be calculated by summing the number of participants assessed as having a complete response and dividing this by the total number of participants evaluable for response (according to RECIST Version 1.1). For the first 12 months, CT scans are performed every 8 weeks after which CT scans are performed 12 weekly. CT scans should continue until progressive disease.  </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine time-to-treatment failure
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time to treatment failure is defined as the time from either (i) randomization (if patients have not yet commenced treatment) or (ii) commencement of therapy (if patients are randomized during the first cycle of imatinib to  treatment discontinuation for any reason, including disease progression, treatment toxicity, patient preference, or death. This outcome will be assessed is up to 24 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine Safety/toxicity/tolerability
</outcome>
      <timepoint>The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (NCI CTCAE v4.0) will be used to classify and grade the intensity of adverse events after each treatment cycle. This outcome may be assessed until 30 days +/- 7 days after the last dose of treatment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine overall survival</outcome>
      <timepoint>Overall survival is defined as the interval from either (i) randomization (if patients have not yet commenced treatment) or (ii) commencement of therapy (if patients are randomized during the first cycle of imatinib) to date of death from any cause, or the date of last known follow-up alive. Maximum duration that this outcome may be assessed is N/A.</timepoint>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a randomized Phase II design to investigate the efficacy/activity of an alternating regimen of
21-25 days of imatinib followed by a 3-7-day gap for washout followed by 21 of regorafenib and a 7-
day gap for washout. The control group will be a regimen of continuous imatinib in a 56 day cycle.
In order to demonstrate a relative increase in progression free survival at 24 months from the date of
randomisation or commencement of imatinib ( if the participant had already commence treatment),
based on AHerns adjustment of Flemings design, approximately 110 evaluable participants in the
alternating group will provide 80% power with a 2-sided 95% confidence each to rule out a 24 month
expected PFS rate of 78% in favour of 88%. Allowing for a 1:1 randomisation, it is proposed to enrol
240 participants into the trial, allowing for approximately a 10% drop-out rate. Currently 80% of
participants are expected to achieve a clinical benefit at 24 months (CBR  rate of complete or partial
response, or stable disease). A secondary outcome would be to determine whether a minimum 25%
relative increase of the CBR (from 80% to 85%) in the experimental cohort can be attained.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to determine whether an alternating regime of imatinib and regorafenib improves disease control in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or more and have a confirmed diagnosis of metastatic GIST. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive an alternating regime of treatment with the drugs imatinib and regorafenib (administered orally by tablet). One treatment cycle lasts for 8 weeks. Participants in the other group will receive treatment with daily imatinib tablets only. Imatinib is currently used as the initial treatment for incurable GIST. Although many people with metastatic disease initially respond to imatinib, the cancer usually becomes resistant to this drug and starts to grow. The cancer drug called regorafenib works in a similar way to imatinib and has been shown to be effective against GIST after other treatments have stopped working. Participants will be regularly monitored for a minimum of 24 months follow-up  in order to determine whether the alternating treatment approach improves disease control. If it is found to have benefit and be tolerable, this alternating approach will be further evaluated in a larger study.</summary>
