  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aims of the study are to evaluate the duration and distribution of the sensory block after an ultrasound guided TAP block using a standard and refined needling technique.  Twenty participants undergoing lower abdominal surgery through lower midline incision will be studied prospectively.  Each participant will receive a bilateral TAP block using the refined needling technique on one side of the abdomen and the standard needling technique on the other side. Randomisation will determine which side receives which technique. 

The standard technique requires the needle to be inserted medial and parallel to the ultrasound probe. With ultrasound guidance it is directed in plane to ensure the tip lies between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis 1-2cm anterior to where the transversus abdominus muscle becomes a fascial extension. To confirm location, 2ml of normal saline can be injected. Once position is satisfactory, 0.5% Ropivacaine is injected in 5ml aliquots with aspiration between injection to a total of 0.75mg/kg.  The time required to perform this procedure is 5 to 10 minutes.

The refined  technique requires the needle to be inserted more medially compared with the standard technique and directed slightly laterally towards the ultrasound probe. Using ultrasound 'in plane' guidance the needle is positioned in the  transversus abdominis plane at its anterior origin and advanced along the plane to ensure at least 5cm of needle is contained within this plane. The tip should still lie 1-2cm anterior to where the transversus abdominus muscle becomes a fascial extension. Hydrodissection with saline may be used to assist needle positioning. Once position is satisfactory, 0.5% Ropivacaine is then injected in 5ml aliquots with aspiration between injection to a total of 0.75mg/kg.  Local anaesthetic should form a echolucent band tracking back along the needle separating the internal oblique from the transversus abdominis.  The time required to perform this procedure is 10 to 15 minutes.

The refined and standard needling procedures will be performed on the participants at the end of surgery while they are still anaesthetised.  They will be only performed once on each participant.


Abdominal sensory mapping (assessment of loss of sensation to ice and light touch) will be performed by a blinded researcher every two hours until full sensation has returned.  Assessment of pain on each side of the abdomen will be recorded using visual analogue scores.</interventions>

1. Asking the participant to complete three visual analogue score (VAS) analgesia scores. One for each side of the abdomen and one to compare each side of the abdomen.
2. Any sensory changes to ice and light touch will be mapped on an anatomical drawing. The researcher will cease assessments when no sensory changes can be ellicited</timepoint>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be identified by the research team three-four weeks in advance from the operating lists.  A participant information sheet will be given to potential participants in the anaesthetic pre operative assessment clinics or the nursing pre operative assessment clinic.  At this time, a brief verbal description of the trial will be given by the anaesthetist or by the nursing supervisor.   Participants will attend these clinics as part of their routine pre operative care, usually two-three weeks prior to their operation.

The evening prior to surgery, the potential participants will be contacted by a researcher and a detailed explanation given including the purpose of the trial, the procedure for performing TAP Blocks, risks of TAP Blocks and alternate forms of post-operative analgesia.

Signed consent will be sought by a researcher prior to surgery.

An envelope will be opened at the end of surgery which will allocate the patient to group A or Group B</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation and Blinding
An independent, non-researcher will produce a computer generated block randomisation table. Participants will be randomised to group A or Group B sequentially according to the randomisation table. These allocations will be concealed in twenty envelopes which will be labelled participants 1 to 20 on the outside.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ultrasound guided Transversus Abominis Plane (TAP) blocks are an effective technique to provide analgesia after lower abdominal surgery. TAP blocks are performed by injecting local anaesthetic around the nerves in the Transversus Abdominis Plane on both sides of the abdomen.  

This project seeks to examine the duration and distribution of sensory changes over the patients abdomen after bilateral  TAP blocks.  The study will also compare the standard TAP block technique to a refined technique which may provide superior analgesia.

Each patient in the study, while anaesthetised will receive a standard and a refined TAP block and then will be assessed by a researcher at 1 hour, 3 hours and then 2 hourly until full sensation returns to the abdomen.</summary>
