  <interventions>
    <interventions>11 subjects who suffered a second degree of ankle sprain underwent 14 days of ankle joint immobilization with a plaster cast. After removal of the plaster cast, were obtained bilaterally evaluations of: (1) leg circumference; (2) ankle joint range of motion (ROM); (3) maximal isometric torque of plantar and dorsiflexors obtained in seven different angles; and (4) electromyographic signals of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis and soleus muscles.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research was performed to identify the adaptations of dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles after two weeks of immobilization in subjects who suffered ankle sprain. Eleven subjects (six women and five men) who suffered a second degree of ankle sprain underwent 14 days of ankle joint immobilization with a plaster cast. After removal of the plaster cast, were obtained bilaterally evaluations of: (1) leg circumference; (2) ankle joint range of motion (ROM); (3) maximal isometric torque of plantar and dorsiflexors obtained in seven different angles; and (4) electromyographic signals of the tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis and soleus muscles. Results obtained in the immobilized side were compared to the contralateral healthy side.</summary>
