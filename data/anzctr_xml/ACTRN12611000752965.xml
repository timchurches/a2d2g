    <interventions>The current study proposes to offer a short, online, automated well-being program, called Mindfulness Online, to assist in reducing psychological distress and improving overall mental well-being for couples or individuals undertaking IVF.

Participants are offered access to the program before they commence a new treatment cycle (e.g,. before they start taking injections/drug treatments for that cycle). 

They are asked to log in once a week for a total of about 15 minutes each time to complete exercises on mindfulness techniques. They are also asked to include 5-minutes a day of offline practice for the 3-week duration of the program.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study proposes to offer a short, online, automated well-being program, called Mindfulness Online, to assist in reducing psychological distress and improving overall mental well-being for couples or individuals undertaking IVF. 

The program is designed to be used during the lead up to an IVF cycle.

A total of 50 couples undergoing standard IVF treatment will be randomised to either receive treatment as usual (wait-list control group) or complete the 3-week mindfulness program (treatment group). 

Couples (or individual women) will be offered the information form during consultation with their IVF specialist or after their mandatory pre-treatment counselling session. If they consent they will complete an online survey before and after the 3 week program containing demographic questionnaires plus measures of well-being, depression, anxiety, stress and mindfulness.

IVF treatment outcomes will be recorded (e.g., pregnancy test results) and those in the treatment group will complete a compliance measure at the end of the program.

The same surveys will also be administered to 25 couples undertaking the newer antagonist IVF cycle pre- and post-cycle to compare with the waitlist control group to see if there is any difference in stress/well-being measures between the two protocols.</summary>
