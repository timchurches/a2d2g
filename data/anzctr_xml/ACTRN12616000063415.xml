    <statisticalmethods>The largest prospective study looking at a defined set of postoperative pulmonary complications showed an overall incidence of 7.9%. Based on a conservative estimate of 7% baseline incidence and a conservative estimate that sugamamdex can reduce this to 3% (based on our retrospective study showing an odds reduction of 0.28, which would reduce the incidence to 1.96%) would produce a clinically relevant NNT of 29. Accepting an alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 0.2 would require 930 patients. Allowing for 5% incomplete data and loss to follow up requires 976 patients. 

Statistical analysis will be performed based on the outcome. 
1. PPC rate, QoR-40 score, hospital stay will be assessed as continuous variables
2. PONV score will be assessed as an ordinal variable
3. Mortality and the presence of respiratory and PACU events will be assessed as categorical variables

The effect of sugammadex on continuous variables will be analysed by 2-tailed Student T-test
The effect of sugammadex on ordinal and categorical variables will be analysed by Chi-squared tests
Binomial regression analysis will be performed on the categorical outcomes for the subgroup analyses. Logistic regression will be performed to analyse the effect of PONV risk on PONV scores.

Statistical tests appropriate to confirm test assumptions are met will be performed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In anaesthesia, traditional agents used for the reversal of paralytic agents are designed around the use of an anticholinesterase inhibitor (commonly neostigmine) to increase motor end plate acetylcholine. This is usually combined with an anti-muscarinic agent (atropine or glycopyrullate) to offset the autonomic effects of excess acetylcholine. Sugammadex is a newer agent that works via encapsulation of aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents. Whether or not sugammadex is superior to neostigmine based techniques in terms of prevention of the morbidity associated with residual paralysis have never been shown in a prospective randomised trial. P-PERSoN is a prospective multi-centre, double blinded, randomised controlled trial to compare neostigmine/glycopyrullate and sugammadex reversal. The primary outcome is all in-hospital respiratory events. Secondary outcomes will be, recovery room airway and desaturation events, hospital stay, quality of recovery scores, all-cause 30-day mortality and respiratory morbidity. </summary>
