  <interventions>
    <interventions>Specific low force chiropractic adjustments to reduce dural tension.
1. The duration of each adjustment will be ten minutes.
2. The part of the body where the adjustment will be made is determined on each visit by a neurological protocol.  Sacral, upper cervical or cranial adjustments are the most common type needed by children however occasionally the primary problem may be in an extremity.
3. The duration of the overall intervention is 16 weeks.
4. The frequency of the adjustments is once a week for 8 weeks followed by once a fornight for 8 weeks.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is being undertaken as a masters degree thesis. There is alot of anecdotal evidence of chiropractic care helping children with learning disabilities.  The purpose of this research is to use a scientific method to measure if children having difficulty reading can benefit from chiropactic care.</summary>
