  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Jet Impulse Technology (JIT) system, is supplied by Dickson and Dickson Healthcare (DnD Healthcare) and comprises a VENAjet pump system foot garment. 

This is a system that is used regularly for DVT prophylaxis in high risk and immobile patients post-surgery.

The subjects' foot that is intended to be casted will be placed in a foot compression garment (a cuff) that will be attached by tube assembly to a pump unit. When the pump unit is turned on, a distal aircell within the foot cuff will inflate rapidly to approximately 130mmHg +/-10% and will then settle to 52mmHg, and a proximal aircell follows approximately 0.3 seconds after, to settle at approximately 48mmHg. After 6 seconds of compression at 48-53mmHg, the cuffs deflate. The cycle repeats every minute. 

The JIT system will be placed on the participants foot, and the cast will be applied over the JIT system.

The JIT system is supposed to be used during non-weight bearing so those using the device will be asked to use it while they are seated or immobile during the day and while in bed at night. Information about device usage will be collected at each visit to determine the use of JIT (60%, or 14.4 hours per day average is defined as good adherence). 

In addition to this intervention, participants will receive the usual care of aspirin EC, 100mg daily.

The overall duration of lower limb immobiisation is expected to be a minimum of 4 weeks, out to a maximum of 8 weeks. 

At weeks 2 and 4 of enrolment, participants will have an above-cast ultrasound of the casted limb to check for asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

At approximately 8 weeks (after removal of the limb immobilisation), participants will have a full length lower limb ultrasound to check for asymptomatic DVT.
</interventions>
    <comparator>As this is a feasibility study to assess the utilisation and safety of the device and the likelihood of this being a comparator arm in the proposed MAIN RCT, there is no intended comparator group.

All potential participants that present during usual working hours will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study until 70 participants have been recruited. Those that choose not to participate will receive the usual care of 100mg aspirin EC daily. They will not be recruited into the trial and will not be followed up.</comparator>

    <concealment>During working hours, investigators â€“ in conjunction with nursing staff at the fracture clinic will identify potentially eligible participants. Subjects will be informed about the open-label trial and asked if they would participate. Those who decline to participate will be asked if this is because the treatment is a device rather than a medication. A log will be kept of potential participants who were treated and discharged outside of working hours and of all potential participants approached during the working day.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We intend to undertake a full study (MAIN RCT) consisting of a three-arm parallel groups randomised-controlled trial of low dose aspirin, an intermittent pneumatic compression device commercially known as Jet Impulse Technology (JIT) plus low dose aspirin, or rivaroxaban alone to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) secondary to cast immobility for a ruptured Achilles tendon or ankle fracture. 

For the proposed MAIN RCT to be viable, we need to establish the capacity to recruit, tolerability of JIT placement under a lower limb cast for a protracted period of time (up to 8 weeks), and adherence to the proposed JIT in-cast regime. 

This feasibility trial has been designed to establish the proportion of subjects likely to enrol in the MAIN RCT, the ease of application and acceptability of the JIT system under a cast, possible adverse events with the JIT system, and the proportion of symptomatic VTE events in the population enrolled in the trial.
