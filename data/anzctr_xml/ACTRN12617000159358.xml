  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will undergo a structured assessment from a palliative care nurse specialist (PCNS). This assessment will take place in a face to face consultation and occur at the participants facility of residence. The participant, and their next of kin if appropriate, will attend the consultation, which will take approximately two hours to complete. Each participant will receive a single consultation. The PCNS will also review available medical and aged residential care (ARC) facility documentation as well as the current medication list to identify advance care planning issues, potential medication concerns or issues of polypharmacy. Based on the findings of that initial assessment and identified patient and family goals of care, an individualized care plan will be formulated for each participant. The plan of care will be formulated in conjunction with the patient/family, aged residential facility caregiver(s), general practitioner, and appropriate hospice interdisciplinary team member(s). Each plan of care will address management of suffering in the physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual domains, and attempt to align documented treatment preferences and medical/nursing care with identified goals of care. Outcomes will be measured at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months post consultation. This will allow investigators to monitor adherence to the plan of care. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive routine facility care. This is defined as the live-in care that they are already receiving from aged care facility staff. This includes assistance with daily activities, food services, laundry, nursing care, dispensing of medications, and health care prescribed by a general practitioner.  </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Older people in aged residential care facilities are routinely assessed for their proclivity to decline in their health and functional status. These individuals often require a comprehensive and complex management approach to their healthcare, with needs often unmet. This need can potentially be fulfilled by the community palliative nurse specialist, with this service currently under-utilised by aged residential care facilities in New Zealand. This project studies the feasibility of implementing routine proactive review by a community palliative care nurse specialist for all residents in two aged residential facilities who are assessed as being at high risk of clinical decline, and compared to usual care of residents in two other facilities with similar risk. The primary objective is to determine whether the proactive approach by the palliative nurse will result in improved health outcomes, better symptom control and reduction in unnecessary or inappropriate health intervention. The outcome of this pilot study will guide the design of a larger study assessing the role of community palliative nurse in the aged residential care sector.  </summary>
