  <interventions>
    <interventions>A three year resilience intervention will be implemented in each school in the intervention group inclusive of the following six intervention strategies:
- Implementation of age appropriate resilience curriculum and programs targeting student resilience factors eg resilience linked to curriculum across subjects, use of existing programs such as the Resourceful Adolescent Program.
- Implementation of school policies and practices that impact on student resilience factors eg modification of welfare policies to include resilience, student reward and recognition program
- Modification of the physical and social environment of the school to create a safe and supportive environment where resilience is fostered eg modification of space use, student murals
- Development of partnerships with local organisations and community groups to deliver resilience strategies within the school eg Salvation Army, Aboriginal Community
- Improve access to, and promotion of, health and community services eg youth services, community health
- Implementation of strategies to engage and increase participation of parents and families in school-based activities eg social events, increased opportunity to attend school events</interventions>

    <concealment>Schools:
Schools will be selected from a current list of all government and Catholic secondary schools in the study area obtained from the Department of Education and Training and from relevant regional Catholic School Offices. The order in which schools will be invited to participate will then be determined using a random number function in Microsoft Excel by an independent statistician. The principals of the first 32 randomly selected eligible secondary schools will be sent a letter informing them about the study and requesting written consent for their school to participate. Within one week from the initial information letters being sent, research staff will contact non-responding principals to answer any questions they may have and to prompt for their reply. Principals that do not reply within a further week will receive additional prompts from research staff. If a school declines to consent the next school on the list will be invited, following the same procedure above. 
Once 32 schools have been recruited to the study, the sample will be stratified by current receipt of National Partnership Payment funding (low socio-economic schools are provided between AUS$1,000-1,500 per student for four years to improve student wellbeing (REF)) and school size (medium sized school 400-800; large sized school &gt;800). Twenty schools will then be randomly allocated to the intervention group and 12 to the control group by a statistician (using a random number function in SAS 9.2) using proportional random allocation.

Children:
Active parental consent will be required for child participation in the data collection part of the trial. In order to maximise parental consent for child participation, schools will be provided with information regarding the study to disseminate via existing school communication channels, including school newsletters, assemblies, staff meetings, and school community and parent groups. Parents will be given study information packs that include a short letter from the school principal on school letterhead, a detailed study information letter for parents, a simplified study information letter for students, a parental consent form for child participation and a reply paid envelope. Parents will be asked to return the consent form by either using the reply paid envelope, or directly to their childâ€™s school. Two weeks after distribution of the information packs, non-responding parents will be telephoned by school staff to prompt return of the child consent form.</concealment>
    <sequence>Eligible schools will be randomly selected from the list, and the order in which they are approached to participate will also be randomly determined (using a random number function in Excel) by a statistician.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A cluster randomised controlled trial study is proposed in 32 schools to test the efficacy of a comprehensive three year resilience intervention in decreasing the self reported health risk behaviours of secondary school students. Twenty schools will be randomly allocated to the intervention group and a further 12 schools randomly allocated to the control group. For evaluation purposes, web-based surveys will be conducted with a cohort of students in grade 7 attending both intervention and control schools at baseline (prior to intervention delivery), and three years after baseline data collection when the cohort are in grade 10. The surveys will include measures of self-reported health risk behaviours (including tobacco, alcohol, marijuana and other illicit drug use; nutritional intake, physical activity and sexual practices for those students in grade 10) risk of mental health problems, as well as student resilience scores. Comparisons will be made at follow up between grade 10 students in intervention and control schools to examine any differential changes in student health risk behaviours, risk of mental health problems, and resilience scores.</summary>
