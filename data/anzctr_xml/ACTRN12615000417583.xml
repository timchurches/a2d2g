  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients entered into the study will receive intravitreal injections of Aflibercept (Eylea) 2 mg/ 0.05mls. All patient's will be required to have an injection every month for a minimum of 3 months. After the mandatory 3 injections (week 8) BCVA, fundal examination and OCT assessment of the patient is used to determine the presence of residual CME. 
- If there is continued BCVA improvement of greater than or equal to 5 letters from the previous visit further injections will be given at a 4 weekly until there is no further improvement. Once BCVA is stable (within 5 letters of best recorded acuity), the OCT is free of either SRF or IRF and CMT is within 50 microns of previous best (minimum) recorded, an injection is given and the interval between the next visit is extended by two weeks up to a maximum of 12 weeks.


- During the period of extension, if there is a reduction in BCVA greater than or equal to 5 letters, evidence of recurrent SRF/ IRF or an increase of greater than or equal to 50 microns (from previous best recorded CMT), an aflibercept injection will be given and the follow up interval will be reduced by 2 weeks.


Following this protocol the time between injections will be extended by 2 weeks at each visit if the patients condition is stable, Using this treatment regimen, each patient receives at least seven injections in the first year. 

In the second year treatment may continued as per the criteria in year one, in addition treatment be suspended based on BCVA, OCT and fundus examination. Rescue treatment of intravitreal steroid or scatter laser may be performed if required.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this prospective case series participants with cystoid macula oedema secondary to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) who are treatment naive will receive treatment with Eylea using an inject and extend treatment protocol. In this study we aim to assess whether a treat and extend regimen is a useful option in the treatment of CME associated with CRVO. We hypothesise that visual acuity outcomes will be non-inferior to that achieved in the pivotal trials and that this will be achieved with fewer visits to the clinic. The study will run for approximately 36 months.  The recruitment period will last approximately 12 months.  Participant involvement will last approximately 24 months.  </summary>
