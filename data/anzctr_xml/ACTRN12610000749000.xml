    <interventions>Distal Peripheral Nerve Block Group: A preoperative (30 mins prior to surgery) one-off ultrasound guided block of the radial (at distal humerus), median and ulnar nerves (at the forearm level) will be performed using 3x 6 ml of ropivacaine 0.5%.Patients will also receive an ultrasound-guided infraclavicular injection of lignocaine 1.5% 30 ml with adrenaline 1/200,000 40 mins prior to surgery to cover torniquet pain.</interventions>
    <comparator>Infraclavicular Group:

A preoperative one-off ultrasound guided block of the infraclavicular brachial plexus will be performed: following standard intravascular injection precautions, 30 ml 20:10 ropivacaine 0.75%: lignocaine 2% with adrenaline 1/200,000 will be injected posterior to the axillary artery.
The duration/frequency of this treatment is the same as the intervention arm with the only difference being the site where the block is administered.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Brachial plexus block is a commonly performed anaesthetic/analgesic technique for elective wrist and hand surgery. Traditionally, long acting local anaesthetic is used which provides 12-15 hours potent postoperative analgesia; however, some patients experience dissatisfaction from the inevitable proximal limb paralysis. The recent availability in the operating room of portable ultrasound equipment has made it very feasible to block, at the level of the forearm, the individual nerves supplying the wrist and hand. This enables the provision of potent analgesia but without proximal extremity motor weakness. A potential disadvantage of this approach, however, is that the duration of blockade may be shorter.
The 2 approaches are to be compared in a prospective randomised manner with patient satisfaction as the primary outcome.</summary>
