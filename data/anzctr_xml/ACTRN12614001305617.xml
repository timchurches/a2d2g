  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Breastfeeding Self-Care Program (BSC-P) was given to primiparous women for one hour by primary researcher who was a nurse educator with midwifery qualification. The program included a booklet and a 14-minutes compact disk (CD) which focused on information about breastfeeding, for example; how to position and latch-on the baby, and how to identify if the baby was feeding well. We used the standard booklet from the Malaysian Ministry of Health together with breastfeeding self-checklist. The 14-item checklist was extracted from Clinical guidelines for the establishment of exclusive breastfeeding (International Board of Certified Lactation Consultant, 2005).  
Two individualized sessions at the womans bedside in the postnatal ward was provided during early postpartum period. The first session was carried out soon after group allocation within 24 hours of delivery. The second session was within 24 hours of the first session. One week after hospital discharge, the woman was contacted via telephone for the third session. The primary researcher observed and assessed breastfeeding using the Breastfeed Observation Aid from UNICEF/WHO (2006), which consists of five components: a) general condition of the woman and baby, b) breast, c) babys position, d) babys attachment, and e) suckling. The participants were also reminded to read program booklet and watch the CD that would help to overcome the difficulties in breastfeeding.

    <concealment>362 primiparous women admitted to postnatal ward of the hospital were assessed for eligibility during the study period from December 2011 to February 2012. The women who meet the inclusion criteria were briefly introduced to the study by the primary researcher and asked for the permission to provide detailed explanation about the study purposes and procedure. Women who deliver vaginally were approached 6-12 hours after delivery and those with a cesarean delivery were approached at 12-18 hours post-delivery.  Participants  were assigned into intervention group and control group by alternate week. Women admitted in first week and third week were assigned in the intervention group and those admitted in second and fourth week were assigned in the control group.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was calculated using the formula by Sakpal.20 The mean difference 5.1 with standard deviation of 10.92 (SE=1.5, n=53) was calculated based on the results of previous studies by McQueen, Dennis, Stremler, &amp; Norman (2011). In order to reduce the risk of committing type II error due to insufficient sample size and statistical power, the researcher fixed the power at 0.80 and alpha value of 0.05. To anticipate the potential attritions of subjects during the course of study, additional 10% of the samples were recruited. The total sample size was 90, with 45 in each group. 
To compare categorical variables between the intervention and the control group, Chi-square test was used. Since the data for breastfeeding efficacy score was not normally distributed, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare the score before and after intervention. To identify association between BSES score and intended duration of breastfeeding, the Spearmans Correlation Coefficient statistical test was used.  A two-tailed level of statistical significance of 0.05 was used. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This quasi-experimental study with pre-and-post-test design was conducted to evaluate the effect of a Breastfeeding Self-Care Program on breastfeeding self-efficacy. The study was carried out in postnatal unit of a tertiary care centre. A total of 90 primiparous women participated in this study. Equal numbers of participants (n=45) were allocated in the intervention group and the control group. Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF) was used to measure womens breastfeeding efficacy in early postpartum before intervention and after intervention at six week of postpartum period. The result showed that self-care program improved womens breastfeeding self-efficacy. </summary>
