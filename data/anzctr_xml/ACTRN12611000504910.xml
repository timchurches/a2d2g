  <interventions>
    <interventions>No intervention, Quality of Life Study.
Patients undergoing a PM for metastatic sarcoma will be invited to complete HRQOL Assessments prior to their surgery and at certain time points after their surgery for up to three years after their PM surgery.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) associated with pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) (specifically patient-reported dysponea, cough, chest pain, fatigue, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, emotional functioning and overall HRQOL).
HRQOL will be evaluate via The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) which is an electronic system aimed at improving and standardising measurement of patient-reported outcomes (PROs).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death.
Patient will be asked to complete HRQOL Assessments prior to their PM surgery, after discharge from hospital, 3-4 weeks after PM surgery, 3-4 months after PM surgery, 8-9 months after PM surgery, 12 months after PM surgery, 2 years after PM surgery and 3 years after PM surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate overall post-metastasectomy survival by evaluating the data recorded with HRQOL Assessment combined with data recorded in ACCORD. ACCORD is a health data based used by hospitals to record patient information such as surgery details and local of samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the patterns of care of patients having PM and peri-operative systemic therapy via ACCORD which is a health data based used by hospitals to record patient information such as surgery details and local of samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data available two years after accrual of the last patient will be analysed in the first instance..</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify prognostic factors associated with survival via ACCORD and HRQOL assessments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data available two years after accrual of the last patient will be analysed in the first instance.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To assess the psychometric properties of the PROMIS HRQOL measurement system relative to the EORTC HRQOL measurement system.

This is achieved by comparing the data measured in PROMIS HRQOL measurement system to data measured in the EORTC HRQOL measurement system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Data available two years after accrual of the last patient will be analysed in the first instance.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Relapse free survival based on clinical assessment and CT scans.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Site of reccurence after PM standard care follow up with treating doctor which is captured in ACCORD</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality time without symptoms of disease or toxicity (QTWIST)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Surgical adverse events such as (death at 30 day follow up,
date of hospital discharge after PM, prolonged air leak
&gt;7 days post-operatively, chest wall pain at 6 months
post-operatively, PEFR pre-operatively and postoperatively
at 3-4 weeks and 6 months), chemotherapy
toxicities, radiotherapy toxicities.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be recruited over 2 years and will be followed up for 3 years after accrual of the last patient or until death</timepoint>
