    <interventions>Robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy
Robot-assisted laparoscopy is the most advanced minimally invasive surgery technique characteristic of a magnified three-dimensional visualization and endowrist instruments with greater range of motion.Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a major surgical operation involving the pancreas, duodenum, and pylorus in most cases. 
Approximate duration required to complete robotic-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy is about  410minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Open pancreaticoduodenectomy
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), also called Whipple procedure, is a major surgical operation involving the pancreas, duodenum, and pylorus in most cases first described in 1938 for treating borderline or malignant pancreatic head, common bile duct, and duodenal pathologies.
Approximate duration required to complete open pancreaticoduodenectomy is about  315 minutes. </comparator>

    <concealment>The RLPD group was matched with the OPD group at a ratio of 1:2 using a matching patient’s algorithm according to age (within ± 5 years), sex, body mass index (BMI; &lt;18.5 versus 18.5–24.9 versus 25.0–29.9 versus = 30 kg/m2), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification (I versus II versus III), and malignancy (malignant vs. non-malignant), location (pancreas versus distal common bile duct versus periampullary region) and size of tumor. The matching process was verified every 2 enrolments in the RLPD group to allow targeted recruitment into the OPD group. All patients included were well informed of the advantages and disadvantages of RLPD and OPD by independent research nurses. All patients voluntarily gave written informed consent for participation in this study. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The statistical software SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Continuous data were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation (SD), and the means were compared using the two independent samples Student-t test. Categorical data were expressed as n(%) and compared using the Fishers exact probability test. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed variables. The linear regression was used to analyze whether demographic growth exhibited significance.  The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to determine whether operative time, bleeding volume and morbidity rate exhibited significant learning curves. Survival analysis was performed using the time between the date of surgery and the date of last follow-up or death. Survival curves were computed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared between groups by the log-rank test. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Robot-assisted laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (RLPD) is a novel minimally invasive surgery technique. None of prospective studies of large sample size comparing RLPD and OPD have been presented and long-tern oncologic outcome is lacking.This study aimed to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness and advancement of RLPD versus open PD (OPD). </summary>
