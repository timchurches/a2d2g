  <interventions>
    <interventions>Comparison of two strategies of reaching low central venous pressure (Low-CVP; below 5 mmHg) during liver resection surgery. 
One strategy is using absolute fluid restriction (Arm 1 - intervention), the other one relative volume redistribution caused by systemic vasodilation (Arm 2 - control). Treatments in both groups will be administered by treating anaesthesiologist (member of the study team) according to the randomization during the preoperative (from morning till surgery) and intraoperative period. Treatments in both arms will be graded into predefined steps.
In the Arm 1 absolute restriction of circulating volume will be provided by reduction of preoperative fluids (neither intravenous nor oral intake 6 hours prior surgery) coupled with minimal (1ml/kg/hour, Ringerfundin solution - B´Braun) intraoperative intravenous supplementation. If needed, given the CVP value assessed by the treating anaesthesiologist, diuretics will be further administered (Furosemide 10mg intravenous per step, maximum 3 doses allowed i.e. up to three steps) to reach the low-CVP target.  Participants will receive only the minimal number of steps required to reach the 5mmHg CVP target.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the Arm 2 standard preoperative intravenous fluid replacement for fasting (6 hours prior surgery, 100ml/hour Plasmalyte solution - Baxter) will be provided coupled with restrictive fluid loading in the pre-resection period (2ml/kg/hour, Ringerfundin solution- B´Braun). Relative fluid redistribution using volatile anesthetics (inhaled sevoflurane in O2 + N2O mixture; 1.6 and 2 times minimal alveolar concentrations as steps 1 and 2) and continuous infusion of vasodilators (isosorbid dinitrate 0.1% 5ml/hour intravenous  step 3) will be used to decrease the central venous pressure till the end of liver resection phase. Participants will receive only the minimal number of steps required to reach the 5mmHg CVP target.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Study is designed as a hypothesis and sample size generating for further research. It is limited  by study time, no calulation of  minimal number of participants has been made.
The analysis will be performed using the MedCalc software (Frank Schoonjans, MedCalc Software, Broekstraat 52, 9030, Mariekerke, Belgium). The Kolmogorov Smirnov test will be  used for normality assessment. Difference in normaly distributed data will be assessed using paired or unpaired student´s t test and Mann Whitney test will be used for abnormally distributed data. For time-dependent variables, repeated measures ANOVA test or Friedman test will be performed. Categorical variables will be tested using the Chi-square test. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to compare the effectivity of two methods of lowering central venous pressure (CVP) on the ease to reach the predefined target of CVP lower than 5 mmHg. Patients´ postoperative outcome assessed via composite morbidity (complications rate) and mortality till 30 days and hospital length of stay as well as intraoperative safety outcomes (hemodynamic stability, markers of global oxygen debt, blood loss,) will be assessed, allowing to define simple, standardized and safe approach of low-CVP anesthesia.</summary>
