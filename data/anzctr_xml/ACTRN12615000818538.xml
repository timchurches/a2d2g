    <interventions>Carfilzomib will be given in the following schedules, on Days 1,2,8,9,15,16 of a 4-week cycle for cycles 1 to 12 then on days 1,2,15,16 in a 4-week cycle during cycles 13-18. For the first 10 patients from each of Australia and Asia, the dose of carfilzomib will be 20/27 per m^2 (i.e. 20mg/m^2 on Cycle 1 Day 1, escalated to 27mg/m^2 from Cycle 1 Day 8). Safety data will be analysed from each of the cohort of 10 patients from Australia and Asia by the respective sponsors trial management committee, after the 10th patient has completed cycle 2 of treatment. Provided no more than 4 of the first 10 patients from each of Australia or Asia, experiencing Grade 4 toxicities as defined by the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.03) in the first 2 cycles, the subsequent patients will be started at a higher dose escalation of carfilzomib, 20/56 per m^2 (i.e. 20mg/m^2 on Cycle 1 Day 1, escalated to 56mg/m^2 from Cycle 1 Day 8) in combination with thalidomide and dexamethasone. Enrolment of patient 11 onwards will be halted until safety assessment has been done on the first 10 patients after their completion of 2 cycles of treatment. Safety reviews of the first cohort of 10 patient on carfilzomib dose 20/27mg per m^2 from each of Australia and Asia are to be done separately by the respective sponsors trial management committee, and will determine the dose schedule only for the respective patient cohorts.

For patients who were initially commenced on carfilzomib 20/27mg per m^2, dose escalation to 56mg/m^2 from Cycle 4 onwards is permitted if the patient has not achieved at least a PR after the second cycle of treatment and provided that the patient has not had grade &gt; or = 3 carfilzomib-related toxicities in the previous cycles. This is allowed prior to and irrespective of the assessment of grade 4 toxicities in the first cohort of 10 patients from each country. 
As there is evidence that a slower 30-minute infusion is better tolerated, all infusions of carfilzomib will be administered over 30 minutes.
Thalidomide will be given at a dose of 100 mg oral tablet daily from cycles 1 to 12. Dexamethasone will be given at a dose of 20 mg oral tablet on Days 1, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23 of a 4-week cycle from cycles 1 to 12, then 20 mg oral tablet on Days 1, 8, 15, 16 of a 4-week cycle from cycles 13-18. For patients aged above 75 years, a lower starting dose of dexamethasone of 12mg will be used and escalated to 20mg at the investigators discretion.  A log of administration will be maintained at the hospital.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of carfilzomib-thalidomide-dexamethasone (CarTD) therapy for relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have RRMM and have received between one and three lines of therapy previously. Study details The study will recruit participants in Australia and Singapore. All participants will receive 12 x 4-week cycles of CarTD therapy followed by 6 cycles of carfilzomib-dexamethasone only. The first 10 participants recruited in each country will receive a low dose for their first 3 cycles. Depending on the toxicity observed in these participants' first 2 cycles, a higher dose may then be used for their remaining cycles (cycle 4 onwards) and for all cycles in newly recruited participants. Patients will be monitored for myeloma response and safety and tolerability of CarTD therapy using blood samples and by reviewing adverse events that occur as well as for disease progression and survival information for 1 year following the last patients final cycle of treatment. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide an evaluation of the efficacy and safety of CarTD therapy in RRMM patients who have relapsed after prior treatment for multiple myeloma.</summary>
