    <interventions>Primary total hip replacement using a 36 mm metal on highly cross-linked polyethylene articulation. This is a surgical procedure where the femoral head is removed and replaced by a metal prosthetic femoral head (which in this situation has a diameter of 36 mm), which is attached to a femoral stem inserted into the femur. The head then articulates with a plastic (highly cross-linked polyethylene) liner in a metal acetabular shell, which is inserted into the acetabulum. The duration of the operation is between about 45 minutes and 4 hours, depending on the complexity of the operation. 
During the operation tiny tantalum beads are inserted into the polyethylene liner and periprosthetic bone to enable determination of polyethylene wear and acetabular component migration using a highly sophisticated radiographic technique, namely radiostereometric analysis.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A Registration Form detailing all inclusion and exclusion criteria is completed for every patient who is to undergo primary total hip replacement by one of the collaborating surgeons. All eligible patients are then given a Patient Information Sheet/Consent Form. Consenting patients are then stratified and randomised. An envelope with the allocation of either a 28 or 36 mm diameter articulation is opened intra-operatively, after intra-operative exclusion criteria have been assessed.</concealment>
    <sequence>A listing of all possible combinations of allocations in blocks of 2 to 8 was prepared (eg for a block of 4: 28,28,36,36; 36,36,28,28, 36,28,36,28 etc) and each combination was allocated a number. Then a random number generator was used to choose the combination sequence for the block sizes required in each stratum. </sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Patients are stratified for a number of factors that may affect primary and secondary outcomes (eg age, sex).
Blocked randomisation is then undertaken within strata, with patients being randomised to receive a total hip prosthesis with either a 28 mm or 36 mm articulation. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We have based our sample size calculation for the 36 mm articulation on an expected mean proximal linear wear of 0.08 mm between three months and two years, and a maximum acceptable mean proximal linear wear of no more than 0.14 mm between three months and two years. We have chosen to use a significance level of 5% (1-sided) and a power of 90% to calculate our sample size because of the limited amount of current knowledge of the in vivo wear of highly cross-linked polyethylene, especially in the 36 mm articulation. 
For a one-sample t-test of equivalence of means, a sample size of 21 is required in each arm of the trial in order to infer that the mean wear from 3 months to two years is no more than 0.14 mm, assuming that the sample mean wear is 0.08 mm, with a standard deviation of 0.09. 
The sample size was increased to 27 per arm to allow for attrition due to death and loss to follow-up.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised controlled trial aims to determine whether a primary total hip replacement prosthesis with a larger 36 mm diameter metal on highly cross-linked polyethylene articulation is associated with significantly greater polyethylene wear and acetabular component migration. This study utilises radiostereometric analysis, the most sensitive radiographic technique available to measure wear and migration in vivo.</summary>
