  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is designed to investigate red blood cell survival in patients with moderate CKD, on haemodialysis and on peritoneal dialysis in comparison with controls. RBC survival will be measured by means of labelling with radioactive chromium, whereby a sample of RBCs of a cross-section of ages is tagged and the disappearance of radioactivity is followed over a period of 4 weeks time.</interventions>
    <comparator>Red blood cell survival in patients with CKD will be compared with the red blood cell survival of healthy controls.</comparator>

      <timepoint>The baseline (equivalent to 100% of systemically administered radioactivity) sample (10ml) will be collected after 10-30 minutes. Subsequent samples will be collected every 3-4 days till day 24 and the final sample will be collected on day 32.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is believed to be caused by erythropoietin deficiency and decreased red blood cell (RBC) survival. The toxic uremic environment and mechanical damage caused by dialysis is thought to account for the reduced red cell life span. However the clinical evidence for this is minimal. To date no accurate data on RBC survival in CKD is available. We propose to undertake a study to investigate red blood cell survival in patients with moderate CKD, on haemodialysis and on peritoneal dialysis in comparison with controls. RBC survival will be measured by means of labelling with radioactive chromium. As almost half the patients with CKD are diabetic, glycaemic control remains an important aspect of their management. Therefore RBC survival will influence the accuracy of markers of glycaemic control, like HbA1c.</summary>
