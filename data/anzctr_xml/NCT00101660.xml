    <summary>The purpose of this study is assess the effects of the investigational drug dasatinib on
      participants who are in chronic phase Philadelphia chromosome chronic myeloid leukemia and
      who are either resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. Other purposes of the study are to
      identify any side effects the drug may produce and to study the level of dasatanib in the
      blood and assess the efficacy of dasatanib in the treatment of leukemia.</summary>
