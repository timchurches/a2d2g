  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two active interventions will be compared. They cover the same content but vary in terms of duration and delivery. The content covered across the two interventions includes: psychoeducation about anxiety; promoting emotional resilience in children; the role of thoughts in anxiety and how to encourage mental flexibility; the role of avoidance in anxiety and exposure; parental responses to children's anxiety (and the advantages and disadvantages of each of these); constructive coping and maintaining gains over time. 
All sessions will be conducted by postgraduate Clinical Psychology trainees, with some sessions to be conducted in conjunction with the named investigator - an experienced Clinical Psychologist.
Standard Fear-less Triple P consists of 6 weekly 2-hour sessions to be conducted at the University of Queensland. These sessions will be conducted in groups of up to 8 parents.
Workshop Fear-less Triple P consists of 1 4-hour workshop that will be held on at the University of Queensland. Up to 20 families will be included in each workshop. 
All therapy sessions will be recorded and a random 25% will be listened to by an independent research assistant to check for treatment adherence. A checklist outlining the content to be covered in each version of the program (workshop and standard) will be used for ensuring treatment adherence. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>On the basis of the literature, it is expected that the % of children who recover from their primary anxiety diagnosis in both the standard and workshop versions of Fear-less Triple P will be equivalent from the 6-month follow-up point onwards. The study is planned to be powered to provide 85% power at the 5% (2-sided) significance level. The sample size required using G*Power is 52 families per group. Allowing for 20% loss to follow-up, it is planned to enrol 125 families in the trial. 
Primary outcomes (diagnostic status) will be examined using chi square analyses. Secondary outcomes (questionnaire data) will be examined using repeated measures ANOVAs.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compare the efficacy of two different versions of Fear-less Triple P, a program for parents of anxiety-disordered children. The two versions differ in terms of intensity. The first version is the standard 6-session Fear-less program. The second version includes content from the 6-session Fear-less program but is delivered as a 4-hour workshop.</summary>
