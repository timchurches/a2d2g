Experimental: Arm A - Amixea- patented stoechiometrical mixture of EAA &amp; AA

Other interventions: Amixea
Amixea is a mixture of amino acids. It consists mainly of essential amino acids (EAA) that cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism, and therefore must be supplied in its diet.

Other interventions: Placebo

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of an amino acid mixture
      (Amixea) on the body composition as assessed by DXA, and on QMVC as assessed by strain gauge,
      in advanced NSCLC patients, compared to placebo, after 10 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the activity of Amixea on the degree of protein
      synthesis, on the nutritional risk and status and quality of life in advanced NSCLC patients,
      compared to placebo, after 10 weeks of treatment. In a small subsample, body composition will
      be evaluated opportunistically from clinically available CT scans.

      Adherence to, and patient satisfaction of treatment will be evaluated as exploratory
      objectives of this study. Finally, the overall safety and product tolerability will be
      evaluated.</summary>
