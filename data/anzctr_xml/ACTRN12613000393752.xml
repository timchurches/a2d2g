    <studytitle>Chest Australia: reducing time to consult with symptoms of lung cancer. </studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients who are at high risk of lung cancer, what is the effect of a complex intervention (comprising a primary-care nurse consultation, self-help manual, and self-monitoring reminders) compared to usual care on consultation rates and time to consultation for chest symptoms associated with lung cancer?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CHEST intervention is theoretically based and comprises a 40 minute consultation in which a nurse guides the patient through a self-help manual entitled Chest symptoms that Call for Action. This aims to increase the salience of chest symptoms, reinforce the benefits of and sanction early presentation, and a discussion of the barriers to presentation.  A personalised action plan is developed which is reinforced through regular monthly prompts.(via email, text message or phone). In addition, each patient is given a spirometry test to measure lung function.
Everyone will have a questionaire posted to them to complete at three different time points in the study: at the beginning, at one month, and at 12 months. Also if the patient consults with their GP with chest symptoms during the 12 month study period they will be asked to complete a shorter "Delays" questionnaire about their symptoms.  This is a self-completed questionnaire that obtains data on presenting symptoms and their duration prior to consultation. We will monitor every month during the trial the consultations of trial participants through electronic searches of the GP records. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment. If the patient is allocated to the "Usual Care" arm, they will still have a nurse consultation and a spirometry test, but will not be shown the handbook or have monthly prompts. They will still have the questionaires posted to them at baseline, 1 month and 12 months and if they do consult with respiratory symptoms in this time they also will be sent the "Delays" questionaire.  </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial will be consultation rates (with the GP) for respiratory symptoms identified through audit of the general practice medical record. </outcome>
      <timepoint>12 months after randomisation. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-efficacy for consulting without delay. This is a 10-item scale summed to score 10-100, within the self completed questionaire given at baseline, one month and 12 months. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, one month and 12 months. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptom Appraisal and help-seeking intervals. This will be measured using the DELAYS instrument (lung cancer version), a self-completed questionaire that obtains data on presenting symptoms and their duration prior to consultation. We will monitor every month during the trial the consultations of trial participants through electronic searches of the GP records. If a consultation has occurred about a respiratory symptom in that timeframe, the participant will be sent a DELAYS questionaire to complete about symptoms relating to that consultation. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Monitored for 12 months.  If a consultation does occur a "Symptoms questionaire" is sent to the patient.  </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the effect of an intervention aimed at promoting earlier symptom appraisal and help-seeking for people at higher risk of lung cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged between 55-90 years and have smoked at least one packet of cigarettes daily for a period of 20 years (i.e. 20 pack years). This includes ex-smokers if your cessation date was less than 15 years ago. Trial details: Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive standard care, whilst participants in the other group will be offered the CHEST intervention. This is theoretically based and comprises a 40 minute primary nurse consultation to discuss and implement a self-help manual, followed by monthly self-monitoring reminders by either, email, text message or phone call. Participants will be monitored for 12 months to evaluate the effect of the intervention on consultation rates and time to consultation for chest symptoms.</summary>
