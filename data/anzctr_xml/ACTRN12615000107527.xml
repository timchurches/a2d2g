    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We assume the treatment failure rate to all the three test drugs in the area is 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included. Allowing for a 25% loss to follow-up and withdrawal rate during the 28/42-day follow-up period, 100 patients should be included in the study per site per test drug. Two drugs will be tested in each of the three sites.

The WHO excel software programs will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Title: Efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in three provinces in Angola.

Purpose: 1) To assess the efficacy of the current first and/or second line treatment policy; 2) To assess the efficacy of a new antimalarial drug to support updating of the national policy 

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine and  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites: Benguela in Benguela Province, M'Banza Congo in Zaire Province, and Saurimo in Lunda Sul Province.

Study Period: January to April 2015.

Study Design:  Two cohorts prospective study in each site in sequential enrolment. 

Patient population: Febrile patients aged between 6 months to 9 years with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection.
 
Sample Size: 600 patients.

Treatment(s) and follow-up: artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28 (for artemether-lumefantrine, artesunate-amodiaquine) and 42 (for  dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine)-day follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.
Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events

Optional exploratory endpoints: 
to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for resistance
