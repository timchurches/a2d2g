  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive six x one hour telephone health coaching sessions over a six week period delivered by study-trained health professionals (health coaches). The health coaching sessions will focus on supporting participants to make positive lifestyle changes (physical activity, diet, weight management, alcohol and smoking) and to uptake colorectal cancer screening consistent with the Australian national guidelines. 
They will also receive (i) a participant handbook including educational information on lifestyle factors and colorectal cancer screening, (ii)worksheets and(ii) a pedometer.
The worksheets will be used to track dietary intake per day and number of steps per day. The worksheets are also used as a motivational tool to record goals, motivations and barriers to leading a healthy lifestyle. 
Participants are instructed to wear the pedometer daily during waking hours throughout the 6 week intervention period and to record the number of steps per day.</interventions>

In addition, participants were asked about their perceived risk of CRC using a modified version of brief validated
questions ["What proportion of people in the general population do you believe are diagnosed with CRC due to family history?, What do you think your chances are of ever developing CRC in your lifetime?"]</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>CanPrevent: This study investigates the feasibility and short-term effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention for first degree relatives of colorectal cancer survivors.

Who is it for?
First degree relatives (parents, siblings, and children) of someone with a confirmed diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer (C18-C20, C218).

Intervention Details
Participants will receive six x one hour telephone health coaching sessions over a six week period delivered by study-trained health professionals (health coaches). They will also receive (i) a participant handbook including educational information on lifestyle factors and colorectal cancer screening, (ii) worksheets and (ii) a pedometer.

Project Outcomes
This project will provide essential information to inform the development of a larger scale randomised controlled trial of the approach. If successful, short term study outcomes will include improved lifestyle factors and health-related quality of life potentially resulting in reduced risk of colorectal cancer, other cancers and other chronic conditions.</summary>
