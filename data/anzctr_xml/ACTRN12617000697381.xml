  <interventions>
    <interventions>0.5 grams of calcium as the citrate salt to be taken twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening, 12 hours apart). The morning dose will taken at our clinic with a standardized breakfast meal consisting of toast with spread, fruit and tea or coffee. The evening dose will be taken by participants at home. The intervention will be administered as oral tablets. The intervention will be taken by all participants at the first or second visit (in a cross-over design) with at least a 7 day washout period between visits. Those that receive the intervention at the second visit will continue to receive the intervention for a further 4 weeks. Adherence to the intervention will be monitored by tablet return. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be a calcium-free placebo, taken twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening, 12 hours apart). Methylcellulose will be administered as oral tablets, in an identical form to the intervention. The morning dose will taken at our clinic with a standardized breakfast meal consisting of toast with spread, fruit and tea or coffee. The evening dose will be taken by participants at home. The placebo will be taken by all participants at the first or second visit in a cross-over design. Those that receive the placebo at the second visit will continue to receive the placebo for a further 4 weeks. Adherence to the placebo will be monitored by tablet return.  </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>We have used the within subject standard deviation for the pooled difference between the differences in calcium and placebo at each time point observed in two previous similar trials to determine the difference in the change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure that could be detected with 80% power at the 5% significance level.   Allowing two participants lost to follow-up 50 participants would be adequately powered to detect differences of the changes in excess of 7.0mmHg systolic blood pressure and 3.4 mmHg diastolic.
The primary aim of this study is essentially descriptive. Initially the first and second visit 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure recordings will be plotted for each person to identify potential issues with the ambulatory blood pressure trace.  All correct data will then be summarized and plotted as mean +/- SD change over time for each treatment arm. Then the two time points in the cross-over phase will be collapsed for each person.  At each time point the difference between calcium and placebo will be calculated in the change in blood pressure from baseline and these mean differences of differences tested against a hypothesis of no difference in blood pressure using a mixed models approach to repeated measures controlling for repeated observations within the same participant over time.  In sensitivity analysis the model will include an order effect.  These analyses will include baseline blood pressure at the appropriate baseline as a covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix will be assumed for the within subject time and difference in treatment effects if possible. 
Analyses will be performed in SAS (v9.4, SAS Institute Cary, NC, USA) with no adjustment for multiplicity.   All tests will be two-tailed,  P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant and analysis will be according to the intention to treat principle.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people take calcium supplements to improve their bone health. However, studies have shown that people who take calcium supplements long-term have a slightly higher chance of having a heart attack. How calcium supplements increase the risk of a heart attack is not known, but it might be through an effect on our blood pressure. In a recent study we found that when women took a calcium supplement in the morning; their blood pressure was higher for the next several hours than when they took a placebo (a pill containing no calcium). If this increase in blood pressure is repeated every time a calcium supplement is taken long-term it could be what is causing the increased risk of a heart attack. 

Calcium supplements are usually taken twice a day, in the morning and evening. The aim of this study is to find out how calcium supplements affect our blood pressure over a full day and night. To do this we need to measure blood pressure for 24 hours in women taking a morning and evening dose of a calcium supplement. We also want to find out if any effects of calcium supplements on blood pressure persist when people take them long-term. To do this we want to repeat the 24-hour measurement of blood pressure after women have taken a calcium supplement for 4 weeks. 

We would like to enrol 50 healthy women who have been through the menopause for at least 5 years. This study will compare two treatments:
a. 0.5 grams of calcium as citrate (a calcium supplement) in the morning and evening
b. A placebo (pills containing no calcium) in the morning and evening

At each visit to our clinic participants will be given either the calcium supplement or the placebo along with a standardised breakfast meal. They will take their second dose of calcium or placebo pills that evening at home. During each visit to our clinic an ambulatory blood pressure monitor will be fitted on participants by study staff. This monitor will measure blood pressure every 30 minutes during the day and every 60 minutes during the night. Participants will be asked to keep an activity diary during the blood pressure monitoring periods. 

The first and second visits will be separated by at least 7 days during which participants will not be required to take any supplements. The second and third visits will be separated by 4 weeks during which half of the participants in the study will take the calcium supplement in the morning and evening every day and half will take the placebo. Participants will not know whether they are taking calcium or placebo at any of your visits or during the 4 weeks of supplementation.

This study is awaiting ethical approval from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee.
