  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study design is a double-blinded placebo controlled trial. 

There are 3 groups of participants of equal gender randomised to a treatment group to receive either fish oil capsules or placebo. The 3 treatment groups in this trial are: 
(i) 2 x 1g dose 500mg Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) [1:5 EPA/DHA] 
OR
(ii) 2 x 1g dose 500mg Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) [5:1 EPA/DHA]
OR
(iii) 2 x 1g dose Placebo (sunola oil)

Participants are required to consume the above dose, corresponding to the group they have been randomised to, daily for a 4 week dietary intervention period.
Participants are assessed at baseline and after the 4 week period.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this trial is to determine the gender-specific responses in platelet function (aggregation) following omega-3 fatty acid supplementation over a 4 week period.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples from participants will be collected at the commencement of the study (prior to suppplementation) and again after the 4 week supplementation period. Whole blood platelet aggregation, platelet count, biomarkers of coagulation and a complete plasma lipid profile will be generated from each blood sample.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcome is to compare the difference in the efficacy of the varying concencentrations of the omega-3 fatty acids in the treatment groups (Eicosapentaenoic Acid, Docosahexaenoic Acid) to influence platelet function.</outcome>
      <timepoint>All these outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks post intervention.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to examine how different fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) concentrates can influence platelet activity and improve platelet function in males and females. There is evidence in the published literature that response to fish oil supplementation is influenced by a gender-specific manner. Moreover, fish oil supplements contain different concentration ratios of the active ingredients, EPA and DHA. This research project will determine how gender influences fish oil supplementation so that males and females can receive maximum benefit against cardiovascular disease risk.</summary>
