  <interventions>
    <interventions>Suitable participants will be provided with the self-help workbook Face Your Fears. This workbook is written by a leading expert in the field of anxiety disorders and contains cognitive-behavioural skills to address all anxiety disorders (i.e. is a transdiagnostic treatment). Participants will be encouraged to follow a schedule of reading rather than reading the whole book at once. The proposed reading schedule will be delivered over an 8 week period and is outlined below. Participants will be informed of this structure in a welcome letter that is provided with the book. Participants are required to read the book and practice the skills described within the book for homework. Brief therapist support is provided by phone as the participant works through the program (approximately 10-15 minutes per weekly call). It is anticipated that participants will spend 3-4 hours per week doing the readings and practising the skills and 10-15 minutes each week with the therapist over the phone.
