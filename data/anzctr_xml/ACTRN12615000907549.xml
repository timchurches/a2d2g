  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard Pelvic floor exercises using PeriCoach biofeedback system
The PeriCoach Sensor unit is switched on, inserted, and paired with the app on the smartphone or tablet. The accompanying smart phone application instructs users to squeeze their pelvic floor muscles at certain timepoints. The biosensors on the device measure the contraction and provide instant feedback to the participant via the app.

The PeriCoach should be used at least once a day with each session lasting 2-4 minutes for the period of the trial- 20 weeks. The app uploads the data to a web portal where it is stored and can be accessed by the user, and remotely by the treating clinician (password protected)</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Pelvic floor exercises using a combination of pulse contraction and held contraction (squeeze and lift) exercises with no device inserted for control group.  
The squeeze and lift exercise should be repeated up to 8 to 12 times, holding the lift for 8 seconds if possible, resting for 8 seconds between each lift.  Three sets of squeezes should be attempted with a rest between each set.  
The exercises should be repeated three times a day while lying down, standing or sitting.  Exercises should be continued for the 20 weeks duration of the study or as instructed by your physician.  The Pericoach group will provide feedback with regards to usage.  The control group will be asked to keep a diary of number of times exercises performed.

    <concealment>Participants will be randomised at the completion of screening activities during Visit 2 and prior to device utilisation and training or at the commencement of Visit 3. Randomisation will be 1:1 and will be undertaking by contacting a central phone number which will issue a pre- allocated overall study specific randomisation number. A study participant will be considered enrolled and assigned a study participant ID number if they meet all eligibility criteria at visit #2. Once eligibility criteria are confirmed at this visit the participant will be randomised. Study participant IDs will be of the format “Site #, Participant#”; e.g.  01-01 for the first participant enrolled at Site 1. The Screening Log will contain the study participant number and initials but no other study participant identifiers. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence has been developed by a statistician and is 1:1 - randomisation is a simple method created by computer software using a computerised sequence generation and provided by the statistician.  </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This is a randomised parallel group comparison of standard pelvic floor exercises with standard pelvic floor exercises and the PeriCoach device. Continuous variables will be summarized at each time using descriptive statistics including mean with a standard deviation or median with the interquartile range, the minimum and maximum, and the number of non-missing values.  Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and proportions.

Primary Endpoints
The primary endpoint, a significant reduction in pad weight, will be compared between randomised groups using a Chi-square test and summarised as the difference in percentages with an exact 95% confidence interval. 

Additionally, the mean change in the two 24-hour pad weight tests  (completed at screening and 20 weeks) and averaged within a visit to provide a single 24-hour pad weight test result per visit) from baseline to 20 weeks will be compared between randomised groups using an independent t-test.  The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population among study participants with two 24-hour pad weight tests at baseline and 3-months.  A secondary sensitivity analysis will be conducted including pad weight results among study participants that only completed one 24-hour pad weight test at either baseline or 3-months. Analyses of the primary endpoint will also be conducted on the PP population as a further sensitivity analysis in support of the ITT analysis results.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis will be performed on the ITT cohort where study participants with missing data are considered failures, i.e. did not achieve a significant reduction in pad weight.  Primary endpoint rates will also be presented by radiated and irradiated study participant groups.   

Secondary Endpoints
Continuous endpoints will be compared between randomised groups using independent t-tests and summarised as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals and categorical outcomes will compared with chi-square tests or fishers exact tests as appropriate and summarised as the difference in percentages with exact 95% confidence intervals.  The secondary endpoints will be evaluated using the ITT cohort.  All available data will be used for the analyses, and no imputation for missing data will be employed. Additional secondary analyses will utilise the per-protocol population.
Power was computed on the basis that the percentage successfully treated at 20 weeks in the control arm will be approximately 30% and in the Pericoach assisted arm this will be 50% or more. Using these assumptions a sample size of 90 (45:45) randomised participants will have 80% power to show this difference as statistically significant (two-sided a=0.05).  The additional 10 participants included in the target sample size have been added to allow for possible participant drop out.
