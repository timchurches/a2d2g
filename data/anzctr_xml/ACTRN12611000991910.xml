  <interventions>
    <interventions>Action Observation Training is performed by a parent/caregiver of each infant in this cohort for 4 weeks; from 9 to 13 post-term weeks of age, for 6 days per week. Three sessions of 5 minutes are performed each day, for a total daily training dose of 15 minutes.  Each session involves the parent/caregiver showing the baby the action of repeatedly grasping a toy. There is a set of 3 toys presented in a random order, and the time is monitored on a stopwatch. If the infant stops attending, the timer is stopped and the baby is allowed to grasp and play with the toy for a short period. The session can then recommence and the timer started again so that they baby has a full 5 minutes of training. The total dose of training over the 4 weeks is 6 hours.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to explore, in a randomised trial, whether a novel training program based on the observation of hand action can influence the early development of hand reaching and grasping in healthy infants and infants with asymmetric brain injury. This study will compare Action Observation Training with standard Observation Training in a population of healthy term infants, as well as in a population of infants with asymmetric brain injury. 

It is predicted that: 
(1) Action Observation Training will improve the symmetry of bimanual hand function as measured on the Infant Hand Assesment at 18 weeks, compared to standard Observation Training; and
(2) Action Observation Training will have a greater impact on the quantity and quality of reaching and grasping of the impaired hand as measured on the Reach and Grasp Assessment at 18 weeks, compared to standard Observation Training.</summary>
