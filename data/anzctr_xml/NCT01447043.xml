  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Retrospective, non-interventional, observational multi-center field study. Patients diagnosed
      with wet Age-related macular degeneration (wAMD) and having started treatment with
      ranibizumab between January 1, 2009 and August 31, 2009 must be consecutively screened and,
      if eligible, enrolled. Patients will be followed up at maximum until August 31, 2011. Switch
      to any other Anti vascUlar endothelial growth factor (anti VEGF) treatment will be documented
      and followed up. For each patient, demographics, medical history, administered treatments,
      results of ocular and visual assessments and other tests (where available) will be
      documented.</summary>
