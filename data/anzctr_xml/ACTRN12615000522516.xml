  <interventions>
    <interventions>Initial intervention criteria: A Shock Index (i.e. Heart Rate / Systolic Blood Pressure) &gt;= 1.0 and other eligibility criteria met

Intervention:  Initial intravenous infusion (usually over ~ 20 minutes) of HBOC-201 (250 ml) or NS ( in 250 ml increments  up to 1,000ml ml)

HBOC-201 is an experimental intravenous fluid with oxygen carrying capacity derived from bovine red blood cell hemoglobin.  The HBOC-201 is a deep red coloured fluid.

Maximum total dose: Doses of IV fluid following initial infusion will be HBOC-201 (250 ml) or NS solution to maintain BP &gt; 70 mmHg depending on randomisation arm.  If further IV fluid is indicated in the HBOC-201 arm after a maximum limit of 2 units of HBOC-201 [2 doses of 250 ml] has been infused standard care (NS) will be administered.  If the Systolic BP is &lt; 70mmHg whilst the HBOC-201 is being infused either as the initial or the second dose of 250 ml, NS will also be administered via a second IV line until the BP is &gt; 70mmHg. 
 
IV infusion stopping criterion: A Systolic Blood Pressure &gt; 120 mmHg and Pulse Rate &lt; 120 beats/minute.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>48 Ambulance Victoria road cars (MICA Single Responder and MICA Stretcher vehicles) will be equipped with 2 units of 250 ml HBOC-201.  
500 opaque sealed envelopes with equal allocation of NS or HBOC-201 will be prepared.  The envelope will be opened by the attending Mobile Intensive Care Officer if the patient meets the enrolment criteria.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sealed, opaque allocation envelopes will be block randomised and distributed across the 48 road cars in batches of 4. Each batch will contained 50% NS arm allocations and 50% HBOC201 arm allocations. 

If the patient is identified as meeting the eligibility criteria, the attending paramedic will open an envelope containing a card indicating randomisation to ‘standard therapy’ Normal Saline or randomisation to HBOC-201.

    <statisticalmethods>Efficacy statistical significance level will be p &lt; 0.05 at final analysis.  Contingency Tables will be developed for dichotomised ordinal data. Fishers exact test will be used to calculate the significance of differences.  Continuous data will be analysed using Students t-test with log transformations conducted as required for normalisation. Holm t-test adjustments will be conducted to adjust for the wide range of secondary outcome measures.  Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be undertaken to generate tables and plots of the survival or hazard function post randomisation. Chi Square or Fishers exact tests will compare Rate Ratios along with Wilcoxon rank sum for duration.

The effect size of this improvement is currently unknown.  This pilot study will determine an estimate of the effect of prehospital HBOC-201 in shocked trauma patients. Trauma Registry estimates are that 75% of eligible patients with a prehospital Shock Index of &gt; 1.0 have a Shock index &gt; 1.0 on Trauma Centre arrival. Assuming a minimum acceptable effect which reduces the number of patients arriving at the Trauma Centre(s) with a Shock Index &gt; 1.0 by an absolute 30.0% (proportion = 0.45) with an alpha of 0.050 and a power of 0.80, the number of total patients needed to enrol in this pilot study is 96 (48 in each arm) (Stata 1C/13.1). 110 will be recruited in total to allow for loss to follow-up.</statisticalmethods>
