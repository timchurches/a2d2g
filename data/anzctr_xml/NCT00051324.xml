  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Refine the prediction of disease diagnosis (motor conversion) using longitudinal measures of plasma, imaging, cognitive performance, motor ratings, psychiatric and functional measures - HD diagnosis will be better predicted by adding longitudinal change to the baseline measures of striatal and white matter volumes, tone-paced and speeded tapping score, tower moves, stroop interference and motor score.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improve markers of disease progression that become abnormal prior to the clinical diagnosis and to characterize their natural history. - Predictive models for HD diagnosis will be further improved (resulting in greater power and lower clinical trial sample size) by adding additional, sensitive measures to the PREDICT-HD exam (e.g., behavioral: companion frontal rating, cognitive: Maze test score, imaging: DTI fractional anisotropy, plasma marker: 8OHDG).
Comparisons of change rates across time will suggest measures best suited to clinical trials by large effect sizes and low variability.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Establish the validity and reliability of disease measures identified in Outcomes 1 and 2. - This will require that we continuously analyze recently collected data, remove items that are insensitive, and add new items to be tested throughout the course of the study. The power and sensitivity of future multi-site trials and studies depend on accurate measures of marker validity.
HD diagnosis will be better predicted by UHDRS total motor score following new standardized reliability training and by the tapping task under modified more challenging, conditions. Psychiatric and functional ratings will be improved with item response analyses and dynamic piloting of item edits to establish the most psychometrically sound items for clinical trials.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One year</timepoint>

          -  treatment with phenothiazine-derivative antiemetic medications such as
             prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, promethazine, and Inapsine on a regular basis
             (greater than 3 times per month);
