Treatment: drugs: OMP-21M18
The first 6 participants will receive OMP21M18 2.5 mg/kg once every other week, the next 6 participants will receive 5 mg/kg once every other week, and the final 6 participants will receive 10 mg/kg once every other week. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the data for the 6 participants in each dose level after the last participant in that group has been treated for 56 days and decide whether it is safe to move up to the next highest dose level. After confirming the optimum dose, 14 additional participants will be treated at the highest dose level that the DSMB considers safe.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new drug,
      OMP-21M18, when given in combination with FOLFIRI, a standard drug treatment for advanced
      colorectal cancer. Participants must not have had more than one chemotherapy regimen for
      their metastatic disease. OMP-21M18 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the
      laboratory) developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP-21M18 will
      also be investigated.

      Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, at up to 6 centres in Australia and New Zealand,
      will receive intravenous infusions of OMP-21M18 followed by FOLFIRI every two weeks, until
      disease progression or limited by drug toxicity. After 8 weeks, participants will undergo
      assessments to determine their disease status. If there is no evidence of disease progression
      participants will continue to receive infusions of OMP-21M18 and FOLFIRI every second week,
      until disease progression.</summary>
