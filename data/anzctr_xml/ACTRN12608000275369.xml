  <interventions>
    <interventions>The South Australian Family Home Visiting Program is a targeted intervention. Participating mothers and infants receive 34 planned home visits delivered by specially trained nurses, commencing when infants are aged 2 to 3 months and finishing when they are aged 2 years. 

Goals of the program include (1) enhancing the mental and physical health of children, parents, and families, (2) enhancing the cognitive, social and emotional well-being of children and their families, (3) assisting families in providing a safe and supportive environment for their children, and (4) linking families to available resources and networks within the community.

Longer term goals when children are aged 5 years include (1) better 'school readiness' for children, and (2) better quality relationships between children and their mothers and teachers..</interventions>
