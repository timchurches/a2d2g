  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to examine the use of StrataXRT silicone gel in the management and prophylaxis of skin reactions on patients receiving external beam radiation therapy to the whole breast at Townsville Cancer Center (TCC). StrataXRT is Therapeutic Goods Administration approved product in Australia. The silcone-based gel has two aims:  prophylatic care of skin to reduce skin reactions and improve skin care management once a reaction occurs.  The outcomes from this pilot will also help investigators determine if further study is warranted.  

A 20 gram tube of StrataXRT will be provided to the patient. Stratpharma, the pharmaceutical company representing StrataXRT, have indicated that one tube should be sufficient for the entire length of treatment, with one application per day for five weeks of treatment with enough product left over for post-treatment application. Additional StrataXRT gel will be provided if required.  

The first application of StrataXRT will be on the patients first day of treatment and will be done by the investigating radiation therapists as recommended by Stratpharma. This will continue for the first week of treatment and ensures the correct amount (approximately the size of a 5 cent coin) is applied. 
The gel should form a thin, clear barrier if applied properly. 

During this time, patients will be instructed on the correct application of the product by one of the two investigating therapists. This will facilitate correct application by the individual patient for the remainder of treatment. Patients should continue to use their allocated product until the skin reaction has resolved.

In patients where moist desquamation develops, StrataXRT will continue to be used for skin care. Patients using Sorbolene cream will see nursing staff for appropriate management or dressings 

Adherence to the product will be queried at weekly review. As with current standard skin care, self-reporting adherence is the only monitor of compliance. 
If patients are unable to comply with skin care product application, they will taken off the trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>The patients randomised to the control arm of this trial will receive the current stanadard skin care management at TCC. That is, and aqueous cream, Sorbolene, throughout their radiation therapy treatment, 
Sorbolene is applied daily after treatment and increased with frequency as required. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin reaction grading is the primary outcome which will be  measured with a skin grading assessment sheet and clinical photographs. The assessment sheet is designed by Stratpharma and is based on the Radiation Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) created by Noble-Adams.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The primary outcome will be assessed for each patient on a weekly basis.  Day one will provide a baseline measurement, and skin reaction will be graded weekly thereafter until the completion of treatment. 
The control group receiving standard care will be compared against StrataXRT group for skin reaction grading once all patients on the study have completed treatment.
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Satisfaction with the product- ease of use. This will be measured using an assessment sheet.
 The assessment sheet has been provided by Stratpharma and will be used for a larger, multi-center study that will assess StrataXRT, as well as this smaller pilot study. </outcome>
      <timepoint>As with primary endpoint, baseline assessment of product will occur at Day 1 and weekly thereafter until the completion of treatment.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Randomisation will occur utilising the “envelope method” whereby five envelopes contain Arm 1 and five envelopes contain Arm 2. Envelopes are constructed by a separate, uninvolved third party and shuffled by this third party to reduce bias due to sequential order. The patient will be given an envelope containing the arm they will belong to for the duration of treatment. As StrataXRT will be applied by the investigators for the first week of treatment, investigators will be required to know which arm the patient belongs to following randomisation.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>For the pilot study, initial data analysis will be based on the RTOG scale for radiation dermatitis. Clinical photographs will be review for assessment of skin reactions throughout treatment. The 10 patients accrued will be assessed by a team comprised of radiation therapists, Radiation Oncologists and radiation oncology nurses to determine if a phase two study is indicated. All analyses will be performed by the investigators and will not involve Stratpharma, the pharmaceutical company who provide the product</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>TThis study is being conducted to assess a new skin product against the standard skin care procedures at Townsville Cancer Center (TCC) in breast cancer patients receiving external beam radiation therapy. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more and have a confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, for which you will be undergoing external beam radiation therapy.
 Study details 
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the current standard skin care management. That is, an aqueous cream, Sorbolene, applied daily after radiation therapy treatment. Participants in the other group will instead receive a new product called StrataXRT, which is a silicone based gel applied to the skin which acts as a barrier to prevent the development of radiation-induced skin reactions. The product is TGA approved in Australia; FDA approved in the United States and is being used clinically in other centres in Australia. All participants will be assessed at the beginning of treatment and weekly thereafter using a specific skin grading scale, and clinical photographs will be taken. 
The study is attempting to determine if StrataXRT is equivalent to current practices, and whether further study on the product is warranted.
