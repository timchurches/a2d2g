    <summary>Hip fractures are a significant problem for healthcare providers due to the increasing
      incidence of fractures in an ageing population. Hip fracture is the most frequent fracture
      for people over 80 years of age and the second most frequent for those over 65 years. It is
      projected that by 2051, 23% of the Australian population will be older than 65 and the number
      of hip fractures will rise fourfold (17,000 in 2004, to 60,000 in 2051).

      Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding management of hip fracture were
      published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1999 and updated in 2003. Seventeen aspects
      of treatment were systematically reviewed, including mobilisation after surgery. Early
      assisted ambulation within 48 hours post surgery was recommended (Chilov 2003 p 490).
      However, the recommendation was based on observational (level 3) evidence only.

      Early mobilization post surgery is resource intensive. Early mobilization is challenging and
      uncomfortable for the patient and requires the assistance of one or sometimes two,
      physiotherapists available seven days per week. Benefits must be rigorously evaluated to
      justify recommendation. We undertook a randomized controlled trial of the effect of two
      different time to first ambulation intervals after hip fracture surgery on patient and
      hospital outcomes.Our hypothesis was that early mobilisation would accelerate functional
      recovery after hip fracture surgery.</summary>
