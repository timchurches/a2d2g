  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis: That a high hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in extremely low birth weight
      (ELBW) infants is associated with a lower rate of survival without severe morbidity (defined
      as one or more of retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or periventricular
      leukomalacia/ventriculomegaly).

      Primary Objective: To determine whether either a liberal or more restrictive threshold of
      hemoglobin level for red cell transfusion in ELBW infants is safer, by randomizing to either
      a high transfusion hemoglobin threshold or a low transfusion hemoglobin threshold.

      Follow-up at a corrected age of 18 months represents a conventional age at which to first
      assess neurodevelopmental outcomes, and to predict long-term outcomes.</summary>
