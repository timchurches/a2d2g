  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be three AIRVO interventions each lasting 20 minutes. These will involve breathing heated and humidified room air through the AIRVO nasal interface (nasal prongs which sit inside both nostrils). Three different flow rates will be used: 45L/min, 30L/min and 15L/min.
A 15 minute 'washout' period will follow each intervention. During this time the subject will breathe room air without any breathing apparatus.
Note: The 45 L/min intervention will have 30 seconds of delivery at 30L/min at the beginning to allow the participant to more comfortably get used to the subsequent 45 L/min level.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be considered enrolled and part of the study population at the time the Consent Form has been filled in by both the Participant and Study Investigator.

The Blinded Investigator responsible for documenting PtCO2, heart rate and oxygen saturations, will be blinded to which AIRVO intervention the participant is receiving by a screen and wearing earplugs. A second Un-blinded Investigator will be responsible for opening an opaque envelope containing the randomised treatment, applying and calibrating the plethysmography bands for measuring minute ventilation, administering the randomised treatment, and recording respiratory rate. The participant will not be told the order they receive the different flow rates via the AIRVO 2. We will ask them not to divulge any detected differences in flow to the investigators due to risk of un-blinding the Blinded Investigator.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation code will be pre-generated by the study statistician by computer and stored in a sealed opaque envelope which will be opened by the Un-Blinded Investigator at randomisation (immediately prior to the first intervention).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effect of the AIRVO device (high flow nasal therapy) on the blood levels of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) in participants with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
Acute exacerbations of this condition cause a build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood which can require ventilation and increase risk of death. Acute exacerbations of COPD lead to 9000 hospital admissions in New Zealand every year. High flow nasal therapy has a potential role in lowering carbon dioxide levels in COPD patients and we therefore wish to study the effects further.
Participants will undergo an informed consent process, gathering of personal/medical information and lung function testing. They will then be randomised to the order they receive 4 interventions for 20 minutes at a time and a washout period of 15 minutes after each. The AIRVO device will be used to deliver air for 3 interventions at different flow rates. The 4th intervention will be 20mins of the participant breathing room air whilst being monitored. The participant will be asked to complete a tolerability questionnaire following each 20 minute intervention with the AIRVO. 
The primary aim of the study is to identify whether the AIRVO device has an impact on PaCO2 levels in participants. Secondary outcomes include how well participants tolerate the AIRVO machine and other physical parameters such as respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, minute ventilation and heart rate.</summary>
