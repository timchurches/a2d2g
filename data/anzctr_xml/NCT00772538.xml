             (whichever is greater) prior to Visit 1.

          9. Patients who have been treated with the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium
             (Spiriva®), beta-blocker medication, oral beta-adrenergics, other non-approved and
             according to international guidelines not recommended ´experimental´ drugs for routine
             asthma therapy (e.g. TNF-alpha blockers, methotrexate, cyclosporin) within four weeks
             prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) or during the screening period.

         10. Patients with any asthma exacerbation or respiratory tract infection in the four weeks
             prior to the trial.

         11. Patients who have previously been randomised in this trial or in the respective twin
             trial (205.416 versus 205.417) or are currently participating in another trial.

         12. Patients with a known narrow-angle glaucoma.

        Note:

        As with other anticholinergic drugs, tiotropium should be used with caution in patients
        with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.

        As with all predominantly renally excreted drugs, patients with moderate to severe renal
        impairment (known creatinine clearance of &lt;= 50 mL/min) treated with tiotropium should be
        monitored closely.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The trial is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of 5 µg tiotropium over a 48-week treatment period as compared to
      placebo. Tiotropium inhalation solution delivered by the Respimat® inhaler will be examined
      as add-on controller therapy on top of usual care in patients with severe persistent asthma.

      The primary objective of each trial is to evaluate the long term efficacy of tiotropium over
      placebo on top of usual care in patients with severe persistent asthma as determined by
      pulmonary function testing, effects on asthma exacerbations, effects on quality of life, on
      asthma control and health care resource utilisation. The secondary objective of each trial is
      to compare the long term safety of tiotropium with placebo in this patient population.</summary>
