  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of an oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) in
      preventing bone loss in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who are receiving
      anastrozole therapy, and to determine how long alendronate treatment is needed.</summary>
