    <scientifictitle>Accident Care Evaluation Study: the effect of an educational program and a clinic that provides specialist medical assessment and referral early to improve health outcomes and reduce costs in patients who have mild to moderate soft tissue injuries including whiplash associated disorders, following motor vehicle accidents compared with a control group with similar injuries who receive standard care available in the Australian Capital Territory.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Specialist assessment involves patients attending a clinic created exclusively for the Accident Care Evaluation Study, and includes the services of a physician with specialist musculoskeletal training and nurse educator.
Clinic participants are assessed and treatment plans are developed to assist the patients primary health care professionals and ancillary healthcare providers manage their care. Assessment and treatment is based on evidenced based guidelines for the management of acute musculoskeletal pain. The examining physician obtains a medical history that includes past medical history, regular medications, occupation, home domestic situation, injury history, treatment to date, investigations to date, current symptoms, results of functional assessment tools and the patient's current expectations in relation to their injury.  A physical examination, structured on evidence-based-practice, is performed in relation to the specific injuries involved. A detailed explanation of the nature and likely natural history of their condition is provided to the participant.

2.Treatment Planning.
Following assessment the patient is given a detailed explanation of the nature and likely natural history of their condition.  In most cases this involves an explanation of the 'pain-dysfunction cycle' using the aid of a PowerPoint presentation.  The patient receives an outline of the recommended treatment program including a range of rehabilitation exercises with specific written instructions reinforcing their rehabilitation program.  The exercise instruction sheets have step-by-step instructions and digital photographs to assist with patient recall and exercise techniques.  The patient is also given written advice about any specific concerns related to protective posturing and the use of medication.
Further investigative and therapeutic referral and review is offered, while the nurse educator contacts the patient at 2 weeks and then again at 3 months. Physician review is available up to the 4 month period after which patients are referred back to their primary health providers.
Where indicated, the physician will coordinate referral to appropriate health care providers for medical imaging, psychological counseling or physiotherapy. Prompt and comprehensive written communication is sent to all involved health care providers, including the patients general practitioner, after each patient contact. The participants are followed up at 6 and 12 months by questionnaire.
3. Education
Educational resources have been developed to promote and increase awareness of the ACE study and its objectives during the course of the interventional research period. Aimed at 2 distinct groups, health care providers and patients who are involved in motor car accidents the resources are in many formats and include the following: hard copy material for patients includes posters, brochures, exercise and treatment sheets, a power point presentation and a 24 page booklet The fast road to recovery, while for health professionals there is the booklet Information and Resources for Health Care Professionals, brochures, posters and for both groups, an Accident Care Evaluation website.
In addition, education sessions are organised for health professionals ranging from emergency department nurses and doctors, general practitioners and their nurse practitioners and allied health such as physiotherapists and chiropractors. The Accident Care Evaluation Clinic physician generally conducted the sessions while the ACE Nurse Educator spoke to the nurse practitioners and supported the other sessions with the educational material. The general practitioners session were run over two separate six week periods, rotating 3 discreet lectures, while sessions ran three times over a twelve month period to catch rotating medical staff from both participating hospitals.
 
Media releases were published in local professional publications, and letters were sent to health care providers informing them of ACE and the education information sessions</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care is the care that was currently available to patients in the community who incur injury following a motor vehicle accident in the Australian Capital Territory. This care can be provided by  local hospital emergency departments, general practitioners, specialist doctors or allied health and is not influenced or provided by the Accident Care Evaluation Group
This study is a sequential cohort study where the control group was recruited before the intervention period began and occurred over a 10 month period. Participants recieved standard care for 12 months</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will evaluate an injury assessment and treatment referral service for those injured in motor vehicle crashes in the ACT. This service will consist of a musculoskeletal specialist, supported by an education program. The primary research hypothesis for the program is that the provision of multidisciplinary musculoskeletal referral service will lead to
improved health outcomes for injured people and reduce the duration of illness and associated costs. This will be established through a comparison with a control group of people injured before the service is established.</summary>
