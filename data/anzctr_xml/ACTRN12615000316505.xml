  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will examine factors that predict post-concussive syndrome in children aged 5-18.  We will assess children at presentation to the emergency department and again at 1-4 days, 2-weeks, 1- month, and 3-months post-injury. 

We will be observing post-concussive symptoms at each time point.  This can include a broad range of symptoms, such as: somatic (eg, headache, vomiting); cognitive (eg, feeling like in fog); emotional (eg, lability); Physical signs (eg, loss of consciousness, amnesia); Behavioural changes (eg, irritability); Cognitive impairment (eg, slowed reaction times); Sleep disturbance (eg, insomnia).  
 
  </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will be children aged 5-18 who have sustained a concussion and do NOT develop post-concussive syndrome.  The observational period for ALL participants will be 3-months post-injury. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence of post-concussive symptoms at 2-weeks post-injury.  This will be assessed by the Post Concussive Symptom Inventory (PCSI), a reliable and validated measure of post-concussive symptoms for both children and adults.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>2-weeks post-injury</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Longitudinal recovery trajectories for PCS and main symptoms.  Post-concussive symptoms will be assessed at each time point using the PCSI.  We will also track daily symptoms by providing patients/parents with a PCSI diary for them to fill out every day between time point 1 (1-4 days post injury) and time point 2 (2-weeks post-injury).  This can be extended if they continue to be symptomatic at time point 2.    </outcome>
      <timepoint> 1-4 days, 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-injury </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of post concussive brain dysfunction (composite outcome combining symptoms, neurocognitive tests and balance-coordination examination results).  This will be assessed using the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool, 3rd edition (SCAT3) and Cogsport, a computerized neurocognitive assessment tool specifically developed for concussion assessment.  </outcome>
      <timepoint>1-4 days, 2-weeks, 1-month and 3-months post-injury</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Presence of post traumatic symptoms, which will be measured using the Child Post-Traumatic Stress Scale (CPSS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1-4 days, 2-weeks, 1-month, and 3-months post-injury</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fatigue will be measured using the PedsQL Multidemensional Fatigue Scale. </outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will measure family burden.  To do this, we will collect data on number of school days missed (participants), sports activities missed (participants), school days missed (participants), work days missed (parents), additional carers required (parents).  </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The expected number of 200 patients for this study has been estimated based on data from the current ongoing Australasian Prospective Head Injury Study (APHIRST) at the Royal Children's Hospital Emergency Department (i.e., the possibility of patients recruitment during daytime (from 8 am to 10 pm) and the seasonal variation in sport-related concussions).  

Categorical variables will be described as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, according to their parametric or non-parametric distribution, respectively. Comparisons will be performed by means of Chi-square test for categorical variables. T-test will be used to compare continuous variables with parametric-distribution, while Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare those with non-parametric distribution.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The Predictors of Post Concussive Syndrome Protocol that we are developing concerns a study on the derivation and validation of a clinical prediction rule for PCS in children aged 5 to 18 years, who present to the ED for concussion.

In order to assist clinicians in identifying patients at high risk of PCS, who will benefit from a closer follow up and early referral to a dedicated concussion clinic, we set out to derive and validate a clinical prediction rule based on pre-injury and injury-related data to be used in the ED.
