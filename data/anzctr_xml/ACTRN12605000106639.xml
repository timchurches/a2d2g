    <interventions>Oxaliplatin is designated chemically as [SP-4-2]-(1R,2R)-(cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-k2N,NÃ¿Â¿Ã¿Â´ (oxalato(2-)-k2O1,O2]platinum (II)
given by intravenous infusion.

This is a single arm open label Phase II study of chemo-radiation of localised oesophageal cancer with Oxaliplatin, continuous infusion fluorouracil and radiation.

The duration of the study participation will include for each patient a 1 week inclusion and treatment planning period, followed by a 6 week treatment period, followed by a minimum of 1 week follow-up for chemotherapy related toxicities after the completion of the study treatment. In addition all patients will be followed for radiation toxicity and disease status for 2 years after the completion of the study treatment.

Treatment Regimen:
*5-fluorouracil via continuous intravenous infusion at the dose of 225mg/m2/day commencing on first day of radiation and continuing until delivery of last radiation fraction.
*Oxaliplatin given by 2-hour intravenous infusion at a dose of 60mg/m2 weekly commencing immediately prior to the commencement of 5-fluorouracil
Radiation-Standard  total 54 to 60 Gy, given daily apart from weekends and public holidays</interventions>
