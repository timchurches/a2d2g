Treatment: drugs - Low-Risk Therapy
Treatment: drugs - High-Risk Therapy
Treatment: drugs - Intermediate-Risk Therapy

Experimental: Low-Risk Patients - Patients with GTR/M0 medulloblastoma, nodular desmoplastic or high grade glioma histology will receive induction chemotherapy and low-risk therapy.
Note: Accrual to the low-risk medulloblastoma cohort is closed as of 12/2/2015. Accrual to the low-risk high grade glioma remains open.

Experimental: High-Risk Patients - Patients with CNS metastatic disease will receive induction chemotherapy and high-risk therapy.

Experimental: Intermediate-Risk Therapy - Patients with M0 medulloblastoma or nodular desmoplastic histology with less than a GTR, other histologic diagnoses with no metastatic disease, will receive induction chemotherapy and intermediate-risk therapy.


Treatment: drugs: Induction Chemotherapy
All patients will receive 4 identical cycles of induction chemotherapy including highdose (5 g/m2 or 2.5g/m2 for patients less than or equal to 31 days of age at enrollment) intravenous methotrexate and standard dose vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide.

Treatment: drugs: Low-Risk Therapy
Induction will be followed by further conventional chemotherapy with carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. After consolidation, patients will receive 6 cycles of oral maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and depending on the diagnosis, either erlotinib or etoposide (VP-16).

Treatment: drugs: High-Risk Therapy
High risk patients will also receive vinblastine with each course of induction chemotherapy. Induction will be followed by either chemotherapy with targeted intravenous topotecan and cyclophosphamide or optional craniospinal irradiation (CSI). CSI will be offered only to patients who reach 3 years of age by the end of induction only. After consolidation, all patients will receive 6 cycles of oral maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and depending on the diagnosis, either erlotinib or etoposide (VP-16).

Treatment: drugs: Intermediate-Risk Therapy
Induction will be followed by consolidation focal radiotherapy (RT) to the tumor bed. Patients less than 12 months old upon completion of induction will receive low risk chemotherapy to delay RT until the age of 12 months. After consolidation, patients will receive 6 cycles of oral maintenance chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and depending on the diagnosis, either erlotinib or etoposide (VP-16).
Note: The option to receive focal proton beam irradiation was suspended 10/29/2015. Focal photon beam irradiation continues as part of the treatment plan.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent of PET scans with loss of signal intensity - Measures will be analyzed for intermediate risk participants who receive proton beam therapy (PBT) and who consent. This objective aims to assess the feasibility of using post-proton beam therapy (PBT) positron emission tomography (PET) as an in-vivo dosimetric and distal edge verification system in this patient population. To this end we will estimate the percentage of PET scans where loss of signal intensity or resolution were observed.

The methotrexate clearance will be calculated using the log-linear trapezoidal method. population parameters and both the inter- and intra-subject variability.

      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic variables of intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide and its metabolites by age, gender, race, and weight - Population pharmacokinetic parameters for cyclophosphamide and metabolites will be estimated, including population parameters and inter-subject variability.

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of participants who successfully achieve target systemic exposure of intravenous topotecan - Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be performed on day 1 of IV topotecan (TPT). If the systemic exposure (AUC) of TPT lactone is not within the target range (140±20 ng/ml*hr) on day 1, the TPT dosage will be adjusted and another PK study will be performed. If PK studies are performed 3 times in 1 course and the AUC is not in target, a dosage adjustment without further PK studies will be made during that course. The final dosage from course 1 will be used for the initial day 1, course 2 dosage. The same PK studies will be performed during course 2 to achieve the target AUC.
For analysis of our target success rate, we'll consider AUC values from an empiric dosage (course 1 day 1) as a "dose success" or "dose failure" while AUC values from a PK-guided dosage adjustment will be defined as a "PK targeting success" or "PK targeting failure". The initial topotecan dosage of course 1 will not count towards this feasibility objective, since this dosage is predetermined.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pharmacokinetic variables of intravenous and oral topotecan by age, gender, race and weight - The population parameters and the inter-subject variability will be estimated. Once the population parameters and corresponding covariance matrix are estimated, individual estimates can be obtained using post hoc analysis. Using such a method, the influence of patient specific covariates such as age, BSA, concomitant drugs, pharmacogenetic factors, and sex on topotecan pharmacokinetic parameters will be tested to optimize dosing in very young children with brain tumors.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of participants with endocrinopathy - Serial GH testing (at baseline, the end of therapy, and at 6 and 24 months after completion of therapy) will be performed on consenting patients in order to estimate longitudinal change in GH secretion as measured by mean peak GH values, with the intent to explore associations with radiation dose to the hypothalamus.

    <summary>RATIONALE: In this study a combination of anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) is used to treat
      brain tumors in young children. Using chemotherapy gives the brain more time to develop
      before radiation is given. The chemotherapy in this study includes the drug methotrexate.
      This drug was an important part of the two clinical trials which resulted in the best
      survival results for children less than 3 years of age with medulloblastoma. Most patients
      treated on this trial will also receive radiation which is carefully targeted to the area of
      the tumor. This type of radiation (focal conformal or proton beam radiotherapy) may result in
      fewer problems with thinking and learning than radiation to the whole brain and spinal cord.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy together
      with radiation therapy works in treating young patients with newly diagnosed central nervous
      system tumors.</summary>
