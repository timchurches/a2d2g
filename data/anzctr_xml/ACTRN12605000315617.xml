  <interventions>
    <interventions>Approximately 200 consecutive preoperative severely obese patients presenting for obesity surgery will complete a series of self-report questionnaires: A Food Frequency Questionnaire, General eating patterns questionnaire, the Baecke Activity Questionnaire, The Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns, Night Eating Syndrome Questionnaire, Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, SF-36, MultiDimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory . Dietary intake data will be collected at baseline, 4 months and 12 months after surgery. Baseline and 12 month average daily energy and nutrient intake will be determined as well as the habitual types and amounts of physical activity and exercise at baseline and 12 months after surgery. Questionnaire responses will also be compared with data collected from ~200 normal weight community controls and~ 200 obese controls.</interventions>
