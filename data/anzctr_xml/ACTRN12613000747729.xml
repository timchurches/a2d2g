  <interventions>
    <interventions>The active treatment group will be allocated to two capsules of aged garlic extract (AGE, Kyolic, 480 mg, 1.2 mg SAC (2 capsules x 240 mg/0.6 SAC) daily for 3 months. The control group will be allocated to matching placebo capsules. 
AGE is highly tolerable, and was acceptable for 92% of patients in previous trials. Participants are advised to take AGE in the evening with food to minimise belching. 

Compliance will be assessed by return of trial capsules, as well as diary entries. Patients will be instructed to mark each day in provided calendars when they have taken the trial and prescription medications, and bring the calendar and the remaining trial medication to their next appointment. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical blood pressure (Systolic and diastolic, SBP/DBP):
A trained research assistant/nurse will use a validated digital sphygmomanometer with appropriate sized cuffs (Omron HEM-907, JA Davey Pty Ltd; calibrated against a mercury sphygmomanometer). The display of the sphygmomanometer is to be positioned away from the patient to assure blinding to the BP readings. BP measurement to be taken with patient in seated position with arm supported at heart level, after 5 min rest, after abstinence from food, nutritional supplements, caffeinated beverages, and smoking for a minimum of 2 hours prior to BP measurement at approximately the same time/day of the week. BP will be recorded as three serial measurements at intervals of 30 seconds. The mean of the three BP measurements will be used in the analysis.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared with baseline</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Haemodynamic parameters: 
Central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, arterial stiffness using the Mobilograph device
The Mobilograph is a brachial non-invasive device which takes a 10 second snapshot of the radial arterial pressure wave and derives the ascending aortic pressure wave, providing critical cardiovascular measurements including central blood pressure, aortic augmentation index, ejection duration and subendocardial viability ratio.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared with baseline</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cardiovascular biomarkers: 
Blood lipids, platelet function, homocysteine, inflammatory markers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks compared to baseline</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patients will be recruited through general practices, and search of electronic clinical records for hypertension.

Consenting and eligible participants will be enrolled at the study site and allocated randomly to either the active or the placebo group. Garlic and placebo capsules are matched in appearance and are packaged in identical containers labelled with the ID and trial name.
</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer-generated permuted block randomisation schedule will be used to allocate patients to garlic or placebo groups within each recruitment site. Randomisation will be done by a statistical consultant not involved in allocation of treatment to the participants.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample size of 100 patients was calculated based on the following assumptions:
 a) To detect a difference of 10 mmHg SBP (SD=10) or 6.5 mmHg DBP (SD=11) in BP change between the active treatment (n=50) and control groups (n=50) with a power of 80% and 95% confidence;  b) to account for 10% drop-out or non-attendance at all appointments; c) to adjust for clustering using a design effect of 1.2 based on the formula: Design effect = [1+ (size of cluster-1) x intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.02]. 
1630 patients from about 8 general practices will be invited, assuming a 15% response rate, 40% have diastolic hypertension under trial conditions, and each practice providing access to 160 patients. Proportions are estimated based our previous studies. </statisticalmethods>
