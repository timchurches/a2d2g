  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major surgeries not involving the heart are common, and major heart problems during or after
      such surgeries represent a large population health problem. Few treatments to prevent heart
      problems around the time of surgery have been tested. There is encouraging data suggesting
      that small doses of Acetyl-Salicylic Acid (ASA) and Clonidine, which are two medications,
      given individually for a short period before and after major surgeries may prevent major
      heart problems. The POISE-2 Trial is a large international study to test if ASA and Clonidine
      can prevent heart attacks and deaths from heart problems around the time of surgery.</summary>
