    <summary>The purpose of this study was to determine if Irbesartan compared to Placebo would reduce the
      risk of vascular events such as heart attack, stroke, non-cerebral thromboembolic event and
      death in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and with at least one major risk of vascular
      events.</summary>
