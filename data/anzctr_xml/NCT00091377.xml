  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Phenoxodiol may help
      cisplatin and paclitaxel kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the
      drugs.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of phenoxodiol when
      given together with either cisplatin or paclitaxel and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with recurrent late-stage ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or
      primary peritoneal cancer that has not responded to treatment with drugs such as paclitaxel,
      docetaxel, cisplatin, or carboplatin.</summary>
