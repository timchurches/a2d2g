    <statisticalmethods>Data of age, weight and height were analyzed as Mean+/-SD. Sex of patients and types of operations were presented as number and percentage. Blood pressures in both radial artery and dorsalis pedis artery were compared by Paired T test. Pearson and concordance correlation were used to analyze the relation between blood pressure in radial artery and blood 
pressure in dorsalis pedis artery. 
One way repeated measures anova with Bonferronis correction was used for serial blood pressure measurements. Multivariate anova with repeated measures and covariates was used for interactions by other risk factors.
Sample Size estimated as follow: Assuming a error = 0.05 (two-tailed) and Beta error = 0.1, a sample size of 32 patients was targeted but the actual sample size was 35 patients, allocated into one group, will have a power of 90% to detect an assumed clinically significant difference of 5% (effect size d = 0.6) or more between the blood pressure measurements at radial and dorsalis pedis arteries. t test for matched pairs was used to estimate the sample size. </statisticalmethods>
