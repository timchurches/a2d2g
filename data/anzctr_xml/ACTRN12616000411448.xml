  <interventions>
    <interventions>The initial meeting with the study dermatologist will use a scripted introduction to the placebo effect to establish an expectation that placebo administration will be effective. In summary the script describes the following information: The placebo effect is any type of treatment  in this case, a pill  that doesnt actually contain any drugs or active ingredients. The scientific evidence shows the placebo effect is powerful for conditions like pain and headaches, and previous research has demonstrated that open placebo administration (with participants knowing they were taking placebos) was beneficial for physical health outcomes. This may be because the body is conditioned to respond to taking medications, or because taking the pills increases expectations of an effect. As the brain and immune system are highly interconnected, placebos can affect immune functioning and therefore wound healing. Psychological factors have been shown to affect wound healing in previous research, so it is plausible that expecting benefits through taking placebos would enhance healing.

After this introduction and a final consent form for the wounding procedure, the dermatologist will make the punch biopsy wound. The procedure involves creating a 4 mm punch biopsy wound 7 cm superior to the medial epicondyle of the inner upper arm (the participant chooses which arm), delivered under local anaesthetic and covered with a hydrocolloid dressing and an additional opsite dressing. This wound will be cleaned and the dressing changed at 7 days post-wounding, and again at 10 days.

Treatment will consist of placebo tablets containing lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate as the only 3 ingredients, Participants will be aware that they are receiving inert placebo tablets without active ingredients. Dosage will be two tablets twice per day, starting on the evening of the wounding procedure and continuing daily until the morning of the 10th day after wounding, which is the day the final measures will be taken. Adherence will be measured with a self-report item on the final questionnaire administered at 10 days post-wounding.</interventions>

G*Power (version 3.1.9.2) was used to conduct a power analysis to determine the number of participants required. Given an expected effect size of d = 0.7 based on a meta-analysis of wound healing studies (Robinson et al., unpublished manuscript) and a = .05, 68 participants will be required to achieve a power of 80% (i.e. 1-beta = 0.8). </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: The aim of the study is to establish if wound healing is faster for participants
taking open-label placebo pills (i.e. known by the participant to be
pharmacologically inert) than participants taking no treatment for their wound
healing.
Hypothesis: Photographs of a 4 mm diameter punch biopsy wound in the inner arm
will show a greater area of re-epithelialisation at 7 days and 10 days after wounding
for participants using daily open placebo treatment than participants using no
treatment.

Summary of the project:
Placebo treatment can be effective for subjective complaints (Miller, Colloca, &amp;
Kaptchuk, 2009) and also results in physiological changes (Finniss et al., 2010),
suggesting that it may be an effective treatment option for some people. However, it
is currently unethical to prescribe placebo treatment, as this typically requires
deception of patients, undermining the principle of informed consent. This study
aims to establish whether open placebo treatment (i.e. placebo administration
without deception, where participants are aware that they are taking placebos) is
effective for wound healing, which would allow patients to benefit from harnessing
placebo effects with full informed consent.
Wound healing rates can be affected by psychosocial factors such as stress (Walburn
et al., 2009), and psychosocial interventions can improve wound healing rates
(Broadbent et al., 2012; Koschwanez et al., 2013). This means that a
psychologically-based treatment such as placebo may affect wound healing rates
through mechanisms such as expectation of improvement or conditioned
physiological effects from ingesting medication (Benedetti &amp; Amanzio, 2013).
Kaptchuk et al. (2010) demonstrated that open placebo treatment was effective for
improving symptoms and functioning for participants with Irritable Bowel Syndrome,
setting a precedent for the use of open placebo treatment to improve participant
outcomes. Given these results, it is worth investigating whether open placebo is
effective in improving wound healing rates in healthy participants.</summary>
