    <studytitle>Investigating the efficacy of two exercise protocols following fracture and open surgical fixation of the proximal phalangeal bone in the finger.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In adults with finger proximal phalangeal fractures, are constrained wrist-finger exercises more effective than unconstrained finger tendon gliding exercises in improving range of motion and grip strength following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group A will undertake a novel combination of synergistic wrist-finger exercises within the constraints of a removable splint after ORIF of proximal phalangeal fracture of the finger.
The frequency of these exercises will be 10 completions of the exercise sequence, repeated a minimum of 6 times throughout the waking day.
The duration of the exercise program is 6 weeks.
The mode of administration will be that exercises are taught one-on-one with a Hand Physiotherapist or Occupational Therapist initially, and then practiced on an individual basis unsupervised until the next review appointment, where the program will be checked and reiterated. This will be repeated weekly for 6 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>Group B will perform traditional unconstrained finger tendon gliding exercises after ORIF of proximal phalangeal fracture of the finger.
The frequency of these exercises will be 10 completions of the exercise sequence, repeated a minimum of 6 times throughout the waking day.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Upon return to the hand clinic at Sydney Hospital for their initial post- operative review following open reduction internal fixation of their finger proximal phalanx fracture, all potential participants will be approached by an independent member of the Hand Clinic team who will not be involved in their treatment or in the study. The project will be explained and the option to participate will be offered. Should they agree, signed consent will be collected at this stage and initial baseline measures will be undertaken prior to stratified randomisation. The researcher will not be involved in the recruitment process.  
The participant will be enrolled into the study after the informed consent process has been completed and the participant has met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.  The participant will receive a study enrolment number and this will be documented in the participantâ€™s medical record and on all study documents.</concealment>
    <sequence>The participant will be randomised (via stratified randomisation) at initial study visit after they have met the enrolment criteria. At this visit the participant will be randomised to study procedure A (Constrained wrist- finger exercises) or Study procedure B (Unconstrained tendon gliding exercises), and receive a Randomisation Number allocated by Hand Clinic. This number will be from a computer generated sequence. 
As standard randomisation alone has the potential to create imbalances on baseline characteristics of treatment groups (Altman et al, 2001), we are electing to use prerandomisation stratification to avert the risk of such imbalances. We intend to use blocking as our form of restriction. We will use this blocking to generate separate randomisation schedules for stratified subsets of participants defined by the severity of injury. Severity of injury is an important prognostic factor following proximal phalanx fracture, and is reflected in the type of fixation required to achieve adequate stability.
Potential participants will be stratified as either a level 1 or level 2 severity. Level 1 severity are those that required plate and screws via a dorsal extensor tendon splitting approach. This is usually because the fracture was significantly displaced or occured within a joint (i.e. more severe injury). Level 2 severity are those that require less bulky fixation via screws alone through a less invasive lateral approach or fixation of fractures not within a joint (i.e. less severe injury). This is usually possible because the fracture is not hugely displaced or lies within the shaft of the bone.

We hope stratified randomisation will be particularly helpful to avert severe imbalances on prognostive factors in this case due to our trial being small, and may improve statistical power and precision (Meinert, 1986).</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose is to investigate whether the type of hand exercises affect short-term outcomes, in particular range of motion of the finger, following surgery to stabilise fractures of the proximal phalanx in the finger. Following surgery, participants will be randomised to one of two groups, where the treatment variable will be type of exercise. All other treatment will be constant between the two groups.</summary>
