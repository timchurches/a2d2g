  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children have the settings controlling their insulin infusion pumps adjusted by a credentially diabetes educator using recommendations from PumpTune computer algorithm once and then are monitored with continuous glucose monitoring for a further six days. There was no washout period separating these six days from the comparison period.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>In this cross over trial the order the interventions were applied was randomised. An independant person used a randomisation table to allocate the order. Each set of pump adjustment instructions was placed into a sealed opaque envelope. The number 1 was written on the outside of the instructions to be used first and number 2 for those to be used second. The diabetes educator who entered the adjustments into the pumps was blinded as to the origin of the instructions. </concealment>
    <sequence>A randmisation table based on permuted blocks was generated by a statistician using software package Stata v 13.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Information from continuous glucose sensors is complicated. Insulin pumps can be set in many ways and the settings are complicated and may vary depending of the person making the changes. This study compares the results after insulin pumps are adjusted by a doctor or by a computer program.</summary>
