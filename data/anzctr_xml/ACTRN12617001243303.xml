  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated to either 1) SMS adherence intervention or 2) no adherence support control. 

Participants in both groups will be expected to continue their home exercise program prescribed to them in a previous study, the TARGET study (Trial Id: ACTRN12617001013358). Participants will complete their prescribed home exercise program 3 times/week for 24 weeks. Each home exercise session will take approximately 20 minutes. 

In addition participants in the SMS intervention will receive text messages over the 24 week period aiming to facilitate adherence to the home exercise program. Message content has been developed drawing on behaviour change theory and will address common barriers and facilitators to exercise participation previously identified in the knee OA literature. The messaging system will be automated, personalized using first names and be semi-interactive. 

Participants will receive approximately 4-5 messages per week initially, dependent on their level of home exercise participation. At the start of the program all participants will receive 2 facilitator to exercise messages per week and a text message asking home many times they completed their home exercise program in the previous week. Participants who complete their home exercise program less than 3 times in the previous week will receive additional messages to identify and address the possible barriers to their exercise participation. Message frequency will gradually reduce over the 24 weeks, so as to not become burdensome to participants. 

Participants in both groups will receive an optional exercise log book to record their weekly exercise practice over the 24 week period.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control intervention will be expected to complete a home exercise program for their knee osteoarthritis 3 times per week for 24 weeks with no SMS support during that period. 

Participants in the control intervention will also receive an optional exercise log book to use during the 24 week period. </comparator>

    <sequence>This study will utilise participants completing another clinical trial, the TARGET study (ACTRN 12617001013358).

Computer generated randomisation will be prepared by our study biostatistician and will be conducted by permuted blocks of varying sizes, stratified by; 
- exercise group assigned in the TARGET RCT (1. weight bearing functional exercise or 2.non-weight bearing quadriceps strengthening) and; 
-	baseline home exercise adherence  in the previous week  (Scale 0-4 where 0-1 = lower adherence; 2-4=higher adherence.) (Note: baseline home exercise adherence refers to home exercise adherence in the previous week, taken from the final time point of the TARGET RCT).

The randomisation schedule will be computer generated, using random permuted blocks of varying sizes. To conceal allocation, the randomisation schedule will be accessed via a password-protected, computer program by a researcher not involved in participant recruitment or assessment.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size Calculation: Participants who complete the TARGET RCT will automatically and immediately be enrolled in the ADHERE RCT and randomised into one of two groups. Conservatively supposing that 102 participants (80% of the 128 TARGET enrolees) will be randomised into ADHERE, and that of those 102 participants, 80% will remain in ADHERE until week 24, this leaves 40 participants per group. With 40 participants per group, we will have 83% power to detect an effect size of 0.6 with two-sided significance level of 0.05, assuming a correlation between baseline home exercise adherence and home exercise adherence at 24 weeks of 0.4, including baseline home exercise adherence in the regression model as a covariate.

Statistical Analysis Plan: Analyses comparing the two groups will be performed by the statistician in a blinded fashion using all available data from all randomised participants. Demographic and baseline characteristics of participants at the time of randomisation in ADHERE will be summarised as appropriate (means and standard deviations for continuous variables that appear to be approximately normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges for other continuous variables, counts and percentages for categorical variables) and will be inspected to assess baseline comparability of treatment groups. For continuous outcomes, differences in change will be compared between groups
using linear regression models adjusted for baseline levels of these outcomes and TARGET exercise group. Models for non-adherence outcomes will also contain a term for baseline home exercise adherence (a stratifying variable). Model assumptions will be assessed using standard diagnostic plots. For binary outcomes, differences between groups will be compared using relative risks, calculated from logistic regression models including terms for TARGET exercise group and baseline home exercise adherence. Should the amount of missing data for an outcome be such that imputation is required, multiple imputation will be conducted and the method reported.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a major public health problem. Exercise is recommended by all clinical guidelines for managing pain in knee OA, however, effects of exercise on pain and function outcomes are only modest. This may be due to poor exercise adherence amongst knee OA sufferers.  There is evidence that the use of text messaging as a behaviour change adherence tool can be effective in the healthcare setting for a variety of conditions.  To date the use of SMS messages as an adherence tool for exercise has not been assessed in the knee OA population.
Our primary aim will therefore be to investigate the effects of adding a behaviour change embedded text message intervention, to a 6 month home based exercise program for knee osteoarthritis.
Participants who complete a previous RCT (ACTRN 12617001013358) will be randomly allocated to one of two groups:
i) SMS adherence intervention  - a home based exercise program completed three times weekly for 24 weeks PLUS an automated, semi-personalised, mobile phone text message intervention, embedded in behaviour change theory to promote adherence to the exercise program. 
ii) No adherence support control - a home based exercise program completed three times weekly for 24 weeks, independently with no adherence support.  
Primary outcomes are self-reported adherence measures and secondary outcomes include self-reported pain and function. The primary timepoint is 24 weeks.
