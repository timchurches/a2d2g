  <interventions>
    <interventions>Melatonin prolonged release 2mg oral tablet nightly commenced within 48 hours after hospital admission and continued until delirium occurrence, discharge, or for a maximum of 3 weeks after any acute medical issues imparting a delirium risk have been resolved.

The intervention will be delivered at 20:00 hours. At each dose, the individually labelled bottle will be opened and the prescribed dose taken out.

    <statisticalmethods>Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for all statistical comparisons. For the primary outcome, comparisons between groups for delirium-free days, with adjustment to the length of stay and other potential covariates using a general linear model approach will be undertaken. For potential missing data, multiple imputation technique will be applied to handle the missing data. A proper multiple imputation method will be employed that based on various models of assumption including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). Sensitivity analysis will apply to examine the effects of these different assumptions on the imputed data structure in order to ascertain the most reliable approach.    

For the secondary outcomes, time-to-event analysis will be used to determine differences in time to first episode of delirium. Delirium precipitants, which occur at variable times and for different durations during the study period are time-dependent covariates and Cox proportional hazard modelling will be used. 
The incidence rate of delirium will also be calculated and compared between the treatment and control groups. For possible toxicity of the medication, incidence of adverse event will be calculated and reported.

Sample size was calculated based on the information obtained in the pilot study on the primary outcome, namely delirium-free days during a 3 week study period, and an analytical approach of comparing the mean delirium-free days between groups. It has been estimated that a sample size of 110 in each arm (n=220 in total) would provide 90% power to reject the null hypothesis with a 5% type I error rate to detect an increase of 2 delirium-free days allowing for 30% drop out or loss to follow-up and 5% for possible adjustments for covariates.  

Two planned interim analyses will be conducted independently and reviewed by the independent data and safety monitoring committee after about 33% and 66% of patients have been enrolled. The primary outcome and adverse events will be compared between groups with p&lt;0.001 required as the threshold of stopping the trial for significant evidence of benefit or harm in either one of the treatment arms.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of melatonin in preventing delirium in hospital inpatients with advanced cancer.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enrol in this trial if you are aged 18 or over and have been diagnosed with advanced cancer for which the intention of treatment is not to cure, and have been admitted to an acute or sub-acute inpatient hospital facility within the previous 48 hours.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive either melatonin tablets or placebo (sham) tablets, once per day at night time until delirium occurrence, discharge from the hospital facility, or for a maximum of 3 weeks after any acute medical issues with a delirium risk have been resolved. All participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires once per day for the duration of their melatonin/placebo treatment to evaluate levels of delirium and effects on sleep, and researchers will also review medical records to evaluate healthcare resource use.

It is hoped that the findings from this trial will provide information on the efficacy of melatonin as a preventative treatment for delirium in advanced cancer inpatients. </summary>
