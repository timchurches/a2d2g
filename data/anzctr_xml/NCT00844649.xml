  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall Survival (OS) - Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from all causes. Participants who did not die were censored at the last known time the participant was alive. Patient survival was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>From randomization to death; until the data cut off 17 Sept 2012. The maximum time in follow up was 37 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) by Independent Radiological Review (IRR) - Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression, or death (any cause) on or prior to the clinical cutoff date, whichever occurred earlier. Participants who did not have disease progression or had not died were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment, on or prior to the clinical cutoff, and the patient was progression free. If a patient began a new anti-cancer treatment prior to documented disease progression (or death), the patient was censored at the date of last assessment when the patient was documented as progression free prior to the intervention. Patients with two or more consecutive missing response assessments prior to a visit with documented progression (or death) were censored at the last date of tumor assessment when the patient was documented to be progression free. PFS was summarized using Kaplan-Meier methods.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Randomization until disease progression or death from any cause; Until the data cut off of 17 Sept 2012. The maximum time in follow up was 37 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved an Objective Confirmed Overall Response by Independent Radiological Review (IRR) - Objective tumor response was summarized as the percentage of participants who achieved a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) based on an independent blinded radiology assessment of response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines. Using RECIST Version 1.0, participants were to achieve either a complete response (CR) defined as the disappearance of all known disease and no new sites or disease related symptoms confirmed at least 4 weeks after initial documentation or partial response (PR) defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions and no progression in non-target lesions based on confirmed responses from the investigator assessment of best overall response during study treatment.</outcome>

    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion Criteria

        A participant will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria are met:

          1. Participant has definitive histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic
             adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The definitive diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma will be made by integrating the histopathological data within the
             context of the clinical and radiographic data. Participants with islet cell neoplasms
             are excluded.

          2. Initial diagnosis of metastatic disease must have occurred =6 weeks prior to
             randomization in the study.

          3. Patient has one or more metastatic tumors measurable by Computed Tomography (CT) scan
             or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if patient is allergic to CT contrast media).

          4. Male or non-pregnant and non-lactating female, and = 18 years of age. If a female
             patient is of child-bearing potential, as evidenced by regular menstrual periods, she
             must have a negative serum pregnancy test Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (ß-hCG)
             documented 72 hours prior to the first administration of study drug.

             If sexually active, the patient must agree to use contraception considered adequate
             and appropriate by the Investigator during the period of administration of study drug.
             In addition, male and female patients must utilize contraception after the end of
             treatment as recommended in the product's Summary of Product Characteristics or
             Prescribing Information provided in the study manual.

          5. Patients must have received no previous radiotherapy, surgery, chemotherapy or
             investigational therapy for the treatment of metastatic disease. Prior treatment with
             5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine administered as a radiation sensitizer in the
             adjuvant setting is allowed, provided at least 6 months have elapsed since completion
             of the last dose and no lingering toxicities are present. Patients having received
             cytotoxic doses of gemcitabine or any other chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting are

          6. Patient has adequate biological parameters as demonstrated by the following blood
             counts at Baseline (obtained =14 days prior to randomization):

             Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) = 1.5 × 10^9/L; Platelet count = 100,000/mm^3 (100 ×
             10^9/L); Hemoglobin (Hgb) = 9 g/dL.

          7. Patient has the following blood chemistry levels at Baseline (obtained =14 days prior
             to randomization):

             Aspartate Transaminase (AST), Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Alanine
             Transaminase ( ALT) Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) = 2.5 × upper limit of
             normal range (ULN), unless liver metastases are clearly present, then = 5 × ULN is
             allowed Total bilirubin = ULN Serum creatinine within normal limits or calculated
             clearance = 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with serum creatinine levels above or
             below the institutional normal value. If using creatinine clearance, actual body
             weight should be used for calculating creatinine clearance (e.g., using the
             Cockroft-Gault formula). For patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m^2, lean
             body weight should be used instead.

          8. Patient has acceptable coagulation studies (obtained =14 days prior to randomization)
             as demonstrated by prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within

             =14 days prior to randomization).

         10. Patient has a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) = 70. Two observers will be required

             symptomatic amounts of ascites should be drained prior to Day 1. Pain symptoms should
