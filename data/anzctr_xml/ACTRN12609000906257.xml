  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with clinical symptoms indicative of influenza, who present within 72 h of the onset of fever during confirmed influenza activity in the community and have a positive rapid antigen test for influenza; will be randomized to receive immediate treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir
according to standard age appropriate dose. Standard Oseltamivir and Zanamivir treatment in influenza is given as twice daily doses for 5 days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of this study is to assess the frequency of emergence of oseltamivir and zanamivir resistant
influenza viruses, and their virological characteristics, in patients treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir for influenza
caused by A/H1N1 2009 (swine flu) and other human influenza viruses during periods of high transmission. Limited
clinical information will also be collected.
Patients with clinical symptoms indicative of influenza, who present within 72 h of the onset of fever during confirmed
influenza activity in the community, will be randomized to receive immediate treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir
according to standard age appropriate dose. Patients will have baseline virus samples taken for typing and oseltamivir
and zanamivir sensitivity and also on completion of treatment (After 5 days of treatment). Limited clinical information
will also be collected.</summary>
