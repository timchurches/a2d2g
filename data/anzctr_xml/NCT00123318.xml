  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the side-effects and effectiveness of a new type of
      chemoradiotherapy treatment for patients who have had surgery for stomach cancer. The
      treatment uses epirubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (ECF) chemotherapy together with
      radiotherapy.</summary>
