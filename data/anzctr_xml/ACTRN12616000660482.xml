  <interventions>
    <interventions>The authors will be responsible for administering the drug: levocarnitine (LC) or placebo. Patients will be selected and then randomized in the hemodialysis unit of the University Hospital of the Autonomous University of Nuevo Leon in Monterrey, Mexico.

The following clinical intervention will take place: randomized patients will be included in the study, They will be divided into 4 groups:

Group LC0 (gLC0) - LC will be administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/session (2 sessions/week) for a period of 12 weeks. LC will be administered at 0 minutes before the start of the hemodialysis session.

Group LC30 (gLC30) - LC will be administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/session (2 sessions/week) for a period of 12 weeks. LC will be administered at 30 minutes before the start of the hemodialysis session.

Group P0 (gP0) - Placebo (normal saline, 5 ml/session, 2 sessions/week) will be administered for a period of 12 weeks. Placebo will be administered at 0 minutes before the start of the hemodialysis session.

Group P30 (gP30) - Placebo (normal saline, 5 ml/session, 2 sessions/week) will be administered for a period of 12 weeks. Placebo will be administered at at 30 minutes before the start of the hemodialysis session.

The drug administration will be made as follows: 

Patients assigned to the gLC0 will received LC (30 mg/kg/session ) as an slow intravenous bolus (2-3 minutes) through the venous catheter line, 0 minutes before each session of hemodialysis for 12 weeks. 

Patients assigned to gLC30 will received LC (30 mg/kg/session ) as an slow intravenous bolus (2-3 minutes) through the venous catheter line, 30 minutes before each session of hemodialysis for 12 weeks.  

The product that will be used is levocarnitine (Efe-Carn, PISA, Mexico), injectable vial whose content is 1 g/5 mL..</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients assigned to the gP0 will received normal saline (5 ml/session, 2 sessions/week) as an slow intravenous bolus (2-3 minutes) through the venous catheter line, 0 minutes before each session of hemodialysis for 12 weeks. 

Patients assigned to the gP30 will received normal saline (5 ml/session, 2 sessions/week) as an slow intravenous bolus (2-3 minutes) through the venous catheter line, 30 minutes before each session of hemodialysis for 12 weeks. 

We will use normal saline (PISA, Mexico) as placebo, this product is an injectable vial whose content is 0.9 g / 100 mL.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory study. Previous studies have shown no difference between groups using levocarnitine, therefore can not be used to calculate sample size. The calculation will be based on convenience sample considering previous studies and the size of our population in Hemodialysis.
Distribution will be assessed with the Shapiro-Wilks test.
The difference between continuous variables will be evaluated with one-way ANOVA test.
The difference between nominal variables will be evaluated with the Chi-square test.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intradialytic hypotension (IH) is common complication in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) on hemodialysis. Its incidence ranges from 15 to 30%. Levocarnitine (LC) has been used as a part of treatment in these kind of patients. LC is a quaternary amine involved in intermediary energetic metabolism, and is also essential in transferring long chain fatty acids through mitochondrial membranes. Those with CKD have relative deficiency of LC. A single-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled quadruple-blinded trial was designed to demonstrate the efficiency of LC in the prevention of IH in patients with CKD5. The subjects will be chosen by convenience sampling. They will be further divided into 4 groups (group 1 [gLC0]: LC [30 mg/kg] at 0 min before starting hemodialysis session; group 2 [gLC30]: LC [30 mg/kg] at 30 min before starting the hemodialysis session; group 3[gP0]: normal saline [5 mL/kg] at 0 min before starting hemodialysis session; group 4 [gP30]: normal saline [5 mL/kg] at 30 min before starting hemodialysis session). The intervention will last 12 weeks.</summary>
