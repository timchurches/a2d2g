  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be receiving standard dose enzalutamide (160mg daily) as determined by treating physician until disease progression or intolerance

If the patient experiences a greater than or equal to Grade 3 toxicity (as per CTCAE guidelines) withhold enzalutamide for one week or until symptoms improve to at least Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg) at the discretion of the investigator

Fatigue and cognition are assessed once every 4-8 weeks for the duration of treatment depending on stability of dosage

Dose reduction will be undertaken in 40mg increments, depending on level of cognition and fatigue impairment at the discretion of the investigator or ceased altogether

Intervention adherence will not be formally assessed in this study

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size: 47 patients
Justification: The primary endpoint is an improvement in the fatigue and cognition symptoms. Improvement will be defined as the patient answering Better in the cognition/ fatigue question at the lowest dose of enzalutamide.
For the dose reduction manoeuvre to be clinically useful, we expect the rate of improvement to be 80% or better. As improvement of 60% or less would be considered clinically marginal, a sample size of 43 patients will have 80% power with 95% confidence to exclude a 60% improvement rate in favour of a more meaningful 80% improvement (Simon design). If a patient drops out due to fatigue or cognition side effects they will be recorded as a failure to the dose reduction manoeuvre. If the patient drops out for any other reason (eg progression of cancer) then they will be regarded as not evaluable. Assuming a 10% drop out rate due to disease progression or other non-fatigue/ cognition score gives a total study number of 47 patients
The patient-reported symptoms will also be validated compared with the validated questionnaires (Brief Fatigue Inventory; Trail making tests A and B; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test  Revised; Controlled Oral Word Association Test).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to determine effect of enzalutamide dose reduction on fatigue, cognition, and drug trough levels in patients with prostate cancer

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or above, have prostate cancer who have commenced enzalutamide within 3 months.

Study details
All patients will be receiving standard dose enzalutamide (160mg daily). If patients experiences a Grade 3 toxicity or an intolerable side effect, enzalutamide will be withheld for one week or until symptoms improve to at least Grade 2, then resume at the same or a reduced dose (120 mg or 80 mg). Dose reduction will be undertaken in 40mg increments, depending on level of cognition and fatigue impairment. Total duration of the intervention period is at the discretion of the investigator. Fatigue and cognition levels will be assessed weekly and blood samples will be collected every four weeks.

We hope  that this study will improve the individualisation of the enzalutamide treatment by tailoring the doses to each person's needs</summary>
