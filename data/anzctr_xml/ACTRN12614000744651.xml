  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is common in critically ill patients. With the exception of traumatic brain injury, FBT with human albumin solution appears safe and perhaps superior in severe sepsis/septic shock patients. However, 4% and 20% albumin solutions have different chloride contents and deliver different volumes.

Objective: To compare the physiological and biochemical effects of FBT with 4% vs. 20% human albumin solution.

Design: Retrospective observational study

Setting: Tertiary intensive care unit

Subjects: Critically ill patients receiving FBT with either 4% or 20% human albumin solution according to clinician preference

Measurements and Main Results: We recorded demographic and clinical data for 202 patients (101 patients in each group). We obtained biochemical and hemodynamic data at baseline and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after the administration of either 4% or 20% human albumin solution. We compared the effect of FBT with the two solutions. Patients receiving 20% albumin had a higher incidence of pre-existing liver disease (P=0.003), were more likely to be on renal replacement therapy (P=0.005) and had higher APACHE III scores and predicted risk of death on admission (P=0.007 and &lt;0.0001 respectively).  Patients in the 4% group received a median volume of 500mls of albumin compared to 100mls in the 20% group (P&lt;0.0001).  There was a trend in higher mean arterial pressure values in the 20% group at 2 and 4 hours following the fluid bolus (P=0.056).  There were no significant differences in absolute or percentage change of any haemodynamic parameters over the four hours following fluid bolus. Patients receiving 4% albumin demonstrated higher serum chloride levels and more negative bass excess (P =0.027 and 0.017, respectively).  The difference in base excess was greater following post-hoc adjustment for risk of death (P=0.003/ 0.004) .  

Conclusions: FBT with 100 ml of 20% human albumin solution is hemodynamically equivalent to FBT with 500 ml of 4% human albumin solution but has a lesser effect on chloride levels and delivers 80% less fluid.
