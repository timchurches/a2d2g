    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The blood samples will be used as a source of DNA and a plasma sample from each individual will be stored indefinitely to allow subsequent measurement of relevant circulating and tissue factors (eg. lipid profiles and cardiovascular hormones including natriuretic peptide hormones, angiotensin II, renin and their receptors etc).</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart disease results from the interaction of the genes we inherit and lifestyle factors, such as diet and smoking. To understand the role that genes play in the development of heart disease within the local population, the objective of the project is to collect blood samples from 1500 normal healthy individuals aged from 30 to 82 selected from the Canterbury region, as a control group for our studies of heart disease.  The age and gender profiles of the control group will be matched to those of patients who have had a heart attack or heart failure . The blood samples will be used as a source of DNA (genetic material) to allow determination of individual genetic profiles and associated levels of hormones and lipids in the circulation.  The frequencies of gene variants thought to be involved in heart disease in the heart-disease patient groups will be compared with the control group to detect those genes which might contribute to an increased risk of to heart disease within the Canterbury population</summary>
