  <interventions>
    <interventions>The subjects were instrumented with cardiofrequencimeter (Polar RS800CX). For implementation of transcutaneous electric diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS), silicon electrodes were positioned in height from sixth to eighth intercostal spaces, using the apparatus Neurodyn Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation/ Functional electrical stimulation (TENS / FES) - 02 output channels  Ibramed. The parameters used for TEDS were: current frequency of 30 Hz, pulse duration of 25 microseconds, Ton= 2, Toff = 3, with the minimum intensity to promote a palpable contraction of the diaphragm. Recordings were taken 07 minutes before, 12 minutes during and 05 minutes after the TEDS.</interventions>
    <comparator>The subjects were their own controls. Recordings of heart rate variability were taken before, during and after TEDS.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The transcutaneous electric diaphragmatic stimulation (TEDS) is a technique of muscle training which results in changes in breathing pattern and rhythm. The technique consists of applying an electrical stimulation through electrodes positioned between the sixth and eighth ribs. Knowing the respiratory influence in heart rate, this article aimed at evaluating if the TEDS changes the cardiac autonomic balance. Healthy volunteers, of both genders and same age group, were studied, kept lying down and at rest. It was advised that they should perform a respiratory frequency of 12 bpm during all the experiment. The RR intervals were obtained by Polar RS800CX monitor, fixed on the wrist and strap catchment positioned in the chest, for the analysis of the heart rate variability by the frequency domain before, during and after the implementation of eletric stimulation (TEDS). Whit this study we could conclude that TEDS modifies the cardiac autonomic balance in favor of parasympathetic system, probably due to the increase the depth of breathing caused by greater diaphragmatic excursion.</summary>
