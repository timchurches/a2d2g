  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nexagon is a novel compound that promotes wound healing by temporarily disrupting cellular
      communication at the wound site, thereby promoting accelerated healing, reducing inflammation
      and pain. This randomized double-blind study will assess the safety, tolerability and
      clinical effect of Nexagon when applied to skin wounds created by punch biopsy in healthy
      volunteers. 43 healthy, fair-skinned males and females between ages 18-40 will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be reviewed again at 3 months and 9 months for follow-up safety assessments and
      wound appearance evaluation.</summary>
