  <interventions>
    <interventions>The two intervention arms in this study are:

Arm 1. App group will use the Smiling Mind Workplace App for self-guided progression.

Arm 2. App+ group will use the Smiling Mind Workplace App, and attend four 1-hour seminars.

The Smiling Mind Workplace App (the App) is a complete online learning tool for mindfulness training. The Apps modules (Everyday Mindfulness, Calm, Clarity, Connection and Mindful Mastery) each include instructional videos, meditations (e.g. 7 and 15-minute sitting and body scan practices) and brief practices and activities to help bring moments of informal mindfulness into the everyday (e.g. 1 and 3-minute practices for moving with awareness between meetings, breathing techniques, and listening). In total, there are 41 different App elements. While the App provides user guidance, the amount of time spent each day engaging with App elements is at the discretion of participants. The App is supported by fortnightly email communications for the first 10 weeks, which include suggestions for how to use App elements, e.g. Find a time that works for you each day, maybe its first thing in the morning, or before you go to sleep. Create a routine; and Listen to 'Brain Break: the breath' when you need a brief moment during your day to stop and reset. The App can be used as a stand alone training program or can be offered in conjunction with face to face seminars, which are run in the initial 10 week period. Licences to the full App content last for 12-months.

The four seminars (attended by the App+ group) will be held at multiple locations at three different times in weeks 1, 2, 4 and 6, and be delivered by an experienced organisational consultant and mindfulness teacher. Attendance will be in-person or via video-conference. Each seminar has a key message: choosing to respond mindfully to stressors; remaining calm in the face of demands; managing attention wisely; and cultivating good relationships with the self and others.

Attendance at the seminars will be collected by self-report, and venue count data. User data from the Smiling Mind Servers will enable objective assessment of adherence to the App program. Participant ratings of the usefulness of the seminars and different elements of the App will also be collected. </interventions>
    <comparator>The two interventions (App and App+) will be compared with each other and a wait-list control (WLC) group from Baseline (T0) to 3-months from baseline (T1). Following T1, the App and App+ groups will be compared with each other at 6-months (T2) and 12-months (T3) from Baseline. The WLC group will commence training with a single 2-hour seminar, followed by self=guided progression with the App.</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>

      <timepoint>The primary time point for this study is post-intervention assessment (T1), 3 months from baseline.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Health-related lost productive time. This outcome is assessed using participant self reports of absenteeism and presenteeism days over the preceding 4-weeks. The number of inefficient days is calculated from the reported number of presenteeism days and self-rated productivity on those days (e.g. six presenteeism days at 60% productivity: [(10060%) Ã— 6 days] = 2.4 inefficient days. Total lost productive time is the sum of absenteeism days and inefficient days.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Health-related lost productive time will be collected for the 4-weeks prior to Baseline (T0), then 3 months  (T1),  6 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) from baseline. </timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Power calculations determined sample size, based on achieving a Cohen's d effect size of 0.48  for the primary outcome for the App group and an additional effect of 0.48 for the App+ group. Analyses will be conducted using R software, in line with intention to treat principles, with significance testing set with alpha=0.05. 

Intention to treat principles will be followed, using an original assigned group approach. All analyses will be done in R software with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. 

Group characteristics pre-intervention will be examined using Chi-squared and t-tests, and descriptive statistics will report recruitment, class attendance and program adherence. Free text reports, where provided, will be coded, categorised and emergent themes defined, and the number of responses per theme will be reported.

Differences between groups in PSS scores over time will be assessed using linear mixed models, fitted by maximum likelihood methods. Standardized mean difference (Cohens d) effect estimates will be reported. Secondary outcomes will be assessed in the same manner, and productive time, resource and AQoL data will be used to undertake an economic evaluation. Correlations between participant and informant reports will be examined.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to see if app-based mindfulness training can reduce stress and related problems for public sector employees.

This three-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial will assess the relative effectiveness of self-guided use of the Smiling Mind Workplace App (App group) and the use of the App supported by four seminars (App+ group) on the primary outcome of perceived stress from pre- to post-intervention, compared with a wait list control (WLC group). The relative efficacy of  the App and App+ interventions will then be assessed at six and 12-month follow up.

Secondary outcomes include changes in mindfulness, mental health, psychosocial job quality, workplace safety and conflict incidents, productivity changes and health-related quality of life outcomes. Changes on these measures from pre- to post-intervention and then at 12-month follow-up will be investigated by group. Informant reports of observed mindfulness and citizenship behaviours will also be collected and the relationship between observer and self-reports of change will be explored. Participant reports of the perceived usefulness of program elements will be collected to inform acceptability and feasibility. User-data from the Smiling Mind servers will be used to assess adherence and to investigate effects by level(s) of engagement with the program.

This study addresses the current lack of strong evidence for app-based mindfulness training for working adults. It will examine the Smiling Mind Workplace App for its efficacy for reducing stress and related mental health problems, and explore its influence on psychosocial, safety and conflict related stressors in the workplace.  The study will contribute evidence regarding the importance of including teacher-led classes/seminars to support app-based learning, in terms of efficacy and economic returns. It draws on multiple sources of data to cross-validate self-report changes, enable objective assessment of program adherence, and determine if app-based mindfulness training leads to noticeable changes in behaviour at work.
