    <interventions>Study 1: Beverages 
Study 1 will compare the effects of 480ml drinks containing 
-1.8 g Lemon balm + Natural sweetener 
-1 g Lemon balm + Natural sweetener 
-1.8 g Lemon balm + artificial sweetener
-a placebo that containing artificial sweetener

Study 2. Dairy products
Study 2 will compare the effects of 250g dairy products (yoghurt drink) containing 
- 1.8 g Lemon balm + Natural sweetener
- 1 g Lemon balm + Natural sweetener
- 1.8 g Lemon balm + artificial sweetener
- a placebo containing an artificial sweetener

Study 3. Bars
Study 3 will compare the effects of 35g fruit bars containing 
- 1.8 g Lemon balm + Natural sweetener 
- 1.8g Lemon balm + artificial sweetener
- Natural sweetener
- Artificial sweetener

For each study, participants consumed each treatment once only. There was a minimum 7 day washout period between each treatment within each study.

Participants were recruited for 1 study at a time. Therefore, it is possible that the same participants may respond to the advertisement of more than 1 study.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants responded to advertisements in local papers and community bulletin boards. After successfully completing a telephone screen, they completed a practice session where they were introduced to the computerised test, passed a brief medical test and informed consent was obtained. They were then given a numerical identification number and was randomly allocated to a treatment series. Participants then returned for 4 testing sessions, receiving a different treatment each visit. The person who determined if a participant was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the participant would be allocated. Allocation was concealed by central randomisation by computer</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of the current study is to conduct three studies to assess the effects of single doses of Melissa officinalis (Lemon balm), delivered in different  food and drink products, on cognitive function, mood and cortisol. The products will vary across the three studies and will include Beverages (Study 1), Dairy products (Study 2), and food Bars (Study 3). This will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study design involving a cohort of 20 healthy young adult volunteers in each study.  
On each study day participants will undergo a baseline (pre-treatment) assessment of cognitive performance, mood and cortisol reactivity. They will undergo similar assessment 1 hour and 3 hours after treatment administration. The procedure will be repeated at weekly intervals until all doses are complete.   

Each  study will allow comprehensive conclusions regarding dose-dependent effects of Lemon balm (delivered in different foods) on: 
- Mood including: Alertness, Calmness, Contentment
- Cognitive function including: Attention, Working memory, Secondary memory, and Executive function.
- Physiological index of stress: Salivary cortisol</summary>
