    <studytitle>A double-blinded, randomised control trial to compare intraoperative morphine and methadone on the post-operative pain scores and analgesic requirements after shoulder arthroscopic surgery</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients undergoing elective arthroscopic shoulder surgery, is a single intraoperative dose of intravenous morphine more effective than a single intraoperative dose of intravenous methadone in reducing post-operative analgesic patient-controlled-analgesia (PCA) requirements and visual analogue pain score (VAS)? A double-blinded, randomised control trial.</scientifictitle>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference between total fentanyl PCA (patient-controlled analgesia) requirements. This is the total fentanyl requirements of participant after transfer from recovery and placed on PCA. This will be measured in micrograms.

</outcome>
      <timepoint>Discharge home (day 1 post-operatively)
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference between visual analogue scale scores post-operatively in recovery and 12 hours post-operatively (measuring post-operative pain)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>In recovery and at 12 hours post-op</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference in post-operative opiate related adverse events. This will be measured using a checklist by nursing staff who will tick whether or not the participants suffered from any of the following adverse effects:
-Post-operative nausea and vomiting				
-Pruritis								
-Drowsiness							
-Respiratory depression
Nursing staff will also detail in the questionnaire whether the participants required treatment for any of these (including anti-emetics, anti-histamines, opioid antagonists etc)
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up until 1 day post-op (discharge)</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Difference between recovery fentanyl usage. Participants will be prescribed a total 100 micrograms of fentanyl (4x 25micrograms) on a as required basis (PRN). Total recovery fentanyl required in recovery before transfer to ward and placed on PCA will be recorded).</outcome>
      <timepoint>In recovery and before transfer to ward (immediately post-operatively- hours)</timepoint>

    <concealment>Consecutive patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy at Nepean Private Hospital by Dr Warren Kuo will be invited to participate in the study. They will receive a letter of invitation and patient information and consent form. If they are interested in participating in the study, the procedure and requirements will be explained to them and the consent form will be signed. Participant will be assigned a number generated from a random number table. This will be used to randomise the participant into each group.</concealment>
    <sequence>Numbers generated from a random number table will be placed into sealed, opaque envelopes by an investigator not involved with recruitment. When a participant in recruited, the investigator involved with recruitment will assign them with an envelope and hence a number. This number will be used to to randomise the participant into each group.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation based on:
Retrospective audit data showing post-operative PCA fentanyl after intraoperative morphine procedures is 590 +/- 215 micrograms. Expected clinically relevant 25 percent reduction in post-operative PCA fentanyl after use of intraoperative methadone. Expected 5 patient in each group lost to follow up.  Power and significance level for calculation: 0.05 (significance level), 0.80 (power).
