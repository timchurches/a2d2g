    <studytitle>Managing swallowing in stroke patients - free water versus thickened fluids</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In stroke patients who aspirate thin liquids does a free water protocol increase fluid intake and improve hydration status without increasing the risk of pneumonia when compared to the provision of thickened fluids only ?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Free Water Protocol.
Allowing aspirating patients access to water between meals but not with food or drink. They also have access to thickened fluids at their bedside and at mealtimes and can choose whether they drink thickened fluids or water. Patients will remain on this protocol until they are assessed as no longer aspirating. The protocol includes a strict oral hygiene regime of twice daily teeth brushing and rinsing mouth after all food..</interventions>
    <comparator>Thickened fluids. 
Providing fluids thickened to the consistency which prevents aspiration. Thickened fluids are provided at bedside and at all mealtimes. Patients will remain on thickened fluids until they are assessed as no longer aspirating. They will also undergo the same oral hygiene regime as the intervention group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average daily fluid intake measured in mls. 
This will be recorded by nursing staff on a fluid balance chart which records fluid offered and fluid drunk.
Water and thickened fluids drunk will be totalled separately.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured daily until patient is assessed as no longer aspirating or is discharged from hospital, whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of pneumonia as diagnosed by medical officer and confirmed by chest Xray</outcome>
      <timepoint>Chest monitored clinically on a daily basis until patient is assessed as longer aspirating and chest Xray ordered as required</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hydration status measured by urea to creatinine ratio from biochemical analysis of a blood sample</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood sample taken on a weekly basis until patient is assessed as no longer aspirating or until patient is discharged whichever comes first.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction with treatment measured by a simple 5 point Likert scale rating factors such as taste, feel in the mouth, thirst, and coughing</outcome>
      <timepoint>Surveyed on a weekly basis until patient is assessed as no longer aspirating or until patient is discharged whichever comes first</timepoint>
