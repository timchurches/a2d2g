  <interventions>
    <interventions>Aerobic cycling exercise 3 days per week for 12 weeks either: continuous (30-45minutes per session) or interval format (30-60 second bursts with 1-3 minutes recovery between). 
Continuous exercise is initially 30 minutes and is progressed to 45 minutes by week 6 of the trial in accordance with the progressive overload principle and individual progress.
Interval training is initially 15 minutes in duration, progressing to 23 minutes as the duration of intervals is lengthened according to the principles of progressive overload an individual progress.
Exercise is administered in to 1-3 participants at a time depending on participant availability by an exercise physiologist.</interventions>
    <comparator>3 days per week of stretch and self-massage. Stretches are static muscle stretching of the pectorals, triceps, calves, quadriceps and shoulder region. Self massage uses an effleurage technique with aid from a massage object if required. This program is progressed with a fit ball training program that incorporates a series of isometric holds and simple balance exercises.
Participants are advised to complete 15 minutes of stretching and 5 minutes of self massage 3 days per week. Following the addition of fit ball exercises, 5 minutes of stretching and 15 minutes of fit ball training is advised on 3 days per week.

Treatment lasts for 12 weeks and participants are required to attend a training session once a fortnight to receive instruction and guidance for training from an exercise physiologist. These sessions also last 25-30 minutes.</comparator>
