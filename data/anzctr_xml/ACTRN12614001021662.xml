  <interventions>
    <interventions>One practice nurse in each intervention practice will be trained as Prevention Navigator to assist patients to attend community-based referral programs and services.
The practice level intervention involves:
1.One clinical audit report and face to face 1.5-hour long meeting  with general practitioners (GPs) and Prevention Navigators in own practices to identify priorities and strategies for improvement in the assessment and management of obese patients; 
2. One 3-hour long training session (for GPs and PNs including the Prevention Navigators) which will cover management of obese patients across the 5As of the chronic disease model approach  Assess, Advise,Agree, Assist and Arrange.
3. Prevention Navigators will be trained the concept of care navigation and their role in this.
4. Results from the health literacy screening are discussed at one 1.5-hour long meeting involving GPs and Prevention Navigators in own practices.

The clinical level intervention involves:
1. Patients in the waiting room will be screened for low health literacy (using three validated questions translated into several languages). Those that are eligible and consent are invited to attend a Health Check visit with the Prevention Navigators.
2. At the Health Check visit, which will be approximately 30 minutes long,the patient will receive brief advice, set goals related to weight loss, be referred to community-based services or programs and makes a follow up appointment with the GP or Prevention Navigator.

The intervention will be provided over a period of 6 months.</interventions>

    <concealment>Procedure:
Once a patient’s name is entered in the practice’s patient appointment list, a pre-installed software assesses the patient for: age (40-70 years), being an active practice attendee, being a patient of a participating GP and having none of the exclusion criteria. 
The software automatically prints out the health literacy screening questionnaire which will also include patient's clinical information and consent form. 
The reception staff gives the patient the printout and Patient Information sheet and ask them to complete the health literacy screening questionnaire in the waiting room and to give it to their GP when they go in for the appointment.
For patients who can’t complete the survey in English but can complete it in a language for which translated Health Literacy questionnaire and Patient Information Sheet is available, the reception staff give patients the translated forms. Patients who can’t complete the health literacy questionnaire in English or in the common languages spoken in the practice self-opt out from the Study.
The GP scores the health literacy questionnaire, completes the section on patient’ willingness to come back to see the Prevention Navigator, and assesses the overall patient eligibility. If the patient is eligible, the GP invites the patient to consent.
In Control practices, the GP also checks the waist circumference and weight and calculates the body mass index. In Intervention practices, the Prevention Navigators record this information at the time of Health Checks.

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimates are based on a two-sided test of significance at alpha=0.05, beta= 0.8 and 20% loss to follow up and effect sizes and standard deviations are based on our previous research.

We will examine change in the primary and secondary outcomes between the intervention and control practices, after adjusting for baseline differences. We will analyse patient variables for within and between practice differences using multilevel linear and logistic regression techniques that adjust for clustering by practice and multiple imputation to adjust for missing values. Analyses will be conducted on an ITT principle.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study tests an intervention to improve overweight patients' health literacy for weight loss and assist them to attend community-based weight management lifestyle modification programs. 

Study hypotheses: 
1. Compared to practice nurses in control practices, those in intervention practices will demonstrate greater improvement in their self-reported behaviour and confidence in assessing obese patients with low health literacy and providing advice and referral to them for weight loss.
2. Compared to similar patients attending control practices, obese patients with low health literacy attending intervention practices are, at six months, more likely to report:
*having received assessment, advice and referral for weight management
*having attended/used community-based weight management lifestyle modification programs referred to.
3. Compared to similar patients attending control practices, obese patients with low health literacy attending intervention practices are, at 12 months, more likely to have improved their health literacy related to weight management.
