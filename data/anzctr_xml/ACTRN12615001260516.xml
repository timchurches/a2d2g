    <interventions>The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) compared to placebo in patients with chronic migraine headaches. The secondary objective is to measure differences between placebo and SVF. 

Thirty participants will be enrolled in the study and randomly separated into 2 study groups.

Cohort 1:   15 patients administered with SVF (Day 0 and Day 30)

Cohort 2:  15 patients administered with placebo (Normal Saline; Day 0 and Day 30)

Autologous non-expanded SVF from adipose (fat) will be used due to the ease of harvest and safety (liposuction; about 60 min). The procedure will be performed by the Principle Investigator (Dr Ralph Bright - Physician and Cosmetic Surgeon), with the fat taken from the abdomen.

Cohort 1: [study drug] will have a SVF intravenous (IV) infusion of 3 million cells/kg of body weight in 500ml of Normal Saline after undergoing liposuction for 200 - 300 ml of adipose tissue (excess SVF will be cryo-preserved for the repeat treatment at Day 30).

The fat is processed on-site to isolate the cells (this process takes up to 40 mins approximately), and an infusion of SVF occurs immediately once the fat processing has finished. 

Cohort 2: [placebo] will have an intravenous (IV) infusion of 500ml of Normal Saline (placebo), packaged in the same way as SVF after undergoing liposuction for 200 - 300 ml of adipose tissue (IV administration will be repeated on Day 30).

SVF will be separated from the adipose tissue and cryo-preserved for the placebo group as an option for treatment after the study.

      <outcome>Safety will be assessed by monitoring for Adverse Events (including abnormal laboratory test results) over the study interval.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Primarily participants will be recruited from the pool currently existing within the Investigator Practices and by posters in each clinic. Other recruitment for the clinical trial will be via referral from other medical practitioners or limited newspaper/website advertisement in the Sydney and NSW regions.

After direct inquiry from a possible participant or after an initial phone based screen, participants will be invited to attend for a formal assessment to ascertain their suitability for the trial. If suitable they will be invited to enroll in the study and then complete a formal informed consent.

Formally enrolled participants will then be randomly allocated to a study group/arm by the study administrator using a randomisation computer program (www.randomizer.org). Allocation concealment involves contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is "off-site".</concealment>

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This study is primarily to assess the safety profile of SVF.  However, a sample size estimate was undertaken for the secondary exploratory efficacy endpoint that identified a target sample size of 30 patients.

The main efficacy criterion will be an overall mean response of 50% reduction in the headache frequency in the active treatment arm, in comparison to the placebo arm. To allow for attrition and ensure adequate power, a target sample size of at least 30 patients was selected. Loss of diagnostic criteria for migraine headache will be compared between treatment arms using a McNemars paired test for categorical data. Headache severity, duration and overall severity scores (severity x duration) will be compared to baseline and summarised using descriptive statistics. VAS scores of perception of headache intensity will be evaluated by the distance along the line (0 to 10), tabulated, and degree of disability analysed using descriptive statistics.

For the sample size estimation, a 30% improvement in the headache diary score from baseline is assumed to be the smallest clinically meaningful change over time. The placebo group is assumed to have a zero improvement over time.    The sample sizes have been estimated assuming a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05.  

The chosen sample size of 30 patients allows for 15 patients per treatment cohort which is sufficient to detect a difference between the placebo group and SVF group in the mean percentage change over time in the headache diary scores of 20% with a standard deviation of 10% or difference of 10% with a much larger standard deviation of 20%.

    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of SVF compared to placebo in patients with chronic migraine headaches.

The secondary objective is to measure differences between placebo and SVF based therapies in several efficacy assessments including:  improvement in migraine headache-free rates, migraine headache severity, duration, degree of disability associated symptoms, and use of concomitant headache medications in comparison to placebo.
