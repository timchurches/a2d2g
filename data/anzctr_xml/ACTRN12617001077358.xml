  <interventions>
    <interventions>Pharmacists who have completed the Goodfellow training on Insomnia will use a screening tool (the adapted 2-page short Auckland Sleep Questionnaire developed by Arroll, Fernando and Falloon) and provide advice in the pharmacy including medical referral for people presenting with insomnia. This will take place face-to-face. The questionnaire has been adapted for pharmacy use by Arroll and Gauld following feedback from pharmacists and doctors. Medical referral is as per this sleep questionnaire which has clear referral points for possible underlying concerns affecting sleep (with input from doctors). The pharmacist would run through their consultation with a person with insomnia guided by this tool, noting answers to questions. Participants would then self-complete in a private room in the pharmacy the full validated 7-page Auckland Sleep Questionnaire (from which the short Auckland Sleep Questionnaire was derived) for use by researchers only.  The pharmacist would then diagnose primary insomnia or refer to a doctor according to the tool and/or provide advice (e.g. sleep hygiene) as the pharmacist deems appropriate (noting their recent Goodfellow training on Insomnia and undergraduate training in this area and according to the answers the person has given, e.g. drinking caffeine or alcohol). Pharmacists will use their usual referral process, which could involve advising the participant to see their doctor or send a notification to the doctor - this will be at the pharmacist's discretion. 
The screening tool looks for underlying causes of insomnia, e.g. indications of depression, obstructive sleep apnoea, etc. 
The pharmacist will ring 2 weeks later to ask what action was taken and what effect it had.

The 2-page screening tool adapted from one developed for general practice (short Auckland Sleep Questionnaire - Arroll, Fernando and Falloon), and the 7-page validated gold standard questionnaire (Auckland Sleep Questionnaire - Arroll, Fernando and Falloon) will identify possible underlying causes, or if none exist, primary insomnia. </outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>How many people need referral for possible underlying conditions? Assessed using the pharmacist's clinical judgement following the 2-page screening tool, and from indications of underlying disorders in the 7-page validated gold standard questionnaire (The Auckland Sleep Questionnaire: Arroll, Fernando &amp; Falloon).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>How well does the 2-page screening tool align with the gold standard Auckland Sleep Questionnaire 7-page screening tool in identifying primary insomnia and possible underlying causes? Findings from each tool will be compared for each participant, with reporting on possible underlying causes identified (e.g. possible depression or anxiety) and findings of primary insomnia, and this will be reported (noting it is pilot phase). </outcome>
      <timepoint>End of study when at least 120 participants have completed the screening tool (max 144 participants based on 12 per pharmacist).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>What proportion of participants had taken the advice of the pharmacist at 2 weeks?The pharmacist will contact the participant 2 weeks after the consultation using a brief questionnaire designed specifically for this study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The data is collected 2 weeks after the participant's consultation with the pharmacist, but all data will be analysed after a minimum of 120 participants have been screened (max 144). </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>What was the outcome of that advice? (e.g. medical diagnosis, sleep improvement, no change)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The data is collected 2 weeks after the participant's consultation with the pharmacist, but all data will be analysed after approximately 120 participants have been screened (max 144 can be included). </timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Insomnia is a common reason for purchasing complementary remedies in pharmacy or seeking advice in pharmacy. However, it may indicate an underlying problem. There is no comprehensive screening tool that has been developed for pharmacy use to ascertain where insomnia may be secondary to another cause (e.g. depression, sleep apnoea). A short screening tool that has been validated in general practice in NZ will be adapted and used in pharmacy. We will look for workability of the tool for the pharmacist (how long it takes, how useful it is), findings of the questionnaire (compared to the gold-standard questionnaire), frequency of medical referral. We will compare the outcomes of the questionaire with the gold standard 7-page questionnaire.  
Consumers presenting in the pharmacy for a sleep remedy or for advice on insomnia for themselves will do the short 2-page questionnaire with the pharmacist. The pharmacist will provide advice e.g. on sleep hygiene or medical referral based on this questionnaire and their expertise. The participant will self -complete the 7-page questionnaire for return to the researchers.
The pharmacist will follow up the participant after 2 weeks to ascertain what (if any) action was taken by the participant, the outcomes of this action (e.g. new diagnosis by the doctor), and whether sleep was thought to have improved, worsened or stayed the same. </summary>
