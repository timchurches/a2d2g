  <interventions>
    <interventions>To be eligible, participants must opioid dependent and enrolled in a methadone maintenance programme but seeking to withdraw from methadone. They must be on stable doses of methadone for at least 30 days prior to Screening.

Participants who meet eligibility criteria will undergo a medically supervised OST withdrawal. Their methadone will be replaced with CR morphine twice daily while they are out-patients (Day -7 to Day -3). An equivalent dose to the methadone will be administered as CR morphine an (using a 1:4 ratio).  The participants response to CR morphine dosing will be monitored for at least 4 hours post dosing and the investigator may adjust the dose to 1:3 to 1:5 ratios depending on participant response.  

Participants will be admitted to the Clinical Site on Day -2 and their CR morphine will be replaced with immediate release morphine administered orally as 10mg four times a day on Day -2 and Day -1. On Day 1 the morphine will be with-held; Medical treatment will be provided to minimize symptoms during the withdrawal period. 

The following rating scales will be used in this study: 
(1)These will be collected to assess psychological and neurological safety and drug effects.  
- The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS): from screening (between Day -28 and Day -9) until Day 3, 
- Psychotomimetic Rating Scale (PRS): from screening (between Day -28 and Day -9) until Day 1,
- Mood Visual Analog Scale (Mood VAS): from screening (between Day -28 and Day -9) until the follow-up Visit one week after discharge from the Clinical Site at Day 3,
- Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), from screening (between day -28 and Day -9) until Day 3,
- Addiction Severity Index (ASI):from screening (between Day -28 and Day -9) until Day -2,
- Readiness for Change (RtC):from screening (between Day -28 and Day -9) until Day -2,

(2) Opiate Withdrawal scales will be used to evaluate the progression and suppression of Opiate withdrawal compared to the participants baseline:
- Handelsman-Kanof OOWS/SOWS and COWS instruments will be used to assess opioid withdrawal. These are conducted from inital screening until the follow-up Visit 1 (one week after their discharge from the Clinical Site at Day 3).

The resumption of methadone OST may occur when the participants withdrawal symptoms have not been controlled with medical intervention and the intensity is to the point where the participant requests OST.  Methadone OST may also be initiated at the investigators discretion when his clinical evaluation indicates the participants withdrawal is increasing and not responding to medical intervention.  

All doses of morphine will be administered at the Clinical Site and mouth checks will be performed to ensure compliance.</interventions>
    <comparator>No comparator or control is involved in this study. It is an open-label observation study of the effects of withdrawing opioid substitution treatment. Even though CR and IR morphine is administered during the study, their administration is to allow observation the effects of opioid withdrawal (the purpose of the study is not to observe the effects of the morphine)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The objective of this study isto evaluate the instruments and procedures to be used in a subsequent study of the safety and tolerability of noribogaine in opioid dependent Participants.  

Primary Endpoint: Evaluate the usefulness of SOWS/OOWS and COWS to define withdrawal</outcome>
      <timepoint>SOWS/OOWS and COWS Assessments will be done at the initial screening between Day -28 to Day -9, Day -8 pre methadone dose and 2 and 4 hours post dosing, Day-7 at pre CR morphine dose, 2, 4 and 12 hours post dosing, Day -6 to Day -3 prior to the 8AM CR morphine dosing, Day -2 and -1 prior to morphine dosing at 8AM and 5PM, Day 1 baseline and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 48 hours after holding the 8AM morphine dose and at Visit 1 (one week after discharge from the Clinical Site at Day 3).    </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary Endpoint:  Evaluate the usefulness of the following scales:
Addiction Severity Index (ASI)
Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI)
Drug History Questionnaire (DHQ)	
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)
Psychotomimetic Rating Scale (PRS)
Mood Visualization Analog Scale (Mood VAS)
Readiness to Change (RtC)

The data from these scales will be summarised using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, inter-quartile range and range) for the quantitative variables.  Categorical variables will be summarized by counts and percentages. The scales will only be useful for subsequent research if they reflect the effects of opioid withdrawal in the study population.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The timepoints for the secondary endpoints vary for each scale; the timepoints for each scale are listed below:

The PRS will be assessed at the initial screening (between Days -28 to Day -9); pre CR morphine does on Day -7 and Day 1 baseline and 3.5 hours post dosing.  

ARCI will be assessed at the initial screening (between Day -28 to Day -9), Day 1 at approximately 12 noon, and Day 3 prior to discharge.  

The participant will complete the ASI at the initial screening and Day -2.  

CSSRS will be assessed at the initial screening (between Day -28 to Day -9) and Day 3. 

The participant will be asked to complete the 5 Mood VAS assessments at initial Screening (Day -28 to Day -9); Day -8  pre methadone dose and 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours post dosing, Days -7 at pre CR morphine dosing and 2, 4 and 12 hours post dosing, Day -6 to Day -3 prior to the 8AM CR morphine dose, Days -2 and -1 prior to morphine dosing at 8AM and 5PM, on Day 1 at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 12, 24, 28, 32, 36 and 48  hours after holding the 8AM morphine dose and at follow up Visit 1 (one week after Discharge from the Clinical Site at Day 3).  

The participant will be asked to complete the RtC at the initial screening and Day -2.

The MINI will be used to assess psychological health and drug and alcohol use.  The MINI will be conducted at inital Screening (between Day -28 and Day -9)
