  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as PR-104, docetaxel, and gemcitabine, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of PR-104 when given
      together with docetaxel or gemcitabine in treating patients with solid tumors.</summary>
