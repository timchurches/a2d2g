    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - JNJ-64457107

Experimental: JNJ-64457107 - In Part 1, the first cohort will receive JNJ-64457107 at a starting dose of 75 microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg). The proposed treatment schedule is intravenous (IV) dosing every 14 days. JNJ-64457107 doses will be escalated following a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM); the JNJ-64457107 dose will be increased by not more than half-logarithmical (3.2-fold) dose increments. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D of JNJ-64457107 are defined or the maximum-administered dose (MAD) has been reached. In Part 2, subjects will receive JNJ-64457107 at the RP2D and regimen determined in Part 1.


Treatment: drugs: JNJ-64457107
JNJ-64457107 administered by IV infusion on Day 1 and 14 of a 28-day cycle.

    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      schedule of JNJ-64457107 when administered intravenously (IV) to participants with advanced
      stage solid tumors in Part 1 and to further characterize the safety of JNJ-64457107 when
      administered IV to participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer
      and cutaneous melanoma in Part 2.</summary>
