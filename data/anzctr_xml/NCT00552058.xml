  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects in Clinical Remission at Week 6 - The percentage of subjects in clinical remission at Week 6 (clinical remission is defined as a total Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 150 points or less). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A score of 150 points or below indicates clinical remission and a score above 450 points indicates extremely severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 6</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Subjects Achieving a Clinical Response at Week 6 - The percentage of subjects achieving a clinical response at Week 6 (clinical response is defined as at least a 100-point decrease from the Week 0 Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score). CDAI is used to quantify the symptoms of subjects with Crohn's disease. A score of 150 or below indicates clinical remission and a score above 450 points indicates extremely severe disease.</outcome>

The IBDQ Global Score is the sum of 32 responses, each ranging from 0 to 7, thus the Global Score ranges from 0 to 224; a higher score indicating a better quality of life.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) Score From Week 0 to Week 6 - The change in Harvey Bradshaw Index (HBI) score from Week 0 to Week 6. HBI score consists of clinical parameters of general well-being (0 to 4), abdominal pain (0 to 3), number of liquid stools per day, abdominal mass (0 to 3), and complications (score 1 per item). The first three items are scored for the previous day. Lower scores indicated better well being.</outcome>
