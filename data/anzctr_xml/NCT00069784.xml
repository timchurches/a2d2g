    <summary>The primary objectives of the ORIGIN study were:

        -  To determine whether insulin glargine-mediated normoglycemia can reduce cardiovascular
           morbidity and/or mortality in people at high risk for vascular disease with either
           Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG), Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) or early type 2
           diabetes;

        -  To determine whether omega-3 fatty acids can reduce cardiovascular mortality in people
           with IFG, IGT or early type 2 diabetes.

      The secondary objectives of the insulin glargine study were to determine if insulin
      glargine-mediated normoglycemia can reduce:

        -  total mortality (all causes);

        -  the risk of diabetic microvascular outcomes;

        -  the rate of progression of IGT or IFG to type 2 diabetes.</summary>
