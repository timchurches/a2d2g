  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study will investigate the effects of implementing a communication partner training program on the communicative interactions between people with aphasia, health professionals and health professional students. The component of the study that involves people with aphasia will consist of single group design, with all people with aphasia receiving the training program. During the study, the people with aphasia will complete a training program which consists of 6 modules (based on the Communication Partner Training Program developed by Connect in the United Kingdom). The modules will focus on developing strategies to assist communication. The modules will be delivered as group sessions facilitated by a qualified speech pathologist and will consist of 6 1-1.5 hour sessions over 6 weeks or 2-3 3 hour sessions depending upon the needs of the people with aphasia. The component of the study involving the health professionals will consist of a single group design, with all health professionals receiving the training program. In contrast, the component of the study that involves the health practitioner students will consist of a randomised control trial (with half of the students receiving the training program and the remaining half of the students acting as an untrained control group). To ensure equality, the students who are allocated to the control group will be offered the training program at the completion of the study. The health professionals and health professional students will attend a single training session (1.5 hours in duration and facilitated by a qualified speech pathologist) at the end of the program (they will not attend any other training sessions). During this session, the people with aphasia will teach the communication strategies to the health professionals and students.</interventions>
    <comparator>For the health professional students, half of the students will completed the single training session with the people with aphasia. For comparison purposes, the remaining students will attend their usual lectures and not the training program (however, to ensure equality, a training program will be offered to the control group after the completion of the study). For the people with aphasia and health professionals, all participants in these groups will be trained (pre and post training measures will be collected for the people with aphasia and the health professionals rather than having a separate control group).</comparator>

      <outcome>Change in self-rated communicative confidence (for all participants) eg. the Communication Confidence Rating Scale for Aphasia for the participants with aphasia, and a non-standardised rating scale developed specifically for this study for the health professionals and health professional students (the scale will consist of a 10cm long line ranging from "Not at all confident" through to "Very confident")</outcome>

      <outcome>Change in self-rated knowledge and implementation of effective communication strategies (for all participants) as measured by a non-standardised rating scale developed specifically for this study (the scale will consist of a 10cm long line ranging from "Not at all confident" through to "Very confident").

    <designfeatures>For the people with aphasia and the health professionals, a single group study design will be employed (as all participants in these groups will receive the training program).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The communication difficulties associated with aphasia, an acquired language disorder, can have significant negative effects on an individuals quality of life and participation in healthcare decisions. Currently, Australian health practitioners are not trained in techniques for communicating effectively with people with aphasia. The proposed study will investigate the impact of a communication training program on people with aphasia, health practitioners and health practitioner students. It is predicted that the program will improve communication efficiency between the groups, increasing the involvement of people with aphasia in their treatment programs and healthcare decisions and potentially improving patient and staff satisfaction. The techniques gained during the program may also assist health practitioners to interact effectively with patients with other communication needs.</summary>
