  <interventions>
    <interventions>A simple randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief 3 week ehealth program designed to increase wellness and decrease stress (called THRIVE eHealth). 

THRIVE eHealth is essentially a one module tools based program, split into 6 key psychoeducational areas (i.e., relaxation, sleep, nutrition, exercise, goal setting and life balance) designed to help people enhance their mental and physical wellbeing. The entire module will take about 20 minutes to read, with an additional 60 minutes if all the wellbeing tools are accessed (e.g., guided audio). Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions during the study period to monitor their progress. The THRIVE module include text, graphics, audio, quizzes, and downloads. THRIVE can be accessible via web, mobile or tablet devices. 

Participants randomised to the THRIVE eHealth (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1-2) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 3) and a 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 7). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to THRIVE eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 7). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they completed the THRIVE eHealth program (Week 9). Access to THRIVE will be provided for the entire trial period. Adherence will be measured by the overall percentage of the module completed by post assessments as well as questions regarding engagement levels.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to register for the study on the THRIVE eHealth website where they will be taken to the Plain Language Information Statement and must provide informed consent to proceed. Following account creation, participants are asked to complete the pre-intervention online questionnaires. Once completed the participant is informed as to which condition they have been randomly allocated too (on screen and sent an automated email). The THRIVE eHealth program software randomly allocates (and informs) participants using a block design method.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>1. Pre-, post- and follow-up variables will be subjected to repeated measures MANOVA and ANOVA to determine significant changes over time and between groups
2. Correlational and multiple regression analyses will be used to determine significant correlates of wellbeing and to determine any potential predictors and discriminators of attrition and adherence.
3. Open ended data obtained from intervention satisfaction may be analysed using protocols of content analysis to identify common themes.

Assuming a medium effect (i.e. GPower f test = 0.40), significance set at 5% (p = .05) and power at 80%, a total sample size of 107 (this figure also accounts for an expected attrition rate of 40%) will be required to demonstrate statistical significance on the primary outcome measure.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A simple randomised controlled trial (RCT) design will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief ehealth program designed to increase wellness and decrease stress (called THRIVE eHealth). The THRIVE eHealth program will be placed within the Federation University eHealth
Platform. 

People who visit the website, either directly or through seeing the program advertised, will be invited to take part in the THRIVE eHealth evaluation study. Those that consent will be randomly allocated to the THRIVE eHealth program (immediate access group) or a wait control group (delayed access group). The delayed access group will receive the intervention following a 6-week waiting period.

THRIVE eHealth is essentially a one module tools based program, split into 6 key psycho-educational areas (i.e., relaxation, sleep, nutrition, exercise, goal setting and life balance) designed to help people enhance their mental and physical wellbeing. The entire module will take about 20 minutes to read, with an additional 60 minutes if all the wellbeing tools are accessed (e.g., guided audio). Participants will also receive automated emails (e.g., to remind them to log on, when to complete post/follow-up questionnaires) and will be asked several questions during the study period to monitor their progress.

Participants randomised to the THRIVE eHealth (immediate access) group will complete a pre-intervention assessment (Week 0), during intervention (Week 1-2) assessment, post-intervention assessment (Week 3) and a 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 7). Participants randomised to the delayed access group will complete the same assessment phases and will be given access to THRIVE eHealth program following the 1 month follow-up assessment (Week 7). However the delayed access group will be asked to complete the post intervention assessment after they completed the THRIVE eHealth program (Week 9).


It is expected that people who undertake THRIVE will show increases in mental wellbeing and optimism and reductions in negative affect at post and follow-up time points. </summary>
