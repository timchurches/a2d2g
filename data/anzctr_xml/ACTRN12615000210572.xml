  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Group Problem Management Plus. Arm 2: Enhanced Treatment as Usual. Therapy is administered onceweekly over 5 weeks in a group format over 3 hours. Problem Management Plus includes skills in identifying emotional and practical problems that can be managed and strategies to reduce and cope with these problems. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after immediate post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months. Therapy is provided by lay health counselors along with community health workers. </interventions>
    <comparator>Enhanced Treatment as Usual comprises normal routine visits conducted by the local community health workers (LHWs). Care is enhanced in 2 ways: (a) LHWs in the EUC arm will receive training in making referrals to their primary care physicians for treatment; and (b) These primary care physicians will receive the standard training in treatment of common mental disorders routinely taught by our partner, the WHO Collaborating Center in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. If, during this treatment or during the studys assessments participants in EUC arm show severe psychiatric disorders (eg psychosis) or problems (e.g., suicidality) that require immediate specialist treatment and follow-up, they will be referred to specialist staff (e.g., psychiatrist) within the District Headquarter Hospital. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after post-trial follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 1.5 months.</comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be women above 18 years referred by their community health workers and indicating moderate distress &amp; impaired functioning. As a cluster randomized control trial the unit of randomization is LHWs, who each have one catchment area of approximately 150 homes or a population of 1,000 persons. All LHWs in Qambar (20) are eligible for randomization, which will be done by a researcher at the independent trial center at the Human Development Research Foundation who is not involved in intervention delivery, clinical supervision, independent assessment or other aspects of the day-to-day running of the study. Within the Qambar Union Council an even number of LHWs will be randomized to the intervention and EUC arm, using a 1:1 allocation ratio. This design is necessary to reduce the chance of contamination that would be present in an individual RCT design as it is possible more than one woman from each household will meet the inclusion criteria.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomization will be conducted by a computer generated system and will be conducted using 1:1 allocation ratio. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The data, as collected by independent assessors will be safely stored at 
the site office. Access to this office will be controlled by the site PI. The
data will be entered into a data-analytic computer program (e.g., SPSS),
without the identifying key. Data will only be available to the members of
the project group. No attributable data will be used in publications. Both
intention-to-treat analysis and completers analyses will be carried out.
To measure comparisons at baseline between the two treatment groups
t-tests will be conducted for continuous variables and chi-squared test
for categorical ones. Repeated measurement analysis will be carried out
to assess differential change over time in mean HADS scores between
groups. We will add the following covariates at baseline to examine
subgroup effects: education, and severity of symptoms. All analyses will
be carried out in SPSS, with p-levels of &lt;.05 indicating statistical
significance.
Since this is an exploratory cluster RCT with 120 participants (60 participants per arm) that does not aim to detect statistically significant differences in effectiveness, no power calculations have been (or should be) carried out.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a low intensity intervention to reduce mental health problems in women in low-resources settings. This study compares the relative efficacy of (a) Group Problem Management Plus, and (b) Enhanced Treatment as Usual. It is hypothesised that Group Problem Management Plus will lead to greater symptom reduction than Enhanced Treatment as Usual. </summary>
