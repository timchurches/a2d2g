  <interventions>
    <interventions>The study involves continuous monitoring of movement and cardiac signals in three patient groups:
1. Management and tertiary prevention: patients with developed cardiovascular diseases and/or COPD that are assessed and managed by Home Based Acute Care services.
2. Secondary prevention: early detection and early management of disease markers.  These patients live at home at attend rehab clinics twice weekly for exercise and other intervention therapy.
3. Primary prevention: preventing and reducing risk factors.  This cohort will be healthy community participants, serving as a control group.
Participants will be monitored 24hours/day for 10-15 weeks, using a device worn on the hip, containing accelerometers and a single channel ECG module, connected to the chest via leads &amp; adhesive electrode pads.
The following observations will be made at the completion of the study:
 Degree of adjustment to patient therapy as a result of frequent / continuous assessment of mobility;
 Ability to identify patients that respond well to certain exercise /education from those that dont respond;
 Patient activity levels through the week between visits to rehabilitation clinics;
 Extent of changes in activity levels as a direct consequence of modifying medications;
 Contribution of ECG monitoring to the management and care of participants;
 Duplication levels in patient assessment;
 Ability to use monitoring for benchmarking rehabilitation services;
 Patient and clinician perceived continuum of care and communication of health information;
 Activity levels of study participants over previous levels;
 Hospital admission and length of stay data for participants in the study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project will involve monitoring a patients activity levels and vital signs to determine their response to targeted exercise therapy, education programs and changes in medications.  This data will be measured using an externally worn monitoring device.  Changes in medications and related health observations will be captured using a form.
Patients perceived Quality-of-Life, self assessed activity levels and trial feedback (satisfaction, inconvenience etc) will also be captured by questionnaire.
It is also desired to link hospital readmission and length of stay measures with the involvement of participants in the study.</summary>
