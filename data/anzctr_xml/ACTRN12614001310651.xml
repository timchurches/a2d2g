  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participants will attend two intervention sessions in random order. The experimental intervention will be a single session of chiropractic care. Full spine adjustments will be carried out during the experimental session. The entire spine and sacroiliac joints will be assessed for vertebral subluxations and adjusted where deemed necessary by a registered chiropractor. The intervention will take approximately 10 minutes to carry out. There will be a 1 week washout period between the 2 interventions. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention will consist of passive and active movements of the subjects head, spine and body that will be carried out by the same chiropractor who pre-checks the participants for vertebral subluxations and who performs the adjustments in the experimental intervention session. This control intervention will involve the participants being moved into the adjustment setup positions where the chiropractor would normally apply a thrust to the spine to achieve the adjustments. However, the experimenter will be particularly careful not to put pressure on any individual spinal segments. Loading a joint, as is done prior to spinal adjustments has been shown to alter paraspinal proprioceptive firing in anesthetised cats (Pickar &amp; Wheeler, 2001), and will therefore be carefully avoided by ending the movement prior to end range- of-motion when passively moving the participants. No spinal adjustments will be performed during any control intervention. This control intervention is not intended to act as a sham adjustment but to
act as a physiological control for possible changes occurring due to the cutaneous, muscular or vestibular input that will occur with the type of passive and active movements involved in preparing a patient for an adjustment. It also acts as a control for the effects of the stimulation necessary to collect the dependent measures of the study, and acts as a control for the time required to carry out the adjustment intervention. The control intervention will take approximately 10 minutes to complete.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Sixty participants will be recruited from the New Zealand College of Chiropractic community to participate in this study. Twenty will be pain free, 20 will be experiencing back or neck pain at the time of the study, and 20 subclinical spinal pain subjects will be recruited.

Participants may include students, staff, faculty, and previous patients of the Colleges chiropractic centre. Subjects will be eligible for inclusion if they are English speaking, aged 18-50, and have previously sought chiropractic care. The pain group will be experiencing back or neck pain at the time that they participate in the trial. The subclinical pain group will have some history of recurring spinal dysfunction such as mild pain, ache, and/or stiffness with or without a history of known trauma.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Over the past decade there has been growing evidence to suggest that chiropractic care influences brain function. The researchers that have done this work have used sophisticated brain research methods such as measuring brain waves using electroencephalography (EEG). These studies have shown that adjusting subluxations in the spine alters function in various brain structures. However, the evidence for the involvement of these brain structures is indirect. Although EEG measures brain activity very accurately time-wise, it has poor spatial resolution, which means its hard to tell exactly where in the brain the activity occurs. 

Recently efforts have been made to improve the spatial resolution of EEG using a new EEG technique, known as multichannel matching pursuit technique. With this technique it is possible to determine with greater clarity where in the brain activity occurs. We intend to use this new technique to explore which structures in the brain are talking to each other prior to, and after, chiropractic adjustments. 

We believe that we will be able to identify differences in the way the brains of a group of 20 individuals who are developing spinal symptoms, function compare with a group of 20 healthy people with no history of symptoms and a group of 20 people in pain. We also believe that a single session of chiropractic care will change the way parts of the brain are talking to each other. We aim to reveal the brain areas involved in subclinical pain processing, then study the communication between these brain areas and how the communication changes following a single session of spinal adjustments.

By completing this study the researchers hope to gain a much better understanding about how vertebral subluxations and adjustments affect nervous system function.
