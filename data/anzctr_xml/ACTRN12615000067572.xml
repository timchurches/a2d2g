  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I):
Participants who are randomly allocated to participate in the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia group will be asked to attend 8 weekly, 60-90 minute treatment sessions that involve learning more about their sleep pattern, and identifying unhelpful habits that may be contributing towards their sleep difficulties. Participants will learn several skills that aim to improve their sleep pattern and sleep quality. They will also be provided with information and worksheets during the program which are designed to help improve their sleep pattern. Participating in this form of therapy requires time and commitment. It will take perseverance to make sustainable changes to their sleep habits, and therefore the strategies that they will learn need to be practiced each day during the trial. Participants in this group will be supported by two qualified therapists who have received specialised training and supervision in this therapy. The 8 treatment sessions will be provided in small groups at the local mental health service venue. This will give participants an opportunity to meet other people who are experiencing similar problems and support each other in making changes to their sleep habits. 

2. Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Insomnia and Depression (CBT-I-D)
Participants who are randomly allocated to the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia and depression group will receive the same program as the group described above. This group, however, will include additional strategies that are specifically designed to also improve their mood. This will involve assisting to increase their level of daily meaningful activity and help them to refocus their attention on positive thoughts rather than depressive negative thoughts. </interventions>
    <comparator>3. Psychoeducation Control group. 
This condition includes providing 60-90 minute supportive education sessions about sleep and mood problems once a week over 8 weeks. This group contains no active treatment strategies of CBT for insomnia. Each session will also be held in small groups and co-facilitated by two qualified therapists. </comparator>

    <concealment>Participants will be invited to participate in the trial via their mental health case manager. This will involve providing participants with an information pack about the trial (e.g., invitation brochure, plain language statement, consent form). Once participants have read the documents and have consented to participate, they will undergo a 2-step eligibility screening process. The first step involves completing a brief insomnia symptom diagnostic screen over the phone. Participants who have current insomnia will be invited to complete a face to face interview. Participants who are eligible for the trial after this second step will be allocated to group/cluster (n=6), which has been randomly generated via cluster/block randomisation. Allocation concealment involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was “off-site”. Participants will have a 2 in 3 chance of being allocated to a CBT group, and a 1 in 3 chance of being allocated to the control group.

    <statisticalmethods>- Data will be entered, screened, and analysed using SPSS.
- Repeated measures MANCOVA will be implemented to explore differences between groups and over time, and calculate effect sizes to investigate treatment effect.
- The projected sample size calculation was conducted using power analysis involving modest statistical assumptions. This was cross-referenced with respected RCTs in the field to obtain a minimum total number of participants and minimum number of participants per treatment condition. 
- Statistical power analysis was based on an examination of treatment-time interactions in a repeated measures analysis of covariance, with adjustment for confounders. It was specified a clinically relevant difference of 2 points between each of the three treatment conditions in the change in adjusted mean of the primary measure (ISI) from pre to post intervention, with no further change at follow-up, and assumed a within-treatments SD of 4.1 points (Bastein et al., 2001). Under the assumptions of constant correlation over time, a conservatively estimated magnitude of correlation (r = 0.5) (Frison &amp; Pocock, 1992), with allowance for a design effect (Donner &amp; Klar 2000) of 1.16 due to clustering of participants within treatment groups (based on an assumed cluster size of 5-6 and a conservatively estimated intra class correlation of 0.04 (Adams et al., 2004)), with a significance level of 5% and 80% power, the projected sample size, calculated using GPower software (Faul et al., 2007) is N = 70.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to test whether Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression, and test whether an advanced form of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for insomnia and depression (CBT-I-D) produces better sleep and mood outcomes for older adults. It is expected that the advanced CBT-I-D group will produce better overall outcomes compared to the CBT-I group and control group. </summary>
