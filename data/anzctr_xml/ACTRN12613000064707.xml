  <interventions>
    <interventions>The self-management program called ACCORD will utilise the Collaborative Therapy Framework delivered by a clinical care coordinator (CLT). ACCORD is composed of three core components adapted to suit the specific needs of the carer: 
a) The framework utilises a modular format. Each module encompasses a manualised discrete skill development intervention run over 12 weeks, one hour in duration, one on one, conducted by a trained health professional, involving: health promotion, interagency collaboration, accessible support care coordinator, information about stroke and resources, understanding stress, family and community support and  caring relation to stroke. The modular format allows for tailoring of the intervention to suit the needs of carers of stroke survivors at various stages of the illness. Similarity across modules in terms of the core intervention, plus overlap between modules, enhances implementation through familiarity with the methods and style. This also addresses efficiency and cost-effectiveness with respect to training staff. 
b) Self-efficacy of the carer is a pivotal part of the process and is taught using a systematic approach to both clinicians and consumers with each module, regardless of content, delivers education, coping strategies, skills development and adaptation paradigms. This supports the philosophy that a persons illness should not be dependent on but supported by the services they need to utilise. 
c) Smooth integration from acute through to community care is paramount. Therapeutic and systemic collaboration with consumers and clinicians will be an integral part of the process. These parties will inform both the content of the group intervention and its integration into existing service structures.
Post-intervention focus groups, with clinicians (nurses, physicians, GPs and mental health workers) and with consumers will be conducted to assist in the evaluation of ACCORD. The focus groups will be for two hours facilitated by two investigators exploring the views of health professionals, carers and survivors of stroke. There will be an opportunity for the investigators to report the findings of the project as well as record the opinions and experiences of the participants. 
The individualised Collaborative Therapy program (ACCORD) will involve 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up and care coordination over a 4-year period. </interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment will include the current discharge planning that operates in the acute and subacute units of the hospital, incorporating referrals to allied health, community support and other clinically appropriate referrals. The length of treatment will vary from person to person according to the severity of their illness and treatment required. Inpatient rehabilitation is  a standard treatment option for stroke survivors but not always required.     </comparator>

    <sequence>A simple randomisation of equal number of subjects to treatment and control groups will be conducted. Patients at St Vincentâ€™s Hospital will be identified by diagnosis according to inclusion criteria and recruited over a 24-month period. After recruitment and consent to be involved in the trial the patient and carer will be randomised by computer generated number system to either the treatment or control group. Assessors and analysers of the results will be blinded to the randomisation process and will not know who is in the control or treatment group. Randomised computer generated number system to either the treatment or control group will be created.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Economic Evaluation
A full economic evaluation will occur alongside the proposed RCT. Both health outcomes and costs will be compared between groups from the perspective of the health care system. In addition to the health outcome measures, the utility measurement of quality of life of the survivor and the informal carer(s) will be assessed using AQoL-6D developed in Australia. The potential long term (life time) impact on cost and effectiveness of intervention beyond the trial period will be extrapolated using the Markov process modelling method. 
Statistical Analysis
T-tests and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to test for statistically significant difference between the treatment groups at 6 and 12 months. The control group will be used as the reference group in the ANCOVA and the p value associated with the treatment group variable will be used to determine the success of the trial. The treatment will be considered statistically significantly better than usual care if the p value is less than 0.05.The economic evaluation will use ICER (incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) and will be based on the Australian Standard of acceptance.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a disease with severe consequences for the survivor and the unexpected carer.  Carers experience tremendous changes and challenges from role reversal to financial struggle and subsequent increased burden, low mood, and poor overall health.  In Australia, there are approximately 60,000 new strokes per year; a  decrease in stroke mortality as a result of improvements in medical and surgical management mean people are living longer with the residues of stroke, and that carers increasingly face long-term burden. Eighty percent of individuals who experience stroke return home with varying degrees of neurological, behavioural and psychological symptoms. At home, they often rely on informal carers for their physical and emotional support. Previous psychosocial interventions to support informal carers of stroke survivors have shown promising results; however none have sought to integrate carer interventions with care coordination. To address this, the Australian Care Coordination program (ACCORD) has combined a 12-week individualised Collaborative Therapy with 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up and care coordination in a 4-year study. This research will assess the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of improving the mental and physical health, social connectedness and health service utilisation of the carers of stroke as well as stroke survivors. This model will be designed with the intention of being readily adapted and applied in the context of other physical and also mental diseases. The findings of this randomised control trial will investigate the impact of ACCORD on reducing carer depression, burden and emotional stress.</summary>
