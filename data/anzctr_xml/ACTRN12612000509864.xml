  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will rest in bed in a purpose built insulated room called a climatic chamber, where the temperature can be set and maintained for prolonged periods. Subjects will be studied on two separate occasions with a maximum interval of 2 weeks in between measurements. On one occasion the temperature will be 20 degrees centigrade and on another it will be 25 degrees centigrade. This is a crossover study so each participant will be studied at these two temperatures in a random order, separated by a washout period of 2 weeks. On each occasion measurements will last for approximately 4 hours. After recording baseline measurements for 1.5 hours, participants will consume a 300 ml glucose drink (75 grams of glucose in flavoured distilled water) and measurements will resume for the next 2 hours.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resting energy expenditure before and after a glucose load. This in measured by monitoring the participants expired air, by placing a transparent canopy over their head while they rest in bed. The expired air content of oxygen and carbon dioxide is measured by a special machine called the Deltatrac II, and these values are converted to rates of energy expendiure by the principle of indirect calorimetry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurements will be made at 30 min and 60 min after entering the chamber, followed by measurements every 30 min after the glucose load for a period of 2 hr. In total 6 measurements of 20 min each will be required.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Body temperature at rest and after a glucose load. In the ear hand held thermometers will record core body temperature. Surface temperatures of different locations of the body will be continuously monitored by using special ibuttons (the size of a 10 cent coin) that are attached to the body with special tape. These devices are not wired.</outcome>
      <timepoint>In the ear temperature measurements will be made at 30 min and 60 min after entering the chamber, followed by measurements every 30 min after the glucose load for a period of 2 hr. In total 6 measurements will be made. The ibuttons provide a continuous recording of surface temperature in their location.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma Adiponectin at rest and after a glucose load. Adiponectin is a protein carried in blood that has beneficial effects on human metabolism. We will collect 6 ml of blood, process and freeze the sample for measurement on completion of the trial.</outcome>
      <timepoint>60 min after entering the chamber and 2 hr after the glucose load. In total 2 measurements.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to understand how the body adapts to a mild cold temperature and whether this differs in people who have evidence of the following metabolic abnormalities: a large waist circumference, high blood fats, low "good" cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood glucose levels. We believe that those who have these abnormalities will not be able to adapt as well to a cold temperature than those without the adnormalities. This will be detected by us as a smaller rise in metabolic rate and the healthy blood protein adiponectin, both before and after a simple meal, like glucose.</summary>
