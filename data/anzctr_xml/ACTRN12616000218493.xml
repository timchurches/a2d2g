  <interventions>
    <interventions>All dancers will receive the following assessment:
Strength and flexibility characteristics: all participants will be examined by a licensed physical therapist, and the following data will be measured: range of motion of the hip, knee and ankle joints, strength and flexibility of the major muscles of the lower extremity .

Functional movement screening (FMS) TM: all participants will perform seven FMS tasks, instructed by a FMS-trained, licensed physical therapist, and be videotaped for scoring. The seven movement tasks are: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability push-up, rotatory stability. 

Neuromuscular control characteristics: the neuromuscular control characteristics of the foot and ankle complex are evaluated by:
Muscle activation pattern of the lower extremity during the FMS tasks. The muscle activity of the lower extremity major muscles will be assessed using an 8-channel FM/FM Telemetric electromyography (EMG) system (Telemyo 900, Noraxon USA, Inc., AZ, USA) during the FMS tasks (deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge).  

Morphology of the joints of the lower extremity: the orientation of the femoral neck, the relative alignment of the tibia and fibula, and the relative alignment of the talus, calcaneus, navicular, and cuboid bones will be assessed using three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI). This item will be assessed in the second year.

All assessments are carried out during a single 3 hour session

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background and purpose of the study. Dance is a unique combination of athleticism and artistry which exposes dancers to extreme physical demands and risks of injuries. Previous studies reported an injury incidence of 17% to 94% in various levels of dancers. The injury patterns reported in the literature involves the highest incidence of 40% in the lower leg, foot and ankle and the mechanisms of the dance-related musculoskeletal injuries were reported as multifactorial. Despite the extensive research on the topic of dancers foot and ankle injuries, no consensus has been reached regarding the risk factors, and effect of injuries on the neuromuscular characteristics and the lower extremity morphology; and limited evidence was available for an effective prevention and training program for dancers with foot and ankle injuries. Therefore, we plan to conduct this study firstly, to assess and compare the neuromuscular performance and morphology of the lower extremity, and compare the functional movement screening (FMS) score between young pre-professional dancers with and without ankle and foot injuries (discriminant validity of the FMS); and secondly, to determine if FMS score combined with other factors could predict the incidence and severity of dancers ankle and foot injuries; and thirdly, to examine the effect of FMS-based training program on the neuromuscular performance, FMS score, and the incidence and severity of dancers ankle and foot injuries.
Research design and method. we plan to recruit 80 young pre-professional dancers (between 15 and 25 years old) from Taipei area to compare the FMSTM score, lower extremity morphology (will be assessed in the second year of recruitment) and the neuromuscular performance (muscle activation pattern) of the lower extremity muscles in young pre-professional dancers with and without previous (within one year) foot and ankle injuries. The muscle activation patterns of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anterior, soleus, and fibularis longus will be assessed using TeleMyo 2400 G2 Telemetry Electromyography System. FMSTM score will be assessed using the following seven movements: deep squat, hurdle step, in-line lunge, shoulder mobility, active straight leg raise, trunk stability push-up, rotatory stability. 
Significance of the study. Findings of this investigation will provide valuable information for the understanding of the risk factors associated with foot and ankle dance injuries and the effect of injuries on the neuromuscular control and morphology of the lower extremity, and help to clarify the role of FMSTM on the injury prevention and training in young dancers. The data from this investigation will give clinicians, educators, trainers, and researchers excellent basis for the professional dance training, dance injury care, and further research in this field of study, and help to prevent or decrease dance injury and associated loss of young talent.</summary>
