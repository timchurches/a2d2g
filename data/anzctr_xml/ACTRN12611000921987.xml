  <interventions>
    <interventions>Baseline measurements, 8 weeks intervention programme (eight 1.5-hour FAB group treatment sessions), followed by maintenance phase of 26 weeks post-intervention. Follow-up measurements at 26 weeks post-intervention. Fanau FAB intervention is a parent-focused programme for overweight and obese children aged 5-12 years and at least one parent/primary caregiver per child participant. The intervention will be delivered by Facilitators with training, support and mentoring provided by Inspiring Limited staff. Back-up support will be provided by the Fanau FAB research team with overall oversight provided by the Study Manager. Participants will attend eight group therapy sessions. Each session will be for 1.5 hours per week. At each session, children will be engaged separately in games and FAB activities while their parents/primary caregivers will be supported with information, goal setting, tasks, and the group process of sharing their lived experiences around FAB - Food, Activity, Behaviour. Both parents/primary caregivers and children will engage in a family activity in the first half hour of each session. The content for the intervention will include: 1. Introductions, Overview, Goal setting, Relationship-building 2. Repeat Introductions, Overview, Goal setting, Relationship-building 3. Improving food/drink choices, Family Plan 4. Enhancing motivation, Reducing Sedentary Behaviour, Review Family Plan5. Modelling and family eating patterns, Review Family Plan 6. Maintaining Healthy Lifestyle Behaviours 7. Reinforce Relationships and Parenting skills.  Revisit Family Plan. 8. Preventing Relapse, Coping Strategies, Revisit Family Plan.  Upon completion of the eight weeks programme, the Fanau FAB Research Team will provide maintenance support with one home visit per family and follow-up phone calls (1 per week per family). Children and their families will also be referred to local community sports and exercise/recreation programmes. The Fanau FAB team will comprise Researchers, Paediatrician, Physical Activity Instructor. They will be supported with clinical, management and intervention programme support through study collaborators.</interventions>
    <comparator>Existing community-based clinical service, Kids in Action.  KIA is a child-focused programme for overweight and obese children aged 8 - 18 years.  The programme provides support for children and families with food choices and eating behaviours, as well as physical fitness and activities.  Exercise programmes are provided every Monday and Wednesday after school for 10 weeks at a local recreation centre with regular home visits every 2-4 weeks within 10 weeks programme i.e. approximately 2-3 home visits per family.  After the 10 weeks programme children and their families are referred to local community sports and exercise/recreation programmes.  The KIA team is made up of a nurse, paediatrician, dietician, and sports and fitness coach.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from local communities, Pacific health service providers, churches and schools.  Recruitment will be facilitated through the media and other networks.  Immediately following baseline data collection, randomisation allocation will be determined and participants will be randomly assigned to either:
Group 1: Fanau FAB intervention programme; or
Group 2: Kids in Action (KIA) programme.</concealment>
    <sequence>A stratified blocked randomisation with variable block sizes (i.e. multiple if two arms) will be used to maintain balance across important prognostic factors.  Two stratification factors will be considered: gender (female and male) and preferred ethnicity (Samoan, Tongan, Cook Island Maori, and Other Pacific).  Allocation concealment by computer up to the point of randomisation will be maintained.</sequence>
