  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>The following eligibility criteria pertain to patients enrolling into PART 2 of the study:

        Inclusion:

          -  Have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of high grade serous or Grade 2 or Grade 3
             endometrioid epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer

          -  Received at least 3 prior chemotherapy regimens. Non-chemotherapy regimens and
             maintenance therapies administered as single agent treatment will not count as a
             chemotherapy regimen

          -  Relapsed/progressive disease as confirmed by CT scan

          -  Have biopsiable and measurable disease. Note: biopsy is optional for patients known to
             harbor a deleterious gBRCA mutation

          -  Have sufficient archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue
             available for planned analyses</inclusivecriteria>
    <inclusiveminage>18</inclusiveminage>
    <inclusiveminagetype>Years</inclusiveminagetype>

    <inclusivemaxagetype>No limit</inclusivemaxagetype>
    <inclusivegender>Female</inclusivegender>
    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>Exclusion:

          -  History of prior cancers except for those that have been curatively treated, with no
             evidence of cancer currently (provided all chemotherapy was completed &gt;6 months prior
             and/or bone marrow transplant &gt;2 years prior to first dose of rucaparib).

          -  Prior treatment with any PARP inhibitor

          -  Symptomatic and/or untreated central nervous system metastases

          -  Pre-existing duodenal stent and/or any other gastrointestinal disorder or defect that
             would, in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere with absorption of rucaparib

          -  Hospitalization for bowel obstruction within 3 months prior to enrollment</exclusivecriteria>
