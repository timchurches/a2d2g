  <interventions>
    <interventions>In a double blind, randomised, controlled cross-over trial, young people with Prader Willi Syndrome will be randomly assigned to receive either an eight week course of oxytocin (Syntocinon) or placebo nasal spray, which will be followed by a two week wash out period. After the wash out period, participants will then receive the alternate version of the nasal spray, which will be administered for a further eight week period. The order of first nasal spray administration (either oxytocin or placebo first) will be randomised across participants according to codes held by the compounding chemist. Participants 16 years and over will receive a dose of 40International Units and participants under 16 years will receive a dose of 32 International Units.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo nasal spray is a solution containing all of the ingredients used in the oxytocin nasal spray except the active oxytocin. The placebo is administered in exactly the same manner as the oxytocin spray.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is characterised by symptoms such as obsessions, overeating, rage attacks, skin picking, irregular sleep breathing and temperature control, and impairments in learning and understanding social cues. Evidence from brain studies suggest that such symptoms maybe related to a deficiency of oxytocin, a natural occurring hormone derived in the hypothalamus. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of oxytocin nasal spray on improving behaviour and physical health in PWS.</summary>
