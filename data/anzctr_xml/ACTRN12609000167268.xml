If eligible they will be allocated to DHA, EPA or placebo, randomised on age, gender and GDS scores by an independent researcher who has the coding sequence for preallocated supplement numbers.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate effects of omega-3 fatty acids EPA vs DHA (1500mg per day of each, supplying total omega-3 fatty acids 1860mg and 1680mg per day, respectively) versus safflower oil placebo on cognition and mood in 120 older adults with mild cognitive impairment over 6 months at two sites, in South Australia and Queensland. We will be measuring erythrocyte fatty acid levels, cerebral blood flow and blood vessel reactivity via transcranial Doppler sonography (tcD) and carbogen (5% carbon dioxide, 95% oxgen) inhalation, telomere length as an indicator of chromosomal damage, apoE-4, homocysteine, B12 and folate (the latter in collaboration with the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA) Centre for dementia research and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Human Nutrition). At baseline we will be doing comparisons on these outcome measures with a group of 30 healthy controls in South Australia. We are also assessing relationships between social networks, physical activity and above biomarkers, and cognitive impairment.</summary>
