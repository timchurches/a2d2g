  <interventions>
    <interventions>Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed up and Go test (TUG) and Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) will be assessed among people with cerebellar ataxia. All the assessment will be prformed once and they will be video taped. The video tape will  be re-assessed by an independent researcher to determine the reliability of the scales. The scales will be correlated with each other to determine the convergent validity. Each assessment will take 60 minutes to complete. The data collection is proposed to take place for 12 months.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has been informed by three previous studies completed by the Study on Cerebellar Ataxia Balance Scales (CABS) research team: 1. A narrative review to identify the available outcome measures for the assessment of balance and postural control among people with cerebellar ataxia. 2. A systematic review to identify the psychometric properties of clinic-based outcome measures in this population. 3.   A Delphi survey to obtain experts opinion and consensus on appropriate clinic-based outcome measures for the assessment of balance and postural control among the target population. The findings of the systematic review and the Delphi survey has helped us to identify three clinic-based outcome measures that will require further testing in people with cerebellar ataxia. The outcome measures that will be tested for thier psychometric properties included Berg Balance scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and The Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). This programme of work has created a strong theoretical framework and a logical reasoning for the need for this proposed project. The current study aims at investigating the psychometric properties (reliability and validity) of appropriate minimum of three clinic-based balance outcome measures among people with cerebellar ataxia.</summary>
