    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - GSK525762

Experimental: Part 1: GSK525762 QD Cohort - Subject will be administered a 5 milligram (mg) starting dose of GSK525762, oral tablets, QD. Dose escalations will be performed in Part 1 and dose adjustments are allowed to address tolerability and safety issues. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. Separate dose escalation cohorts will be opened for subjects with AML, NHL, and MM for QD dosing. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined or until a dose of 200 mg per day is reached.

Experimental: Part 1: GSK525762 BID Cohort - Subject will be administered a starting dose of GSK525762, oral tablets, 20 mg BID (12 hours apart, total daily dose of 40 mg). Dose escalations will be performed in Part 1 and dose adjustments are allowed to address tolerability and safety issues. Thereafter, subjects will be enrolled in a standard 3+3 design. Separate dose escalation cohorts will be opened for subjects with AML, NHL, and MM, for BID dosing. Dose escalation will continue until an MTD is determined or until a dose of 200 mg per day is reached.

Experimental: Part 2: GSK525762 dose expansion cohort - After the MTD has been determined in Part1, Part 2 dose expansion cohorts will be opened for AML, NHL and MM.


Treatment: drugs: GSK525762
GSK525762 1 mg, 10 mg and 30 mg will be supplied as white to off-white, amorphous free base and white to slightly colored crystalline besylate tablets, round, biconvex tablets with no markings. GSK525762 will be administered with 240 milliliter (mL) water.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an open-label repeat dose, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK525762 given once-daily
      (QD) orally. Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2
      dose (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of
      GSK525762. Eligible subjects with select relapsed refractory hematological malignancies
      (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma [NHL]and multiple myeloma [MM]), will
      be enrolled in the QD and/or BID dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may
      continue treatment in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent. . Upon determination of the MTD, twice daily (BID) dosing cohorts may
      be opened to collect additional safety data and evaluate the preliminary efficacy of
      GSK525762 administered BID. Part 2 will explore clinical activity at the MTD or RP2D;
      separate expansion cohorts will be planned for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL, including an exploratory sub-cohort of subjects with myc and B-Cell Leukemia
      (BCL)2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements/overexpression [double- and triple-hit lymphoma]), and
      multiple myeloma (MM). This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with
      these relapsed and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies
      are anticipated to result in a durable remission.</summary>
