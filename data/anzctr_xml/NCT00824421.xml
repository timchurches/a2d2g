  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Less Than 50 Copies Per Milliliter (Copies/mL) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Ribonucleic Acid (HIV-1 RNA) at Week 48 - Plasma HIV-1 RNA level was determined by validated Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor standard assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 48</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Less Than 50 Copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 24 and 96 - Plasma HIV-1 RNA level was determined by validated Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor standard assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Less Than 400 Copies/mL of HIV-1 RNA at Week 24, 48 and 96 - Plasma HIV-1 RNA level was determined by validated Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor standard assay.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24, 48, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Log 10 Transformed HIV-1 RNA Levels at Week 24, 48 and 96 - For the log 10 scale, all the HIV-1 RNA levels were log 10 transformed prior to the average calculations. Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 24, 48, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time-Averaged Difference (TAD) in Log 10 Transformed HIV-1 RNA Levels at Week 24, 48 and 96 - TAD was calculated as area under the curve of HIV-1 RNA levels (log10 copies/mL) from baseline to the time point of interest divided by time period in weeks minus baseline HIV-1 RNA level (log10 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 24, 48, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Response as Determined Using the Time-to Loss of Virologic Response (TLOVR50) Algorithm at Week 24, 48 and 96 - TLOVR50 response is compliment to TLOVR50 failure. TLOVR50 failure based on observed HIV-1 RNA levels and failure events (death; permanent discontinuation of drug; lost to follow-up; met treatment failure [TF] criteria). TF: an increase to at least 3 times baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA level at Week 2 or thereafter; failure to achieve HIV-1 RNA level &lt;50 copies/mL at Week 24; starting at Week 2, an increase in HIV-1 RNA level to detectable levels (&gt;50 copies/mL). TF criteria's defined above were confirmed by second measurement at least 14 days after first. In 'TLOVR50', '50' denotes the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of assay (which is 50 copies/mL). Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 24, 48, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Cluster of Differentiation (CD4+) Absolute Cell Count at Week 24, 48 and 96 - Baseline value was calculated as the average of all the measurements collected prior to and including Day 1 pre-dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 24, 48, 96</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With NRTI and NNRTI Resistance-Associated Mutations (RAMs) at Time of Treatment Failure Through Week 24, 48 and 96 - Phenotypic resistance and genotypic resistance was assessed for all participants at Day 1 predose, and was evaluated for nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and non-NRTIs (NNRTIs) resistance-associated mutations at time of treatment failure using Monogram GenoSeq and/or PhenoSenseGT assays. This was then repeated for all participants with HIV-1 viral load more than 500 copies/mL at treatment failure, up to Week 96.</outcome>

Laboratory values that met the criteria of the Division of Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) grade 1 (mild, symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities) or greater were considered as abnormal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline up to Week 96 or early termination</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) of Lersivirine - Data for this outcome measure are not reported here because the analysis population includes participants who were not enrolled in this study.
