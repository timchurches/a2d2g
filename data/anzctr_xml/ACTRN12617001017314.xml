  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial with active control. This is a pilot study of physical activity (PA) behaviour change interventions with adults with mental illness. The study conditions will be: (1) Motivational intervention (MOT), and (2) Opportunity intervention (OPP). The MOT intervention will be considered the 'treatment', and the OPP intervention will be considered the 'comparator'. Details that are identical for both interventions are outlined below, followed by the MOT intervention's unique characteristics:

-Location: Both interventions will involve attending the gym facility at Lang Park Police-Citizens Youth Club (Lang Park PCYC; 40 Castlemaine St, Milton QLD). 
-Mode: Both interventions will be delivered face-to-face by a research assistant (qualification: Master of Philosophy in healthcare and health outcomes for people with intellectual disability) and a personal trainer (minimum qualifications: certificate 4 in fitness, current first aid), in groups of up to 10 participants. 
-Duration: Both interventions are delivered once/week for eight (8) weeks (total of eight contact sessions). Group sessions are 1-hr in duration (total eight hours of intervention-related contact time). Participants will be followed-up 8-weeks post-intervention (i.e. they will be reassessed on study outcomes over eight weeks after the face-to-face intervention ceases). 
-Adherence: As a pilot study, intervention adherence will be assessed as attendance to the sessions (recorded by the research assistant). 

The study interventions will differ in content, and in the targeted mechanisms of behaviour change. 
1) MOT: Motivation to increase PA will be provided through i) external feedback about PA participation from an electronic PA monitoring device (Garmin Vivofit 3; https://buy.garmin.com/en-AU/AU/p/539963) which provides real-time feedback about daily PA on the face of the device (e.g. step count, Intensity Minutes); and ii) structured, facilitated group discussions about individual PA goals, strategies for overcoming barriers, and available community opportunities (e.g. walking groups etc). Participants will be informed (verbally and in print) about the National PA guidelines of 150-300 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and encouraged to work towards meeting the guidelines. The Garmin Vivofits will be password protected so that detailed data about weekly PA intensity, sleep quality, step count, etc. can only be downloaded at group sessions (therefore normalising participant interaction with the device; e.g. not all participants may have smartphones/computers that would allow access to more detailed feedback outside the facilitated sessions). Participants will be asked to record physical activity in a diary that will be supplied to each participant. Participants will keep Garmin Vivofits for 8-weeks after the intervention for follow-up assessment to provide continued external feedback absent of the facilitation and group support. 
-The MOT intervention has a personalised component: Participants will be asked to record personal physical activity goals in week 1, and to think about strategies for reaching goals. Participants will be informed about existing community-based physical activity programs, and asked to identify any that they would like to attend, and to develop an action plan to attend (e.g. planning transport). Participants will be asked each week about their goal progression, barriers that they face to becoming physically active, and ways to work around barriers. This will be done at the face-to-face group intervention sessions, following the supplied study diaries.

-Adherence: As a pilot study, intervention adherence will be assessed as attendance to the sessions (recorded by the research assistant). 

The study interventions will differ in content, and in the targeted mechanisms of behaviour change. 
2) OPP: Opportunity to increase PA will be provided through i) local gym membership, and ii) supervised exercise instruction sessions designed to increase gym confidence and exercise knowledge. Participants will be informed about the National PA guidelines of 150-300 minutes/week of MVPA (verbally and in print), but will not be encouraged to meet guidelines, as in MOT. The exercise type will be heart-rate based aerobic exercise, combined with simple resistance exercises that follow an educational program that focuses on proper equipment use (outlined in supplied participant diaries). Participants will be provided heart rate monitors to use while attending the gym sessions. Participant gym memberships will be valid for 8-weeks after the supervised period to enable continued attendance absent of the supervision and group support. The personal trainer will provide educational instruction only, i.e. they will not engage in motivational or goal setting discussion.  
-The OPP intervention has a personalised component: Participants do not have to follow the exact exercise program set out in the participant diaries if they do not want to. The intervention is about improving exercise knowledge and gym confidence - not about prescribing an exercise protocol. Participants may be limited by previous injuries (e.g. can't do squats because of knee pain), and the personal trainer will take this into account when showing participants exercises. Participants can also request to do specific exercises if they have a preference, and the personal trainer will help them and give advice on how to exercise correctly. This will be done in the face-to-face group sessions.

    <statisticalmethods>-Primary outcomes of this pilot study are feasibility and acceptability: Intervention acceptability will be assessed qualitatively (focus groups); procedural statistics (e.g. recruitment, staff and equipment costs, attendance, withdrawal rates) will be used to assess feasibility of the trial and interventions. These analyses will be predominantly descriptive. Comparisons of feasibility of each intervention group will be performed between conditions (e.g. t-test of attendance rates). Feasibility of the PA assessments will be assessed using data management statistics, such as the number of valid days of wearing the accelerometer, and potentially over-reported PA values (identified using the data management protocol of the questionnaire). Acceptability will be assessed by asking participants to rate the perceived ease/difficulty of completing the measures on a 7-point Likert scale; results will be ranked to determine the most acceptable research measures. 

-Secondary outcomes: Physical activity adoption will be assessed by converting GENEActiv accelerometer data into time spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, light activity and moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA), using validated thresholds and algorithms. Minutes spent in MVPA (continuous variable), and the proportion of participants meeting PA guidelines (150 minutes/week of MVPA), will be compared between conditions for each week of monitor wear. Simple regression will be performed with PA adoption as DV, and psychological distress and stage of change as IVs. To assess the intervention impact on physical and mental health, the percentage change in K6 score, sleep quality, functional capacity (6MWT distance), weight, and waist circumference will be compared between conditions.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study will be a randomised controlled trial of two physical activity (PA) interventions for adults with mental illness: i) PA self-monitoring using technology (wrist-worn Garmin Vivofits, which provide real-time feedback on the face of the device), and ii) supervised exercise intervention at a community gym. As a pilot study, the primary outcomes will be 1) feasibility of the trial, and 2) feasibility and acceptability of the interventions. Secondary outcomes will be the impact on PA behaviour change (assessed using accelerometers), physical health (weight, waist, blood pressure) and psychosocial wellbeing (self-reported sleep quality and psychological distress). 

The interlinked aims of this pilot study are to: 
i)	Assess the feasibility of the trial
ii)	Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PA interventions
iii)	Compare the change in PA participation in response to interventions that either promote PA motivation, or provide PA opportunity. 

Additional aims are to assess: 
i)	The utility of the 6-min walk test, wrist-worn accelerometry, and questionnaires on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep.
ii)	The impact of the intervention on mental and physical health. 

It is hypothesised that:  
i)	The trial will be feasible to conduct on a larger scale.  
ii)	The PA interventions will be feasible to implement in the mental health service
iii)	There will be a qualitative difference in the acceptability of the interventions, dependent upon how they influence capability, opportunity and motivation to promote behaviour change. 

Inclusion criteria: 
i)	Current adult consumer of Metro North Mental Health Services (other than acute care teams) 
ii)	Aged 18-65 years
iii)	Clearance for participation from a medical professional
iv)	Willingness to provide written informed consent.
Exclusion criteria: 
i)	Diagnosed with an eating disorder (assessed by referring clinician)
ii)	Medical contraindications that preclude safe exercise participation, as per the American College of Sports Medicine absolute contraindications to exercise assessed using the Exercise and Sports Science Australia pre-exercise readiness questionnaire
iii)	Physically active, defined as more than 150 minutes/week of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA (assessed using the Active Australia questionnaire)
