  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate how 3 types of drug formulations are absorbed by the body. This
      study is termed 'open-label', which means volunteers will be aware of which treatment they
      are receiving. The study is split into 2 parts. Part 1, involves volunteers receiving 2 new
      formulations, as a single dose. There is no placebo (dummy-drug; no active ingredient) in
      this study. Volunteers will also receive a single dose of a formulation used in previous
      trials (reference formulation), so a proper comparison with the new formulations can be made.
      The new fomulations will be administered with food and the reference formulation will be
      given without food. In Part 2, volunteers will receive only one of the 3 formulations as a
      repeat dose for 7 days. Each of these doses will be given with food.</summary>
