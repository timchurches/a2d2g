  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Observe physical activity during hospital stay from day 2 of hospital admission day to day 5 or until discharged.
2. Observe physical activity for one week at home from the day of discharge.
3. Observe physical activity for one week at home at 6 weeks following the day of admission.
The overall duratio n of patient recruitment to this observational study is 7 weeks.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome is average steps per day. This will be measured by the Sensewear Pro3 armband which is a motion sensor worn on the upper arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The steps per day will be averaged over three time points being hospitalisation, the first week at home and the week at home at the six week follow-up. The difference in the average steps per day across the time points will be compared with paired t-tests.  A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Another primary outcome is average energy expenditure per day. This will be measured by the Sensewear Pro3 armband which is a motion sensor worn on the upper arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The average energy expenditure per day will be averaged over three time points being hospitalisation, the first week at home and the week at home at the six week follow-up. The difference in the average energy expenditure per day across the time points will be compared with paired t-tests.  A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Another primary outcome is time spent in greater than 3 METs activity per day. This will be measured by the Sensewear Pro3 armband which is a motion sensor worn on the upper arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The average greater than 3 METs activity  per day will be averaged over three time points being hospitalisation, the first week at home and the week at home at the six week follow-up. The difference in the average greater than 3 METs activity per day across the time points will be compared with paired t-tests.  A p-value of &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Six minute walk distance from the six minute walk test where patients are asked to walk as far as possible in six minutes on a designated track.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Six minute walk distance will be measured over two time points being day 5 of hospitalisation and at the follow up (six weeks post day of admission).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety and Depression as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Anxiety and Depression will be measured over two time points being day 5 of hospitalisation and at the follow up (six weeks post day of admission).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio will be measured by spirometry.</outcome>
      <timepoint>FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC ratio will be measured over three time points at Day 2 of hospital admission, on the day of discharge from hospital and 6 weeks post the day of admission.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dyspnoea will be measured by the MRC dyspnoea scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Dyspnoea will be measured over two time points being day 5 of hospitalisation and at the follow up (six weeks post day of admission).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>COPD impact will be measured by COPD assessment test (CAT).</outcome>
      <timepoint>COPD impact will be measured over two time points being day 5 of hospitalisation and at the follow up (six weeks post day of admission).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Armband comfort will be measured by Armband Comfort Survey</outcome>
      <timepoint>We would like participants to complete a survey to rate how comfortable and tolerable it is to use the armband device. This will be completed on discharge from hospital.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional Performance Inventory - Short Form</outcome>
      <timepoint>Day of discharge from hospital and 6 weeks post the day of admission</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obtain current physical activity levels during hospital admission and post hospital discharge in COPD patients admitted to an Australian hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD. If activity levels are shown to be reduced, this provides evidence for the need to investigate options to improve physical activity levels in hospital and once home in this group.

The hypothesis is that in people admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of COPD, physical activity will be lower during hospitalisation and will improve in the first week after discharge and improve further six weeks after hospitalisation admission.</summary>
