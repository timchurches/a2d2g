  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study is an exploratory pilot study that aims to examine whether the subjective and objective measures of withdrawal proposed are sensitive enough to discriminate withdrawal, when there is a 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1mg reduction from 2mg of Buprenorphine only sublingual tablets (SL; under the tongue), by using the measurements of withdrawal proposed below, in order to provide data for a robust power analysis for a larger study. The trial design involves a randomised 1-way crossover design in three phases over a 21-day period once participants have been transferred from 2mg once daily BNX film to 2mg once daily of Buprenorphine only SL tablets: (1) Phase 1: a baseline phase of Buprenorphine only tablet treatment (2mg equivalent dose) (7 days) followed by (2) Phase 2: a double-blind treatment (experimental) phase (7 days) where participants dose will be reduced to a minimum of 1mg through a combination of active and placebo dosing; and, (3) Phase 3 (7 days): a stabilisation phase where participants will be returned to 2mg Buprenorphine only tablets. Participants will undergo each reduction and will therefore complete Phases 2 and 3 five times during the study (taking 13 weeks to complete). We will monitor adherence by daily saliva testing throughout the experimental phase. </interventions>

      <outcome>We aim to examine whether the subjective and objective measures of withdrawal proposed (COWS, SOWS, ARCI WOW191, and pupillometry) are sensitive enough to discriminate withdrawal, when there is a 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 1mg reduction from 2mg of Buprenorphine only sublingual tablets (SL),  in order to provide data for a robust power analysis for a larger study. This is an exploratory study that aims to confirm those measures sensitive enough to enable us to conduct between group differences and to enable calculation of sample size required in future larger study, as such descriptive statistical analysis will be conducted</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Buprenorphine-Naloxone (BNX) sublingual film is the preferred preparation for buprenorphine substitution treatment of opioid dependence. However, the smallest dose available in the BNX film preparation is 2mg. Experience with buprenorphine has shown that some patients who wish to taper and cease buprenorphine find the transition from 2mg to zero difficult due to severity of withdrawal symptoms, and therefore continue in maintenance treatment (Winstock, Lintzeris, &amp; Lea, 2011). In order to investigate these concerns we propose to use Temgesic sublingual tablets which are Buprenorphine only tablets however they are available in 200 microgram (0.2mg) tablets, and as such allow for smaller dose reductions than Subutex tablets which are only available at 400 microgram (0.4mg).
This pilot study specifically aims to provide subjective and objective measures of withdrawal, when there is a 1mg reduction from 2mg of Temgesic sublingual tablets (SL), by using the measurements of withdrawal proposed below, in order to conduct a power analysis to determine the number of participants required for a larger pilot study. </summary>
