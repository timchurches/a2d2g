  <interventions>
    <interventions>A mucoperiosteal flap often needs to be raised to remove impacted lower third molar teeth.  The intervention involves the use of a pedicle flap design to raise the mucoperiosteum for lower third molar removal.  The pedicle flap is used on one randomly assigned side of the patients lower jaw for this procedure, then the control flap is used on the other side around three weeks later, or vice versa.  The order the flap designs are used in is also randomly assigned.  The pedicle flap design involves an incision placed in the buccal gingival sulcus from the mesio-buccal line angle of the first molar to the most distal visible aspect of the third molar.  Distal to the third molar the incision is extended approximately 1cm and curved towards the buccal sulcus to allow for rotation of the flap and primary closure over sound bone.  Prior to closure the gingival papilla distal to the second molar is removed and the apex of the pedicle de-epithelialised.  A lingual flap is raised in the subperiosteal plane and the lingual nerve protected using a Howarth retractor. A round surgical bur and copious irrigation was used to remove bone superior, distal and buccal to the crown of the third molar tooth.  A fissure bur was used to section the tooth if required. The tooth is then elevated and delivered and the dental follicle removed. Sterile saline irrigation of the socket was carried out to remove debris.  Interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures (3-0 polyglactin 910; Undyed Vicryl Rapide; Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA) are placed to stabilize the flap and close the extraction site to the desired degree.  Each operation takes around 20 minutes.  The participants are then followed up two and seven days after the procedure and again at six and nine months post-operatively.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator involves the use of the conventional envelope flap design to raise the mucoperiosteum for lower third molar removal.  The conventional envelope flap is used on one randomly assigned side of the patients lower jaw for this procedure, then the test flap is used on the other side around three weeks later, or vice versa.  The order the flap designs are used in is also randomly assigned.  The conventional envelope  flap design involves an incision placed in the buccal gingival sulcus from the mesio-buccal line angle of the first molar to the most distal visible aspect of the third molar.  A releaving incision is then made extended up the external oblique ridge.  A lingual flap is raised in the subperiosteal plane and the lingual nerve protected using a Howarth retractor. A round surgical bur and copious irrigation was used to remove bone superior, distal and buccal to the crown of the third molar tooth.  A fissure bur was used to section the tooth if required. The tooth is then elevated and delivered and the dental follicle removed. Sterile saline irrigation of the socket was carried out to remove debris.  Interrupted and horizontal mattress sutures (3-0 polyglactin 910; Undyed Vicryl Rapide; Ethicon, Somerville, New Jersey, USA) are placed to stabilize the flap and close the extraction site to the desired degree.  Each operation takes around 20 minutes.  The participants are then followed up two and seven days after the procedure and again at six and nine months post-operatively.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain levels were evaluated by asking the patient to mark on a visual analogue scale the level of pain they were experiencing both at rest and on maximal mouth opening.  They were also asked to record the amount of each of the prescribed analgesics they used.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and two and seven days post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Oro-facial swelling was assessed subjectively by asking participants to look into a mirror and mark on a separate visual analogue scale  the level of facial swelling they felt was present.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and two and seven days post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Trismus was assessed by measuring the maximal interincisal distance i.e. the distance between the mesio-incisal edges of the maxillary and mandibular right central incisor teeth during maximal mouth opening with a standard ruler in millimeters.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and two and seven days post-operatively.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Gingival recession was evaluated by measuring the distance from the gingiva margin distal to the second molar to the cemento-enamel junction at the distobuccal and distolingual surfaces of the second molar tooth to the nearest millimeter using a periodontal probe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and six and nine months post-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pocket depth was assessed by measuring the distance from the gingiva margin distal to the second molar to the depth of the periodontal pocket at the same two points.  The probe tip was inserted into the gingival sulcus parallel to the long axis of the tooth until slight resistance was met and the depth was measured.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and six and nine months post-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical attachment loss was then calculated by the subtraction of the gingival recession from the pocket depth measurements.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and six and nine months post-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The amount of plaque present on the second molar tooth and the gingival inflammation distal to the second molar tooth were assessed clinically using indices described by Silness et al. (1964) and Loe et al. (1963) respectively.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and six and nine months post-operative</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Participants were asked if they had suffered any sensitivity in their lower second molar tooth since the procedure.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-operative and six and nine months post-operative</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The presence/absence of dry socket/infection was clinically assessed.</outcome>

    <concealment>Participants were selected from the University of Otago, Faculty of Dentistry waiting list for extraction of lower wisdom teeth which had been assessed and required removal based on clinical and radiographic grounds.  Participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups using the logan envelope technique.  In one group the first procedure was carried out using the envelope flap design, while with the other the pedicle design was used first.  Both flap designs were then randomly allocated to either the left or right side of each participantâ€™s lower jaw again using the logan envelope technique.  The logan envelope technique involves taking two large envelopes and filling each with the same number of smaller envelopes containing equal amounts of letters.  Each letter had written on it either envelope or pedicle flap in one large envelope and left or right on the other.</concealment>
    <sequence>Sequence generation was carried out also using the logan envelope technique mentioned above.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A sample of patients was obtained from the waiting list at the the School of Dentistry with symmetrically impacted lower wisdom teeth.  The patients will receive removal of their wisdom tooth incorporating a different gum flap (incision) design randomly assigned to each side; a conventional flap or a pedicle flap design.  Post-extraction complications, including pain, swelling, delayed healing, jaw muscle spasm, gum recession and associated tooth sensitivity will be evaluated immediately after the procedure and at a subsequent review appointment. To ascertain severity of sequelae, a comparison will be made of preoperative and postoperative values and conclusions drawn from the data.  It is hypothesised that a pedicle flap will reduce the risk or severity of the above mentioned post-operative complications after lower third molar removal</summary>
