  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alsympca is an international Phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Radium-223 dichloride in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer and skeletal metastases.

The aim of the study is to compare, in patients with symptomatic HRPC and skeletal metastases, the efficacy of best standard of care plus Radium-223 dichloride versus best standard of care plus placebo, with the primary efficacy endpoint being overall survival (OS). Patients will be randomised in a 2:1 allocation ratio (Radium-223 dichloride:Placebo). The study treatment consists of 6 intravenous administrations of Radium-223 dichloride or placebo (saline) each separated by an interval of 4 weeks. The patient will be followed until 3 years after first study drug administration. Within the U.S., the trial is conducted under an IND sponsored by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. All patients received BSoC (Best Standard of Care)</summary>
