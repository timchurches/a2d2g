    <studytitle>The OPTIONS study. Evaluating a patients' decision tool (OPTIONS tool) for considering treatment choices for the elderly with end stage kidney disease.</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A pragmatic randomised controlled trial of the OPTIONS tool to measure effectiveness of this intervention in reducing decisional conflict and uncertainty for  patients' 70 years and older with a kidney function of 20mL/min or less, when choosing between dialysis or non-dialysis treatments.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a decision aid called "OPTIONS Tool" which consists of a self-administered audio workbook, audio recording and personal worksheet. The information within the booklet and audio recording is based on evidence generated from a Systematic Review the researcher has undertaken and covers specific issues such as prognosis, risk and benefits of dialysis, burden of dialysis and non-dialysis management. Once the participant has been randomised to receive the intervention they will be given a DVD, booklet and personal worksheet which they will take home to review and complete with their family. They will return in one months time (as will those who have been randomised to standard education) where a training clinician will provide counselling to ensure the decision they have made best matches their personal values. The booklet, audio recording and personal worksheet will take approximately 30 minutes to complete. There are no strategies undertaken to monitor adherence apart from review of personal worksheet at the clinic appointment with the trained clinician one month after receiving the intervention. It is anticipated that the clinic appointment at one month will take approximately 30 - 45 minutes for both intervention and standard care.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard education currently delivered to patients 70 years and over with a kidney function of 20mL/min or less. This standard education may differ between sites. The information presented to the participant may differ depending on the clinical condition of the patient and the philosophy of the clinician. At all sites there is a formalised education program including group education sessions and one-on-one sessions. There are a variety of booklets that may be given to the patients, these are available at all sites. Standard education is generalised with no targeted education to a specific age group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of the study is decision conflict and uncertainty in decision making. This is observed through recorded scores in the decision conflict scale. The decision conflict scale has been developed by Ottawa Hospital Health Research institute  to measure both decisional conflict and uncertainty. The scale has been validated in low literacy populations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>This outcome will be measured at time point 1 - one month after delivery of intervention - OPTIONS tool.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Decision as measured by Decision Regret Scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>Repeated measurement - Time point 1 - one month, Time point 2 - three months, Time point 3 - 6 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Knowledge of options and benefits and harms of these options. Measured by Knowledge questionnaire. This questionnaire was adapted from a template developed by AM OConor, Sample Tool: Knowledge (Taoxifen) Copyright 1999. Available from https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/eval_know.html. Content of this decision aid is based on best available evidence. Framework of Knowledge questionnaire has been validated.</outcome>

      <outcome>Quality of life as measured by SF-36 Vs2.1.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time point 1 - one month
Time point 2 - three months
Time point 3 - six months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preparation for decision making has been designed to assess both the patient's and clinician's perception of how useful the OPTIONS tool was in preparing them for decision making. Preparation for decision making scale will be used to measure this.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation has been undertaken based on secondary outcome 'decision regret scale'. The effect size used within this calculation was 15%. Calculations based on 90% power and a type 1 error rate (two-tailed) of 5%.  Minimum sample size is 122 patients with 61 patients for each study arm.
Data analysis conducted on intention-to-treat basis. Measurements with only one measure - mean and Standard deviations utilising unpaired t-test if normal distribution. If non-parametric then Mann-Whitney test performed.
For repeated measures - paired t test.</statisticalmethods>
