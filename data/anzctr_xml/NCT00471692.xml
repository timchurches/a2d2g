  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure. The major current debates revolve
      around laparoscopic hernia repair. The most recent Cochrane review concluded that
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair was associated with less post operative and chronic pain,
      shorter convalescence and earlier return to work when compared to open repair (McCormack K,
      Scott NW, Go PM, Ross S, Grant AM. EU hernia trialist collaboration. Laparoscopic techniques
      versus open techniques for inguinal hernia repair. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003;
      1(CD001785.). However, laparoscopic repair has not gained wide acceptance. It is more
      expensive, technically difficult for the inexperienced surgeon, is associated with rare but
      potentially more hazardous procedure related complications (Lo CH, Trotter D, Grossberg P.
      Unusual complications of laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair. ANZ
      journal of Surgery 2005 Oct, 75(10): 917 - 919.) and unlike open repair, requires a general
      anaesthetic. Critics state that laparoscopic repair is not suitable for all general surgeons
      and should be restricted to experts. Two prospective studies have shown that a longer
      laparoscopic learning curve exists when compared to open surgery. Up to 200 laparoscopic
      procedures are required to achieve a recurrence rate comparable to open mesh repair. (Bittner
      R, Schmedt CG, Schwarz J, Kraft K, Leigl BJ. Laparoscopic transperitoneal procedure for
      routine repair of groin hernia British journal of Surgery 2002 89; 1062 - 1066.) A
      meta-analysis and large multicentre randomised study have added to these concerns by
      demonstrating a higher recurrence rate with laparoscopic repair. (Memon MA, Cooper NJ, Memon
      B, Memon MI, Abrams KR. Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials comparing open and
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair. British journal of Surgery 2003; 90: 1479 - 1492.
      Neumayer L, Giobbie-Hurder, Jonasson O, Fitzgibbons R, Dunlop D, Gibbs J et al. Open mesh
      versus laparoscopic mesh repair of inguinal hernias. New England Journal of Medicine 2004;
      350: 1819 - 1827.). Over the period 1998 to 2003, in Denmark, the frequency of laparoscopic
      repair remained constant at 4.5 - 8.0%, the laparoscopic approach being used more frequently
      for bilateral hernia repairs and recurrent hernia repairs. There was a higher re-operation
      rate following laparoscopic repair of bilateral inguinal hernias compared to bilateral open
      hernia repair. (Wara P, Bay-Nielsen M, Juul P, bendix J, Kehlet H. Prospective nationwide
      analysis of laparoscopic versus Lichenstein repair of inguinal hernia. British Journal of
      Surgery 2005 92(10); 1277 - 1281.)

      Given these issues, a considerable number of adult inguinal hernia repairs will continue to
      be performed using the open technique. There is the opportunity to improve the results of
      open repair by potentially improving post operative pain and chronic pain. One method may be
      to perform an ilio inguinal nerve block. However, this procedure can be complicated by
      femoral nerve palsy, colonic or small bowel puncture and pelvic haematomas (Johr M, Sossai R.
      Colonic puncture during ilioinguinal nerve block in a child. Anesth Analg 1999 88 1051 -
      1052, Amory C, mariscal A, Guyot E et al. Is ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block always
      totally safe in children? Paediatr Anaesth 2003; 13: 164 - 166. Vaisman J. Pelvic hematoma
      after an ilioinguinal nerve block for orchialgia Anesth Analg 2001 92 1048 - 1049. Notaras
      MJ. Transient femoral nerve palsy complicating preoperative ilioinguinal nerve blockade for
      inguinal herniorrhaphy. British Journal of Surgery 1995 82: 854. Rosario DJ, Skinner PP,
      Raftery AT. Transient femoral nerve palsy complicating preoperative ilioinguinal nerve
      blockade for inguinal herniorrhaphy. British journal of Surgery 1994 81: 897. Ghani KR,
      McMillan R, Paterson-Brown S. Transient femoral nerve palsy following ilio-inguinal nerve
      blockade for day case inguinal hernia repair. J R Coll Surg Edinb 2002; 47: 626 - 629. Erez
      I, Buchumensky V, Shenhman Z, et al. Quadriceps paresis in pediatric groin surgery. Pediatr
      Surg Int 2002; 18: 157 - 158, Vironen J, Neiminen J, Eklund A, Paavolainen P. Randomised
      clinical trial of Lichtenstein patch or prolene hernia system for inguinal hernia repair.
      British Journal of Surgery 2006; 93: 33 - 39)), resulting in delayed discharge of patients.
      It also has a failure rate of 20 - 30% (Lim SL, Ng SB, Tan GM. Ilioinguinal and
      iliohypogastric nerve block revisited; single shot versus double shot technique for hernia
      repair in children. Paediatr Anaesth 2002; 12; 255 - 260.) The aim of our study is therefore
      to assess the role of ilio inguinal nerve block in adult patients undergoing primary inguinal
      hernia repair.</summary>
