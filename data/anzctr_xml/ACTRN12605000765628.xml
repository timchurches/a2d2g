  <interventions>
    <interventions>Women recruited will receive a magnesium sulphate intravenous infusion for 24 hours or until they give birth (whichever is the shorter) and will be randomised to different rates of administration of the intravenous loading infusion. 4 g magnesium sulphate over 60 minutes followed by 1 g per hour versus 4 g magnesium sulphate over 20 minutes followed by 1 g per hour.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control: 4 g magnesium sulphate administered over 20 minutes followed by 1 g per hour for 24 hours or until birth (whichever is the shorter). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of any maternal adverse effects (clinical and self-assessed) during the magnesium sulphate infusion. This includes: arm discomfort with infusion, blurred vision, confusion/drowsiness, dizziness, headache, mild nausea/vomiting, mouth dryness, muscle weakness, palpitations, sweating, warmth/flushing, other reported side effects, tachycardia, respiratory depression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of the infusion, and at completion of the infusion. </timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cessation of treatment due to adverse effects attributed to the magnesium sulphate infusion. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured throughout the infusion. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse cardiorespiratory effects of the infusion (defined as a respiratory rate &lt;16/minute, sdrop in diastolic blood pressure &gt;15mmHg, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, maternal death)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at 20 minutes and 60 minutes after the start of the infusion, and at completion of the infusion. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised clinical trial will assess whether a slower, compared with the standard infusion rate of the loading dose of magnesium sulphate, given to women at risk of very preterm birth at less than 30 weeks gestation for fetal neuroprotection, is effective in reducing maternal adverse effects of treatment.</summary>
