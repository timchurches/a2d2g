  <interventions>
    <interventions>A venous blood sample from each participant will be drawn on arrival at our research facilities. Each participant will drink 100 ml of a lactulose- mannitol solution containing 10 g of lactulose and 5 g of mannitol immediately followed by 300 ml of water. Participants will be ask to to empty their bladder on arrival and at 1.5 and 3 hours after the consumption of the lactulose-mannitol solution. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparisons of the correlation of serum endotoxin levels with permeability of the gut in healthy subjects and those with Crohn's disease. The endotoxin level will be determined using Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay. Gut permeability will be assessed by the excretion of lactulose and mannitol in urine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be drawn at the commencement of the session (prior to the ingestion of the lactulose-mannitol solution) for the determination of serum endotoxin.
The excretion of lactulose and mannitol in urine are determined three hours after the ingestion of the lactulose-mannitol solution.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>

      <outcome>Similarly, the comparisons of the correlation of serum LBP (Lipopolysaccharide- binding protein) with permeability of the gut in healthy subjects and those with Crohn's disease. LBP levels will be determined using an ELISA.
The excretion of lactulose and mannitol in urine are determined three hours after the ingestion of the lactulose-mannitol solution.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be drawn at the commencement of the session (prior to the ingestion of the lactulose-mannitol solution) for the determination of serum LBP.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparisons of the correlation of serum endotoxin level with serum LBP level in healthy subjects and those with Crohn's disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood sample for the determination of serum endotoxin and LBP level will be drawn at baseline (prior to the ingestion of the lactulose-mannitol solution).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>No published data are available that have concurrently determined the levels of serum endotoxin and the permeability of the gut to lactulose and mannitol in subjects with Crohn's disease and compared those with these in healthy control subjects. In a previous study we observed a significant difference of the rate of excretion of lactulose in 4 subjects with inactive Crohn's disease and 6 healthy controls. Published data indicate that the serum level of endotoxin and LBP are elevated by 35% and by 80%, respectively, in subjects with inactive CD compared to healthy controls. In the case of serum endotoxin levels a sample size of 15 subjects per group is needed to achieve a statistical power of 0.8. Hence, the recommended sample size is 45 women to distinguish between subject with mild to moderate Crohn's disease and subjects with inactive Crohn's disease and healthy control subjects.

All parameters in all samples will be determined in duplicates. The data will be checked for normal distribution. If it, or its residuals, are non-parametric distributed we will endeavor to render it parametric using the Johnson Transformation. Failing this, data will be compared by non-parametric statistical tests. Normally distributed data obtained from subjects with Crohn's disease will be compared with those obtained in healthy subjects by ANOVA. Statistical significance of difference will be considered when p &lt; 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the permeability of the gut in health and in Crohn's disease and the concentration of bacterial endotoxin in the systemic circulation in order to assess whether a leaky gut is accompanied with greater absorption of bacterial products e.g. endotoxin. </summary>
