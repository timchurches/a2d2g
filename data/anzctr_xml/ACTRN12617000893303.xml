  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This will be a double blind randomised placebo controlled study in 24 subjects with Ross River virus induced arthralgia.

Rationale
PPS is a semi-synthetic heparin like macromolecular carbohydrate that resembles glycosaminoglycans. It has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties in the treatment of interstitial cystitis. PPS also has fibrinolytic, lipolytic, and anticoagulant properties and is used for the treatment of thromboembolic prophylaxis in Europe. In Germany and Hungary, PPS is also approved in oral and injectable form for the treatment of peripheral arterial occlusive disease. 

In a recent study in mice with Ross River virus induced joint disease, PPS administered for 10 days post infection significantly reduced the severity of joint symptoms, with reductions in joint swelling, inflammation in joints and muscle, and serum levels of mediators of inflammation which are implicated in the disease. PPS treatment also demonstrated a joint cartilage protective effect, with preservation of the thickness and structure of the joint cartilage.

On the basis of this research, Paradigm intends to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PPS treatment in human patients affected by joint symptoms following Ross River viral infection

The main inclusion criteria for the study will be:
1.	Males and females aged 18  to 65 years (inclusive)
2.	Confirmed diagnosis of Ross River virus infection based on laboratory definitive diagnosis 
3.	Clinical symptoms of Ross River virus infection including a minimum 2 joints involved 
4.	The onset of RRV infection symptoms minimum 12 weeks and maximum 36 weeks prior to Day 1

Treatment Intervention
Patients will be randomised 2;1 to receive either PPS or placebo respectively.
Dose schedule: 2 mg/kg administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly for 6 weeks.  Treatments will be given by medically qualified site staff, and patients will be evaluated and monitored at the regular visits during the study.

Objectives
The primary objective will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) in subjects with Ross River virus (RRV</summary>
