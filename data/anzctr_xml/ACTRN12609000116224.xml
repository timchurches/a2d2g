  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A potential treatment for some blood cancer types is high dose therapy with stem cell transplantation. Stem cells are normally found in the bone marrow. Stem cells are collected from your bone marrow by mobilising them into the blood stream. An apheresis machine removes blood from a vein in your arm or chest, collects off the stem cells and then returns the rest of your blood back to your vein. The collected stem cells are frozen and stored for later use.
At the time of transplantation, a high dose of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy would be given, and your frozen stem cells thawed and injected into your body (similar to a blood transfusion). These stem cells can help your bone marrow recover from the high dose therapy.

Stem cells are usually mobilised from the bone marrow into the bloodstream using daily or twice-daily injections of a drug called Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF), or filgrastim (Neupogen). This usually requires 6-10 days of injections. This project aims to test the combination of Mozobil® (a new agent for stem cell collection) with Neulasta® (a single dose, long-acting version of filgrastim) in the hope that it will produce better yields of stem cells in a shorter time with fewer injections.</summary>
