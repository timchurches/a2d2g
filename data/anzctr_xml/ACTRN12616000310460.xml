  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will consume a controlled diet provided by the experimenters for 10 weeks. The diet will provide 1.6 g/kg/day of protein and will meet energy needs for each participant based on the Harris-Benedict equation. The diet will also consist of approximately 30% fat and 50% carbohydrate. Participants will be asked to record any food not consumed in a food diary. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will consume a controlled diet provided by the experimenters for 10 weeks. The diet will provide 0.8 g/kg/day of protein and will meet energy needs for each participant based on the Harris-Benedict equation.  The diet will also consist of approximately 30% fat and 60% carbohydrate. Participants will be asked to record any food not consumed in a food diary. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Two way ANOVA with diet as a between subject factor and time as a within subject factor will be used.  A total of 30 subjects with 15 subjects each in the 2 treatment arms will be required to achieve a power of 80% and a significance of 5% for the comparison between treatment and control arms. These calculations are based on the variance in appendicular muscle mass (as measured by DXA) from (Gregorio, et al., 2014), effect size was also based on an extrapolation of these data. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>40 healthy men age 70+ years old will be randomized to consume a weight maintenance diet containing either 0.8 or 1.6 g/kg/day of protein for 10 weeks. Muscle size, strength, lean body mass, physical function (SPPB and timed up and go), insulin sensitivity and gut microbiome composition will be measured before and after the 10 week dietary intervention period. Muscle fibre size will be measured via muscle biopsies taken before and after the intervention period.     </summary>
