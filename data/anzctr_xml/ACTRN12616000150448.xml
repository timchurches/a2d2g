  <interventions>
    <interventions>On presentation, participants will complete a questionnaire including 1) The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), 2) The World Health Organisation Quality of life - Bref Questionnaire, and 3) their pelvic pain levels in the last 3 months. All clinical decisions regarding management will be independent of study questionnaires. Follow-up questionnaires at 6 monthly intervals will be sent. We will recruit for 18months, and the study will conclude follow-up at a minimum of 36 months for each patient. The follow-up period is based on an attrition rate of 30% (gauged from original pilot data). Data will be analysed at each 12-month point - if clinically significant outcomes are determined, the option of gaining ethics for an extension of the follow-up period will be explored.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study aims to clarify factors that impact on outcomes for women presenting with persistent pelvic pain (PPP). We are utilising a specifically devised questionnaire, which incorporates Likert-scales for determining 5 facets of pelvic pain - dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, dyschezia, dysuria and chronic (non-cyclical) pelvic pain, as well as overall patient satisfaction assessment. Also, the WHO QOL-Bref and Pain catastophisation scores (PCS) will be employed.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be collected at 6-monthly intervals, and entered into the confidential database. We plan statistical analysis to be performed using the STATA Data Analysis and Statistical Software (STATACorp, USA, Version 13). A p-value &lt; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all comparisons. Association between variables will be analysed using appropriate correlation tests and logistic regression models. 
A pilot project was conducted for 12months, to assess the feasibility for the project design, as well as to determine numbers and attrition rates. Approximately 35-40 patients are eligible for inclusion each month. Only 70% of these attend clinic, the remainder are unable to be recruited. Of these, approximately 28-30 are recruited each month, giving an overall recruitment rate of ~70%. At 6month, of those that we have approached for followup, we have a 60% response rate. We aim to improve this with repeat patient contact. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>AIMS: This study aims to clarify factors impacting upon outcomes in women presenting with persistent pelvic pain (PPP). The study team are keen to understand whether there are specific features of the woman, including the type and severity of the pain, the duration of these symptoms, or her response to her pain, that might influence or predict her outcome and thus potentially allow selection of the most appropriate therapeutic approach for specific patient characteristics.

METHODS:
Pelvic pain is the most common indication for referral to the outpatient gynaecology clinic. Information regarding this study, including study information, consent, and questionnaires regarding symptoms, quality of life(QoL), pain catastrophisation scale(PCS), will be sent to patients at the same time as their appointment information. 

On arrival at their first appointment, the research assistant will approach the prospective participants to ensure that initial paperwork and questionnaires were received, and offer the opportunity for questions. If the patient agrees to participate and has not completed the questionnaires they will be encouraged to do so whilst waiting. Consent to access patient data from medical records will also be sought. All clinical decisions regarding management will be independent of study questionnaires. Clinicians, who with the patient, decide that surgery for the PPP is warranted, will be asked to complete a brief survey regarding the factors influencing this decision.

Follow-up questionnaires at 6 monthly intervals will be sent (either electronic, utilising survey monkey, or in paper format with reply paid envelopes, depending on patient preference). The pilot study will conclude at a minimum of 36 months. Patient questionnaires will take 15-30minutes.
