  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Immune function will be assessed using infant mononuclear cells cultured in serum free medium, either alone or in the presence of food allergens, inhalant allergens or bacterial antigens or mitogens (PHA). Cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, TNF and IFN-gamma) will be measured in the supernatants after 48 hours. This will include a range of cytokines to assess the pattern of cellular response to these stimuli (above), including production of T helper cell type 1 (Th1) cytokine (IFN-gamma), pro-allergic Th2 cytokines (Il-5 and IL-13),  regulatory cytokines (IL-10) and an inflammatory cytokines (IL-6). Cytokines will be measured by Luminex multiplexing technology (Austin, Texas, USA).</outcome>

      <outcome>Sensitisation to food and aero allergens. The child will have allergy skin prick testing (SPT) to determine sensitisation status to common food (wheat, egg, cow's milk, peanut, cashew nut, fish) and aeroallergens (rye grass pollen, cat and house dust mite {D. pteronyssinus}) with histamine and control solutions in accordance with standard clinical methods as outlined in the 2009 ASCIA Skin Prick Testing for the Diagnosis of Allergic Disease: A manual for practitioners.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Allergies have been on the rise in Australia, and evidence suggests vitamin D may play a role. Vitamin D has been shown to influence the immune system and has been linked to asthma, eczema and food allergies. This study will help determine whether vitamin D supplements given to infants will alter the risk of development of allergic disease.</summary>
