  <interventions>
    <interventions>Study participants receiving the intervention (i.e. those in the Interdisciplinary Care Group  ICG) will be managed using Wagners Chronic Care Model as the guiding framework. All participants in the intervention arm will receive smoking cessation support. Participants with FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 (diagnosed with COPD) will receive the Lung Foundation of Australia (LFA) booklet Better Living with COPD  A Patient Guide and will be managed according to the COPD-X Plan. The intervention will be led by a practice nurse or a research pharmacist, a consultant pharmacist (accredited to undertake medication reviews) and a physiotherapist. These staff will work in collaboration with practice GPs. Health professionals involved in the project will be offered training. Supporting smoking cessation: a guide for health professionals and COPD-X will form the basis of all interventions. 
The key components of the intervention include intensive smoking cessation support, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation and home medication review. Participants will be followed up for a total of 12 months  the components of the above intervention will be implemented (subject to patient consent) if appropriate and as required throughout this time period.

Smoking cessation support:
Intensive smoking cessation support for participants will be coordinated by the practice nurse/research pharmacist and/or consultant pharmacist. QUIT (Registered Trademark) Resources and the assistance of other staff such as GPs, nurses and dieticians will be used, where appropriate. Pharmacotherapy (over-the-counter and/or prescription) will be recommended, if appropriate. If prescription medications are required to assist smoking cessation, these will be discussed with the GP. The intervention(s) offered will be individually tailored to the patients needs and preferences - as such, the duration of the smoking cessation support consultation between the above mentioned study staff (practice nurse/research pharmacist and/or consultant pharmacist) and the participants will vary according to the specific needs of the individual participant. Follow up phone calls to participants will be conducted one week and one month from initial consultation (i.e. at baseline) to re-emphasise the importance of quitting and long-term abstinence, and to discuss issues surrounding relapse and relapse prevention strategies. A standard question asked in the six and 12-month follow-up questionnaire will be utilised to monitor participants adherence to the smoking cessation strategies recommended. 

Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation:
A home-based pulmonary rehabilitation model will be employed. Key components of this model include one home visit with weekly follow-up telephone calls using a motivational interviewing approach to build confidence and set goals. Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation will be prescribed based on each patients exercise capacity. A goal for walking distance will be set and distance will be recorded using a pedometer. Participants will be encouraged to exercise for 30 minutes, five times per week and to record the completion of this activity in a home diary. Resistance training for the arms and legs will utilise daily activities and equipment that is readily available in the home environment (e.g. step-ups on an internal or external step, sit to stand from a standard height chair, water bottles for upper limb weights). Participants will be contacted by a physiotherapist each week by telephone for seven weeks. During the weekly telephone calls, disease specific self management training and exercise progression will be achieved using the principles of motivational interviewing. Exercise goals and health goals will be discussed and documented each week in the home diary. The duration of the home visit and weekly follow-up phone calls will vary between participants as these components are driven by and individually tailored to each participant's needs.

Home medication review:
A comprehensive home medication review from a consultant pharmacist will identify any medication-related problems and deviations from COPD-X guidelines. Recommendations regarding amendments to drug therapy will be discussed between the GP and consultant pharmacist with changes made as appropriate. The pharmacist will assess medication use of participants, including inhaler technique. Interventions for optimising medication adherence and inhaler use will be offered.
Participants who receive the home medication review will be asked to complete a questionnaire to assess satisfaction with this component of the intervention. GP feedback on each home medication review conducted will also be sought by asking them to complete a questionnaire at the time of submission of the report.</interventions>
    <comparator>Patient participants in the control arm (i.e. in the usual care group  UCG)  will receive usual care and Quitline referral; those with FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7 (diagnosed with COPD) will receive the Lung Foundation of Australia (LFA) booklet Better Living with COPD  A Patient Guide. 

GP participants in the control group practices will receive a copy of the COPD-X Plan and the Supporting Smoking Cessation: a guide for health professionals.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>1.	Recruitment of practices and practice staff: Primary care clinics will be invited to participate in the study through advertisements and consultation with Medicare Locals/Primary Health Networks (PHNs) and key informants. Other methods of recruitment such as direct approach may be employed if necessary. Both group and solo primary care practices that have a practice nurse/pharmacist or are willing to accommodate a practice nurse / research pharmacist will be targeted.

2.	Cluster Randomisation: General Practice/primary care clinics will be block randomised to control (Usual Care Group = UCG) or intervention (Interdisciplinary Care Group = ICG). Randomisation at the practice level will avoid contamination (i.e. the same practice managing patients from both control and intervention groups). A web-based randomisation program managed by an independent agency will be utilised for this allocation process.

3.	Recruitment of participants: The General Practice’s clinical database will be searched to identify eligible patients, who will then be invited to participate in the study. Practice receptionists may be trained in identifying eligible patients. Other methods of recruitment such as GP referrals may be employed if necessary. Signage and pamphlets will also be used within clinics to encourage participation. Letters with an Expression of Interest (EOI) form will be sent from the practice to eligible patients formally inviting them to take part in the study. A toll-free number will also be set-up and made available for interested patients to call and obtain further information regarding the study if desired. Those interested in the study will be asked to return the completed form to the practice nurse/research pharmacist in a reply-paid envelope. Non-respondents will be sent up to two reminders at two-weekly intervals. Following receipt of the EOI, each potential participant will be contacted, inclusion/exclusion criteria applied, a meeting with the practice nurse/research pharmacist will be organised, written informed consent obtained and baseline data collected.

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample Size: 
Change in SGRQ score from enrolment is the primary efficacy end point. A difference of at least 4 points between treatment arms is considered clinically significant. Assuming a conservative standard deviation of 10 points, 99 participants per group (80% power and p &lt; 0.05) will be required. Adjusting for clustering by practice (intra-class correlation=0.01 and cluster size 10), the required sample is 108 per arm. Allowing for attrition of 20% after enrolment, we will continue recruiting until 280 (140 in each arm) participants have entered the trial. Therefore, 28 primary care practices will be recruited and 14 each randomised to ICG and control. From each practice, 50 smokers will be screened to identify 10 with COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt;0.7). A sample of 1400 smokers would allow the proportion of COPD patients to be estimated to be within +/-2% approximately with a 95% confidence interval from 18% - 22%. 700 smokers in each arm would allow a difference of 6% points in abstinence rates to be detected (e.g. 12% in control versus 18% in intervention) with 86% power and p &lt; 0.05 significance level.

Statistical Analyses: 
The mean change in SGRQ from enrolment in each treatment group will be estimated. Difference between groups and 95% confidence interval will be determined. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to compare continuous outcomes between the two groups. Binary outcomes will be analysed using multiple logistic regression. All regression analyses will be adjusted for clustering, prognostic variables and potential confounders (e.g. socio-demographics, comorbidities). All primary analyses will be conducted using the intention to treat principle. Participants who are lost to follow-up will be deemed to have relapsed smoking at that point. Per protocol analysis will also be undertaken to provide a measure of reliability of the primary analyses.

Cost-effectiveness Analysis (CEA): 
CEA of the study will be conducted according to the good research practices of CEA alongside clinical trials. A cost-utility analysis will also be undertaken utilising EQ-5D.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RADICALS is an interdisciplinary model of care that brings together the expertise of different health professional groups to provide a solution for a major public health problem, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This community-based model mainly surrounds interdisciplinary collaboration to deliver intensive smoking cessation support, COPD management according to COPD-X guidelines, home medication review and a home-based exercise/self-management program. 
This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the RADICALS program in reducing the burden of smoking and COPD through: 

(a) increasing the detection of COPD among long-term smokers, 
(b) improving the effectiveness of smoking cessation care provided in general practices; and 
(c) improving health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of people with COPD. 

It is hypothesised that: 

(a) A general practice-based screening program among smokers will result in early identification of COPD
(b) Interdisciplinary care will result in higher abstinence rates at 6 months than Quitline referral among smokers; and 
(c) Among people with COPD, interdisciplinary care will maintain HRQoL better than usual care at 6 months
