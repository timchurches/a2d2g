Experimental: MSC1936369B Regimen 1 - Orally once daily on Days 1 to 5, 8 to 12 and 15 to 19 of a 21-day cycle.

Experimental: MSC1936369B Regimen 2 and Regimen 2 Food Effect - Orally once a day on Days 1 to 15 of a 21-day cycle.
Orally once a day from Day 1 to 21.

Experimental: MSC1936369B Regimen 3 once daily - Orally once a day from Day 1 to 21.

Experimental: MSC1936369B Regimen 3 twice daily - Orally twice a day from either Days 1 to 15 of a 21-day cycle (similar to Regimen 2) or up to Day 21 (similar to Regimen 3).


Treatment: drugs: MSC1936369B
MSC1936369B will be administered to subjects at a dose of 1 to 120 milligram (mg) at escalating dose levels once daily up to 2 cycles (Each cycle of 21 days) and if the subject will be treated beyond 2 cycles the treatment continues until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity or investigator/subject decision.

Treatment: drugs: MSC1936369B
MSC1936369B will be administered to subjects at a dose of 1 to 255 mg at escalating dose levels once daily up to 2 cycles (Each cycle of 21 days) and if the subject will be treated beyond 2 cycles the treatment continues until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity or investigator/subject decision.

Treatment: drugs: MSC1936369B
Subjects in the regimen 2 food effect cohort will be sequentially assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the fed/fasted sequence or fasted/fed sequence for Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2. Subjects will be administered with MSC1936369B at a dose of 90-150 mg at escalating dose levels once daily up to 2 cycles (Each cycle of 21 days) and if the subject will be treated beyond 2 cycles the treatment continues until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity or investigator/subject decision.

Treatment: drugs: MSC1936369B
MSC1936369B will be administered to subjects at a dose of 60 to 90 mg at escalating dose levels once daily up to 2 cycles (Each cycle of 21 days) and if the subject will be treated beyond 2 cycles the treatment continues until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity or investigator/subject decision.

Treatment: drugs: MSC1936369B
MSC1936369B will be administered to subjects at a dose of 45 to 75 mg at escalating dose levels once daily up to 2 cycles (Each cycle of 21 days) and if the subject will be treated beyond 2 cycles the treatment continues until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity or investigator/subject decision.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of subjects experienced at least a Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) over the first cycle - Day 1 to 21 - DLT was defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0 (CTCAE), as any of the following toxicities at any dose level and judged to be possibly or probably related to the trial medication by the investigator and/or the sponsor: any Grade 3 or more non-haematological toxicity excluding: Grade 3 asymptomatic increase in liver function tests reversible within 7 days for subjects without liver involvement, or Grade 4 for subjects with liver involvement. Grade 3 vomiting if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal therapy (e.g. 5HT3 antagonists and corticosteroids). Grade 3 diarrhoea if it is encountered despite adequate and optimal anti diarrhoea therapy. Any Grade 4 neutropenia of &gt; 5 days duration or febrile neutropenia lasting for more than 1 day.
