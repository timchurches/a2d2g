    <interventions>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as short-term prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in people who have close familial contact with the disease. The study is observational only.

The recommended adult dosage for oseltamavir for prophylaxis is 75mg once daily for ten days.  Zanamivir prophylaxis consists of two 5mg doses (inhalations) once daily.  Zanamivir can be either inhaled or is available intravenously.  This protocol does not stipulate the dose or duration to be given to subjects, this will be determined by the treating physician and may differ to that normally indicated due to the pandemic environment.  This study is observational only.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis.

 All data will be collected on electronic case report forms.  Data includes collection of laboratory and adverse event results to assess evidence of pandemic influenza.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One month</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seroconversion to pandemic influenza.
The participant is examined by a physician at each visit and all laboratory and adverse events are documented on an electronic case report form.  At the end of the study the two drugs will be statistically compared to assess effectiveness in relation to seroconversion and adverse events. 
All (any) adverse events thought to be related to the NA inhibitor prophylaxis will be collected.  These may include gastro-intestinal upsets, fatigue, sneezing, nausea, rash, basically any event that occurs post-prophylaxis that cannot be definitely ruled out as having a causal relationship.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors as short-term prophylaxis against pandemic influenza infection in people who have close familial contact with the disease. The study is observational only. The primary measure used in this study will be the incidence of symptomatic pandemic influenza in patients receiving prophylaxis. Seroconversion to pandemic influenza, the incidence of adverse events and the relative effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis will also be examined. This project will commence upon pandemic influenza being declared in Australia, Hong Kong or Singapore. Data will be analysed as quickly as possible to help inform the continued use of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy as a cornerstone of the public health agency response to pandemic influenza.</summary>
