  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend the clinic at 2 times points for approximately 6 hour visit, with a 1 week wash out period between treatments. They will be asked to eat a meal, which will be comprised of regular foods (chicken, bread and salad) plus 40g of either palmolein oil or control oil, offered in a randomised order. they will have 15 minutes to consume the meal. the meals will contain  30% energy from protein,  58% energy from fat and  11% energy from carbohydrate. total energy content of the test meals is ~2800kJ.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The aim of the study is to compare blood vessel elasticity after two protein-rich meals which are high in either olive oil or palmolein. 

Diameter of the brachial artery of the right arm will be measured with participants laying supine using high-resolution external vascular ultrasound at baseline and during reactive hyperaemia (endothelium-dependent vasodilation).The diameter of the artery will be measured from two dimensional B-mode ultrasound (Accuson Aspen Duplex) images at the centre of the brachial artery, identified when the clearest picture of the anterior and posterior intimal layers is obtained. For the production of reactive hyperaemia, a sphygmomanometer cuff will be placed around the mid-point of the forearm and inflated to a pressure of 200 mmHg for 5-min. The arterial diameter will then be scanned every 30 sec for two min after the cuff is deflated, with the difference between the baseline scan diameter and the maximal diameter in response to the release of occlusion (expressed as a percentage of the baseline diameter) providing a measure of endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilatation.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The study also aims to compare the effect of these test meals on a suite of blood markers of heart health (VCAM, ICAM, E-Selectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (total) nitrotyrosine, tissue plasminogen activator). </outcome>
