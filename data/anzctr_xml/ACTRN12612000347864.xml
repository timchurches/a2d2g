  <interventions>
    <interventions>High intensity humidifier machine(AIRVO), which is currently in clinical use, will be used for nocturnal humidification in patients with pSS.The humidifier device gives warmed and humidified air to the participant through a mask.This device will be used overnight, on the study night during sleep.The patient will have a sleep study performed on this night and the subjective quality of sleep will be assessed next day. Following this there will be a washout period of 1 week. After 1 week the cross over trial will be performed.The sleep study and subjective sleep quality will be assessed during the cross-over trial.
Overall, this study involves use of the humidifier device for 1 night , by each participant who is involved in the study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excessive dryness of mouth and throat, occurs in patients with Sjogrens Syndrome. This could result in sleep disturbance and predispose to obstructive sleep apnea. A previous study has reported that nocturnal humidification (moistening the mouth and throat at night) improved mouth dryness and decreased sleep disturbance. It might be possible therefore to improve sleep apnea and sleep quality in patients with Sjogrens Syndrome by using special mask and device which will deliver humidified air and
keep mouth and throat moistened, during night.Our aim is to find out the usefulness of nocturnal humidification (giving humidified air through a mask during sleep at
night) in improving sleep apnea and sleep quality in patients with Sjogrens Syndrome.</summary>
