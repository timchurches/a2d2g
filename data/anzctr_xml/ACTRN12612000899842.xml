  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective observational study. All patients with a severe brain injury and intracranial pressure monitoring will be included. Blood alone ( ARM 1 ) or blood and cerebrospinal fluid ( ARM 2) will be collected on days 1, 3, 5 and 7. Arm 1 - Sampling of Plasma (patients with ICP monitoring via Codman indwelling transducer)
Arm 2 - Sampling of CSF and Plasma (patients with an external ventricular drain). Values will be compared with those from historical controls who healthy age and gender matched patients having subarachnoid anaesthesia and who have provided us wth their CSF</interventions>
    <comparator>There will be a direct comparison of concentrations of these compounds in blood between the two groups. As CSF will only be collected in one group, we will use historical controls, whose data we have already published. We propose to examine changes over time of these compounds.
The control samples were taken from healthy age and gender matched patients having subarachnoid anaesthesia and who have provided us wth their CSF</comparator>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Plasma and CSF samples will be subjected to GC-MS/ HPLC analysis to determine concentrations of Isoprostanes, Isofurans and Neuroprostanes. We will use satistical methods to examine the correlation between plasma and CSF samples and their predictive utility in terms of outcome.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Measurement of neuroprostane and isofuran levels in plasma and CSF may give prognostic information in traumatic brain injury.  The study aims are: 1) To establish the correlation between plasma and CSF levels of these markers in a population of severely brain injured patients and 2) To establish correlation between neuroprostane and isofuran levels and outcome as measured by glasgow outcome score and anterograde amnesia score.</summary>
