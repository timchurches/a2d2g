  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children will be randomised to receive either inhaled corticosteroids or placebo. Children allocated to the intervention group will receive 250 micrograms fluticasone propionate twice daily for two weeks, delivered via metered dose inhaler and spacer (with or without mask, depending on age and technique).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of children with good response to inhaled corticosteroid treatment. Good response is defined as an improvement in cough verbal category descriptive score of greater than or equal to 1 for at least 3 days compared to baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Endpoint of study medication is day 14. Cough verbal category descriptive score to be assessed daily for the 14 days of study medication. Timepoint for primary outcome is during the 14 day study treatment regime.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potential participants will be screened upon presentation to the emergency department or outpatient clinic and invited to participate. Following provision of written informed consent by the parent/guardian, children will be randomly allocated to either inhaled corticosteroid or placebo. Allocation will be performed by a hospital pharmacist external to the research project and concealed in sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation sequence, stratified by age and using permuted blocks of variable block sizes will be generated and maintained by a statistician external to the research project. Children will be allocated the next available independent sequential study number within the appropriate age stratification (&lt;=6 and &gt;6 years). The allocation is fully concealed from all investigators.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will help us answer the question: should children with chronic cough be given inhaled corticosteroids to promote faster recovery and improve ability for children to return to their normal daily routines? This study will also evaluate whether fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels can predict short term response to inhaled corticosteroids in children with chronic cough. We hypothesise that a short (two week) course of inhaled corticosteroids will reduce cough severity in children with chronic cough, and that FeNO measurements can be used to predict this response.</summary>
