  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary Objective : Compare the risk of occurrence of Grade3-4 cumulative peripheral sensory
      neuropathy (PSN) relative to cumulative dose of oxaliplatin between treatment group and
      placebo group.

      Main Secondary Objective : Compare the response rate (RR) between treatment group and placebo
      group in order to ensure that the efficacy of the chemotherapy is not compromised by the
      addition of xaliproden to the chemotherapeutic regimen.

      Other Secondary Objectives : study of the neurotoxicity parameters (Duration of
      oxaliplatin-induced PSN (G2,3,4); overall incidence of PSN during treatment; dose of onset of
      PSN ; incidence of dose-reduction and dose delay due to PSN; incidence of oxaliplatin
      treatment discontinuation due to PSN; change in Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)) ; study of
      the safety profile (other than PSN) ; study of the chemotherapy efficacy (progression free
      survival, overall survival).</summary>
