    <studytitle>WorryTime: A randomized controlled trial comparing smartphone and paper and pencil delivery of worry postponement in young Australians aged 16-25 years</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In a sample of young Australians aged 16-25 years, does smartphone delivery, compared with paper and pencil delivery of the stimulus control technique of worry postponement, improve engagement with and ease of use of the technique and thereby improve levels of worry to a greater extent?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will be asked to use the stimulus control technique of worry postponement via a smartphone application called WorryTime for 7 days. The technique invites users to postpone worries they experience during the day and worry about them at a set time period each day, usually in the evening. During the day users make a brief note of their worry in the application and then attempt to continue with what they were doing. When the designated worry time arrives (the application provides a reminder alarm), the user reviews the list of worries generated during the day. Worries that no longer bother the user can be dismissed (via a swipe action on the application), allowing them to focus their attention on the remaining active worries. Users are encouraged to engage in problem solving to assist them during their scheduled worry time. When the worry time window elapses (time period is set by the user), users are again encouraged to continue with their day.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group will be asked to use the same worry postponement technique for 7 days, but using the traditional method of a paper and pencil diary. Participants in this group will record worries by hand in their diary and also to participate in the scheduled worry time (no reminders provided). They are asked to cross out any worries that are no longer bothering them and focus on the active worries, as in the intervention group.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to compared two methods of delivery for the stimulus control technique of worry postponement; the traditional paper and pencil diary method or a novel smartphone application 'WorryTime' method. The study will examine whether using the technique on a mobile phone platform increases the frequency and duration of use of the technique and improves the effectiveness of the technique, as compared with the traditional paper and pencil methods. Additionally the study aims to explore user satisfaction, acceptability and usability of the smartphone application compared with the paper and pencil diaries. Two hundred young adults (aged 16-25 years) will be recruited to the study via Facebook and asked to use the worry postponement technique for 7 days. </summary>
