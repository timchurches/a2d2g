  <interventions>
    <interventions>Fast track protocol consist on
1. preoperative counselling consists of two sessions of 5 minutes duration each: the first after examination and qualification a patient for the appendectomy, and the second before signing a consent

2. early postoperative oral feeding commenced 6 hours after operation and gradually increased from 30 ml of fluids every hour to solid diet as tolerated by a patient
3. opioid-sparing analgesia (paracetamol started 1g per rectum applied immediately after operation and followed by oral 1g 6-8 hourly + indomethacin oral, 25mg 8 hourly, pethidine parenterally, 1mg per kilogram of body weight only if needed as a rescue analgesia

Patients were discharged when passed flatus or stools and tolerate solid diet, and had no complications requiring hospitalization. Patients were observed in the study until discharge from the hospital and were followed up on 7th postoperative day for complications.</interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional care protocol (control)
1. postoperative fasting until the patient passes first flatus or stools, or bowel sounds could be heard
2. opioid-based analgesia: pethidine parenterally, 1 mg per kilogram body weight until the patient resumes oral diet</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of the study: to determine if fast track care protocol which consists on early postoperative oral feeding and opioid-sparing analgesia is safe, feasible and beneficial. Based on the earlier studues on fast track protocol after colorectal surgery we hypothetized that it will safe and beneficial after appendectomy</summary>
