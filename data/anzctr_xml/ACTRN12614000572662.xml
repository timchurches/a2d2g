  <interventions>
    <interventions>- Intervention A: Patient directed group education program (discussion based) consists of one 2 hour session weekly for 6 weeks (patient directed with some prompts if patients go completely off topic). Patients will be encouraged to discuss topics relating to their diabetes such as how they feel about their diagnosis, their diet and physical activity, hypoglycaemia, and self care activities. Intervention A will be facilitated by an accredited practising dietitian (APD) (the primary researcher). The focus will be on discussion based activities, goal setting and patient-centered care.

    <statisticalmethods>Changes over time will be analysed using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. P&lt;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.
The qualitative interviews, which are based upon a series of open ended questions, will be transcribed verbatim by the student researcher. The transcribed text will be read several times and discussed by the research team. Data analysis will be completed manually and independently by all three researchers who will systematically code the data using inductive coding to label the data regardless of previous theory. The data will then be analysed using thematic content analysis and seeking patterning of responses. The analytical themes will be derived on the basis of the analysis. The data obtained from these interviews will be grouped and the similarities and differences between the groups will be assessed. This research is of a descriptive nature, and an interpretive approach will be used in the data analysis.
Sample size calculations (using figures from previous published research) indicate that 22 participants are required to achieve statistical significance. It is assumed that retention of group participants will be below 100%, hence the aim of recruiting 30 participants per group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This intervention study will evaluate a discussion-based, patient directed group education program for the management of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The potential benefits of this research for the researchers and other health professionals in the field, include an improved understanding of how best to educate type 2 diabetes patients in a group setting. Additionally, the impact of group interactions and patient-directed or patient-centred care will be assessed. The potential benefits for the participants include an improved understanding of type 2 diabetes, lifestyle improvements, and improvements in self-management behaviours. Participants will have the opportunity to ask any questions to the health professionals facilitating the groups, and to discuss any issues they have relating to their diabetes with both peers and health professionals.</summary>
