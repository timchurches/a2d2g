  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At present, it is standard for women with early breast cancer to receive five years of treatment with tamoxifen, following surgery.  For many women, tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer returning.  However, some information suggests that tamoxifen may be of most benefit in the two to three years after surgery, after which it becomes less effective.  The Adjuvant Exemestane trial will test whether it is better to take five years of tamoxifen, or to begin a new treatment (exemestane) after two to three years of tamoxifen, for the remainder of the five years.  Exemestane is effective in patients with advanced cancer who have already been treated with tamoxifen and had their cancer return.  Internationally, 4400 postmenopausal women who have had early breast cancer and taken two to three years of tamoxifen treatment will take part in the trial, and be given either exemestane or more tamoxifen to finish five years of treatment.  It is hoped that switching treatments will be more effective at lowering the risk of breast cancer returning than continuing tamoxifen, and it may also lower the risk of developing long-term side effects from tamoxifen.</summary>
