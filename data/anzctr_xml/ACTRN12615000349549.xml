  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Administration fluids directly into a vein is commonly used to treat low blood pressure in critically ill patients, termed fluid resuscitation.  The aim of fluid resuscitation is to restore and maintain organ function.  Two commonly administered intravenous fluids are 20% albumin and 4% albumin. Intensive care doctors do not known if either of these two fluids should be used in preference to the other for fluid resucitation.

In response, the aim of this study is to establish the feasibility, safety, biochemical and physiologicy efficacy of intravenous 20% albumin solution compared with intravenous 4% albumin soluation for fluid bolus therapy in critically ill patients.  

For a period of 48 hours from enrolment, patients that are enrolled in this study will receive either of the study fluids when their treating intensive care doctors deems it necessary.  This study will enrol 400 patients for two intensive care units of hospitals located in Melbourne and Adelailde, Australia.

If our findings support one intravnous fluid over the other then we would aim to conduct larger studies to assess its benefits in terms of patient-centred outcomes.</summary>
