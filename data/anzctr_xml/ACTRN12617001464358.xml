    <statisticalmethods>An excel expandable spread sheet will be used to capture and analyse the quantitative data relating to the numerical distribution of cycling-related injury cause, type and severity. The data collected will be collapsed into patterns to determine the contribution of cycling accident circumstances to the injury type or severity. The primary statistical tool for this pattern analysis will be excel, with any additional qualitative data analysed using nVivo. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cycling-related injuries, including minor injuries that are largely hidden from other reporting methods, are over-represented in emergency departments. This opens up opportunity for more focused &amp; inclusive analysis of this population of patients. The Bicycle Injuries Study (BIS) aims to identify, describe and quantify the patterns of cause, type and severity of cycling crash injuries, within the adult population, as they present to the Emergency Department of Royal North Shore Hospital in NSW; the trial will be based on extraction and analysis of emergency department medical record data relating to the crash circumstances, resulting injuries &amp; treatment. Collecting data from emergency department records in this way will allow for the creation of an integrated database that grounds cycling injuries in the context of our current road environments, potentially revealing new targets for injury prevention.</summary>
