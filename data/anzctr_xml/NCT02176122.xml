  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Bloodstream infection with E. coli or Klebsiella spp. with proven non-susceptibility
             to third generation cephalosporins and susceptibility to meropenem and
             piperacillin-tazobactam from at least one blood culture draw. This will be determined
             in accordance with laboratory methods and susceptibility breakpoints defined by EUCAST
             standards (www. eucast.org). Bacterial identification to species level will be
             performed using standard laboratory methods (e.g. MALDI-TOF) and susceptibility
             testing (e.g. Vitek2)

          -  No more than 72 hours has elapsed since the first positive blood culture collection.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yet been performed comparing different treatment
      options for AmpC or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. During the last 10 years we have seen
      an exponentially increasing rate of carbapenem resistance worldwide, including Australia and
      New Zealand. The investigators urgently need data from well-designed RCTs to guide clinicians
      in the treatment of antibiotic resistant Gram-negative infections. The investigators face a
      situation where a commonly used antibiotic for these infections (meropenem) may be driving
      carbapenem resistance. For this reason, the investigators are seeking to compare a
      carbapenem-sparing regimen with a carbapenem for the treatment of these infections. Formal
      evaluation of safety and efficacy of generic antibiotics in the treatment of infection is of
      immense clinical and public health importance, and no formal trial has yet been conducted to
      address these issues. The international collaboration between teams of clinician researchers,
      some of whom are leaders in their field, makes it highly likely that the outcomes of this
      trial will have a significant impact on clinical practice.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that piperacillin/tazobactam (a carbapenem-sparing regimen)
      is non-inferior to meropenem (a widely used carbapenem) for the definitive treatment of
      bloodstream infections due to third-generation cephalosporin non-susceptible E. coli or
      Klebsiella species.</summary>
