  <interventions>
    <interventions>Text message based intervention for improving health outcomes like pain intensity, whiplash associated disorder(WAD) related disability, self-efficacy, function and quality of life in people with chronic WAD.
The content of text messages will be developed through qualitative methods of in-depth interviews of stakeholders like physiotherapists, rehabilitation specialists, general physicians, patients with chronic whiplash.
Text messages will be sent twice every week for a period of 12 weeks in addition to usual care
Text messages are not yet developed, and are part of stakeholder consultation. However they will be n line with National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines. For example :"Collar immobilisation should not be undertaken with chronic whiplash."
"Prescribed rest is not recommended for chronic whiplash."
" Stay active on your way to recovery"
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be participants with chronic whiplash ( that is more than 12 weeks but less than 12 months). They will continue on any treatment with physiotherapists, rehabilitation specialists, pain, chiropractor or psychologist consultancy/treatment they may be seeking for the condition.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) represents a significant public health problem, resulting in substantial social and economic costs throughout the industrialized world. Chronic WAD is a bio-psycho-social condition. And though education is an effective intervention for people with WAD, providing access to such interventions is a major challenge. The randomised control trial aims to investigate whether simple reminders about self-management sent via mobile phone text message improves health outcomes in people with chronic WAD. 

This is pilot for a randomised controlled trial with three months follow-up to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effect on health outcomes of repeated reminders sent via mobile phone text messages compared to usual care. A total of 50 patients, with chronic WAD will be randomised to either standard care or the TEXT WAD intervention. The participants will be identified through Personal Injury Registry, Motor Accident Authority, NSW. The intervention group will receive two weekly text messages that provide information, reassurance, support, and recommendations for act usual and physical activity. The primary endpoint is change in score of Neck Disability Index. Process outcomes related to acceptability and feasibility of TEXT WAD will also be collected. Text messaging has potential as a cheap, safe and simple method to support and educate people with chronic WAD. However, its effectiveness and feasibility in practice must be proven in a well-designed and rigorously conducted trial.
