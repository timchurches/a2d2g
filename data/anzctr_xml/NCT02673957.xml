  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Blood pressure cuff protocol

Blood pressure cuff protocol - All participants receive a baseline control blood test, and all participants receive the blood pressure cuff inflation protocol and blood sampling following the cuff protocol.


Other interventions: Blood pressure cuff protocol
4 cycles of pneumatic blood pressure cuff inflation to 200mmHg for 5 minutes followed by 5 minutes of deflation. Each subsequent cycles commences as soon as the previous cycle is completed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to analyze the way the human body responds to a temporary lack of oxygen, or
      ischaemia. Prospective participants will complete a health screen to confirm overall health /
      low cardiovascular risk profile.The participants will be required to have pneumatic blood
      pressure cuff inflation to 200mmHg on the upper arm for 5 minutes which will then be deflated
      for 5 minutes and then repeating the cycle of inflation and deflation a further 3 times.
      Blood tests from veins in the forearm would be taken before, during, and after this is done
      in order to compare results and establish any change in concentration of local and
      circulating compounds.</summary>
