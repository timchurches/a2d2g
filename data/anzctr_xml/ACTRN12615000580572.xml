  <interventions>
    <interventions>Functional motor control exercise including core muscle strengthening, spine segmental control, trunk and extremity dissociated movement control retraining will be administered by a physiotherapist. Participants in this group will receive 16 one-to-one sessions (45 minutes/session), twice a week for 8 weeks.
The exercise programs will be tailored to individual patient. Outcome will be assessed upon completion of the 8-week program and at 6-week follow-up after the treatment.
</interventions>
    <comparator>General exercise will include trunk and extremity strengthening, stretching exercises. Each patient will receive at least 10 sessions (30 minutes/session) of treatment in 8 weeks. The program will be one-to-one sessions with a physiotherapist. The maximum number of sessions that may be administered is 16. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our study purpose is to compare the improvement of movement control ability and clinical outcomes in patients with chronic low back pain after functional motor control exercise training.

Our hypothesis is that  patients in the functional motor control exercise group will demonstrate better improvement of movement control ability and clinical outcomes than those in the general exercise group.
