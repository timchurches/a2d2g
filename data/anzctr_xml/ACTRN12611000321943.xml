  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a therapist-assisted, 12-week internet-based treatment adapted from a manualised face-to face CBT program (Systematic Treatment for Obsessive-compulsive Phenomena or STOP Therapy).  OCD STOP consists of 12 modules where users complete one module per week for the duration of treatment. Each module takes approximately 1 hour to complete. Modules 1-3 provide information about OCD, anxiety, and an introduction to CBT, along with anxiety and depression management strategies (e.g., relaxation, activity scheduling). In Modules 4-6, Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) strategies are introduced through the construction of hierarchies. These teach the participant to plan and implement an ERP program suited to their individual problem. Due to heterogeneity of the disorder, participants are provided with a range of examples to correspond to various presentations. Modules 7-9 include cognitive therapy techniques (e.g., cognitive restructuring) targeting OCD specific cognitive styles (such as inflated responsibility/overestimation of threat, importance/control of thoughts). As part of this, cognitive misappraisals are identified and alternatives developed and practiced; and more advanced ERP, integrating cognitive strategies is undertaken. Modules 10-12 include relapse preventions strategies (e.g., problem solving, risk identification, contingency management, and mindfulness techniques). The importance of daily practice is emphasised and discussions focus on enablers of and barriers to maintenance of CBT.

Therapist assistance for OCD STOP is in the form of weekly emails communication from a registered psychologist. All therapists will strictly adhere to the Australian Psychological Society Code of Ethics and the state registration board in providing online services.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a 12-week internet-based Progressive Relaxation Training for anxiety. Participants complete one module per week, which takes approximately 1 hour to complete. Individuals receive basic information about OCD, the relationship of OCD to anxiety, and the use of relaxation as a treatment for anxiety. Individuals are taught to relax specific muscle groups while paying attention to the feelings associated with both the tensed and relaxed stages. It permits the individual to achieve a state of deep relaxation in increasingly shorter periods and to control excess tension in stress-inducing situations. Participants work through the sequential tensing and releasing of 16 muscle groups (Modules 1 to 3). These are reduced to seven (Modules 4 and 5) and to four (Modules 6 to 7). The tension component is then withdrawn (Modules 8 to 11) in what is called relaxation through recall, and the final stage (Module 12) consists of a mental summary of the previously learned techniques. Participants will have access to downloadable audiovisual and written material on-site to guide their progressive relaxation training.

Upon completing the PRT and post-treatment measures, individuals will complete the therapist-assisted OCD STOP free of charge.</comparator>

    <summary>This study will evaluate the effectiveness of OCD STOP, which is an online psychological treatment for individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that is based on the face-to-face psychological treatment for OCD called the Systematic Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive phenomena or STOP. To assess its effectiveness, OCD STOP will be compared to an online relaxation program for anxiety known as Progressive Relaxation Training. This study is funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).</summary>
