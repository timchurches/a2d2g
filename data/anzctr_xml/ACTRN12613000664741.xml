  <interventions>
    <interventions>One (1) 20-30 minute pre-operative education session delivered by a Physiotherapist at the standard outpatient Pre-Admission Clinic appointment. The education is to be provided within 6 weeks of the schedued operation date and will be performed in person, however, if this is not possible, the patient will be contacted by phone and provided with the education and training via telephone and the booklet sent via mail. The pre-operative physiotherapy session will consist of education on the prevention of post-operative pulmonary complications stressing the importance of early post-operative ambulation and the performance of self-directed deep breathing and coughing (DB&amp;C) exercises immediately from waking from the operation. Patients will be informed that the further they walk and the more often they walk away from the bedside each day following their operation the better their chance of avoiding serious post-operative complications (chest infection or deep vein thrombosis). They will be informed that a Physiotherapist will see them on the first post-operative day and assist them out of bed to walk as far as possible. They will be told that they will be walking at a pace that gets them a bit breathless and will be familiarised with the 0-10 Borg scale Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). They will be told that each time they walk it should feel like a 3-4/10 in exertion. After the first post-operative day session with the Physiotherapist they will be encouraged strongly to walk or exercise by their bedside as often as they can by themselves or with the assistance of a nurse or carer. 
As it is frequently not possible to ambulate as early and as often as recommended, participants will be encouraged (during the pre-operative intervention) to perform self-directed breathing exercises to protect their lungs during this time in bed. They will be instructed to perform the DB&amp;C exercises immediately from waking from the anaesthetic and then every hour during daytime waking hours until their first ambulation session, and then at any time when they are not ambulant. The physiotherapist will then coach each participant in at least three repetitions, and as many as required to master technique, of two sets of 10 slow-flow breaths to maximum inspiratory capacity with two to three inspiratory sniff breath stacking manoeuvres. Each breath is held for three to five seconds. Each set of 10 breaths are followed by three coughs, or a forced expiratory technique with an open glottis called a huff, with a small firm pillow pressed over on the abdominal incision to support the wound and to encourage greater expiratory force. Participants will be encouraged to practice these exercises prior to their operation to develop familiarity. Each patient in the intervention group will be given an estimate of their likelihood of getting a PPC based on available pre-operative information (type of procedure proposed, booked post-operative admission to ICU, usual length of procedure, respiratory co-morbidity, self rated fitness levels, current smoker). Patients will be informed that aggressive early self directed DB &amp; C exercises and ambulation is effective in reducing this known risk of a PPC. Participants will be provided with an accompanying education booklet outlining what was presented on prevention of PPC, post-operative physiotherapy, early ambulation, self directed DB&amp;C (2 sets of 10 DB followed by 3 coughs every hour during daytime) and the expected recovery process. Post-operatively participants will be provided with a standardised physiotherapy assisted early mobilisation program and reminded to do the DB&amp;C exercises as per the booklet provided. No further coached respiratory physiotherapy is provided.</interventions>

    <concealment>Eligible patients who are listed for elective major upper abdominal surgery will be identified from the hospital's elective gastrointestinal, urology, and general surgery waiting lists. Written information about the clinical trial and consent form will be sent to the patient in the mail. The information and consent form will be re-presented to patient, or next of kin, at presentation to hospital for their pre-admission appointment.
Allocation:	Patients will be randomly allocated by the Pre-operative Physiotherapist by opening a pre-prepared sealed opaque envelope containing a card with the nominated group allocation . After allocation patient details will be written on envelope once opened to ensure that patients were randomised in the same order as they were recruited.
</concealment>
    <sequence>An administration assistant (who then takes no further part in the study) will prepare sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, each containing a card with allocation group determined by computer generated random number (odd=intervention). </sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Recent published Australian studies (Scholes 2009, Browning 2007) in this patient population have measured the rate of post-operative pulmonary complications at 15-20% in context of providing pre-operative physiotherapy education and a once only post-operative physiotherapy session. 
Sample size was calculated using inference for proportions comparing two independent samples with a 0.05 two-sided significance level and will have 80% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in PPC between Pre-Op (estimated at 10%) and an education booklet (estimated at 20%) when the sample size is 398. This is further increased by 11% to account for attrition, resulting in a final sample size of 441.
The effectiveness of the randomisation process will be tested by simple logistic regression for binomial categorical variables; general linear modelling for normally distributed continuous data; and ordered logistic regression for non-normal continuous data or for rank-ordered categorical variables. In order to minimise the effect on outcome estimates of potential confounding variables due to minor variation in distribution of those variables between the trial groups, multivariate adjustment for those variables will be performed. Adjustment covariates will be selected from covariates that may have the potential for clinically significant alterations in effect sizes by backward stepwise regression. These include: history of a respiratory comorbidity, smoking history, self-reported physical activity levels, age, BMI, length in time of operation, operation category (upper gastrointestinal, colorectal, urological, other), ICU admission immediately following the procedure, incision type and location, intraoperative ventilation strategies, fluid delivery, blood transfusions, mode of post-operative analgesia, and use of prophylactic antibiotics.
All outcomes are to be analysed using intention-to-treat. The absolute and relative rates of PPC in the trial groups will be estimated using multivariate robust random effects Poisson generalised linear regression to allow assessment of binary outcomes with or without adjustment for potential confounding variables (incidence rates and rate ratios, 95% confidence intervals, p-values). Treatment centre will be treated as a fixed variable in the multi-level models. In addition, the effect of time from the end of surgery/anaesthesia to commencement of symptoms of PPC will be compared using Cox proportional hazards regression with and without covariate adjustment (hazards ratio, 95% confidence intervals, p-values). Graphic representation of this analysis will be performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Binomial secondary outcomes, including pneumonia, unplanned ICU admission and patient reported complications, will be analysed using mixed effects Poisson regression. Secondary outcomes with irregular distributions, including length of time periods (ICU and total post-operative LOS, time to ambulation for 1 minute and 10 minutes, and time to discharge from assisted ambulation physiotherapy service) and HRQoL and functional capacity, group differences will be evaluated using mixed effects ordered logistic regression, with mean time (95% CI) estimated for descriptive purposes using mixed effects linear regression, with or without log transformation depending on distribution. Hospital costs associated with the interventions will be compared using mixed effects linear regression. Log transformation of highly skewed cost data will be performed. 
The sensitivity of the outcome estimates to missing data will be evaluated using multiple imputation (Stata command syntax mi). All analyses will be performed using Stata version 13 or later (StataCorp, College Station, Texas USA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Chest infections can occur in as many as 1 out of every 2 patients after they have had major bowel, stomach, liver or kidney surgery. This is serious and costly. Chest infections dramatically increase the risk of death following surgery, and the average length of time spent in hospital is doubled. 

Studies have shown that getting up, and out of bed, and walking as early as possible after surgery with a Physiotherapist reduces this chance of getting a chest infection down to as low as 1 in 20. Unfortunately, these studies have also included time spent with a Physiotherapist before the operation on learning how to do breathing exercises and how to get going again soon after the operation. 

So, it is really hard to say for certain if this significant reduction in chest infections is down, not just to the amount of walking a patient does after the operation, but also to the level of education they received before the operation. 

No clinical trial to this point has specifically looked at how effective this type of pre-operative education is, in its own right, in reducing the risk of a chest infection after an operation. 

The LIPPSMAck POP trial will provide education and training from a Physiotherapist to half of the patients about to undergo major abdominal surgery. The other half will get a pamphlet covering the same sort of information. All patients will get a follow up session with a physiotherapist on the first day after their surgery. 

The trial will compare these two groups and see if there is any difference in rates of chest infections and how long they stay in hospital.

The result of this trial will assist in determining the wisest and most cost effective way to allocate Physiotherapy services to people having a major abdominal operation and assist them in recovering from their operation as quickly as possible.
