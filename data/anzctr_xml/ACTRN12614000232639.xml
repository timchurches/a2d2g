  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be randomly allocated, with equal probability to receive supplemental betaine; either 0.5 g or 2.5 g, or placebo once daily for 6 months. Active treatment sachets will contain 5 g of powder; either 2.5g betaine and 2.5 g water-soluble placebo maltodextrin or 0.5g betaine with 4.5 g water-soluble placebo maltodextrin. Participants will consume one sachet of treatment by dissolving the contents into a beverage of 200 ml once daily for 6 months.

Randomization into 1 of 3 sequences will be performed in permutated block sizes from a computer-generated randomization list. Study treatments will be dispensed in identical numbered packages of sachets with the lowest available number allocated to each sequential participant.

Participants will be contacted by telephone weekly for the first month of study, and thereafter participants will be contacted at fortnightly intervals to improve adherence to study medication. Compliance to treatment will be determined by sachet count.

In pigs the changes in body composition are &gt;5%. The coefficient of variation in DEXA estimates of body fat % is &lt; 3%, and the intra-individual coefficient of variation in % body fat has been reported as 10%, although this is probably an overestimate since the method used was bioelectrical impedance which is confounded by variations in hydration, and the actual value is more likely to be in the 8-10% range. The proposed recruitment of 25 subjects per group would have sufficient power to detect a significant difference between active treatment and placebo if the intra-individual coefficient of variation is &lt;8%. 

The recruitment of 25 subjects per group will provide sufficient power for conclusive and publishable results on the biochemical risk-factor secondary endpoints. Based on our and others previous experience, the plasma betaine concentrations will be raised by 20 to 50 Âµmol/L by the treatments, detectable with n &lt; 6. The expected change in fasting homocysteine, and the post-methionine load rise in homocysteine, will be readily detectable; the intra-individual variation in plasma homocysteine is 8% and we expect changes &gt;12%. The non-HDL cholesterol will be of particular interest, based on cross-sectional studies the increase in plasma betaine was associated with a 0.15 to 0.4 mmol/L decrease in plasma non-HDL cholesterol, and if this response is realised in this study then 25 subjects per group is sufficient. The effects on changes in measures of insulin resistance, inflammation and coagulation markers will be novel data.</statisticalmethods>
