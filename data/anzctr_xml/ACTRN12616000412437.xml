  <interventions>
    <interventions>A print and online decision aid about enrollment in paediatric oncology clinicial trials for parents and young patients. A decision aid is a patient information tool with an emphasis on guidance about making a decision, including value-clarification exercises. The decision aid will be provided to parents and adolescents with content tailored for each specific group. The mode of administration will run sequentially for the pilot. The first 10 participants will receive the hard-copy version, and the following 10 will receive the online version. The DA will be assessed for acceptability and feasibility, with time spent reviewing the DA content up to individual participants. The questionnaire is estimated to take approximately 30 minutes. There is no further follow-up once completing the questionnaire. </interventions>
    <comparator>There will be no comparator for this trial as it is a pilot study.. The DA will be assessed sequentially, with the hard-copy assessed firstly to confirm content is acceptable, followed by assessment of the online DA. The print DA will not be compared to the online DA. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of the decision aid to parents, and adolescents and young adults who have had to make a decision of whether to enrol in a paediatric oncology clinical trial in the past. This will be assessed with an online/hard-copy questionnaire designed specifically for this study, utilising validated measures where possible. We will assess overall satisfaction with the booklet, acceptability content, length and amount of information, balance in how the options were presented and emotional impact, Modality preferences of the decision aid will also be assessed. </outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a decision aid tool for parents/carers of children with cancer, and adolescents with cancer to assist in the decision making process of clinical trial enrolment. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are either a parent/carer of a child with cancer who has been invited to participate in a clinical trial 3 months to 4 years previously; or if you are aged 12-25 years of age, having had a cancer diagnosis and been invited to participate in a clinical trial 3 months to 4 years previously. 

Study details 
Parents/carers and adolescents enrolled with either receive the decision aid as a hard copy or as an online tool. They will then be asked to complete a questionnaire, including several open ended items, asking for their feedback regarding the decision aid, either by hard copy or online as chosen by each participant. 

It is hoped that this study will result in an acceptable and feasible online decision aid tool, which will assist parents/carers of children with cancer, and young people with cancer with the decision of whether or not to participate in a clinical trial.</summary>
