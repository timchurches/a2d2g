    <interventions>This is a patient oriented translational research project aiming to improve clinical outcomes for patients with BRAF and NRAS wild-type unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic melanoma who have progressed on, or are unable to receive standard therapy (in general, immunotherapy).

Consecutive patients seen at three major clinics with unresectable Stage III or IV melanoma   will be invited to participate. All patients are first provided with the standard care BRAF/NRAS mutation testing, followed by standard care therapy.

Those patients with melanoma found to be BRAF/NRAS wild type will also undergo extended molecular testing of their melanoma. The extended test in this project covers approximately 400 cancer related genes. Following progression on standard therapy, patients with BRAF/NRAS wild type melanoma will be reviewed at a meeting of the project multidisciplinary team. Patients will be offered a targeted therapy matched to the genetic aberrations detected on extended testing. The current library of targeted therapies include:

Everolimus
Bortezomib
Cabozantinib
Ceritinib
Crizotinib
Dasatinib
Erlotinib
Everolimus
Gefitinib
Imatinib
Lapatinib
Nilotinib
Olaparib
Palbociclib
Pazopanib
Ramucirumab 
Regorafenib
Sorafenib
Sunitinib
Trametinib
Vorinostat

Where multiple targets are identified in one patient, or where multiple potential therapies would be appropriate for a single tumour mutation, the appropriate therapeutic approach will be decided after consultation with the multidisciplinary team, using the latest version of library of matched therapies. Similarly, for patients where no genetic aberration was detected or for whom there is no current targeted therapy available for a specific genetic aberration, further treatment will be discussed with the molecular multidisciplinary team formed for this project.

All patients who consent to participate in the study will be followed up until death.</interventions>

    <designfeatures>This is a patient oriented translational research project aiming to improve clinical outcomes for patients with BRAF and NRAS wild-type unresectable Stage III or Stage IV metastatic melanoma who have progressed on, or are unable to receive standard therapy (in general, immunotherapy). Consecutive patients seen at three major clinics and fitting the broad eligibility criteria will be invited to participate.

The approach is designed to test the impact of different targeted drugs on different mutations in a single type of cancer. In this project, patients will have tumour tissue genetically profiled to determine which mutation(s) are present, and will then be assigned to receive a matched drug expected to target the mutation(s) in the tumour. Where multiple targets are identified in one patient, or where multiple potential therapies would be appropriate for a single tumour mutation, the treating clinician may determine the appropriate therapeutic approach after consultation with the study team, using the latest version of library of matched therapies.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of cancer therapy which is matched specifically to the genetic profile of each individual's tumour in patients with metastatic melanoma.
Who is it for? You may be eligible to participate in this study if you are aged 18 or over, and are newly diagnosed with stage IIIB, IIIC or IV melanoma.
Study details: All participants in this study will first undergo standard testing to establish whether a certain type of genetic mutation (BRAF/NRAS mutation) is present in their tumour cells. This is carried out using an existing or fresh tumour tissue sample. All participants will then begin standard care therapy for the melanoma. In participants with tumours testing negative for BRAF/NRAS mutations in the initial test, and who show disease progression or who are unable to continue standard care therapy, further testing on their tumour tissue sample will be carried out. This will provide further information regarding the genetic profile of the tumour. Researchers will then match this genetic profile to a specific therapy which targets it. Researchers will measure disease progression and survival to evaluate the efficacy of the matched targeted treatment in comparison to standard care only. The matched targeted therapies which may be used will be continuously updated as other research provides more information on which drugs may target which genetic profiles. It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide valuable information regarding the efficacy of therapies which target the specific genetic profile of metastatic melanoma tumours, in comparison to the current standard care.</summary>
