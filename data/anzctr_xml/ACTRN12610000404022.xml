  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and from fish oil constitute the active intervention. Each capsule will contain 1000mg fish oil, comprising 600mg marine triglycerides as EPA 550mg and DHA 110mg. Four capsules per day will deliver 2.2g EPA, and 0.44g DHA. The particpants will take the medication for 16 weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo capsules, containing 1000mg low-phenolic olive oil, consisting of predominantly monounsaturated fatty acids, will be identical to the EPA capsules in every way, including size, shape, colour and smell.  participants will take 4 capsules daily for 16 weeks.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusions criteria
Participants with scores below or equal to 17 on the PSS asking about stress levels over the past three months at baseline
Participants have not taken a course of fish oil in the past three months, and consumes less than two non-fried fish meals per week on average
Participants will be instructed to maintain their usual diets which will be monitored by the electronic Food Frequency Questionnaire at t=0, t=4, t= 8, t=12 and t=16 weeks</inclusivecriteria>

Participants taking immunosuppressive medications
Participants with an inflammatory disorder
 Participants with an infection
Participants that have suffered a significant trauma, such as surgery, within the last 6 months
Participants with unexplained weight loss
 Participants with any kind of malignancy

    <concealment>Randomisation will stratified according to age and a computer program will be used to
generate the randomisation schedule. The coding will kept in sealed envelopes in a locked filing
cabinet until the completion of the trial. An independent staff member of the Department of Natural
and Complementary Medicine not associated with the current study or funding bodies, will conduct
the randomisation and coding of the supplement bottles. The success of the blinding procedure will
be checked by asking each of the subjects to identify the agent they believed they were taking.
Blinding will also be correlated with blood cell membranes of fatty acids as a further cross check.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of EPA-rich fish oil in the amelioration of
chronic work stress. A secondary aim is to contribute to the understanding of the causal relationship
between dietary fatty acids and psychological stress. The primary hypothesis is that that EPA-rich
fish oil will significantly reduce chronic work stress in comparison to a placebo over a 16 week
period.</summary>
