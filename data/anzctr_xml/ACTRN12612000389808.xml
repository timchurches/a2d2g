  <interventions>
    <interventions>The investigation will employ a single centre, double-blind, placebo controlled, five-period crossover design with a 7-day washout period.

Participants will be required to attend one practice session followed by five testing sessions. 
During the practice session particpants will sign the consent form and be familiarised with the mood scales and cognitive tasks.

The testing sessions will see participants taking one of four interventions:

1)  Whole green tea extract standardised with regard to caffeine and catechins (GTE). Extract to deliver 40 mg caffeine per dose,170 mgs catechins. 
2)  40 mg synthetic caffeine (caffeine)
3)  Decaffeinated green tea extract (Decaff-GTE) standardised with regard to catechins.  Extract to deliver 0.12 mgs caffeine; 170 mgs catechins, 
4)  Catechins alone i.e. without any other components of green tea extract (catechins). Extract to deliver 185 mgs catechins .
5)  Placebo

All five treatments will be administered as capsules and will be matched for colour, smell and taste

Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either treatment (1) or (2) or (3) or (4) or (5) on their first testing day. This will be done by a randomised computer number sequence generator. Over the course of the investigation, they will complete all five treatments with treatment order counterbalanced across participants. A disinterested third party will be responsible for the blinding procedure. 

On the testing days subjects will provide baseline blood and saliva samples then undergo baseline mood and cognitive assessment. The days treatment will be administered at 9.00 am +/- 30 min) followed exactly 30 min and 120 min later by the same mood and cognitive assessment (using parallel forms of stimuli). Final blood and saliva samples will be taken and subjects will leave the laboratory. 
At the end of the final visit subjects will be fully debriefed before leaving the laboratory.

There will be a seven day washout period between each testing session</interventions>

5.  Susceptible to any unwanted side-effects of caffeine, such as reduction in sleep quality.

    <concealment>A unique screening number will identify each subject screened for study participation.  Screening numbers will be assigned in ascending numerical order according to appearance at the study site.  Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised according to the randomisation schedule generated by the Biostatistics and Data Management Department of GSKCH using computer software. 
\
Two copies of the randomisation codes will be kept; one for administration purposes and one for emergency code break situations.  Whilst the investigation is a double blind trial, investigators will know the whereabouts of, and have access to, this information. This is in case of an emergency where the contents of the treatment used may need to be known.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is aiming to determine the effects of green tea and combinations of potential active components of green tea (caffeine and catechins) on cognitive function and mood. 

This project will assess the effectiveness of green tea extract and different fractions of green tea extract on cognitive function (primarily attention) and mood measures. The plasma levels of several potential active constituents of green tea will also be monitored.

Subjects will be required to attend five testing sessions (and one practice session). Subjects will take one intervention (administered in capsule format) at each session. 

1. Whole green tea extract standardised with regard to caffeine and catechins (GTE). Extract to deliver 40 mg caffeine per dose. 
2. 40 mg synthetic caffeine (caffeine)
3. Decaffeinated green tea extract (Decaff-GTE) standardised with regard to catechins 
4. Catechins alone i.e. without any other components of green tea extract (catechins)
5. Placebo</summary>
