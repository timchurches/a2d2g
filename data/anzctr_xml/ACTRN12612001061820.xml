    <interventions>Arm 1: 1 mA transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
Arm 2: 1 mA transcranial random noise stimulation (rRNS) with a 1mA DC offset

All excitatory stimulation will be applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 20 minutes using a neuroConn GBH/Eldith DC Stimulator.</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 3: Sham stimulation. 
This will involve placing the electrodes in the same position as for active sessions, however stimulation will be ceased after 30 seconds (so as to generate the same initial sensation and ensure blinding is maintained).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recently there has been much interest in the capacity of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques to enhance cognitive processing. The technique that has been most often studied in this regard is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and there is now robust evidence that tDCS can be used to enhance a variety of cognitive processes. However, the potential of related techniques such as transcranial intermittent current stimulation (tICS) and transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) have not yet been investigated in detail, and many unanswered questions remain regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of stimulation induced cognitive enhancement. 

A related avenue of research is the emergence of novel cognitive training paradigms for depression. These therapies differ from traditional methods in that they target the cognitive rather than the emotional symptoms of depression. There has been much speculation regarding whether their efficacy could be further enhanced by concurrent application of non-invasive brain stimulation. 

The current study will investigate the capacity of three active methods of non-invasive electrical brain stimulation (tDCS, tRNS and tICS) and sham stimulation to enhance prefrontally mediated cognitive processing, in both healthy controls and individuals with major depression. It will address the following questions: 

1.	Which of these methods best augments cognition? 
2.	What impact do these methods have on cortical excitability?
3.	To what degree do these brain stimulation methods impact on the neural oscillations associated with cognitive processing?</summary>
