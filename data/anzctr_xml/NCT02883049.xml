  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized phase III trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating
      young patients with newly diagnosed B acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is likely to come
      back or spread, and in patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-like tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) sensitive mutations. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing,
      or by stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) and
      giving the drugs in different doses and in different combinations may kill more cancer cells.</summary>
