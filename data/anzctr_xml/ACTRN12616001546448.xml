  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a 16 week, open-label pilot trial of N-acetyl cysteine in body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). 

Participants with BDD will be asked to take NAC orally, alongside any treatment-as-usual, for the study duration. The daily dose will start at 1g twice daily (2g total per day) and will be increased up to a maximum of 1.5g twice daily (3g total per day), depending on (non-)response, and following a case review between the investigators. Response assessment and case review will take place at two-week intervals. For compliance monitoring, participants will be asked to return any empty bottles and/or unused capsules 

Participants will be assessed for BDD symptom presence/severity and side-effects at two week intervals. Face-to-face assessment sessions will occur at baseline and weeks 8 and 16, and again at 2 months follow-up (week 24). Participants will be assessed via phone and completion of online measures at weeks 2, 4, 6, 10, 12 and 14. Primary outcome measure is the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Modification of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (BDD-YBOCS). Assessments will be undertaken by a clinical psychologist with expertise in BDD, and medical oversight for the study will be provided by a consultant psychiatrist with expertise in the treatment and management of patients with BDD.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of NAC in BDD. There is a growing body of research pointing to NAC's possible effectiveness in treating a range of psychiatric conditions. In particular, accumulating evidence points to its probable efficacy in treating obsessive-compulsive and related disorders including obsessive-compulsive disorder, trichotillomania, compulsive nail-biting and pathological gambling. BDD, another obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder, is an often-debilitating condition affecting up to 2.5% of the population. This study will investigate whether NAC holds any promise as a new treatment for BDD. Participants will undergo treatment with NAC, at a starting dose of 1g twice daily (total 2g per day). Response will be assessed every two weeks and dosage will be adjusted depending on response and tolerability of the NAC, up to a maximum daily dose of 3g. Change in BDD symptoms and other scores over time will be assessed relative to baseline. </summary>
