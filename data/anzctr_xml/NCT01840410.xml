  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Ranibizumab
Other interventions - Sham control

Experimental: Ranibizumab - A 0.5 mg ranibizumab intravitreal injection was given to the study eye at baseline, and then as needed based on evidence of disease activity.

Sham Comparator: Sham control - Sham injection was given to the study eye at baseline, and then treatment was given based on evidence of disease activity. At Month 1, if treatment was needed, sham was administered. At Month 2, participants could switch to open-label ranibizumab on an as needed basis.


Treatment: drugs: Ranibizumab
Ranibizumab 0.5mg/0.5mL was administered intravitreally to the participant.

Other interventions: Sham control
The sham vial did not contain active drug (empty sterile vial). The sham injection was an imitation of an intravitreal injection using an injection syringe without a needle touching the eye.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Best-corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) in Study Eye to Month 2 - BCVA was assessed in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity (VA) testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. The data were analyzed using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) which contained scheduled visit, the type of underlying pathophysiologic mechanism (angloid streaks versus others) and treatment group as fixed effect factors, centered baseline BCVA as a continuous covariate and treatment group by visit and visit by centered baseline BCVA interactions. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 2</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in BCVA in Study Eye up to Month 2 - BCVA was assessed in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity (VA) testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model which contained the type of underlying pathophysiologic mechanism (angloid streaks versus others) and treatment group as fixed effect factors, centered baseline BCVA as a continuous covariate. A positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Month 1, Month 2</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Central Subfield Thickness (CSFT) in Study Eye - CSFT was assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With Presence of Active Chorioretinal Leakage - The presence of active chorioretinal leakage was assessed by photography imaging, i.e. fluorescein angiography (FA).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average Change From Baseline in BCVA - BCVA was assessed in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like visual acuity (VA) testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. BCVA was assessed at each month from Month 1 through Month 6 or at each month from Month 1 through month 12, and the data were averaged. The outcome measure is reporting the change between baseline and average BCVA from Month 1 through Month 6 or from Month 1 through Month 12 (average BCVA - baseline BCVA). A positive change from baseline indicated improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With = 1, = 5, = 10 and = 15 Letters Gain or Reaching 84 Letters - VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using ETDRS-like visual acuity testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters.</outcome>
