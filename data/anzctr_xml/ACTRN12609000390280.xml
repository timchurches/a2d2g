  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment Group patients will be treated as for the Control Group, but, from day 3 onwards postoperatively,will in addition, receive continuous passive motion (CPM) for two hours twice a day. The CPM will be set up by a physiotherapist as follows. With the patient in supine, the hip and knee axes of the CPM unit will be aligned with the greater trochanter of the hip and the patients knee joint respectively and the length of the lower leg section of the CPM adjusted to fit the patient. Mid-thigh and mid-calf straps will then be secured. The range of movement of the CPM will be increased until it reaches the patients maximal tolerated range. The speed of the CPM will be adjusted up to the fastest tolerated speed. The CPM will be continued until such time as the patient can achieve 90 degrees of active knee flexion range of movement or is discharged from hospital.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control Group patients will be treated according to the standard Royal Adelaide Hospital postoperative physiotherapy protocol following total knee arthroplasty. This involves active knee range of movement exercises, quadriceps strengthening (static and inner range strengthening, and straight leg raise) and ambulation (using appropriate mobility aids), twice per day from days 1 to 4 postoperatively with the treating physiotherapist. Patients will be assisted in ambulation by one or two physiotherapists as required, or by nursing staff as mobility improves. Mobility will be progressed (in terms of the distance walked, speed of walking, degree of assistance required and mobility aids) as deemed clinically appropriate for each patient. Functional training over a single step will be commenced twice daily from day 3/4. From day 5 onwards, patients will be reviewed daily by the treating physiotherapist until their mobility is such that the patient is safe for discharge from hospital. Each rehabilitation session will last approximately 30 minutes.</comparator>

The investigator will explain the project aims and format to them, provide them with the written information sheet and, after allowing them time to consider whether or not they wish to participate, obtain informed written consent from those patients willing to participate. Once consent has been obtained, patients will be assigned to the treatment or control group by referring to sequential sealed opaque envelopes kept in the Physiotherapy Department.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Continuous passive motion (CPM) machines, which move the leg up and down, are often used for patients who have had knee replacement surgery to improve knee movement. Studies have shown CPM does not improve knee movement or function if used routinely for all patients who have had knee replacement surgery. In this study we want to find out whether or not CPM is beneficial for patients who are slow to regain knee movement after knee replacement surgery, compared to standard physiotherapy treatment without CPM. Our standard practice at the Royal Adelaide Hospital is to use CPM only for those patients who are slow to regain knee movement after knee replacement surgery but no studies have investigated the use of CPM in this setting.</summary>
