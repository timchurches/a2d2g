  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people who acquire a brain impairment (e.g. through stroke or traumatic injury) suffer significant paralysis and loss of function in their arms and hands. This loss of function is extremely disabling and effects many aspects of their daily lives. Therapists frequently provide motor retraining programs to try and help them regain functional use of their limbs. Unfortunately, there is considerable variation in the type and amount of therapy given. Current evidence also suggests that many of these patients do not regain their function despite participating in therapy. This randomised controlled trial will attempt to determine if an intensive daily program of specific functionally based hand exercises is able to improve the hand function of people with acquired brain impairment. It is hoped that its results will help to guide the current and future practice of Occupational and Physiotherapists working in rehabilitation.  Final measured outcome assessor of the study is blinded.</summary>
