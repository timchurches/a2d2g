  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Triple P Discussion Groups are preventively focused interventions designed to provide specific advice about common child behaviour or developmental issues. During the two-hour group sessions, parents are taught about the principles of positive parenting, strategies for developing a good parent-child relationship, and strategies for managing specific problem behaviours. These strategies are alternatives to coercive and ineffective discipline strategies. All discussion groups involve video-modelling of behaviour management strategies, a tailored implementation plan, and training in planned activities routines to cope with high-risk situations. The format of the group session includes some didactic presentations, active skills training, and group discussions. Each discussion group is accompanied by a workbook. 
The Triple P Discussion Groups used in this study will focus on five different topic areas: Dealing with Disobedience, Being a Positive Parent, Fighting and Aggression, Doing Chores, and Building Self-Esteem. The Dealing with Disobedience Triple P Discussion Group focuses on reasons for disobedience, parenting traps, ways to encourage positive child behaviour and strategies for dealing with disobedience. During the Being a Positive Parent group parents are introduced to the principles of positive parenting and taught a range of skills aimed at assist them to support their childs competence and development and to build a positive relationship with their child. The Fighting and Aggression session covers why children fight, skills to teach children to play cooperatively, and strategies for dealing with sibling conflict, fighting, not sharing, and aggression. During the Doing Chores group parents will learn why helping is important, strategies to help prepare and encourage children to do chores, as well as strategies to use when chores are not completed. The Building Self-Esteem session looks at causes of low self-esteem, and teaches strategies to encourage healthy self-esteem, and to help children to manage negative self-talk and solve problems.   
 
Arm 1
Participants allocated to the one-off discussion group condition will receive the Dealing with Disobedience Triple P Discussion Group only. 

Arm 2
Participants allocated to the series of four group sessions will receive the Dealing with Disobedience and Being a Positive Parent Triple P Discussion Groups. They will then be given the choice to attend two additional groups targeting other specific behaviours and concerns, out of the three following topics: Fighting and Aggression, Doing Chores, and Building Self-Esteem. Parents attended four sessions once a week over a period of 4 to 5 weeks. </interventions>

- The parent/s is currently seeing a mental health professional for emotional or psychological problems, or for their child's behavioural problems (rationale: if parents are receiving support from another service, then it will be difficult to disentangle potential benefits gained from the provided programme from those gained by this external support).

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Parents interested in participating in the study are asked to self-refer to the researcher. Information about the study protocol is explained and a screening interview is conducted to determine participant eligibility. Written informed consent is collected and pre-intervention measures are then administered. Randomisation to condition is conducted at the level of individual children in sequence of completion of pre-intervention measures.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated list of random is used to allocate to condition. Allocation is stratified to control for study site (West vs. Central Auckland) and household configuration (e.g., one- vs. two-parent families). Allocation to condition will be conducted by an individual independent of the study to ensure there is no bias in the allocation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will evaluate the effects of attending preventively focused group interventions designed to provide specific advice to parents about common child behaviour or developmental issues (Triple P Discussion Groups). A randomised controlled trial design is used to evaluate the effects of attending a one-off discussion group in comparison with attending a series of four group sessions. Participants will be parents with a 5-8 year old child displaying at least a mild level of behaviour problems. Measures will be completed by parents at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up.</summary>
