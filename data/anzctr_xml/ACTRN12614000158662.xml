  <interventions>
    <interventions>Two period cross-over trial. Intervention with mouth-rinsing will commence at the start of either induction, consolidation, or re-induction chemotherapy phase. Group 1 will be rinse with 10 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash twice daily, and Group 2 will rinse with 15 mL of 1% povidone iodine mouthwash twice daily, for 14 days during the first period of study. Alkaline saline mouthrinse will be used by the subjects during the 2 week washout time between the two periods of study. The two groups will then switch mouthrinses during the second study period. The occurrence of ulcerative lesions and severity of mucositis will be measured at baseline and twice weekly of each study period, using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and World Health Organization Grading Scale. If oral mucositis/ulceration develops during either period and persists beyond 14 days, the subjects will continue to use the mouthwash assigned to their group until lesions heal. A participant diary on the use of mouthwash and other oral care hygiene measures such as toothbrushing and flossing will be used to monitor adherence to treatment.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistics are generated for all variables. Descriptive measures include: Percentage, Mean, Standard deviation.  For nominal data, frequencies and percentages are computed.  For numerical data, mean +/- SD were generated.   Two-way ANOVA, Mc Nemar, and Chi square test are used for test of significance. The 0.05 levels is used as the cut off values for statistical significance (p =0.05). The results are demonstrated as tables and graphs.This research is limited to the study of a subset population of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia ages 6 to 18 years old. Sample size is determined statistically using the effect size based on the results of the study Comparison effects of chlorhexidine gluconate and povodine iodine mouthwashes to chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia by Setiawan et al. done in 2006 (as cited in the review of literature) which showed that the mucositis and its related pain healed in mean of 6.1 days (range of 5 to 7) for the chlorhexidine group and mean of 11 days (range of 8 to 14) for the povidone iodine group. To detect an effect size of 1.231, under alpha error of 0.05 and power of 0.80, at least nine subjects will be used in the study. Calculation is performed using PASS 11 for Windows. (Hintze, J. PASS 11, NCSS, LLF, 2011. www.ncss.com)

A sample size of 9 achieves 85% power to detect a mean of paired differences of 4.8 of an estimated standard deviation of differences of 3.9 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05000 using a two-sided Wilcoxon test assuming that the actual distribution is normal.
This research study will use a sample size of 20 for better statistical outcomes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>One of the most debilitating complications of chemotherapy is oral stomatositis. It occurs in up to 52-80% of children undergoing chemotherapy, and  can start from the 3rd to 5th day after initiation of chemotherapy and lasts about 3 weeks. Standard oral hygiene includes several mouthwashes that may be chosen for prophylactic and therapeutic use, however, there are only a few studies which compare their efficacy in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A consensus protocol regarding prophylaxis and treatment of oral mucositis is needed for this population of patients. General Objectives- To compare the efficacy of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% povidone iodine mouthwash in the prevention of oral lesions in acute lymphoblastic leukemic children receiving chemotherapy. Specific Objectives- 1. To determine the demographic and clinical data of the participants as to:  a) sex  b) age  c) type of leukemia  d) phase of chemotherapy 2. To determine the effect of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash and  1% povidone iodine mouthwash in the prevention and treatment of oral lesions in acute lymphoblastic leukemic children receiving chemotherapy as to: a) incidence  b) severity of oral lesions c) duration of symptoms 3. To determine any side effects of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash and 1% povidone iodine mouthwash
Methodology: Prospective, randomized controlled, non-blinded, two period cross-over trial. The study will be conducted at the Santo Tomas University Hospital and Benavides Cancer Institute (STUH-BCI). Twenty eligible children ages 6 to 18 years old diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia who are undergoing chemotherapy will be divided into two groups. Group 1 will be rinse with 10 mL of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash twice daily, and Group 2 will rinse with 15 mL of 1% povidone iodine mouthwash twice daily, for 14 days during the first period of study. Alkaline saline mouthrinse will be used by the subjects during the 2 week washout time between the two periods of study. The two groups will then switch mouthrinses during the second study period. The occurrence of ulcerative lesions and severity of mucositis will be measured at baseline and twice weekly of each study period, using the Oral Mucositis Assessment Scale and World Health Organization Grading Scale. If oral mucositis/ulceration develops during either period and persists beyond 14 days, the subjects will continue to use the mouthwash assigned to their group until lesions heal.
