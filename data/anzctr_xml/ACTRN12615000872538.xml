    <concealment>Once patient consent is obtained, the patient will be randomised into Group A (Standard INF, 50 mcg/mL) or Group B (Concentrated INF, 300 mcg/mL). The patient randomization list is prepared in advance by a member of the research team who will have no contact with patients and have no role in assigning patients to treatment groups. The randomization list is prepared using a computer-generated programme. A sealed envelope attached to each study pack will contain the allocation group, and study packs will be used sequentially.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Baseline data including age, sex, weight and diagnosis will be described as median with interquartile range and number with percentage as appropriate.  Pain and sedation scores at each time point will be described as median with interquartile range.  Change in VAS score from T0 to each other time point will be described as mean reduction (with positive being shift towards the left of the scale) in millimetres with 95% confidence interval.  The difference in the mean VAS reduction scores between the two groups will be assessed using a Mann Whitney U test. Change in sedation scores will be described as median change with interquartile range.  The other categorical outcomes of descriptions of amount of change and satisfaction will be described as number and percentage, as will be adverse events of different types.  Some comparison of outcome measures between those who received only the initial 1.4 mcg/kg fentanyl dose and those who received the additional 0.7 mcg/kg dosage at T15 may be performed depending on frequency of the latter dosage addition.  
Sample size calculations: There is general literature agreement that the clinically significant reduction in severe pain score is between 15-30 mm on the 10cm visual analog scale.   Based on the available literature and the mean change and standard deviation derived from an earlier pilot study, power of 0.8, alpha of 0.05, a sample of 45 patients per group would be required to detect a difference in reduction of VAS score by 15 mm. Recruitment of 110 patients (55 per group) would allow a further 20% 'leeway' to cover the patient drop-outs, incomplete data etc.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Pain is a common presenting symptom in the emergency department. For moderate to severe pain, standard treatment is an intravenously administered opioid. But this can be associated with pain, inconvenience and delay as it requires the insertion of an intravenous cannula. The intranasal route of administration of opioids offers an attractive alternative as it is non invasive and does not require intravenous access. It also provides an alternative where intravenous access is difficult or not required and where nausea and vomiting prevent oral drug administration. In a number of patients intravenous access may then be completely avoided. 
IN Fentanyl is already commonly used in the paediatric population where more invasive methods of drug delivery (intravenous or intramuscular) may result in significant discomfort, anxiety and increased stress during a hospital visit. For adults who require larger doses of fentanyl, there is a concentrated version available (CINF), hower it is not generally used in emergency departments due to its cost. (An ampoule of concentrated INF (300mcg/mL) is $28.14 and the standard INF (50mcg/mL) is 56 cents. 
We have recently completed a pilot study of concentrated INF in 41 adult patients presenting to Frankston ED with moderate to severe pain. (CINF was specifically purchased for this study funded by a grant by the PHREC). Our results showed that CINF was a safe, well tolerated and efficacious in this patient population. 
The standard INF which is inexpensive and widely available has not been studied in adults in the acute setting as has been done in children. 
We are proposing a randomised equivalence study of CINF versus the SINF, which is readily available in the ED at a fraction of the cost. If equivalence is proven then standard concentration can be recommended for IN use in adults.
A similar study was performed by Borland et al. in children and found that the two formulations of IN fentanyl were equally effective at reducing pain scores.
Hypothesis: standard intranasal fentanyl (SINF) and concentrated intranasal fentanyl (CINF) are equally effective and safe in reducing moderate to strong pain in adult patients in the ED.</summary>
