             investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to
             return to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that
             would compromise their participation and follow-up in this study.

          2. Women who are pregnant.

          3. Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that
             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          4. Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 6 month(s).

          5. Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

          6. Subjects who have osteonecrosis of the femoral neck

          7. Subjects who have an existing contralateral hip, ankle or knee replacement or an
             ipsilateral knee or ankle replacement or any metal implant in the lower lumber spine
             (navigated cases only).

          8. Subjects who are greater than 90kg in weight.

          9. Subject who have a CCD angle of the anatomical femur less than 125Â°

         10. Subjects with significant bone loss or gross deformity in the region of the neck of
             the femur as identified on the pre-operative radiographs, where in the Investigator's
             opinion, there could be considerable migration of the prosthesis or a significant
             chance of fracture of the femoral shaft and/or the lack of adequate bone to support
             the prosthesis.

         11. Subjects with a Charnley C classification.

         12. Subjects with an active local or systemic infection.

         13. Subjects with loss of musculature, neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency in
             the affected limb rendering the arthroplasty procedure unjustified.

         14. Subjects with Paget's disease

         15. Subjects who still plan in the future to have children.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine if the Silent hip, when used as part of an
      artificial hip joint, is stable and effective in treatment of patients with joint disease
      requiring a total hip replacement. Patients who enter the study will be evaluated at regular
      intervals following hip surgery using patient, clinical, standard and special x-rays (RSA) to
      allow the position of the Silent Hip within the bone to be accurately monitored.</summary>
