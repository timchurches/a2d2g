  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will include 12 weeks of high intensity intermittent exercise and ingestion of green tea.  Groups will be control, exercise, green tea, and green tea/exercise.  The exercise group will perform high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) three times per week for 12 weeks.  Each session will be 20 minutes duration and will involve sprinting on a stationary bike for 8 seconds and easy pedaling for 12 seconds. This is repeated for the 20 minutes.  Each session will be supervised and heart rate will be monitored throughout.  The speed of pedaling will be 110 revolutions per minute and the resistance on the bike will be 60% of each subject's VO2max which will be assessed at the start and end of the trial.  Typically, the resistance on the bike will be from .75 to 1.5 kg.  The green supplementation group will ingest 1500 mg of commercial green tea (GNC Herbal Plus) in capsule form (3 capsules), containing 375 mg of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Each capsule, containing 125 mg EGCG, will be ingested after each meal.  This is the standard dose in these kinds of green tea trials.  The exercise/green tea group will ingest the green tea and perform the exercise.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project aims to determine if 12 weeks (three times per week) of high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) and green tea consumption leads to significant fat loss and improvements in metabolic markers for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in overweight men.  We have shown that HIIE leads to significant fat loss and increase in insulin sensitivity in women and now want to demonstrate this effect in men. The ability of HIIE to increase catecholamline secretion may be the reason why this form of exercise combined with green tea consumption results in more fat loss compared to exercise such as walking and jogging.  

We hypothesize that exposure to 12 weeks of HIIE and green tea will result in:
-	significant subcutaneous and visceral fat loss
-	significant increases in insulin sensitivity 
-	significant increases in aerobic and anaerobic fitness 

We also hypothesize that:
-	greater hepatic fat loss will occur when green tea is consumed with HIIE</summary>
