  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Contracture after stroke is a condition that causes pain and disability in adults with hemiplegia after stroke. It is commonly treated by using hand splints. This trial aimed to evaluate the effect of two types of hand splints used clinically during rehabilitation to prevent contracture: a hand splint that positions the wrist in neutral and a hand splint that positions the wrist in extension. The trials primary hypotheses were (i) do commonly prescribed hand splints prevent contracture in people with hemiplegia after stroke, and (ii) do commonly prescribed hand splints improve function, and reduce pain and/or spasticity in people with hemiplegia following stroke. The trial assessed changes in outcomes at four weeks (following removal of splints) and at six weeks (follow-up). All outcomes were measured by a research assistant blind to treatment group allocation.</summary>
