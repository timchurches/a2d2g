  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing ovarian stimulation will be randomised into a mild and moderate starting dose of gonadotrophins.

Mild stimulation: 150 international units (IU) Menopur subcutaneous injection daily for 7 days starting on Day 2-3 (D2-3) of natural menstruation without oral contraceptive pill (OCP) pretreatment. Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist subcutaneous injection daily to commence Day 5 (D5) of Menopur until trigger criteria reached. Injections administered by fertility nurse with minimum five years' experience or patient under direction of nurse. First bloods and scan Day 5 (D5) of Menopur. Alternate day bloods and scan to monitor response until trigger criteria reached (see below). No dose adjustment allowed. If &gt;16 days follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) without meeting trigger criteria patient withdrawn from study. Patient compliance measured by monitoring remaining gonadotrophin doses from prescription.

Trigger criteria: Leuprolide acetate or triptorelin acetate 0.2mg administered by subcutaneous injection to patients according to treating physician choice within 24 hours of developing 3 follicles of 17mm diameter or greater. 

Oocyte Pick Up (OPU): 34-38 hours after trigger. Aspirate all follicles greater than 12mm. Definition of oocyte retrieved equivalent to cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs). 

In vitro fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (IVF/ICSI) according to unit clinical protocols. 

Culture to blastocyst stage then trophectoderm biopsy at D5 or D6 all BB stage or above.

Vitrify all biopsied blastocysts. 

Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS): Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based preimplantation genetic screening using VeriSeq protocol as per Illumina. 

Transfer euploid embryos sequentially in frozen cycles with appropriate endometrial preparation.

Overall duration of intervention equivalent to standard IVF cycle and will be abandoned if &gt; 16 days FSH injections without adequate clinical response. </interventions>
    <comparator>Moderate stimulation: 300 international units (IU) Menopur subcutaneous injection daily for 7 days starting on Day 2-3 (D2-3) of natural menstruation without oral contraceptive pill (OCP) pretreatment. Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) antagonist subcutaneous injection daily to commence Day 5 (D5) of Menopur until trigger criteria reached. Injections administered by fertility nurse with minimum five years' experience or patient under direction of nurse. Dose adjustment permitted from 300IU to 225 IU per day or cancel cycle any day after Day 5 if clinician judges unacceptable risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. First bloods and scan Day 5 (D5) of Menopur. Alternate day bloods and scan to monitor response until trigger criteria reached (see below). If &gt;16 days follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) without meeting trigger criteria patient withdrawn from study. Patient compliance measured by monitoring remaining gonadotrophin doses from prescription.

    <statisticalmethods>We have powered the study to show a difference in proportion of euploid embryos per group based on the Baart et al. (2007) study. In addition, we will conduct a post-hoc non-inferiority analysis if possible based on the recorded standard deviation (analysis below). 

Study Sample size and power calculations:	

To show a difference in proportion of euploid embryos from 37% to 55% (moderate stimulation versus mild stimulation, based on Baart et al. 2007) with 0.8 power and 0.05 type 1 error rate the study requires 120 patients per group (240 patients total). 

Statistical Analysis:
	
Depending on the recorded variance our study will be able to demonstrate a non-inferiority margin of 0.75 embryos per patient if SD &lt;/= 1.75 based on expected recruitment. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hypothesis:
Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using conventional ovarian stimulation leads to a lower proportion of euploid embryos per patient than using mild ovarian stimulation when tested using the gold standard of 24 chromosome screening at D5-D6 of development.

Primary Objective:
To determine and compare the mean proportion of oocytes that develop to provide euploid vitrified blastocysts per patient resulting from conventional vs low dose stimulation protocol. 

Secondary Objectives:
Number of euploid vitrified blastocysts per patient, number of 2PN preembryos
generated, total number of embryos surviving to D5-D6 and total number of blastocysts biopsied. Quality of the oocytes generated using conventional vs. low dose stimulation protocols using mtDNA copy number. OHSS resulting in hospitalisation. Incidence of dose adjustment or cycle cancellation.</summary>
