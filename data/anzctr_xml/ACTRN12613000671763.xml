  <interventions>
    <interventions>A step training system will be provided to participants. This will consist of a computer unit, a dongle and a step pad. The participants TV will be used for the display screen. The dongle will be plugged into the computer and link with the step pad. In addition, a USB modem will be provided to enable the upload of data to a central server via the internet.

Intervention participants will play the exergames (exercise + video games) by giving step responses on the pad. Several games will be played: a modified version of Tetris (rotation of down-drifting objects), a choice stepping reaction time task (rapid stepping), Dance Dance Revolution (step coordination including go/no-go tasks and tasks of divided attention), and a Trail-Stepping task (set-shifting). In all games, participants are required to step after or while solving cognitive tasks thus combining balance training and cognitive exercises. They will receive feedback about their performance. 

Participants will be asked to play as many times as they want with the recommended dose of 3 or more sessions per week for 20 minutes for a period of 3 months. 

The intervention will be unsupervised and participants will exercise in their own homes. Instructions will be provided at the beginning of the study period when the system is installed. To encourage adherence, participants will be contacted by phone after weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 or if data upload shows non-adherence in between (non-use of the system for 5 days). In addition participants will be provided with a phone number to call if they have questions or problems related to system.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants in the control group will be provided with written health advice at the beginning of the trial and asked to maintain their usual activities. Participants will be provided with a phone number which they can call if they have questions or problems related to content of the educational material.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical/physiological fall-risk assessed by the Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA); this assessment involves tests of contrast sensitivity, lower limb proprioception, knee extension strength, postural sway and simple reaction time. An overall score is generated from these 5 sub-scores with higher scores indicate a higher fall risk.</outcome>
      <timepoint>3 months (end of intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Stroop Stepping Test (SST) will be used as a measure of combined stepping and executive functioning. In the centre of a display screen an arrow appears pointing in one of four directions (front, right, back, left). Inside this arrow is a written word indicating a different direction. Participants are required to step by the word and ignore the orientaion of the arrow.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Concern about falling will be assessed with the Icon-FES. Using an iconographic questionnaire, pictures are presented and participants are required to rate their concern of having a fall while doing particular activities on a 4 point Likert scale. Higher scores indicate higher concern.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depressive symptoms will be measured using the 9 item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Different cutpoints for different levels of depressive symptoms/clinical depression have been established. Higher scores indicate an increased likelihood of depression.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Specific cognitive functions will be assessed using a range of neuropsychological tests. 
The Trailmaking Test will be used to assess attention and executive functioning (set-shifting). Participants are required to connect numbers (A) or alternating numbers and letters (B) in ascending order. The difference score (Trails B minus Trails A) will also be taken to provide a measure of executive functioning removing the motor speed component.
The digit symbol test assesses processing speed and working memory. Participants are required to match symbols to numbers as quickly as possible. 
The attentional network test will be used to measure three independent networks of attention (orienting, alerting and executive function). During this reaction time test paradigm, participants respond with button presses to arrow directions. Different stimuli (simple arrows, sets of five arrows, flanker tasks) and cueing (no cueing, spatial cueing, timed cueing) are used.
The Stroop task measures selective attention and response inhibition using the interference of different colour-word presentations.
To measure visuo-spatial performance, a mental rotation task will be used. Participants are required to determine whether shapes that are rotated clockwise/anti-clockwise are the same or different shapes.
A dual task will be used to assess divided attention. The Timed up and go test (see below) will be administered with a concurrent cognitive task.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Functional mobility will be assessed using the Timed up and go test (TUG) and Sit-to-stand test. The TUG requires participants to stand up from a normal height armed chair, walk three meters at a self-selected comfortable walking speed, turn, walk back and sit down again. The time to complete the test is recorded. The Sit-to-Stand test requires participants  to stand up and sit down five times as fast as possible from a normal height chair with their arms crossed over the chest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Choice Stepping Reaction Time (CSRT) will be assessed using the same step pad as used in the intervention. Participants step as quickly as they can in different step directions indicated by arrows changing their color on the screen.</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome> To test reactive stepping responses the Push and Release test will be used. Participants are required to lean backwards and push against the hands of the assessor. The assessor suddenly releases his hands and observes the stepping response of participants to recover balance. Recovery is rated on a scale from 0 (one sufficiently large step to recover balance) to 4 (no step response).</outcome>
      <timepoint>after 3 months</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Falls data will be acquired using falls calendars and the ProFaNE definiton for falls.</outcome>
      <timepoint>monthly falls calendars (with follow-up telephone calls as required) for 6 months from randomisation</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>between-group:

Differences at baseline will be explored using Chi square (discrete variables) and Student t-tests (continuous variables).
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyse group differences for all continuous outcome variables adjusting for baseline performance. Negative binomial regression will be used to test for differences in fall rates between groups.

The Alpha level will be set to 5%.

within-group:

Paired t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA will be used to analyse changes within groups and to explore subgroups (e.g. different doses) in the intervention group.

The estimated sample size is based on the effects of a pilot study for the Stroop Stepping Test as outcome measure (effect size f=0.3443374, ANCOVA, Alpha 5%, Power 80%, Numerator df  1, Number of groups 2, Number of covariates 1 (same variable at baseline, 20% drop out).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>With advanced ageing, physical and cognitive functions decline and these age-related changes increase the risk of falls. Above the age of 65 years, about one third of individuals experience at least one fall every year with about half of those who fall in this period do so multiple times.

As stepping and specific cognitive functions are risk factors for falls in older people, this study aims at improving these functions to reduce risk. 

In this randomised controlled trial, participants will use low-cost computer game technology to play a range of games that combine stepping and specific cognitive functions. Earlier studies have shown that this intervention type and mode of delivery is feasible and safe. In this phase III trial, participants will be recommended to perform the exergames three or more times per week for 20 minutes for a period of three months.

At the end of the trial, physical and cognitive functions associated with fall risk will be assessed. Falls will also be recorded over a period of six months. Using this novel approach of delivery, we hypothesize that playing exergames can improve both physical and cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of falls.
