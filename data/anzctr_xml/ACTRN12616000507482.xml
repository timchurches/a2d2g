  <interventions>
    <interventions>During the trial, standardised food and drinks will be provided to the participants before, during  and after the intake of human gas capsule to observe the effect of diet and establishing the baseline. Only one capsule is taken during the trials. In these trials, we don't assess intervention adherence or fidelity.
One day before the clinical trial (T=0 h breakfast time/ baseline) the intake of the standard diet starts to establish the baseline. At T= 24 h the capsule is taken by the participant with breakfast. This clinical trial will be conducted for 32 h. The capsule takes samples of the gases of the gut continuously every five minutes and sends them out to an external data acquisition system, in which the participants will need to attach around the waist (or keep in the vicinity of their body when sleeping) after the capsule intake, which is the duration of 32 h . Post-trial follow-up will be conducted for up to 7 days by monitoring the participants daily stool sample to ensure the capsule has left the participants body.

Standardised food:

Three meals per day with some small snacks in between will be served to the volunteers. The conventional timing for the meals are used: 8 am breakfast, 12 pm lunch, 4 pm a small snack and 7-8 pm dinner. The participants will be divided into two groups equally, for which one group will be only served with high fibre meal and the other will be on low fibre meal. The meal will start to be provided to each participant one day before the clinical trial and continue for the whole clinical trial period. 
High fibre meal (that includes ~30 g dietary fibre per serving):
3/4 cup wholegrain breakfast cereal, 2 slices of wholemeal bread, 1 apple (with skin) and 1 orange, 2 cups mixed raw vegetable, 1/2 cup baked beans and 1 cup of fruit juice with pulp
Low fibre meal (that includes less than 5 g dietary fibre per serving):
2-3 slices of white bread or pancake without nuts and seeds, 1 small bowl of white rice with tofu, and a few crackers with spread of butter, 1 bowl of refined hot cereals, such as cream of wheat, and 1 cup of vegetable juice with no pulp 

human gas capsule: 

Capsule components: the main components of the human gas capsules are similar to the components of the commercial camera and pH capsules in the market. The difference is that the pH sensor or camera is replaced by gas sensors and gas permeative membranes. The main components include: safe and low current silver oxide batteries, electronic boards, gas sensors, gas permeative membranes and the bio compatible shell of the capsule.    </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The raw data of the intestinal gas profile are extracted against time. They are then converted into meaningful gas concentration values in volume percentage (vol%) or part per million (ppm) based on the pre-calibration results of the human gas capsule before the clinical trial. The meal intake time will be plotted in the profile for result interpretation. Possible identification of gas types and concentrations in different sections of gastrointestinal tract will be analysed based on the previously reported in vivo and in vitro studies.
The plan is to have equal number of male and female participants (12 + 12) and we hope that this number gives us an acceptable baseline in our measurements (measurements on gas constituents of the gut by Levitt et al. (Gastroenterology, vol. 59, pp. 921-929, (1970)) used a total of less than 15 participants  so our chosen of 24 number will result in a better statistical outcome). No formal sample size calculation was performed,</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to obtain a real-time gas profile of the entire gastrointestinal tract of healthy human volunteers on a standardised diet using a novel medical device entitled human gas capsule. The clinical trial will also evaluate the viability of the gas capsule in the human body, accessibility of the graphical user interface for the data acquisition system and the reliability of the data analysis.</summary>
