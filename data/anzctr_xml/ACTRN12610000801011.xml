  <interventions>
    <interventions>The conditions to be observed are non-obstructive coronary artery disease and obstructive coronary artery disease for a period of 12 months. 
This will involve an observational and prospective, longitudinal follow-up (12 months) of health status outcomes in patients presenting for coronary angiography for the investigation of chest pain, who show either obstructive or non-obstructive coronary artery disease on angiography. Patients who undergo coronary angiography at either the Queen Elizabeth Hospital or Lyell McEwin Hospital, in Adelaide, Australia will be approached for consenting prior angiography. Health status outcomes to be investigated include health-related quality of life, and clinical characteristics at angiography and then at 1, 6 and 12 months following angiography.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to evaluate the natural history and health outcomes of patients with chest pain who have non-obstructive coronary artery disease. These patients traditionally have been though to have a benign prognosis and frequently have their symptoms trivialized.  Despite this, persistence of chest pain symptoms is common and limited therapeutic strategies cause significant morbidity in these patients. This is in contrast patients who have obstructive coronary artery disease, who although are at increased risk of mortality, receive attention and experience symptom relief with medication and surgical interventions.  There is limited longitudinal data available assessing and evaluating patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease, especially utilizing valid and reproducible health status assessments  and also comparing them to other patients who experience similar symptoms but have a clear etiology for their pain. This is important since the incidence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease may be as high as 30% of angiograms performed. Thus this study aims to evaluate the health status of patients who undergo coronary angiography for chest pain who show non-obstructive coronary artery disease and compare these to patients who undergo the procedure and show obstructive coronary artery disease, for a period of 12 months following index angiography.</summary>
