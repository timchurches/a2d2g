  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of fractions being successfully delivered with Calypso-guided tracking. - The primary endpoint of this Pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing realtime adaptive radiotherapy using DMLC. This will be assessed as greater than 95% of fractions being successfully delivered (no equipment failures and tracking MLC follows beacons) with Calypso-guided tracking.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in overall beam-target geometric alignment. - Geometric alignment will be measured as average difference between beacon centroid and shifted MLC against original MLC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in dosimetric coverage of prostate and normal healthy structures. - Dosimetric improvement will be assessed by applying the methods of Poulsen to reconstruct delivered dose distributions for each fraction of patient cohort and summed total dose. Preliminary data demonstrates dose reconstruction to follow the planned dose distribution, potentially even for ultrahypofractionated cases with longer treatment duration and Flattening Filter Free (FFF) delivery with larger potential delivery error per time increment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acute toxicity - Portion of patients with grade 3 or greater genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity assessed using the Modified Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Toxicity Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed up to 12 weeks post treatment</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Late toxicity - Ongoing reporting of gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity of the DMLC tracking cohort will be compared to matched pair controls using the modified RTOG scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to five years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Biochemical control - Ongoing biochemical control of the DMLC tracking cohort will be compared to matched pair controls using Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to five years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to monitor movement of the prostate during radiotherapy and
      adjust the radiation beam to account for any motion seen. This will increase the radiation
      dose to the prostate and decrease the dose to the rectum and bladder.</summary>
