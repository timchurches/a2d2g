    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The surgical registrar / surgeon informs the acute theatre nurse coordinator that the patient will be a trial patient. The coordinator can then ensure the Theatre Trial Pack is available in theatre 2. The randomisation stream – Uncomplicated or Complicated – will need to be communicated to the theatre nursing staff.
The circulating nurse takes the top envelope from the appropriate pile – Uncomplicated or Complicated – and opens the sealed envelope to determine the allocation arm – Humidifier On or Off. 
It is essential that the allocation is not revealed to the medical staff or the scrub nurse. It is essential that the allocation is not revealed to the medical staff or the scrub nurse.</concealment>
    <sequence>Random number generator using http://randomization.com. Stratification will take place for clinically generalised peritonitis (complicated) versus clinically localised appendicitis (uncomplicated).
Randomisation allocations placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes, a set for each stratification group. 
The sequence will be concealed until recruitment is complete.
In theatre, at the request of the surgeon (surgical registrar) the circulating nurse will open the top envelope from either the peritonitis or localised appendicitis pile, as requested.
Prior to insufflation the circulating nurse will turn the humidifier on for patients randomised to the intervention arm, and leave it turned off for control patients.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In laparoscopic surgery, the use of dry, cold insufflation gas (to inflate the abdominal cavity for a clear view of operating field) results in the drying of the lining of the cavity, which has been suggested to be a negative determinant of length of recovery. Adult studies using warm humidified insufflation gas were suggestive of decreased post-operative pain, decreased fogging of the camera lens, decreased operative time and decreased length of Post-Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) stay - although findings were variable. No such studies have been done in children. This study will be the first in the paediatric population, aiming to measure; post-operative pain using the amount of PCA (patient controlled analgesia) morphine use; pain score; length of PACU and hospital stay and fogging of camera using Laparoscopic Fogging Criteria.</summary>
