    <designfeatures>Recruitment of study participants:

Participants will be recruited from those people who are referred to the IDS because of their challenging behaviours. Normal criteria for referral to the Behavioural Support Team (BST) is:
*	the client must have an intellectual disability (ID), 
*	must be over seventeen years of age and 
*	have challenging behaviours that impact on themselves or others, placing them at risk. 
Each referral is discussed at the weekly multidisciplinary meeting and if it is accepted the referral is then discussed at a further BST meeting where it is placed on a waiting list.  One of two possibilities will then occur.
1.	The referral is allocated to a clinicians caseload and after an initial assessment the client could be re-referred to the researcher to complete the next  Social Skills and Realtionship (SS&amp;R )course.
2.	The BST decided to place the client directly onto the SS&amp;R course wait list. 
An additional criterion for attendance to any SS&amp;R course offered by the BST is that a component of the clients challenging behaviour must be of a sexual nature. If members of the BST believe the client requires education regarding sexuality and relationships, the client will be referred to the SS&amp;R course. 
 
Each potential client will be invited to participate in this research.  If they choose to participate they will be:
1.	Asked for permission to use their data from the pre &amp; post ASK assessments
2.	They will participate in the SS&amp;R course which will be run over 8 weeks for 90 minutes per week.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The stated goal of the research project is to determine the effect of undertaking a Social Skills and Relationship (SS&amp;R) course which will impact on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to sexuality for people with an intellectual disability (ID).  

A well-used and respected tool within the Behaviour Support Team (BST) is the  Assessment of Sexual Knowledge (ASK).  This is the main tool currently available to the researcher and her BST colleagues when assessing clients sexual knowledge.  One of the components for the research project is to analyse the scores of the pre and post ASK assessments for each of the SS&amp;R Course participants to determine if the programme has been tailored to suit the individual educational needs of the group.  It is envisaged an increase in scores may occur in the clients scores once the programme is completed. 

The ASK involves a series of pictures being shown to the client and a number of set questions, that are sequentially graded are asked by the administrator of the ASK.  The clients answers are recorded on set answer sheets by the administrator and a standardised scoring system is utilised.  The ASK has high levels of test-retest reliability of 76% and can be utilised to test individuals both prior to commencing an education programme and again upon its completion.

    <publicnotes>After meeting with the HDEC committee, they suggested  inviting the then current group of clients who were attending the pilot SS&amp;R group to participate in the study as HDEC  viewed the  study as an audit. 
Peliminary approval for the study was granted subject to a few word changes on the participant consent form.  Full approval has now been received.</publicnotes>
