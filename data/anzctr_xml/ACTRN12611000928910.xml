    <studytitle>Safety of a Rapid Infusion Protocol for Administration of Intravenous Iron Polymaltose</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>This study will assess the immediate (during infusion) and delayed (up to 5 days) adverse events associated with rapid (over 1 hour) administration of intravenous iron polymaltose compared to standard administration (over 6 hours) in patients receiving iron infusions for iron deficiency in a hospital based outpatient setting.</scientifictitle>

    <interventions>Intravenous Iron Polymaltose
Dose of iron polymaltose will be calculated based on the patients weight and haemoglobin level. A dosing table will be used in line with the organisations current intravenous iron policy. For participants who have been randomised to receive the rapid infusion the maximum dose of iron they will receive will be capped at 1500mg. 
Rapid intravenous administration over approximately 1 hour.
Dose prescribed (up to a maximum of 1500mg) mixed with 250mls of Normal Saline. 
Commencement of a test dose at a rate of 40mls/hr for 15 minutes. If tolerated the infusion will be increased to a rate of 250mls/hr until the end of the infusion.
The rapid infusion differs from the standard in that the volume of normal saline is half and the rate of the infusion will be approximately 1 hour as opposed to the standard rate of approximately 6 hours.</interventions>

Dose prescribed (up to 2500mg) mixed with 500mls of Normal Saline.
Commencement of a test dose at a rate of 20mls/hr for 30 minutes then, 40mls/hr for 30 minutes, then 90mls/hr for 30 minutes and then 120mls/hr for the remainder of the infusion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of adverse events experienced by participants during the infusion.

Potential adverse events may include; flushing, welts, rash, urticaria, headache, nausea and vomiting and bronchospasm. Less common adverse events may include; joint and muscle spasm, faintness, tachycardia, sweating, dizziness, syncope, hypotension and circulatory collapse, chest and back pain, arthralgia, chills, fever, angioneurotic oedema and generalised lymphadenopathy. 
Adverse events will be graded in terms of severity. Mild - no observable patient discomfort. Moderate - observable patient discomfort. Severe - distress or cardiorespiratory compromise. Mild events will be assessed by the registered Nurses giving the infusion. Moderate or severe events will be assessed by a medical officer.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During and on completion of the infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The rate of delayed adverse events experienced by participants.
Adverse events will be graded in terms of severity. Mild - no daily activity limitation. Moderate - some daily activity limitation. Severe - requiring bed rest or medical assistance. The events will be assessed by a study investigator through a follow up phone call at 5 days post infusion. This investigator will be blinded as to whether the participant received the standard or the rapid dose.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 5 days following infusion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The type and severity of adverse events experienced by participants during and in the 5 days following the infusion.
Events during the infusion will be assessed by the registered nurses giving the infusion in the case of mild events and by a medical officer for moderate to severe events. A study investigator will assess delayed events via a telephone call to the participant 5 days following the infusion.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During and in the 5 days following infusion.</timepoint>

    <concealment>All potential participants information sent to study co-ordinator by the out patient unit when a booking has been made for them to receive their inron infusion.
Study co-ordinator will assess suitability for inclusion into study using initial iron infusion referral criteria and  electronic medical records. 
If criteria met study co-ordinator will contact patient by telephone, inform them of the study and confirm patient is suitable for inclusion. Study co-ordinator will then send out the participant information sheet and consent form. 
On day of infusion a study investigator will assess the patient and gain written consent. 
Allocation of treatment (allocation concealment).
Registered nurses within the out patients department will, following consent, take the next sequentially numbered opaque envelope containing either the rapid or standard iron administration protocol. They will then proceed to give the iron infusion as stated.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Iron deficiency anaemia is a common problem in the community. While many patients can tolerate oral iron supplements to replenish iron stores and correct the anaemia, a significant minority of patients, either cannot absorb oral iron or have side-effects which preclude its use. These patients are eligible to receive intravenous iron. Guidelines for use of intravenous iron indicate that it should be infused slowly (taking approximately 6 hours). This is inconvenient for patients, takes considerable nursing resource and limits access to outpatient day stay facilities. Anecdotal experience and a recent published paper suggest that intravenous iron can be given much faster (taking approximately 60 min), without undue side-effects. This will be a randomised study between rapid infusion and standard infusion rates of intravenous iron with immediate and delayed side-effects noted. If the rapid infusion rate is well tolerated this would then become the standard of care at the host institution.</summary>
