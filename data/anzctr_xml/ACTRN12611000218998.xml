  <interventions>
    <interventions>A nasoduodenal feeding tube will be inserted through the nose and positioned in the proximal duodenum using the Cortrak device. Between t = 60 and 120 min infusion of 0.9% saline into the duodenum. At t = 120 min, an intraduodenal glucose infusion will begin (32 g glucose together with 3 g 3-oxy-methyl-D-glucose (3-OMG) in water to a total volume of 120mL, and infused over 60 minutes ~ 2 kcal/min). Participants will undergo this intervention once, after consent has been granted by the next of kin.</interventions>
    <comparator>Healthy Volunteers will undergo the same process of having saline, glucose and 3-OMG infused via a nasoduodenal feeding tube like the participants in the intervention group. 

Once the nasoduodenal tube has been inserted(t=0), a one hour observational period will commence. At t=60, a saline infusion will begin for a period of 60 minutes, thus enabling the subject to be his/her own control.

The control will be administered to the participants once.

The duration of each session is 4 hours from insertion to removal of the nasoduodenal tube in healthy volunteers.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to investigate the effect of critical illness on blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract during feeding and the absorption of sugar in older patients. We hypothesize that the change in blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract during feeding and the absorption of sugar in ICU patients will be less than that of healthy volunteers. This may indicate a possible mechanism for malabsorption during critical illness or alternatively, when to start feeding critically ill patients via the gastrointestinal route.</summary>
