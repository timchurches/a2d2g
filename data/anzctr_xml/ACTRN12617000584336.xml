  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an prosepctive observational study of individuals with gender dysphoria about to commence cross sex hormone therapy. Treatment is not affected by the individuals participation in the study and individuals receive the same treatment regardless of participation in this study. The study involves 5 visits at an Australian urban tertiary hospital Endocrinology Department over 24 months.
Baseline: history, physical examination, quality of life questionnaires, bloods, DXA, HRpQCT 
3 months: history, physical examination, quality of life questionnaires, bloods
6, 12, 24 months: history, physical examination, quality of life questionnaires, bloods, DXA, HRpQCT</interventions>
    <comparator>Female and male controls will be recruited and undergo the same study visit schedule as described above. Controls may not have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and must not be receiving treatment with cross sex hormones, anti-androgens or other agents that may affect bone health. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective observational study looking at bone health in transgender individuals. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes that occur during cross sex hormone therapy for gender dysphoria, in particular changes to the architecture of bones but also to muscle mass, fat mass, cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life. We will recruit participants  just about to start on hormone therapy (i.e. have not previously taken gender hormones in the past) .

We plan to review participants 5 times over a 2 year period and will be using DXA/body composition scans as well as a specialised bone CT scan. We will also be performing blood tests and quality of life surveys. </summary>
