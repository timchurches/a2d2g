    <scientifictitle>The feasibility and preliminary clinical utility of 11C-Methionine and 18F-Fluorothymidine Positron Emission Tomography-Computerised Tomography (PET-CT) imaging following radiotherapy and 2-3 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high grade glioma in order to assess time to progression, overall survival and 6 month progression-free survival.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>11C-Methionine (C-MET) and 18F-Fluorothymidine (FLT) imaging will be performed on all consenting eligible patients receiving adjuvant temozolomide containing chemotherapy, at the same time as their routine mid-treatment Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. Current routine care at our institution involves an MRI following 3 cycles of adjuvant temozolamide chemotherapy. Several clinical trials are however commencing which require an MRI after 2 cycles of temozolamide chemotherapy and thus the protocol will allow the C-MET and FLT PET-CT scans to coincide with the patients planned MRI scan which will be performed either after cycle 2 or 3 of adjuvant chemotherapy. A cycle is defined as temozolomide administered days 1-5 every 28 days. Patients who are not treated in this way will not be eligible. Information on the number of cycles will be obtained from the treating medical oncologist; start dates of each cycle will be recorded.
For the C-MET PET-CT scan intravenous dose administered will be 300 MBq/m2 according to patient body surface area (BSA). For the FLT PET-CT scan intravenous dose administered will be 100 MBq/m2 according to patient BSA</interventions>

      <outcome>Time to progression with progression as defined by MacDonald criteria</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival.  Patients will be followed clinically to determine outcome.   Survival will be measured both from date of diagnosis (ie: date of original pathological diagnosis) and from date of post cycle 2 or 3 MRI.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up of patients will be performed for at least 6 months after study entry to determine outcome.  Follow-up will be until the censorship date (when all patients have been followed for at least 6 months) or until deceased.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival. Patients will be followed clinically to determine outcome. Progression will be determined by MRI scans, performed 3 monthly or more frequently if required. Radiological progression will be defined as per the Macdonald criteria (MacDonald DR, Cascino TL, Schold SC, Cairncross JG. 1990. Response Criteria for Phase II studies of Supratentorial Malignant Glioma. J Clin Oncol;8(7):1277-1280), with 25% or more increase in the size of the product of the cross-sectional diameters of the enhancing tumour, or unequivocal presence of new lesions</outcome>
      <timepoint>6 months. Progression  free survival  will be measured both from date of diagnosis (ie: date of original pathological diagnosis) and from date of post cycle 2 or 3 MRI. Follow-up will be until the censorship date (when all patients have been followed for at least 6 months )  or until  progression has been confirmed.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This pilot study aims to gain preliminary information on the utility of C-MET and FLT PET-CT imaging for distinguishing pseudoprogression from true progression in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy for high grade glioma. C-MET and FLT PET-CT scans will be performed at the same time as their routine mid-treatment MRI (after 2-3 cycles of chemotherapy. Patients will be followed to record radiological and clinical responses to chemotherapy. Patients will also be followed up for survival. This data will be used to obtain preliminary information of the prognostic significance of C-MET and FLT PET-CT imaging in glioma</summary>
