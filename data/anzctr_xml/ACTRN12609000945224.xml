  <interventions>
    <interventions>In Group 1 (Comparator), 16 women, the medial pectoral nerve was preserved during the Patey´s mastectomy
duration of this procedure:  mean 101,4 min</interventions>
    <comparator>In Group 2 (Control): 14 women  the medial pectoral nerve was sectioned during the Patey´s mastectomy. The routine Patey`s mastectomy procedure at this service is to section the medial pectoral nerve

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preservation of the medial pectoral nerve and its association with no loss of strength in the pectoralis major muscle, compared with the group of women in whom this nerve was sectioned.

palpation of the pectoralis major muscle compared with sternal insertion was used to evaluate its trophism; and an overload test on the pectoralis major muscle was used to evaluate its strength.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before surgery, 15 and 43 days after surgery</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Loss of muscle mass in the pectoralis major muscle in women in the group with preservation of the medial pectoral nerve, compared with the group of women in whom this nerve was sectioned.  

palpation of the pectoralis major muscle compared with sternal insertion was used to evaluate its trophism</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before surgery, 15 and 43 days after surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Differences between loss of range of shoulder flexion and abduction for the groups of women in whom the medial pectoral nerve was preserved or sectioned.

Goniometry was used to measure the range of movement of the upper limb;</outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>The allocation of the patients was done using sealed envelopes prepared by the computing section of the hospital. In 16 of these women, the medial pectoral nerve was preserved during the mastectomy, while in the remaining 14, this nerve was sectioned during surgery. The routine mastectomy procedure at this service is to section the medial pectoral nerve. To avoid contamination of the groups during the rehabilitation, the incision and consequently the scar was the same in both groups. The physiotherapist was blinded to the kind of surgery that had been performed and the patients were also not informed about the technique.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>The sample size was estimated as 15 patients in each branch of the study. This was based on the study by Merson et al. which found that 54% of the women presented shoulder dysfunction after modified mastectomy with sectioning of the medial pectoralis nerve, while 6% presented shoulder dysfunction when the medial pectoralis nerve was preserved. Alpha and beta were estimated as 5% and 10%, respectively.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Systematic modifications to the surgical technique of mastectomy have been proposed with the objective of minimizing injuries to the pectoral nerves and their effects. The aim of this study was to compare muscle strength and mass of the pectoralis major muscle (PMM) and abduction and flexion of the homolateral upper limb following mastectomy among women with breast cancer undergoing either preservation or sectioning of the medial pectoral nerve (MPN).</summary>
