  <interventions>
    <interventions>20000 women (16-50 years) from 40 general practices (500 per practice) in Victoria, Australia, will be mailed a screening survey. Women who screen positive to being afraid of their partner or ex-partner in the last 12 months will be invited to the next [intervention] stage of the project. The intervention will be multifacted and practice-based involving a professional, patient-oriented and organisational component. For GPs there will be 8 hour training program involving feedback based on the screening of their patients, training in guidelines for IPA management, long-distance education as well as interactive training sessions using simulated patients to improve counselling skills. The patients will subsequently receive 3-6 sessions of brief counselling from their GP. Each session will be 30 minutes in duration and conducted over the phone or on a one-to-one basis. Patients will be surveyed at baseline and then followed for one year after the invitation for counselling from the GP with surveys at 6 and 12 months. The final element of the intervention involves organisational change to promote awareness about IPA throughout the practice through pamphlets and posters.</interventions>
    <comparator>A basic IPA education kit is provided to GPs and women attend their GP as usual (no intervention) - GPs will not be aware of which women are participating in the trial. The comparator observation period is 12 months in duration, commencing from when the invitation to GP counselling is sent to women in the intervention group.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>GP participants must practice in urban or rural areas Victoria, Australia within 150km of Melbourne; have at least 200 women aged 16-50 years that they saw in the last 12 months; use computerised patient registers. To be eligible for screening, patient participants must be female; aged 16-50 years; and have seen the participating GP in the previous 12 months. Women who indicate in the screening survey that they have been afraid of their partner/ex-partner in the previous 12 months and who would like to hear more about the weave project will be eligible for the intervention stage of the study. These women will be contacted by phone based on the information they provided in the survey and invited to participate.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>GPs: GPs who have a majority of non-English speaking patients or who have not worked at the practice in the last year are excluded.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>GPs will be recruited through a letter of invite followed up by a phone call. For each participating practitioner, a list of patients who meet inclusion criteria will be randomly generated. In conjunction with the GP, research staff will identify women on that list who meet exclusion criteria. Between 200 and 600 women per GP will be mailed the screening survey. At the end of the screening survey respondents will be asked if they would like to participate further in a study to explore “the care that women receive from GPs when they are experiencing depression, domestic violence or stress and worry.” Women eligible for the intervention stage based on the screen will be contacted by phone. Those willing to participate in the project will be sent the baseline survey. Allocation of GPs to the intervention or comparison group will be concealed and achieved by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule at a central administration site. GPs will subsequently be informed of their allocation. The allocation of the GP will dictate whether women participants are in the intervention or comparison arm of the trial.</concealment>
    <sequence>To help ensure comparability of the intervention and comparison clusters with respect to cluster characteristics, the GPs will be stratified according to whether they are i) solo or group and ii) based in urban or rural location and iii) a PN or GP delivering the intervention. This stratified allocation will create six strata to be incorporated in generating the randomisation schedule. Randomisation will be performed by a statistician not directly involved in the study and who is blind to the identity of the practitioners.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Intimate partner abuse is a common hidden problem for women attending general practice. It has major emotional and physical consequences. This project aims to evaluate if an intervention in general practice involving screening for intimate partner abuse and feedback to GPs, a training program for GPs, a brief counselling intervention for women and practice organisational change increases abused womens safety planning and behaviours, mental health and quality of life. The project also aims to increase womens readiness for change, comfort to discuss abuse and health provider inquiry about safety, and determine if such a program is cost effective. The pilot study is complete. The main study involved sending 20000 women (16-50 years) a screening survey from 55 general practices in Victoria, Australia. Women who screen positive to being afraid of their partner or ex-partner in the last 12 months and indicate an interest in being involved in next stage were invited to participate. Those in the intervention group were invited to attend their GP for up to 6 sessions of brief counselling, and be followed for 2 years with surveys at baseline, and 6 and 12 and 24 months following the invitation to see the GP. This study used a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the intervention. General practitioners were randomised either to be intensively trained to deliver the intervention and their practice systems improved for care of abused women or to be briefly trained to ensure minimum safe practice and deliver usual care. Outcomes of this project include evidence of the effectiveness of this model to increase safety of women and their mental health and quality of life, and an updated continuing professional development curriculum will be available. The 24 month follow up (weave II) consists of:
A. 2 year follow up to assess the longer term effect of the weave intervention on womens experience of abuse; their quality of life; mental and physical health; and use of services.
B. Economic modeling to estimate impact of measured outcomes on womens lifetime health and wellbeing and on lifetime costs and savings for Australian health care and society.
C. Qualitative process evaluation to understand context of extent to which weave is effective.</summary>
