  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention consists of a curriculum with 5 modules, tought and learned over a period of 8 weeks.  Assessments are pre and one month post intervention. The modules are: 1) asking clinical questions, 2) searching the evidence, 3) critical appraisal of systematic reviews, 4)applicability of the evidence to the patient, 5) implementation of the evidence into practice.  Each module consists of an e-learning component (these are one to three 15-25 minutes online sessions for the trainee to complete in her/his own time), applying the theoretical knowledge during clinical wardrounds and formative and summative assessments. 
A clinical facilitator guides trainees  to  
identifying learning opportunities in a clinical setting, directs appropriate use of learning resources (e-learning) and providies feedback on learning exercises/assignments. 
Trainees will pursue independent study using the study guide and e-learning modules.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control intervention consits of online disseminated evidence based medicine (EBM) resources from the World Health Organization Reproductive Health Library (WHO RHL) workshop-based course with the same learning objectives as the intervention. The materials include 6 powerpoint presentations with additional text that describes the process and contains explanatory information. Learning is self-directed; the 6 modules have to be taken in sequence over a period of 8 weeks; summative assessments are pre-and post intervention.The content of the presentations are similar to the content of the RHL-EBM Course.  The powerpoint presentations focus on;
1) formulating clinical answerable questions. 
2)searching effectively for evidence using tools such as the Reproductive Health Library and the Cochrane Library
3)critically appraise clinical evidence for its validity and applicability
4) understanding basic effect measures such as Relative Risk and Numbers Needed to Treat</comparator>
