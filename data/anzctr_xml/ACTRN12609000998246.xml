  <interventions>
    <interventions>Examine whether administration of Vessel Dilator (VSDL) to ADCHF patients in single and multi-dosage regimes induce changes in hemodynamic parameters with renal, natriuretic and diuretic effects as seen in the treatment of CHF patients without serious adverse side-effects (SAE);
1.Single dose of intravenous (IV) VSDL in saline at 50 ng/kg/min  for 60 min (n=6)
2.Single dose of IV VSDL in saline at 100 ng/kg/min for 60 min (n=6)
3.Single dose of IV VSDL in saline at 200 ng/kg/min for 60 min (n=6)
4.Standard method of care for the treatment of ADCHF (n=6)
5.Multiple dose of IV VSDL in saline at most appropriate dose (50, 100 or 200 ng/kg/min) for 60 min at 0 h, 12 h, and 24 h (n=6)
6.Multiple dose of IV VSDL in saline at most appropriate dose (50, 100 or 200 ng/kg/min) for 60 min at 0 h, 6 h and 12 h (n=6)</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard Treatment is current guideline treatment for patients with ADCHF and would include the administration of intravenous diuretics, morphine and nitrates. Acutely it may also include continuous positive airways pressure ventilation and occasionally the administration of oral Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to find out if a man-made heart hormone (MAD001) improves the treatment of people diagnosed with acute decompensated congestive heart failure (ADCHF).  This substance improves several heart functions, lowers blood pressure and increases salt (sodium) and water removal from the body, when given to animals, healthy humans and persons with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). The purpose of this study is to determine if this substance also improves heart functionality, and to a lesser extent increases sodium and/or water removal, in persons with ADCHF to improve their condition.</summary>
