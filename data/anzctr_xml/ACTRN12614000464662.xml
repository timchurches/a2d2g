  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm 1: Aprepitant 130 mg IV Injection (InnoPharma, Inc.); International Non-Proprietary Name is Aprepitant injection; single dose only. At least a 10-hour overnight fasting period, subjects will be dosed and will be required to continue to fast for at least 4 hours after drug administration. 
Arm 2: EMEND Registered Trademark 150 mg IV Injection (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp.); International Non-Proprietary Name is Aprepitant injection; single dose only. At least a 10-hour overnight fasting period, subjects will be dosed and will be required to continue to fast for at least 4 hours after drug administration. 
Arm 3: EMEND Registered Trademark 125 mg Oral Capsules (Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corp.); International Non-Proprietary Name is Aprepitant Capsule; single dose only. At least a 10-hour overnight fasting period, subjects will be dosed and will be required to continue to fast for at least 4 hours after drug administration. 
Washout period is 7 days between each dosing.
Subjects will be confined in the clinical facility from 10 hours prior to drug administration until 24 hours after drug administration for each study period to monitor adherence to treatment.
At least a 10-hour overnight fasting period, subjects will be dosed and will be required to continue to fast for at least 4 hours after drug administration. Following a fasting period of at least 4-hours after drug administration, subjects will be given standardized meals and caffeine/methylxanthine-free beverages at scheduled times. In this study, meals will be served at approximately 4.5, 9.5 and 13.5 hours after drug administration.

    <sequence>In this study, the assignment of treatment groups will be generated by a computer program designed and run in SAS, producing a balanced random allocation of subjects into treatment sequences known as the randomization scheme. Subjects will be assigned consecutive subject numbers in an ascending order. This number will identify the subject and determine the treatment sequence the subject will undergo. Treatment assignment will be described in the randomization scheme.

Each subject is scheduled to receive a total of three treatments by the end of the study.

The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for the Test/Reference ratios of geometric means for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax will be calculated based on the least square means (LSMEANS) and ESTIMATE of the ANOVA.</statisticalmethods>
