  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a study of the effects of the timing (i.e. morning versus evening) of administration of dexamethasone on sleep quality. To be eligible, patients will need to already be on any dose of dexamethasone up to 8mg/day. This will delivered over 10 days as 2mg encapsulated tablets (or multiples of) in a daily dose in either the morning or evening as follows:

Treatment Group 1: Day 1-5: dexamethasone in the morning (0800-0900 hr) and matched dose placebo capsule in the evening (1700-1800hr); Day 6-10: placebo in the morning and dexamethasone in the evening. 

Treatment Group 2: Day 1-5: placebo in the morning and dexamethasone in the evening; Day 6-10: dexamethasone in the morning and matched dose placebo capsule in the evening.

There will be no 'wash-out' period between changes in the timing of dexamethasone on Days 5-6. The daily dose of dexamethasone will remain unchanged from the dose the patient was taking prior to participation.</interventions>
    <comparator>Both arms in this cross-over trial will act as control as well as intervention arms. Both arms will receive both active and placebo treatments each day; it is the order in which these are received (morning vs evening) that will be manipulated. The placebo will be an inert substance encapsulated to match dexamethasone capsules, delivered once a day in either the morning or evening.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Pharmacy will be contacted whenever a patient is under-going the screening process to warn them of a potential trial candidate. This will be followed up by a confirmatory
call as soon as the patient's eligibility has been confirmed. The randomisation request will take the form of the prescription of the study drugs.

The site clinical trials pharmacist will prepare the study drugs for the participant according to the allocation determined by a published 2 arm randomisation schedule
ie whether to start with bottle A or B on the morning of day 1.

They will have previously labelled all dexamethasone capsules as A orB (and all placebo capsules as the other) but will blind the investigators to this allocation.

The allocation will be recorded on the schedule along with the date of allocation, the signature of the pharmacist preparing the drugs and the patient ID number.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a study of the effects of a corticosteroid (dexamethasone) on sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer.

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have a diagnosis of cancer. You should be on a stable dose of corticosteroid for the previous 48 hours for any indication, and likely to remain on a stable dose of corticosteroids for the next 10 days.

Trial details
Participants in this trial will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take their usual dose of dexamethasone in the morning and a placebo (sham tablet) at night for five days, and then switch the order for the next five days (i.e. placebo in the morning and dexamethasone at night). Participants in the other group will complete this treatment in reverse order. Only the pharmacist will know which drugs are being taken when. 

Participants will be asked to complete a sleep questionnaire each morning in order to assess the effect of the timing of dexamethasone on sleep quality.</summary>
