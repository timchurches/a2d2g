  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete an initial neurocognitive assessment and a baseline imaging session. Participants will then be pseudo-randomly assigned to either the 'active' Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) group or the placebo TMS group. Following the scan, participants will begin a 4-week protocol of repetitive TMS. TMS will be administered by trained personnel. Participants in the active TMS condition will undergo a 600-pulses theta burst stimulation to the prefrontal cortex.This procedure will involve the participant coming to the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute five days per week (Mon-Fri) for a ~45min TMS session. After the 4-week TMS regime, participants will undergo a second imaging session, immediately followed by a final clinical assessment. Six months after completion of the intervention, participants will participate in a follow-up cognitive assessment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo stimulation will be administered with a specific coil that is made by the same manufacturer. This coil mimics the noise and effects of the real TMS but does not affect the neural activity of the targeted area.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a severe mental illness that can
dramatically reduce quality of life. Despite use of best practise clinical management,
many patients continue to experience symptoms and associated disability. Recent
neuroimaging studies have shown that OCD is characterised by significant, yet
specific, changes in the activity of macroscopic brain networks comprising of frontal
and subcortical brain regions. Parallel to these developments, non-invasive brain
stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have
emerged as viable tools to modulate the activity of brain networks in both healthy and
pathological populations. TMS has an established clinical role in the treatment of
major depressive disorder. This project aims to assess the possible use of local TMS
to selectively restore altered brain network activity and improve symptoms in people
with OCD. To achieve this goal outpatient with OCD will be asked to undertake
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after a TMS intervention. If
successful, the proposed project will represent the first demonstration that TMS can
be used to selectively restore the altered function of widespread neural networks and
improve symptoms in people diagnosed with OCD. Such an outcome will be
instrumental to motivate larger clinical trials to test the efficiency of TMS as a
treatment, or complementary treatment, for OCD.</summary>
