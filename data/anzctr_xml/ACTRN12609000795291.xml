    <scientifictitle>A prospective, multicentre, cohort study evaluating patient benefit after primary total shoulder arthroplasty with the modular PROMOS shoulder system.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>PROMOS standard prosthesis- The standard PROMOS features modular components for the metaphyseal part, the collum (modular body) and the humeral head. The body (metaphyseal component) in different heights helps to restore the original length of the humerus und can be fixed in any antetorsion angle.
PROMOS reverse prosthesis - The reverse shoulder system consists of a humeral and a glenoid component, both of which are modular. The humeral stem is used in combination with a body and concave polyethylene component. The concave polyethylene component snaps into the proximal body and articulates with the
hemispherical head attached to the glenoid baseplate. The glenoid baseplate is fixed in the glenoid bone with two screws.

The appropriate treatment type is administered to patients based on individual requirements as determined by the operating surgeon

The duration of the surgical procedure depends on individual circumstances, on an average a normal surgey lasts for 1.5 hours.</interventions>
    <comparator>The first 100 consecutive total shoulder arthroplasties until the one year follow up were monitored using objective and subjective outcome parameters.</comparator>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient benefit measured with SPADI (Shoulder Pain and Disability Index)and Constant Murley score at the joint level,
with the QuickDASH (Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire) for the upper extremity and the SF-36 (Quality of Life) mental score as a generic tool</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at Pre-operative, post-operative, 6 months, 1year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years time point</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Active and Passive Range of motion - measured by Goniometer</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at Pre-operative, post-operative, 6 months, 1year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years time point</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Strength of Abduction - measured by spring balance.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Subjects will be seen at Pre-operative, post-operative, 6 months, 1year, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years time point</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Rate of implant related complications 
The following implant related compications will be assessed.
-humeral fracture
-luxation/dislocation
-acromion fracture
-rupture of glenoid component
-ectopic bone formation
-superficial wound infection
-deep joint infection
-clinical deep vein thrombosis
-death
-reoperation 
-total revision
-partial revision</outcome>
      <timepoint>The assessment is completed by responsible investigator, if the any complication occurs.</timepoint>
