  <interventions>
    <interventions>For patients presenting to the emergency department with Pain, following collection of baseline data and the eligibility of the patient is confirmed; consenting patents in series will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group by a computer-generated program.  The intervention to be evaluated in this research will be emergency nurse practitioner (E-NP) service. The emergency nurse practitioner model of care specifically includes assessment and management of patients using critical decision-making skills, referring directly to other health care providers, prescribing medications, performing interventions, ordering and interpreting diagnostic investigations and admission/discharging autonomy. The E-NP will assess the next available patient within their scope of practice according to time waiting to be seen as per usual ED policy. After this initial assessment the E-NP will commence management of the patient and complete the episode of care. The duration of the intervention will be from initial patient assessment until discharge from the ED. The service is geographically located in the Fast track area of the ED and the E-NP manages patients presenting with ATS categories 2-5 (Australian College of Emergency Medicine, 2012).


</interventions>
    <comparator>The study control will be standard ED care, which is operationally defined as medical officer managed care with assistance from registered nurses. Medical officers covering the fast track zone are emergency medicine registrars with a minimum of 3 years post basic training and are currently undertaking advanced training to be registered as a fellow of the Australian College of Emergency Medicine. Standard ED care will be practiced in accordance with usual ED policy with no changes to the model. The patient is allocated to the Fast track zone and the next available clinician will commence the initial assessment. The registered nurse or the medical officer may undertake this initial assessment but management decisions will be made by the medical officer and then completed by the standard ED care team members in the Fast track zone.</comparator>

    <concealment>All patients will be given study information and consent documents and invited to participate in the study. The information document will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. Prior to enrolling in the study a signed consent form will be obtained for each patient. The CRA will conduct the informed consent discussion and will check that the patient and their legally acceptable representative comprehend the information provided and answer any questions about the study. Consent will be voluntary and free from coercion. 
The CRA will recruit patients, collect baseline data and allocate patients according to the generated random block allocation sequence performed by the Lead Researcher. The CRA will be trained in methods of consent, data collection and protocol for contacting the Lead Researcher for (blinded) randomization allocation. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Following collection of baseline data and the eligibility of the patient is confirmed; consenting patents in series will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or the control group by a computer-generated program.  The Clinical Research Assistants (CRA) will telephone the primary researcher who will allocate study participants using a block randomisation process. Randomisation gives each patient a chance of being assigned to either the intervention or control groups. Successful randomisation practices require that group assignment cannot be predicted in advance. Block randomisation is used to ensure appropriate distribution across the two treatment arms and help to reduce bias and confounding, especially when the sample size is small. Allocation will adhere strictly to the generated sequence. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Differences in pain scores and effectiveness will be evaluated throughout the study. In 2007, the NHMRC National Institute of Clinical studies (NICS) sanctioned The NICS National Emergency Care Pain Management Institute for the implementation of best practice in relation to ED pain management. As a result, a national audit of 36 hospitals throughout Australia (n=1996) was sampled and results showed that a median time to analgesia in the ED was 61minutes, where 30 minutes was considered the national standard by ED care experts (Herd, Babl, Gilhorta, &amp; Huckson, 2009). The study also discovered that less than 40% of patients sampled had a pain score documented at triage. The clinical indicators recommended from the report were a target of 80% of patients presenting to the ED have a documented pain score within 30 minutes, a median time to analgesia of 30 minutes from triage and their VNPS reduces by a score of 3 points within 60 minutes of arrival to ED. 
The main purpose of the study will be to detect differences between the two intervention groups in relation to time to analgesia and pain scores. As per the defined national standard of best practice in relation to time to analgesia in the ED (National Health and Medical Research Council, 2011), the primary outcome is whether or not analgesia was administered within 30 minutes of arrival. A 20% change of compliance with the 30 minute standard between the two groups was considered to be clinically important. Sample size calculations will be based on 80% power and a type 1 error rate (two sided) of 0.05 and adjusted for an estimated loss to follow-up of 20%. Consequently the sample size was calculated to total 260 patients; 130 patients per arm of the study. The 30 minute Target Achieved variable will be considered as binary (yes/no for achieving the target time of 30 minutes).   The difference in "time to analgesia" tested by t-test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum depending upon the distribution. Utilising 30 minutes as best practice for time to analgesia for patients presenting with pain to the ED, we felt a difference of 20% between the two groups to be clinically important. We anticipate a male to female ratio of 3: 2 which reflects the over representation of males presenting with minor to moderate painful traumatic injury and is consistent with the gender ratio previously reported in similar patient cohorts and study 1 results.
Did not wait presentations will be identified by the routine ICD-10-AM disposition code (Statistical classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Australian Modification) on the ED patient information system/electronic heath record by the ORA. Representations within 48 hours will be hand searched though the enquiry ability of the electronic patient record system by the ORA.
A comparison style study will also be conducted examining the comparative use of use of EBG in everyday practice. The patients whom are treated for ankle, knee or burns injury will be selected and compared with the intervention. The patients electronic health record will be audited to determine if EBG were used and documented in their treatment decisions in their ED care.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of this research are to compare the effectiveness of Emergency Nurse Practitioner (E-NP) on service and quality of patient care outcomes, with that of standard care in the Emergency Department (ED). Hence the following null hypotheses will be tested:
For patients presenting to the ED with pain, allocated to the fast track zone and who receive care from either an E-NP or standard care, there will be no difference in: 
Primary outcomes
1.	Pain score reduction and time to analgesia 
Secondary outcomes
2.	Service indicators of 
a)	Waiting time
b)	Number of patients who did-not-wait 
c)	Length of stay in emergency department 
d)	Representations with 48 hours

In addition, a comparative evaluation of clinicians use of evidence based guidelines for management of i) knee injury, ii) ankle injury and  iii) burns injury will be conducted to further test the integrity of the intervention.
