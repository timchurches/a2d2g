    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants must have a completed referral form from their GP or gastroenterologist prior to their first screening appointment in the trial. This referral confirms a diagnosis of constipation predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (C-IBS) as per the Rome III criteria and if the participant is suitable for screening. If the participant meets the eligibility criteria at screening they will be allocated a coded trial number according to the trial site. Each site is allocated a block of participant numbers which are consecutively allocated. Trial medication has been previously numbered to match the site allocation and enrolled subjects are provided with their trial medication and (coded) number.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer randomisation block sequence was generated at a central administrative site by a third party not involved in the trial and the trial intervention was also labelled in number (coded) containers to maintain concealment for researches. Randomisation is conducted in blocks of four, so every four consecutive numbers has two random active and placebo sequences.</sequence>
