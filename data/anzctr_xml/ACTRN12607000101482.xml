  <interventions>
    <interventions>Community gymnasium based progressive resistance strength training (PRST) program.  Participants allocated to the experimental group will complete a 12-week (two times per week, for 90 minutes per session), gymnasium-based strengthening program targeting the major muscle groups of the legs.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the control group will receive 'usual care plus a social program'. The 'usual care' in the control group may include normal exercise, or therapy, providing it does not include a PRST component.  In addition, these people will receive an alternative program of educational and social activities designed to be of interest and of value to the participants. This program will be conducted one-hour each week for 12 weeks to control for the social aspect of the PRST program. The program will comprise leisure and recreational activities that would not be expected to have a fitness or training effect, such as massage, film going, visits to leisure and recreational attractions around Melbourne, luncheons and other social activities.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Muscle weakness is common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), and this can affect the performance of many everyday activities such as walking. A pilot study we completed showed that for people with MS weight training can lead to increased strength, improved walking ability, and improved physical functioning. Perhaps even more importantly, people in the pilot study overwhelmingly reported that they enjoyed the program because it made them feel more energetic, less disabled and more confident. This study will be the first large scientifically rigorous trial of a gymnasium-based strength training program for people with MS in the world.</summary>
