Each weekly session runs for an hour and a half and it is expected that women attend every session. Women in this condition will be case-managed by a midwife/health professional and referred to other agencies/services as necessary, as normally happens where specialised programs are not available.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antenatal depression (AND) is at least as prevalent as postnatal depression and is an important risk factor for postnatal depression. Depression has major implications for women's well-being and for the health and well-being of their babies. Despite more than 1 in 10 women being affected by a clinical depression in pregnancy, treatment following identification is not part of routine antenatal care services. This study will test whether an 8 session cognitive behavioural group therapy program will reduce antenatal depression, anxiety and increase health service uptake compared to pregnant women not receiving the program. 100 women with a clinical diagnosis for depression will be randomised to either intervention or control group. Participants will be assessed by self-administered questionnaires pre and post treatment and at 3,6 and 12 month follow-up time points.</summary>
