  <interventions>
    <interventions>Group 1. True acupressure  will receive 3 min of acupressure treatment on predefined acu-point (LI 4-Hegu) for general anaesthesia. This point have been traditionally used to treat pain and anxiety. Group 2. sham acupressure  will receive 3 min of pressure on sham point (on the palm, proximal to the second MCP joint at the head of the second metacarpal bone). Group 3. no-treatment group  no pressure on any points. The intervention group (1) will recieve the intervention only on one occasion and within 72 hours of the initial injury occurence.</interventions>

    <concealment>Sports participants/athletes attending the Otago Sports Injury Clinic will be approached by clinic staff during enrolment at the clinic.
Sequentially numbered opaque envelopes will be used. These are generated before patient recruitment begins. As there are 3 study groups (true acupressure, sham acupressure, no-treatment group), there are 3 possibilities of the modality application diagram which will be placed into the sequentially numbered opaque envelopes based on the outcome of the random number table. True acupressure group diagram shows acupressure points used for pain and anxiety. Sham acupressure diagram shows points unrelated to pain or anxiety. Rest group diagram shows no points. Once informed consent and pre-treatment questionnaire is obtained, the envelope will be opened and researcher will carry out the modality based on diagram.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acupressure is a technique which is derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine. It is a non-invasive and easy technique to perform which consists of a pressure of a finger or thumb on specific points on the body. It is a common technique used to manage symptoms such as pain, anxiety, nausea and sickness.
The purpose of this research project is to determine the effectiveness of acupressure as pain relief for sports injuries. The aim of the proposed study is to compare the effects of acupressure with placebo (sham) and no treatment on the pain and anxiety of patients with a sports injury. Participants will fill in a questionnaire that collects basic (age, gender), and data about pain and anxiety. Participants will then be randomized to one of three treatment groups (true acupressure, sham or non-treatment group). After treatment patients will be asked to re-evaluate their pain and anxiety scales.</summary>
