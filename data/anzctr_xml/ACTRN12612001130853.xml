    <interventions>CTO (Carboxyamidotriazole Orotate) is an oral (capsule) preparation to be admninstered once daily with an overall trreatment duration of 12 weeks.  Doses to be administered will follow a cohort process into which eligible subjects will be enrolled sequentially.  Cohort 1 (4mg/Kg), Cohort 2 (8mg/Kg) &amp; Cohort 3 (12mg/Kg).  Since only one eye is selected for examining the effects of the drug (if any) ie. for meeting the ojectives of the study, the other eye is nominated as the 'non-study' eye.  The non-study eye will still undergo the same ophthalomogical assessments as the study eye. The only time this non-study eye will be assessed for 'outcomes' is if Choroidal Neovascularisation is detected (CNV).</interventions>
    <comparator>There is no control group for this trial.  However, dosing will be escalated up to (or reduced down to) a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).  This will then be expanded to enrol more subjects to determine further, the safety profile of the drug.  A total of 27 subjects will be enrolled into this trial.  The number of subjects allocated to the expansion phase of the trial will be determined by the number of subjects enrolled during the escalation phase ie. if 9 subjects were required to justify the escalation to cohort 1, then 18 subjects will be enrolled in the expansion phase ie 27-9=18.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of orally administered CTO for 12 weeks for the treatment of neovascular (wet) AMD.  This will be done via the collection of adverse event data, blood sample collection to measure drug levels and determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, blood sample collection to ensure parameters remain within the normal range ('normal' for the subject in question), physical exmainations, patient questionnaire completion, echocardiogram (ECG) and general ophthalomologic assessments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered CTO in preventing vision loss in the study eye, as measured by the proportion of subjects who lose fewer than five letters (one line) on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 weeks compared to baseline</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the proportion of subjects who gained at least 15 letters on BCVA in the study eye at 12 weeks compared to baseline.  This will be achived using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS) logMAR chart assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the proportion of subjects who maintained BCVA (plus or minus five letters) in the study eye at 12 weeks compared to baseline.  This will be achieved using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS) logMAR chart assessment where the subject will be required to read a series of letters from a chart that is placed at a set distance from the subject.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered CTO on the size of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and the amount of leakage from CNV in the study eye at 12 weeks, as assessed by fluorescein angiography.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered CTO on the change in mean central retinal subfield thickness measure by optical coherence tomography (OCT) from baseline in the study eye at 12 weeks.</outcome>
      <timepoint>12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate the fellow (non-study) eye following orally administered CTO if CNV is present.  CNV will be detected by Flourescein Angiography (FA)and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT).  The methods used will be to measure change in lesion size, leakage from CNV, the area of subretinal fuid (SRF) and change in OCT thickness.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this trial is to test 3 dose levels of an investigational drug in people with the medically diagnosed eye condition 'Age-related Macular Degeneration' (AMD).  You will be allocated to a cohort in a sequential/rolling manner, depending on the time that you are screened for the trial. The aim is to find the optimum dose that is not only safe but may also have a beneficial effect on the condition.  During the course of the trial, you will certain assessments conducted such as having blood samples taken, ophthalmologic assessments. physical exams and having certain photographs/images take of the eye.  These will enable the objectives of the trial to be assessed.</summary>
