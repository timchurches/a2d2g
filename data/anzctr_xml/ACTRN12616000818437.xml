      <outcome>The primary outcome is the tidal volume homogeneity (VT homogeneity) which is calculated using several variables:

    <statisticalmethods>As this is an observational descriptive study, the sample size is largely driven by what is logistically feasible and sufficient to allow for the patterns to be determined for more directed sample size calculations in future studies. Initially we wish to aim for recruiting 30 subjects.
Although the pattern of VT homogeneity is well described in the infant requiring ICU support, it is known to be highly variable and the pattern in healthy infants undergoing an anaesthetic is unknown. Consequently, primary analysis will be limited to simple descriptive statistics. The following would be considered a clinically meaningful change in each parameter: 
CoV &gt;2% 
%VT in the dependent (or right) hemithorax 
&gt;10% Change in %atelectasis
&gt;5% VT &gt;2mL/kg 
Cdyn &gt;0.1mL/kg/cmH2O
Depending on the frequency of inhomogeneity we may choose to perform regression analysis to explore the association/correlation between risk factors and lung inhomogeneity. If the frequency is low, then there may be insufficient data for such an analysis. In this case we may consider recruiting more children to enable this analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Mechanical ventilation is often required to support respiratory function but it can cause lung injury. This risk is well understood in the Intensive Care Unit setting where mechanical ventilation is often required for long periods of time but the impact of short exposure to mechanical ventilation during anaesthesia is unknown. Some populations, in particular neonates and small infants, are at greater risk of this potential detrimental effect. One of the principal factors related to ventilator induced lung injury is the inhomogeneity of lung ventilation. To evaluate lung homogeneity, imaging techniques are usually used, although these are often invasive, intermittent and time consuming. Recently a new technology, called Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), has been developed. EIT is a non-invasive, radiation-free monitoring tool that allows real-time continuous imaging of ventilation at the bedside, measuring the impedance of the thorax through a belt placed around patient's chest. This study will use EIT to define the patterns of tidal ventilation within the chest and determine whether mechanical ventilation during general anaesthesia increases the risk of lung inhomogeneity in neonates and small infants. We also hope to determine if there is a correlation between the degree of lung inhomogeneity and different aspects of mechanical ventilation. These results could improve our knowledge about the impact of mechanical ventilation on the neonatal lung and help us to find best management for neonatal ventilation during an anaesthetic.</summary>
