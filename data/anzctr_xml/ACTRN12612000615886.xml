  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants attended to the physical therapy department two times/ week for the 4-week. Patient assumed supine lying on the treatment bed and wore goggle.  The knee(s) underwent laser therapy was slightly flexed and supported with a pillow. During the therapy session, hot packs wrapped in toweling were placed on the target knee(s) for 20minutes followed by laser therapy. The equipment of low level laser was a Gal-Al-As diode laser with a power output of 50 mW and a wavelength of 830 nm. The diameter of the laser beam at the treatment point was 1 mm.  Eight points were irradiated with LLLT three on the medial side of the knee, three on the lateral side of the knee, and 2 on the medial edge of the tendon of the biceps femoris muscle and semitendinosus muscle in the popliteal fossa.  Each point received energy of 6 J/point for one minute, with a total dose of 48 J/cm2 in each session. the duration of each visit was 20 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the placebo group, procedures were identical but without emission of energy. Because this type of laser presents invisible radiation, the patient was unaware of which group, they belonged to.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measurement was the pain intensity on Visual Analogue Scale(VAS). 
Pain Intensity on Visual Analogue Scale: The VAS consists of the 10-cm horizontal line anchored by two extremes of pain: "No pain" at the left and "Worst pain" at the right. The patients were provided with a translated Arabic version of VAS, with "No pain" on the right side and "Worst pain" on the left side. Patients indicated their current level of pain intensity in their knee (s), and marked this with X on the 10-cm line. Then, the therapist measured the distance between the right side anchor" No pain" and the mark on the VAS by lying a transparent 10cm ruler over the line. The pain intensity was recorded in centimeters. Pain intensity was recorded at rest and immediately following a 50-foot walking test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>outcome measurements were taken at baseline (W0) and 4-week (W4) after the study was begun.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The secondary outcomes were knee function in terms of WOMAC scale (WOMAC pain, WOMAC stiffness, WOMAC function).</outcome>
      <timepoint>outcome measurements were taken at baseline (W0) and 4-week (W4) after the study was begun.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>the time required to walk distance of 50-feet.The time required to walk a distance of 50-foot "as fast as possible" was measured with stopwatch and recorded in seconds.</outcome>
      <timepoint>outcome measurements were taken at baseline (W0) and 4-week (W4) after the study was begun.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients who had knee OA according to American College of Rheumatology criteria were recruited for the study. All patients had knee OA of grade II or III confirmed radiologically according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system. All the patients had a minimum score of 25 on the Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score. All patients had moderate to great knee pain defined as a score of 4 or greater on visual analogue scale (VAS) in the previous three months. They were willingness to participate and follow the treatment schedule.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>The patients were excluded from the study if they had concomitant disease affecting the knee, such as rheumatoid arthritis, injury and / or surgery to the knee, had received physical therapy and intra-articular corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections during the last six months. Furthermore, patients were also excluded if they had history of cancer, dementia, neurological deficits (sensory or motor), heart pacemaker, diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, or morbid obesity (BMI  less than 40).</exclusivecriteria>
