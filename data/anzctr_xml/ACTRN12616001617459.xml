  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants in the study will be commenced on the standard acetylcysteine regimen. That is 200mg/kg acetylcysteine in 500mls 5% glucose over 4 hours followed by 100mg/kg acetylcysteine in 1000mls 5% glucose over 16 hours. 

Participants randomised to the intervention arm will receive 12 hours of acetylcysteine only. To achieve this, they will have their 16 hour infusion of acetylcysteine ceased at eight hours (250mg/kg acetylcysteine) and then be commenced on the equivalent fluid and volume but not acetylcysteine for the remaining eight hours i.e. 500mL of 5% glucose over 8 hours.

This is administered in an emergency department short stay/observation ward with 24/7 nursing care to monitor adherence to above intervention.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>A statistical approach will be used to set the equivalence boundary or minimally significant effect size for this non inferiority study.  A statistical equivalence boundary is based on previous data of the existing treatment effect that the new alternative treatment is to be compared. The non-inferiority margin should be no more than half of the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of the standard treatment (20 hours acetylcysteine) effect.

ALT data from 121 paracetamol overdoses (single ingestion, 30g or less and treated with a 20 hour acetylcysteine regimen within 8 hours of ingestion) from the three participating hospitals has been collected. The mean difference between admission and 24 hour ALT is 0.2IU/L with a standard deviation of 10.9 and 95% confidence interval of -21.2 to 21.6 IU/L. Half the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is 10.7 hence 10 or less should be chosen as the non inferiority margin. A margin of 5 has been chosen which is also satisfactory for a clinical significance boundary. Therefore a mean difference in ALT (between baseline and 24 hours post ingestion) of -4.8 to 5.2 (0.2 +/- 5) in the new treatment arm (12 hour acetylcysteine regimen) would be considered as a non-inferior treatment of paracetamol toxicity. 

A non-inferiority study aims to show that one treatment is not significantly worse than another treatment. Therefore this is a one sided test and the significance or alpha level is set at 0.025. With a power of 90% (higher power to minimize the risk of a non-inferior treatment being missed due to chance) and a standard deviation of 10.9 with a non-inferiority limit of 5, the total sample size required is 200 or 100 in each arm. Allowing for a 10% margin for failure to adhere to the study protocol, we aim to recruit 220 patients in total. 

The continuous primary outcome of ALT difference between the two-acetylcysteine regimens will be analysed per protocol by students t-test or non-parametric equivalent depending on the distribution of the data. Secondary outcomes will be analysed using Chi-square or Fishers exact test, whichever is appropriate. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Paracetamol is one of the commonest medications taken in overdose worldwide and is the leading cause of acute liver failure in the developed world. The antidote acetylcysteine which replenishes liver glutathione was developed in the 1970s however the regimen (20 hours duration) was never subjected to either a randomised controlled trial or any dose ranging studies. The regimen gives a large loading dose and the remainder of the infusion (20 hours) is given to mirror the average time taken for paracetamol to be cleared by the liver. This time is only an average and depends on the degree of liver damage. We now know that this half-life is variable. For normal or undamaged  livers it is much shorter (12 hours). 

The aim of the study is to compare acetylcysteine given over 20 hours compared to 12 hours for patients presenting early with paracetamol overdose to see if it provides the same protection against liver damage.

The research design will be a multicentre non inferiority per protocol unblinded randomised controlled trial of a 20 hour versus a 12 hour regimen of acetylcysteine in paracetamol overdose. The study will be undertaken at the Princes Alexandra, Calvary Mater Newcastle and Prince of Wales hospitals. Eligible patients will be paracetamol overdoses less than 30g presenting within 8 hours of ingestion.

The primary outcome will be a comparison between the standard and the experimental arm of the absolute difference between the liver function test alanine aminotransferase (ALT) on admission and 24 hours post ingestion. This difference will be analysed per protocol by students t­test or non­parametric equivalent depending on the distribution of the data.</summary>
