  <interventions>
    <interventions>The current study is a stepped wedge, randomised controlled trial, whereby each site undergoes a control period (varying in duration from 4 to 16 months) followed by training (consisting of a two day workshop and a one day clinic visit) and then an intervention period (varying in duration from 4 to 16 months).

Intervention 

EAT is a behaviour change counselling intervention based on the strategy delivered by Dr Britton in the pilot study [publication in development]. It has been refined to be delivered by dietitians in the clinical setting, alongside their normal dietetic involvement with HNC patients (i.e. weekly during radiotherapy, fortnightly for six weeks post-radiotherapy and then 'as needed' thereafter).

It is largely based on motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) strategies. EAT is designed to improve health behaviours of HNC patients and maintain their nutrition over the course of their cancer treatment. Of particular interest are behaviours related to sufficient daily nutritional intake, either orally or via feeding tube. Although to a healthy population this may seem a simple task, in order for HNC patients to eat, they must overcome significant barriers of pain, oral disfigurement, mucositis, nausea, reduced or no saliva, taste changes and severe losses of appetite in addition to the premorbid complications of high rates of alcohol misuse, mental illness and poorer self-care. EAT is designed to assist the HNC patient in finding the motivation to eat despite all these barriers, and to provide them with practical behaviour change strategies to support this change. 

Training will be delivered in a two-day workshop. On the day after training, the trainers will accompany dietitians during their usual consultations to assist with the clinical implementation of EAT. The trainers will return in two months to refresh EAT intervention skills, problem solve clinical concerns and troubleshoot any systems change issues that may have arisen. 

During the intervention phase, dietitians will participate in at least monthly supervision with one of the trainers (clinical psychologist). Supervision will be used to discuss clinical issues, problem solve and provide skills based feedback. Common themes, barriers and solutions discussed during supervision will be distributed (e.g. email) to participating dietitians. 

Systems change strategies will be used to encourage the implementation of EAT and, as appropriate, to align dietetic practice with clinical guidelines. This element of the study is aimed at positioning dietetic intervention and counselling as an integral part of cancer care. The following elements will be addressed with staff during training. 

1. Due to the prevalence of depression amongst HNC patients, dietitians will be trained in a method used to screen for symptoms of depression (PHQ-2). For patients who are identified to be at risk of depression, dietitians will be encouraged to work with radiation oncologists to implement a referral procedure. This procedure will be site specific and developed in close consultation with hospital staff. Dietitians will be asked to document in client notes when the PHQ-2 is administered and the outcome (i.e. whether the patient was referred to the radiation oncologist). Radiation oncologists will be asked to document in client notes what support option(s) were discussed with the patient and whether a referral was made. 

2. Dietitians will be asked to consult with patients in accordance with the schedule documented within the clinical guidelines (weekly during radiotherapy, fortnightly for six weeks post treatment and as required thereafter). Dietitians will be asked to document the occurrence of each dietetic consultation within client notes. 

3. Sites will be asked to schedule dietetic appointments adjacent to radiotherapy appointments. Integrating dietetics into radiotherapy in this way is designed to position dietetic intervention as an integral part of cancer care for both patients and department staff. 

4. To prompt the delivery of dietetic intervention consistent with the intervention/guidelines, the medical records of patients will include a coloured printed prompt, placed by research staff, identifying the patient as a trial participant, outlining the key components of dietetic intervention and the behavioural change techniques recommended for use during the consultation.</interventions>

    <studytype>Interventional</studytype>
    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>This is a stepped wedge design. Therefore all hospitals will begin in the control condition and at a randomly generated point in time will receive training and begin delivering the intervention. Randomisation will be used to guide the order in which hospitals will receive training AND to guide patient enrolment. 

Due to the nature of a stepped wedge design, enrolment into the trial will occur at a rate of approximately one participant per site, per week for the duration of the trial. 

On a weekly basis, research officers will be required to use treatment planning software (i.e. VARIAN or MOSAIQ) or similar to generate a list of patients who meet the following criteria: 
1. Aged 18+ 
2. Have one or more of the following cancer diagnoses 
a. Nasopharynx 
b. Oropharynx 
c. Oral Cavity 
d. Larynx 
e. Hypopharynx 
3. Scheduled to undergo definitive or postoperative radiotherapy 

Once a list has been generated of patients meeting the above screening criteria, data managers/ trial coordinators will be required to use an online system to randomise the order in which patients will be approached regarding consent.

This system will indicate which order patients should be approached with information about the study, with a view toward enrolment. 

The research officer will approach patients with information about the study in the order generated until the weekly enrolment target has been met. </concealment>
    <sequence>The order in which hospitals will be randomised will be done by an independent statistician not involved with the study.  The statistician will be sent the list of hospitals and asked to use the uniform randomisation function in the statistical package of their choice to order the hospitals from 1 to 5. The function will use time as the seed and the order of randomisation of hospitals from first to last will be the same as the order from 1 to 5 as determined by the statistician. 

Randomisation software will be used to generate the randomised 'approach order' for patient enrolment.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>The current trial is a stepped wedge cluster randomised control trial. In a stepped wedge design all hospitals begin in the control condition and then move to the intervention condition at randomised intervals. During the control phase, all patients will receive 'treatment as usual'. At randomised intervals across the study, researchers will travel to hospital sites to provide dietitians with training in the EAT intervention. Following training, all patients will receive 'intervention'. Assessments will be conducted on a sample of patients (N=400) recruited across the control and intervention phases of the study. A randomisation procedure will be used to guide enrolment into the study.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>The primary endpoint for this study is nutritional status at 12 weeks post treatment as measured by the PG-SGA.  Differences in the mean level of PG-SGA from before to after the introduction of the intervention will be tested using ANalysis of COVAriance (ANCOVA). The outcome in the model will be the individuals PG-SGA score at 12 weeks and their baseline value of PG-SGA will be included as a covariate.  We expect the intervention in this study to have an instantaneous impact on the health of patients and therefore we expect a sudden shift in the mean level of PG-SGA after the intervention is introduced. We will include a before and after intervention term in the model and it will be the p-value associated with the before and after term that will be used to determine whether there is a statistically significant improvement in PG-SGA scores as a result of the intervention. The model will also include terms for hospital and time, with time measured as months since study onset.

A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed prior to the implementation of the intervention in the second hospital.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating the effectiveness of a dietitian delivered health behaviour intervention to reduce malnutrition in head and neck cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.

Who is it for? 

This study is taking place within six Australian Hospitals. You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or more, and have a confirmed diagnosis of cancer involving the nasopharynx, oropharynx, oral cavity, larynx, or hypopharynx requiring definitive or postoperative radiotherapy with curative intent. 

Trial details 

All sites will begin in the control condition  dietitians will provide treatment as usual. Participants recruited during this phase will receive treatment as usual by trained dietitians according to standard hospital practice. At a randomly determined time point, researchers will attend the hospitals to provide training to the dietitians. Dietitians will then provide EAT (Eating as Treatment) as part of standard dietetic consultations (weekly during treatment, fortnightly for six weeks and then as needed). You will not be aware of whether you are participating in the 'control' or 'intervention' phase.

EAT is a dietitian delivered health behaviour change intervention designed to improve health behaviours of head and neck cancer patients and maintain their nutrition over the course of their radiotherapy. Of particular interest are behaviours related to sufficient daily nutritional intake, either orally or via feeding tube. 

Participants will be regularly assessed for up to 12 weeks post radiotherapy treatment in order to evaluate nutrition status. Information about mood, smoking and alcohol use, therapeutic alliance and radiotherapy side effects will also be collected from participants. Medical records will be reviewed to collect a range of information including total radiotherapy treatment time, unplanned hospital visits, length of stay, dietitian contact and referral to appropriate services for depression. </summary>
