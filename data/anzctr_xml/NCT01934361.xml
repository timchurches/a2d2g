  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multi-center, phase Ib/ II study (two parts) with patients that had recurrent
      glioblastoma multiforme. The first part (phase Ib) was to investigate the maximum tolerated
      dose/Recommended phase ll dose (MTD/RP2D) of once daily buparlisib in combination with
      every-three-week carboplatin or buparlisib once daily in combination with every-six-week
      lomustine (CCNU) using a Bayesian model. Once MTD/ RP2D is established in either of the 2
      arms, the corresponding phase II portion of the study was to start. Phase II was to assess
      the treatment effect of buparlisib in combination with carboplatin in terms of Progression
      Free Survival (PFS) and was to compare the treatment effect of buparlisib with lomustine
      versus lomustine plus placebo in terms of PFS.</summary>
