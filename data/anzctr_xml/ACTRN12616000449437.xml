  <interventions>
    <interventions>Postural data will be recorded, and audio-feedback provided through a postural monitor feedback device. This device consists of a tri-axial accelerometer and data recorder, and has the size of a pager.

Data will be collected over a 6 week period and then at follow-up time points. During the first and sixth week, baseline and post-intervention measurements will be collected. The intervention period consists of 4 weeks (weeks 2 to 5, inclusive). 
Arm 1 - Feedback Group (FG)
The FG will received postural audio-feedback, whenever the postural threshold is exceeded, during the four weeks of intervention. The field coordinator will be responsible for setting the devices and handing these to healthcare workers at the beginning of every week. Participants will wear the device clipped to their waistband or belt, during working hours, over the working days of each week. 

To enhance adherence, workers will receive reminders to their mobile phones (if they consent with that), and reminders will be printed and placed at strategic areas of the workplace. 

Adherence will be assessed as the number of days participants worked with the lumbopelvic monitor and feedback device, and was will be expressed as a percentage of total working days of that specific week.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants allocated to the placebo group (PG) will not receive postural audio-feedback and the postural monitor and feedback will be adjusted to monitor and record the postural behaviour. The postural monitor and feedback device will be clipped on the waistband or belt, and will be worn during working hours, over the working days of each week data is collected. 

Adherence will be assessed as the number of days participants worked with the lumbopelvic motion monitor, and was will be expressed as a percentage of total working days of that specific week.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure will be postural behaviour defined and expressed as the total number of times the postural threshold was exceeded in a week. Postural behaviour will be measured using a lumbopelvic monitor device. 
Postural threshold was defined by setting threshold values for range of motion (45 degrees of lumbopelvic forward bending), frequency (a maximum of 2 lumbopelvic forward-bending events exceeding the range of motion threshold per minute), and duration of sustained bending (5 seconds). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The baseline will occur at week 1. The follow-up will occur at the sixth week of data collection, and at one, three, six and twelve months after the sixth week. At baseline, and at the end of the sixth week, and the follow-up time points (one, three, six and twelve months), participants will wear daily the device during these weeks, so that postural behaviour can be monitored and recorded.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Randomization will be stratified by cluster-size (one to nine participants; or more than ten participants per centre). Within each strata, centres will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups (placebo or feedback group). To ensure allocation concealment, the investigator (JHA) will hold the randomization schedule, and will sequentially provide, by stratum, notification of group allocation to the recruiting investigator (JT) as each new site (cluster) is recruited. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization schedule will be generated using Randomization.com, a free online randomization program, by an investigator (JHA) not involved in recruitment, assessment, or statistical analysis. </sequence>

    <designfeatures>Blinding:

Participants will be blinded to group allocation. The researcher responsible for statistical analysis (DCR) will be blinded to group allocation until data analysis is complete. The field coordinator (JT) will be responsible for setting the postural monitor device, and delivering the devices to workers. This person will not be blinded to group allocation. The field coordinator will also be responsible for downloading the data from the postural monitor feedback device. Risk of bias is minimal as the primary outcome is measured and recorded by the postural monitor device, and secondary outcomes are participant self-reported. </designfeatures>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimation

The sample size is estimated based on the recommendations of Rutterford et al.  [1]. We estimated the sample size for a standard RCT, using the pwr package in R [2].  Assuming an effect size of 0.6 (identified through our published feasibility RCT) [3], alpha of 0.05, and power of 80% as input data for sample size calculation; a 2 arm RCT, with allocation ratio of 1:1, and one-tailed test appropriate to a superiority hypothesis, 35 subjects per group is the minimum required to achieve statistical significance level of 0.05 with power of 0.80. Assuming a 15% drop-out rate, a minimum of 40 participants per group will be required. 

The sample size for the cluster RCT was estimated by, first, calculating the design effect (DE), using the following formula:

Equation 1: DE=1+[(1+CV^2 )m-1]p

Where:
CV = coefficient of variation of cluster size;
m = mean cluster size;
p = intracluster correlation coefficient.

Once the DE is calculated, sample size for the cluster RCT can be determined using Equation 2 [4]:

Equation 2: SS_Clustered = SS_RCT x DE

Where:
SS_Clustered = sample size for cluster RCT;
SS_RCT = sample size for standard RCT;
DE = design effect.

Equation 1 allows estimating sample size for a cluster RCT with unequal clusters sizes [4]. The CV is estimated by dividing the standard deviation of cluster size by the estimated mean cluster size [4]. The standard deviation of cluster size can be calculated by estimating the range of cluster sizes and dividing it by four [4]. For the purpose of this study, the estimated maximum cluster size is 15, and the estimated minimum cluster size is 5, which leads to a cluster size range of 10. The mean cluster size is assumed to be seven. The p was calculated based on data from the feasibility RCT, and was equal to 0.05. Based on Equation (1) and the values above described, the DE equalled 1.33. Therefore, using Equation (2), the estimated sample size for the cluster RCT was a minimum of 108 participants, with 15 clusters (approximately 7 participants per cluster).
The method we used (Equation 2) for estimating the DE tends to overestimate the sample size, and less conservative methods have been described in the literature [1, 5]. We opted for a conservative estimation of the DE because our feasibility RCT may have inflated the true effect size for the intervention [6].

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses will be performed using R software [7]. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to estimate the effect of feedback provision on postural behaviour. For all statistical analysis, alpha will be set at 0.05. Missing data will be dealt with by using maximum likelihood estimation [8].

1) Study Aim 1
All statistical analysis will be conducted using R [7]. The use of cluster randomization reduces statistical power [1], so we will compensate power loss by increasing precision through adjustment for covariates (i.e. demographic data, baseline measurements; functional disability, measured with the Oswestry Disability Index; and psychosocial factors, measured with COPSOQII) in the statistical analysis [1, 5]. All statistical analyses will be conducted using individual level data.

Two repeated measures mixed-effect model analysis of variance (ANOVA) will used for assessing (1) within-group and (2) between-group changes in postural behaviour. The difference between the two models is that the time point factor will include baseline measurements for the within-group comparison. This will allow us to assess the within-group immediate changes in postural behaviour at the 6th week. For the between-group comparison, baseline measurements will be controlled for and considered as a covariate. Therefore, baseline measurements will be removed from the time point factor.

1.1) Within-group comparisons
Postural behaviour scores (as measured by the postural monitor and feedback device) will be used as dependent variable; participants and clusters will be considered as random-effects; and follow-up time points (baseline, 6th week, one, three, six and twelve months), postural behaviour baseline scores, work-related psychosocial factors and ODI scores will be considered as fixed-effects. Significant interactions and main effects will be followed-up with planned contrasts, with alpha adjusted for multiple comparisons [9].

1.2) Between-group comparisons
Postural behaviour scores (as measured by the postural monitor and feedback device) will be used as dependent variables; participants and clusters will be considered as random-effects; and follow-up time points (6th week, one, three, six and twelve months), baseline postural scores, work-related psychosocial factors and ODI scores will be considered as fixed-effects. Time point x intervention interaction will be included in the model. Significant interactions and main effects will be followed-up with planned contrasts, with alpha adjusted for multiple comparisons [9].

2) Study Aim 2
Research question 2 is a secondary analysis, and findings related to this research question will be submitted for publication as a separate manuscript. The primary outcome measures for research question 2 are low back pain disability scores and presence of low back pain. 

2.1) The effect of postural feedback intervention on low back pain disability scores
Low back pain disability scores, as measured with the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI), will be used as the dependent variable; participants and clusters will be considered as random-effects; and follow-up time points (6th week, one, three, six and twelve months), baseline ODI, and work-related psychosocial factors will be considered as fixed-effects. Time point x intervention interaction will be included in the model. Significant interactions and main effects will be followed-up with planned contrasts, with alpha adjusted for multiple comparisons [9].

2.2) Time to LBP resolution in participants presenting LBP at baseline, and time to developing LBP in participants who are symptom free at baseline
A discrete time to event (survival) analyses will be used to assess the time to LBP resolution and time to developing LBP using logistic regression. We will consider the effects of baseline measurements (i.e., age, body mass index, smoking habits, postural pattern at baseline, psychosocial factors, and Oswestry scores) and intervention group (i.e., control or feedback group) on time to LBP resolution for those who have LBP, and time to developing LBP on symptom free participants. Unadjusted survival analyses will be conducted using the demographic ad intervention effects on the resolution of or development of LBP. If numbers permit, adjusted models will be explored. Kaplan-Meier analyses will assess discrete time survival between the groups for both time to LBP resolution and time to developing LBP. Survival curves will be constructed based on follow-up time-points, proportional hazards models will be used to assess the hazard ratios (HR) for each intervention group (i.e., control and feedback group) [10], and the HRs and their respective 95% confidence intervals and p-values will be reported.
