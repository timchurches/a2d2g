Experimental: Hyperfractionated Involved-Field Radiotion-immunotherapy - Completed prior salvage induction therapy and have not received full tissue tolerance from prior radiotherapy may receive hyperfractionated involved-field radiotherapy twice daily for 7 days.
HIGH-DOSE PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: Beginning within 7 days after radiotherapy, carmustine IV over 3 hours on day -6; etoposide IV over 1 hour and cytarabine IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2; and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on day -1.
ASCT: Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Filgrastim (oral or IV) beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.
IMMUNOTHERAPY: Cyclosporine IV twice daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until the completion of the course of recombinant interferon gamma and interleukin-2. When sufficiently recovered, Aldesleukin once daily for 18 days.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation
      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.
      Giving immunotherapy using cyclosporine, interferon gamma, and interleukin-2 after stem cell
      transplantation may help the transplanted cells make an immune response and kill any
      remaining cancer cells. It is not yet known whether high-dose chemotherapy followed by
      autologous stem cell transplantation is more effective with or without immunotherapy.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well high-dose chemotherapy
      followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, cyclosporine, interferon gamma, and
      interleukin-2 works and compares it to high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem
      cell transplantation only in treating patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's
      lymphoma.</summary>
