    <interventions>Randomised, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled, Crossover Design, Single Center Pilot Study.  
Target Population: symptomatic adult patients with evidence of significant systolic left ventricle dysfunction (with Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction&lt;40%) on maximal medical treatment.
Intervention: use of organic nitrates(isosorbide dinitrate) and hydralazine with placebo (tablets) as a comparator
Dose 40mg three times daily (Isosorbide) and 50mg three times daily (Hydralazine) for total of 12 months with 1 month washout. Crossover will be performed at 6 months (each arm will receive 6 months of study medications and 6 months of placebo )
Total number of visits 13.
Informed consent will be obtained in the eligible subjects at the initial Visit 1.
Visit 2, 3 and 4 will be scheduled in two weekly intervals. 
Subsequent visits will be at 2 monthly intervals (Visits 5, 6 and 7).  
A wash-out period will follow and will last 4 weeks. Subsequently crossover between treatment arms will be performed at Visit 8. Visit 9 and 10 follow every 2 weeks.
Visits 11,12 and 13 planned at 2 monthly intervals.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Nitrates and Hydralazine are well known drugs being used in management of angina and hypertension. They have been tried in patients with heart failure who can not use Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and in African American population of USA on the top of ACE inhibitors, but have not been tested in addition to ACE inhibitors in Australian population. 
The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the benefit of optimising medical treatment in symptomatic patients with heart failure by addition of Nitrate and Hydralazine. This will hopefully translate into decrease of the symptoms of heart failure, increase in subjects exercise capacity and improvement of their quality of life.</summary>
