    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cmax of of Budesonide After Administration of Pulmicort and Three Dose Levels of MAP0010 - The maximum concentration (Cmax) is the highest concentration of a drug measured in the plasma.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Tmax of Budesonide After Administration of Pulmicort Respules® and Three Dose Levels of MAP0010 - Tmax is the time to maximum concentration of a drug in the plasma. The Tmax of budesonide is reported in minutes (min).</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AUC(0-8) of Budesonide After Administration of Pulmicort Respules® and Three Doses of MAP0010 - The AUC(0-8) is the area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time after drug administration. Budesonide AUC(0-8) is reported in picograms times minutes per milliliter (pg*min/ml).</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>AUC(0-inf) of Budesonide After Administration of Pulmicort Respules® and Three Dose Levels of MAP0010 - The AUC(0-inf) is the area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time to infinity (inf) after drug administration. Budesonide AUC(0-inf) is reported in picograms times minutes per milliliter (pg*min/ml).</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 hours</timepoint>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Half-life (t1/2) of Budesonide After Administration of Pulmicort Respules® and Three Dose Levels of MAP0010 - Half-life (t1/2) is the time for the drug to decrease to half of its maximum concentration. Budesonide t1/2 is reported in minutes (min).</outcome>
