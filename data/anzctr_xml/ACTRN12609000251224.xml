  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is a home based stage 2 cardiac rehabilitation based on information and communication technologies over 6 week mentoring program and 6 month follow-up period. Intervention involves: Pre-assessment and education at the care centre at the start of the 6 week program. Weekly 30 minute mentoring sessions via normal or video calls using the mobile phone involving education and goal setting. Mentoring includes exercise, diet, risk factors, stress and other behavioural counselling. Mentors can view patients self observations and measurement data such as walking activity on a web-portal prior the mentoring sessions. Patients will record daily measurements and self observations on the mobile phone regarding their weight, blood pressure, exercise, stress, diet, sleeping, smoking and alcohol use. Walking activity (steps) is automatically measured by the phone. All data is transferred to the web-portal that also the patient can access.
Patient will receive educational and motivational text- messages on the mobile phone 2 times per day. Patient is reminded to view educational video clips stored on the phone regarding cardiovascular disease, healthy lifestyle and risk factors. The phone includes relaxation audio files that the patient can listen to any time.
At the end of the 6week program there will be a post-assessment at the care centre and the mentoring sessions will not continue.
During the 6 month follow-up period the patients will continue to use the mobile phone and web-portal tools for self management. The patients can also use the care centre gym without supervison</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard treatment is a community care centre based stage 2 cardiac rehabilitation program over 6 week gym-based group exercise program and 6 month follow-up period. The treatment involves: Pre-assessment and education at the care centre at the start of the 6 week program. 2 x 1hour exercise sessions per week at the community care centre gym including lifestyle and health education and goal setting. The exercise sessions are supervised by rehabilitation nurses and physiotherapists. At the end of the 6week program there will be a post-assessment at the care centre. During the 6month follow-up period the patients can continue using the care centre gym without supervison.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Physical exercise adherence.
Tools:
- Pedometer for 1/52
- 6 minute walk test
- Active Australia Survey, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW)

The adherence will be assessed by:
- The daily steps and duration of walking activity measured with the pedometer during one week. Both the absolute activity levels and improvement are evaluated.
- Distance covered in the 6minute walk test. Both the absolute levels and improvement are evaluated.
- Duration and number of times spent in moderate and vigorous physical activities in a week from the Active Australia Survey. Both the absolute levels and improvement are evaluated.</outcome>

      <outcome>Process Indicators: 1) Costs (Staff time used in mentoring the intervention group and treatment of the control group is assessed through staff reports on Care Continuum Suite (CCS) system, projected equipment and facility costs are collected from the hospital's financial database, other technology costs are calculated from the project's financial records or estimated from the current market values), 2) Drop-out rates (from the trial recruitment spreadsheet updated by the project officer), 3) Median time return-to-work / Return to work (patient reports), 4)Numbers in control and intervention groups (from the trial recruitment spreadsheet updated by the project officer), 5)Numbers / percentage of people who did / did not consent to participate in the trial (from the trial recruitment spreadsheet updated by the project officer)</outcome>

    <summary>Clinical trial objective is to show evidence that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enabled home-based care process of cardiac rehabilitation patients provides equally good or better outcomes than traditional hospital based rehabilitation processes not using ICT tools. The trial will potentially provide evidence that the new process is equally or more cost effective than traditional rehabilitation process.</summary>
