  <interventions>
    <interventions>In patients with asthma commencing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, we will evaluate if monitoring by inhaled mannitol bronchial provocation challenge testing will provide a greater and more sustained control of asthma over 18 weeks compared with monitoring by spirometry alone.

We will use the inhaled mannitol bronchial provocation test to monitor bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in the intervention group. Results of the test would be reviewed by the patients and their treating physicians to allow assessment of the current control of their asthma. 

The intervention group will have the mannitol challenge at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks. The control group will be seen at the same time points, but will receive the results of spirometry only. 

The challenge involves inhaling a series of doses of mannitol powder using a small inhaler device, until a total of 635mg has been inhaled or the participant has had a fall in FEV1 of 15% or more from the baseline spirometry for the visit. A lower dose of mannitol required to induce a fall in spirometry indicates more severe bronchial hyperresponsiveness.

The participants will be followed for 18 weeks from baseline.</interventions>
    <comparator>Using standard spirometry (Forced expiratory volume in one second) which is the current standard to monitor response to  treatment.

Spirometry will be performed at each visit (baseline, 6, 12 and 18 weeks), both before and after the inhalation of bronchodilators. 

The control group will be monitored for 18 weeks after commencing ICS treatment

    <concealment>Subject whom meet the inclusion criteria will be asked if they would like to participate in the study. Once they have consented they will be asked to attend their first visit 6 weeks after commencing their ICS treatment.  
On attendence at their first visit they will be randomly allocated to either the BHR or control group. Randomisation will be stratified by asthma severity (mild vs moderate-to-severe), and allocation concealment will be achieved by the use of sequentially-numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.</concealment>
    <sequence>Two random allocation lists have been generated, each with randomly varying block sizes. Each block contains an equal number of allocations to each group. By using one list for participants with mild BHR (PD15 greater than 155mg to  less than 635mg) and the other list for participants with moderate to severe BHR (PD15 of less than or equal to 155mg), stratification for severity will be achieved. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>All values will be expressed as mean and standard error when data is normally distributed and median and interquartile range when not normally distributed. Comparison between groups for the primary outcome of ACQ (as well as other relevant parameters) over the duration of the study will be performed using linear mixed-effects models. Differences between groups in demographic data and other key baseline outcomes will be performed using a standard t-test. p values  less than 0.05 will be considered significant.


We have calculated that to detect a minimum clinically significant difference in ACQ score of 0.5 between two parallel arms of this study (mannitol vs spirometry monitoring) and at a significance level of 0.05 (two sided) with a power of 0.9 requires a minimum of 20 subjects in each arm. We wish to recruit at least 5 more in each arm to account for drop-outs during the study. Thus the study will require a total of 50 subjects to be randomised.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a parallel group, prospective randomised trial comparing two methods of monitoring asthma control.
Participants will be recruited from the Pulmonary Function Laboratory who have been referred for testing using inhaled mannitol to assess BHR in persons who are suspected of having asthma. Following the identification of a positive test, the provision of written consent and once there is confirmation the clinician has prescribed ICS, the subject will be contacted by phone and asked to return to the Laboratory at 6, 12 and 18 weeks to have either a mannitol challenge with spirometry performed or spirometry performed alone. The subject will be provided with feedback at each visit as to the benefit of ICS on the test outcomes and encouraged to seek the goal of achieving a reduction in their airway response to mannitol or improvement in lung function into the normal range. The referring clinician will also be provided with the results at each visit. Subjects will also perform an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) at each visit and both patient and clinician will be informed of these improvements. Prior to both spirometry and a mannitol challenge, participants will have two rapid non-invasive tests performed that measure the size of the small airways as well as the degree of inflammation by measuring a gas when expired known as nitric oxide.</summary>
