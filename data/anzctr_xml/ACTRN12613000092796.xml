  <interventions>
    <interventions>The difference between unipolar versus bipolar head (Lubinus, Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany) in the same stem (Lubinus SPII, Waldemar Link, Hamburg, Germany) when treating femoral neck fractures in elderly patients. This randomized control study wants to investigate whether there is difference in the outcome of mobility or difference in the acetabular erosion leading to revision surgery. Patients with femoral neck fracture will receive a hemiendoprosthesis either with unipolar or bipolar head, 80 minutes surgery time. Primary outcome is revision surgery of any reason, follow-up time is in the minimun 5-years. Survival analyses were performed using Cox regression models. Revision surgery of any reason and complications are stated when occurred and final check-up is done at the end of the study at 30.3.2013.</interventions>
    <comparator>Half of the patients receive bipolar head and half will receive unipolar head. Bipolar head is the group studies with unipolar head as control.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>Analyses of outcome were based on the intention to treat principle, and all patients remained in the group to which that they had been randomized.   Data were analyzed using a chi square test for dichotomized measures or Students t test for continuous numeric variables. A Cox regression analysis was used to determine survival functions. The level of significance was set at p-value less than 0.05. We used SPSS 18.0 for Windows (IBM, NewYork) for all analyses.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The choice between unipolar and bipolar hemiarthroplasty in displaced intracapsular fractures in elderly still remains controversial. Bipolar head has been postulated to decrease the wear of acetabulum thereby diminishing the risk of conversion to total arthroplasty with time. Our objective was to compare series of elderly individuals who sustained a displaced femoral neck fracture treated with either a cemented, modular monopolar prosthesis or a cemented, modular bipolar prosthesis with the same femoral component for at least five years.</summary>
