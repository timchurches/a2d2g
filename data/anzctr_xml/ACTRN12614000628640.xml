    <designfeatures>Participants will be randomised in 3 sequential cohorts. Each cohort will dose for a different treatment period (4, 8 or 12 weeks). Cohorts will be explored in a sequential manner: 8 weeks of treatment will only be explored after completion and safety review of the 4 week treatment cohort; 12 weeks of treatment duration will only be explored upon complete evaluation of the 8 week treatment cohort. Within each cohort 50 subjects will be randomized in a 1:3:3:3 ratio to placebo or one of the following doses of GS-9620: 1, 2 or 4 mg. Participants will be followed up to Week 48.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>EFFICACY
The primary analysis set for efficacy analysis is the full analysis set (FAS) defined as all subjects who were randomised and received at least one dose of study drug. 
Subjects will be analysed according to the randomised treatment assignment.

Primary analysis: will be conducted when the last subject in each treatment duration group reaches Week 24. The change from Baseline to Week 24 in HBsAg (log10 IU/ml) will be analysed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include the Baseline HBsAg level, Baseline HBeAg status, treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as independent variables. An unstructured within subject covariance matrix will be employed. If convergence is an issue, another covariance matrix will be used. 

Secondary analysis: The change from Baseline to Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 48 in HBsAg (log10 IU/ml) will be analysed using the same method as in the primary analysis. Categorical secondary endpoints will be summarised by number and percentage of subjects that meet the endpoint. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will be used to compare the treatment groups, in an exploratory manner.

SAFETY
The primary analysis set for safety analyses is the safety analysis set (SAS) defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects will be analysed according to the treatment actually received.

Analysis: All safety data collected on or after the date that study drug was first dispensed up to the date of last dose of study drug will be summarised by treatment group (according to the study drug received). Data for the pretreatment will be included in data listings.

PHARMACOKINETICS
The PK analysis set will include all subjects who are enrolled and have received at least one dose of study drug and for whom concentration data of analytes are available.

Analysis: Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from all subjects in the optional intensive PK sub-study and will be listed and summarised for using descriptive statistics (i.e. sample size, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, % coefficient of variation, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Plasma concentrations of GS-9620 over time will be plotted in semi logarithmic and linear formats as mean +/- standard deviation. Drug exposure in all study subjects with measurable GS-9620 concentrations from single PK samples will be evaluated in relation to GS-9620 PK from the optional intensive PK sub-study, as well as previous intensive PK data from earlier studies as appropriate to characterise the exposure profile of GS-9620 in this population.

BIOMARKERS
The primary analysis set for biomarkers is the biomarker analysis set, defined as all subjects who were randomised, received at least one dose of study drug and have the biomarkers available.


No power calculation was performed to determine sample size because this is an exploratory study to characterise the safety and efficacy of GS-9620 in chronic Hepatitis B.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to evaulate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability (side effects) of GS-9620 in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who are currently being treated with oral antiviral (OAV) medication. Approximately 150 patients with CHB that are currently being treated and who have completely suppressed HBV infection, will be given an extra treatment of either GS-9620 or a dummy drug (placebo). The study aims to look at how effective GS-9620 is in combination with the already used OAV, in reducing the amount of virus in participants blood. Participants will be followed up to Week 48. The total study duration for each participant may be up to 57 weeks, inclusive of the screening, treatment and follow-up period.</summary>
