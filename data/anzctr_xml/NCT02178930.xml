    <interventions>Other interventions - Integrated self management support

Other: Integrated self management support - The intervention involves the introduction of an interactive chronic disease support platform into doctor-patient consultations, in addition to a self-management support program. Specifically, the intervention comprises the following interlinked components: within consultation engagement; at home exploration; phone and web-based health coaching.

No Intervention: Usual care - The control group will receive usual care from study sites until all study participants have completed 12 months of follow up from their Baseline Visits. At this point access to the study intervention will be expanded to include control sites.


Other interventions: Integrated self management support
The intervention comprises a consultation engagement, at home exploration, phone and web-based health coaching.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to improve the health status of people living with HIV in
      Australia. The overall goal is to rigorously evaluate the impact of interactive health plans
      and self-management support on chronic condition outcomes in people with HIV.

      The specific aims are to:

      Aim 1: Using a doctor-level cluster randomised trial, evaluate the effect of interactive
      health plans and self-management support on coronary heart disease risk and other chronic
      condition outcomes in people living with HIV.

      Aim 2: Evaluate patient and health care provider experiences and acceptability of interactive
      health plans and self-management support.

      Aim 3: Evaluate intervention cost-effectiveness and effect on health service utilisation.</summary>
