  <interventions>
    <interventions>This will be a randomised crossover study involving five visits on five days. On two days, 12 healthy adults will receive beverages sweetened with 50g sucrose (duplicate control). On three days participants will receive beverages sweetened with 16.7g fructose + 33.3g sucrose; 25g fructose + 25g sucrose; and 33.3g fructose + 16.7g sucrose. Beverages will be consumed on mornings after an overnight fast. The order that the beverages are given will be randomised to each participant. Blood will be sampled via cannula by a registered nurse at intervals over two-hours following consumption of the beverages. The washout will be 2-7 days between treatments. All beverages will be given under supervision to ensure they are fully consumed. The study will be run by a MSc student in Human Nutrition under the supervision of a senior lecturer in the University of Otago Clinic Rooms.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>The study will be powered to detect a 30% difference in incremental area under the curve (iAUC) between the sucrose control and the blended sugar test beverages. A difference of 30% iAUC has been associated with clinical benefit (Wolever et al, 1992).  Using variability data from previous work, a sample size of 11 was adequate to detect a 30% reduction in iAUC with 80% power using the 5% level of significance. A sample of 12 was also sufficient to detect a 50% difference in uric acid AUC between control and test beverages. Blood pressure was a secondary outcome and the study was not powered for this factor.

A mixed effects regression model will be used to determine if there are any significant differences between the sucrose control and the glycemic and uricaemic responses to the test beverages. The model will be adjusted for treatment order. Uric acid concentrations are sex dependent, therefore the uric acid data will also be adjusted for sex. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>European beverage manufacturers are permitted to use health claims when fructose partially replaces sucrose on the basis that fructose raises blood sugars to a lesser extent when sucrose is fully exchanged for fructose. However, the claim relates to a one-third to two-third ratio of fructose:sucrose as being effective without confirmatory evidence. Additionally, fructose has the potential to acutely raise blood pressure and plasma uric acid, which would be regarded as undesirable effects. Hence the aim of this work is to test the glycaemic, uricaemic and blood pressure raising potential of sweetened beverages containing sucrose and fructose added in various proportions to test beverages. Our hypotheses are that partial replacement of sucrose with fructose will lower postprandial glycemic response and raise uricaemia with no effect on blood pressure.</summary>
