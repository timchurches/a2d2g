  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) to latex (SLIT latex, ALK-Abello, Madrid, Spain). The SLIT is oral fluid.
The treatment was administered once a day: two drops of SLIT each day. The study was performed in two phases: the first one, double-blind, placebo-controlled during one year; and the second one, also for one year, opened, where every patient received active treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo.
The placebo was made of the same dilution liquid (water) used in the active treatment. The active treatment had no taste, and had clear appearance, so no masking was required.</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>

      <outcome>Conjunctival challenge test.
The difference in the concentration of latex extract needed to obtain 5 points of symptoms in the conjunctival challenge test was compared between placebo and active groups after one year of active treatment and intragroup after one and two years of treatment.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glove use test.
The difference in the time using the latex glove needed to obtain 5 points of symptoms in the glove used test was compared between placebo and active groups after one year of active treatment and intragroups after one and two years of treatment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Specific IgE determination.
Specific IgE to NRL was measured using commercial uniCAP (Phadia, Sweden) to NRL (k81), and to recombinant main allergenic components of latex (Hev b 1, hev b 3, hev b 5, Hev b 6, and Hev b 8). The results were compared between placebo and active groups after one year of active treatment and intragroups after one and two years of treatment.</outcome>

    <concealment>A randomization table in 4-patient groups was performed. Each patient was assigned to a correlative number. The investigator who included the patients was unaware to which group the subject was allocated.
Allocation was made assigning a correlative number to each patient. Treatments, active and placebo were bought to the laboratory (ALK-Abello). The laboratory created a randomization table, in 4 patient-groups (each 4 correlative patients, 2 were placebo and 2 active) and labelled the treatments with one number. The external appearence of placebo or active treatments were identical.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>BACKGROUND: Natural rubber latex allergy is still an unsolved health problem. In addition to the recommended avoidance to the allergen, therapeutic measures are needed and therefore so are immunotherapy extracts with proven efficacy and safety.
The aim of the present randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of latex sublingual immunotherapy in adult patients undergoing permanent latex avoidance.
METHODS: Twenty-eight adult latex-allergic patients (5 males and 23 females), with mean age of 39 years (range 24-57) were randomized to receive a commercial latex-sublingual immunotherapy or placebo during one year, followed by another year of open, active therapy. The following outcomes were measured at baseline and at the end of first and second year of follow-up: skin prick test, gloves-use score, conjunctival challenge test, total and specific IgE, basophil activation test, and adverse reactions monitoring. 
RESULTS: No significant difference in any of the efficacy in vivo variables was observed between active and placebo groups at the end of the placebo-controlled phase, nor when each group was compared with their baseline values at the end of the two year-study. An improvement in the average percentage of basophils activated was observed. During the induction phase, 4 reactions in the active and 5 in the placebo group were recorded. During the maintenance phase, two patients dropped out due to pruritus and to acute dermatitis respectively.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to evaluate latex-sublingual immunotherapy, since efficacy could not be demonstrated in adult patients with avoidance of the allergen.</summary>
