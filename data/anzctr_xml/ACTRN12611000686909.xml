  <interventions>
    <interventions>Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) arm - 6 weeks
a) subjects exhales on one breath through the expiratory pressure threshold device.  Device will be set at 75% of the subject's maximum expiratory pressure (MEP).
b) five repetitions of the exercise = 1 block
c) five blocks completed daily, five days per week

Traditional voice therapy/ Usual Care arm - 6 weeks
a) release of muscle tension
b) establishment of 'Twang' voice quality
c) visual and auditory biofeedback
d) negative practice
e) improved breath support via postural stability
1x weekly one-on-one sessions with a speech pathologist for up to 60 minutes per session</interventions>
    <comparator>Patients may be required to wait for services, in which case they will be allocated to a waitlist for 6 weeks.  These patients will act as the control group, as they will be reevaluated to see if spontaneous recover has occurred prior to being allocated to one of the two 'active treatment' arm (Expiratory Muscle Strength Training OR Traditional Voice Therapy/Usual Care)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Determine which therapy is more efficacious in treating dysphonia secondary to unilateral vocal fold palsy using:
1) Videostroboscopy - measuring (a) degree of cord movement; (b) mucosal wave; (c) electroglottography
2) Consensus Auditory Perception of Voice (CAPE-V)
3) Voice Handicap Index (VHI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (pre treatment) and post therapy (after 6 weeks treatment)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>determine whether participants who are waitlisted for therapy experience spontaneous recovery from unilateral vocal fold palsy using

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>patients referred to Voice Clinic who meet inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.  Once consented, they will be allocated to either (a) intervention (b) waitlisted.  If they are allocated to the intervention group, they will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms.  If they are waitlisted, they will be reviewed in six weeks to determine if their dysphonia has resolved.  If they continue to demonstrate vocal fold palsy they will move to (a) and be randomized to one of the two interventions.

Randomization will occur using a computer program 'Sealed Envelope Limited' which wil allocate patients to one of the two active treatment arms.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1.	Patients with a unilateral vocal fold palsy (UVFP) who are randomized to undertake Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) will demonstrate greater improvement in measures of voice quality and airway protection over a six-week period than patients who are randomized to undertake Usual voice therapy.  
2.	Both the EMST and Usual groups will show improvement in their measures of voice quality compared to patients who elect not to undertake therapy.
3.	Patients who undergo EMST and Usual therapy will maintain improvements to their vocal quality when followed up one month post completion of treatment.
4.	Patients with UVFP in the EMST group will show greater adherence to treatment techniques than patients in the Usual group.</summary>
