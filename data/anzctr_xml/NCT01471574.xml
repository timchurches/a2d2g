  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Sustained Virologic Response at Follow-up Week 12 (SVR12) - SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) values lower than the lower limit of quantitation, target detected or target not detected at follow-up Week 12. HCV RNA levels were measured by the Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test version 2.0 from the central laboratory. HAART=highly active antiretroviral therapy. SVR12 was defined as hepatitis C virus (HCV) values lower than the lower limit of quantitation, target detected or target not detected at follow-up Week 12. HCV RNA levels were measured by the Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test version 2.0 from the central laboratory. HAART=highly active antiretroviral therapy.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA Levels Lower Than The Lower Limit of Quantitation (LLOQ), Target Detected (TD) or Target Not Detected (TND) - Participants who achieved HCV RNA levels lower than the LLOQ i.e., 25 IU/ml, TD or TND. HCV RNA levels were measured by the Roche COBAS® TaqMan® HCV Test version 2.0 from the central laboratory. HAART=highly active antiretroviral therapy.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants Who Died and With Serious Adverse Event (SAEs), Grade 3 to 4 Adverse Events (AEs), and AEs Leading to Discontinuation - Adverse event was defined as any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a pre-existing condition that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE was defined as a medical event that at any dose resulted in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; was life-threating, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or required prolonged hospitalization.
