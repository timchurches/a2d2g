  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a longitudinal observational study to examine clinical phenotypes and adipose tissue characteristics of weight-cyclers vs non-cyclers. Pre-menopausal obese women undergoing bariatric surgery will be recruited and followed up for 2 years. Prior to surgery, patients will fill in a validated questionnaire to categorise them into weight cyclers or non-weight cyclers and body composition (DXA) and resting metabolic rate (hand-held respirometer) will be measured. At the time of surgery, a fasting blood sample and subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue biopsies will be obtained. Participants will return to the clinic at 6, 12 and 24 months to measure anthropometry, resting metabolic rate and body composition.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This is an exploratory study comparing examining resting metabolic rate, body composition and circulating and adipose tissue expression profiles of women classified as weight cyclers vs non-weight cyclers via self-report questionnaire. 

We aim to recruit 100 obese women. Given that weight cycling is estimated to occur in 30% of the population, we anticipate classifying 30 women/group as weight cyclers vs non/less severe weight cyclers. This sample size is similar to previously published studies in this area. Our target sample size of 100 women was chosen in order to provide a large enough sample size to successfully stratify the cohort into weight cyclers vs non/less severe weight cyclers,

Statistics. We will use Independent Samples T-test/Mann Whitney U to test comparisons in clinical and adipose tissue characteristics between participants classified as weight cyclers vs non-weight cyclers. Regression analyses (general linear models) will be used to test whether weight cycling status at baseline is associated with weight loss or changes in cardio-metabolic markers at follow-up time-points. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Weight cycling (yo-yo dieting) is an ongoing battle for many obese individuals and is commonly believed to impair energy metabolism and promote future weight gain. However, scientific evidence for this idea remains scarce and mechanisms of how this occurs has not been examined in humans.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether weight-cyclers have impaired energy metabolism, greater fat deposition and greater circulating and fat tissue inflammation compared to non-cyclers.

100 overweight/obese women undergoing bariatric surgery will be recruited into this study. 60 women (30/group) will be classified as weight-cyclers or non-cyclers using a validated questionnaire. Blood and fat tissue samples will be collected at the time of surgery and markers of inflammation measured in the laboratory. Clinic visits will be performed at baseline prior to surgery and at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.  Measurements include anthropometry, body composition, resting metabolic rate and circulating markers of cardiometabolic disease (glucose, insulin, HbA1c, lipids, inflammation).

Using a rigorous scientific approach and comprehensive clinical phenotyping we will address whether individuals who weight cycle have reduced energy expenditure and greater fat deposition. These results will assist in tailoring personalised weight loss treatment strategies for the over 70% of Australians affected by overweight and obesity.</summary>
