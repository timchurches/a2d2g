  <interventions>
    <interventions>Usual salt intake in overweight and obese people is approximately 11 g salt/day in men and 8 g salt/day in women which is much higher than the NHMRC population target of 6g salt/day. In this study patients will be educated to reduce their salt intake using the simple strategy to choose foods defined according to the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) guideline of 120 mg sodium/100g food. They will also be given general guidelines regarding reducing sodium intake.  This advice will be given on an individual basis by a dietitian at the start of the study and participants will have access to the dietitian for advice and support regarding dietary changes throughout the study.  Interventions will require three visits of about 30 minutes duration at the start of the study, and at three and six months, where blood pressure will be taken and height and weight measured.  A 24 hour urine sample will also be collected on each occasion.  Compliance will be assessed by sodium excretion measurement.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a randomised parallel study of two groups - salt reduction to a target 100mmol Na/day (approximately 6g salt/day) compared with usual care.  Usual care is defined as dietary education with no specific advice on sodium reduction. At the end of the study patients in the usual care arm will be given the same information about reducing salt intake as the intervention arm.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A high salt intake is a neglected risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Recently attention has been drawn to the potential reduction in death and disease a decrease of 3g salt/day can bring. The aim of this study is to translate knowledge into practice by substantiating dietetic practice in salt reduction in individuals with hypertension at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular disease is a significant burdens for individuals and for the Australian health care system potentially leading to early death or disability. Keeping blood pressure well controlled has a key role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Salt reduction can greatly assist blood pressure control but there are no studies evaluating the most effective education strategies to help people with hypertension implement and maintain salt reduction. This study will help fill this gap. The expected outcomes are that a lower salt intake of 6g/day is sustainable and will reduce blood pressure by 3-5mmHg SBP/day.</summary>
