  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study aims to investigate whether the neuropathic pain medication pregabalin (Lyrica) is more effective than standard paracetamol in relieving pain and widespread neuropathic-type symptoms in individuals with mild to moderately painful knee osteoarthritis, who have been assessed for the additional presence of neuropathic pain. 
Participants will be randomly allocated to take either Lyrica (intervention) and placebo paracetamol (sugar pills) or 1000mg paracetamol four times daily (active control) and placebo Lyrica (sugar pills) daily for 28 days. The Lyrica dose will be titrated from 75mg daily to a potential maximum of 150mg over 14 days, dependent on individual tolerance level. All medications are to be taken orally.
All patients will be issued with a medication diary in which clear instructions are provided for titrating medications. In addition to this, patients will receive regular telephone calls to ensure titration instructions are understood and adhered to. Research staff will work very closely with patients in this area. 
Note: Patients will be required to complete the medication diary with the number of tablets taken on each day. This will be returned at the end of the study along with any unused medication. At this point drug accountability will be performed by research staff before returning to Pharmacy, who will also monitor drug accountability.

    <comparator>Participants on the active control arm will be prescribed 1000mg paracetamol four times daily and placebo Lyrica for the duration of the study which is 28 days. Both the paracetamol and placebo Lyrica will need to be taken orally. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cold Detection and Cold Pain Threshold (CDT &amp; CPT) at index knee to assess cold hyperalgesia. 

This outcome is measured using a Peltier thermode. The thermode probe is attached to the test site with a velcro strap and subjects given time to adapt to the baseline temperature of 32C. When the device is activated the thermode temperature will drop at a rate of 1C/sec. Subjects will be instructed to depress the hand-held switch as soon as they perceive any cooling change from baseline. The endpoint measure is the thermode temperature (C) at first perceived cooling change from baseline. The thermode then returns to the baseline temperature. For cold pain threshold testing, subjects will be instructed to press the switch as soon as the cooling sensation changes to one of painful cold, thereby reversing the temperature to baseline. The endpoint measure is the thermode temperature on first indicated painful cold. For both CDT and CPT, one practice will be followed by 3 trials, each trial separated by a randomly assigned pause of between 3 and 6 seconds. The mean of the trials will be calculated for analysis.

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) at index knee to assess mechanical hyperalgesia.

This outcome will be measured using a digital pressure algometer. The 1cm2 algometer probe is applied at a 90 degree angle to the skin at a rate of rise of applied pressure of 40kPa/sec. Subjects are instructed to depress the hand-held switch as soon as the sensation of pressure becomes one of painful pressure. The endpoint measure is the pressure value (kPa/cm2) when the subject indicates painful pressure. One practice followed by 3 trials, with the mean calculated for analysis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 Days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self Reported Clinical Measures using The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain subscore &amp; PainDETECT scores.

WOMAC will be used to evaluate subjective pain, stiffness and functional limitation at each test session. This OA-specific self-report scale is widely used to measure pain and disability from knee OA.

Pain DETECT Neuropathic Pain Diagnostic Questionnaire is a validated self report tool and will be used to identify neuropathic pain components in subjects within this study. </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 Days</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cold Detection &amp; Cold Pain Threshold (CPT), Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) and cold response at other sites (widespread hyperalgesia).

This outcome will be measured using the same methods that will be employed to assess the 1st and 2nd primary outcomes. However instead of assessing only the knees for signs of cold hyperalgesia, other sites will be assessed. This includes the forearm (extensor carpi radialis brevis) and lower leg (tibialis anterior). </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 Days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vibration Detection Threshold (VDT) - will be assessed using a Vibrameter. The device will be applied at a standard pressure equivalent to th eprobe weight (650g) and the vibration amplitude will be gradually increased to the point where the subject indicates they perceive the vibration - VPT. The device will then be activated at a higher amplitude and the amplitude will be gradually decreased to the point where the stimulus is no longer felt - vibration disappearance threshold (VDT). One practice and three trials will be carried out for each measure. </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 Days</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of Life will be measured with the SF-36v2, a generic self-reported health outcomes assessment tool. The tool measures general health status via eight domains, including mental health, general health perceptions and physical functioning, generating either sub-scores or a total score of health outcome. 
 </outcome>
      <timepoint>28 Days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Pain Quality Assessment Scale (PQAS) Questionnaire will be used to provide data regarding the dimensions of spontaineous pain experienced by OA subjects. Subjects will complete the PQAS at each test session in order to assess the effect of the medication on specific sub-scales which reflect different pain domains. </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>It is estimated that from previous studies that in order to achieve a power of 80%, based on a clinically significant change in primary outcomes of 20% the study will require approx. 45 subjects per group, with a total cohort of 90 subjects. 
Clinically significant change has been calculated as an approximate 15-20% improvement from baseline mean. To detect a 20% change from baseline, a sample size of between 38 and 51 would be needed per group. </statisticalmethods>
