  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be allocated to receive:

Fan A: a hand held, battery-operated fan that generates a low air flow rate and general advice about breathlessness management and exercise.; or 

Fan B: a hand held, battery-operated fan that generates a high air flow rate (three bladed hand held battery operated Cooler Multi Function Personal Mini Fan by Design Go) and general advice about breathlessness management and exercise.

Intervention participants will be taught how to use the hand held battery operated fan in the context of general advice about breathlessness management and exercise. 

Participants will be encouraged to use the fan when they feel breathless e.g. in relation to waking, exercise and other daily activities over the following 28 days. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control goup will be given information leaflets outlining practical advice on managing breathlessness including breathing control exercises, positions for recovery from breathlessness, advice about the importance of exercise and some simple exercises to try will be provided to all participants. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially eligible participants will be approached by the patientâ€™s usual clinician and referred to the study nurse or clinician investigator if agreeable to finding out more about the fan study. Potential participants will then be contacted by a member of the investigating team to discuss participation in the study. Eligibility will be assessed at this time and the potential participant provided with a participant information sheet. Case identification in outpatient and inpatient clinics will also occur with case note review. 

In the UK the allocation of the randomisation codes will be held in the oncology clinical trials unit in Hull and in Australia these codes will be held in the Sacred Heart Clinical Trials Unit, in Darlinghurst, NSW.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be allocated by block randomisation (1:1:2) to receive one of the three study arms. The Central Registry will be responsible for generating the block randomisation tables and will provide each site with the required number of randomisation sequence contained within sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.  


The allocation will be recorded on the schedule along with the date of allocation, and the participant ID number. On randomisation of a participant, the study nurse or trials unit manager at each centre will email a notification to the Australian coordinating site, using study number only. This notice will be monitored alongside the participant eligibility as entered onto the on-line data base from CRF A by the study nurse.

    <statisticalmethods>As this is a feasibility study aiming to generate basic information on outcome estimates for powering the Phase III study no hypothesis will be tested. However, the following simple analyses will be conducted:
1. Descriptive analysis on recruitment per site per unit time
2.Descriptive analysis on the completion of endpoints
3.Comparison of fan or no fan groups, irrespective of flow rate, with regard to activity as measured by the activPAL (Trademark) monitor. 
4.To estimate the magnitude of outcome measures as well as to calculate the corresponding variance associated with these estimates. 
5.Differences in the primary study outcome between the low flow and high flow fan groups. 
6.Feasibility analysis regarding the percentage of people who completed all measures and study withdrawal rates.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people live with the distress and difficulties arising from breathlessness which continues despite treatment of the disease which is causing it.
Exercise is known to be important and helpful for breathlessness, but the breathlessness itself, inevitably triggered by exertion, often puts people off persisting with this. Simple measures such as the use of a hand held battery operated fan to give cool airflow to the face can be helpful in easing breathlessness.  The fan is cheap, easy to use and to carry around and something that both patient and their carer can manage, but it has never been assessed to see whether such a simple device could support people to exercise more as part of their daily routine. However, it is likely that in order to test this question, we will need a big study with several research teams who have an interest in the area working together.
This study is the first step in planning such a study involving colleagues in the UK and Australia. This first stage, therefore, is to see how we should set up such a study with regard to the following: 
1.	Will patient participants find the study we propose acceptable and practical?
2.	What are the practicalities of working together with colleagues from the UK?
3.	What number of participants would we need to make the full study able to answer our research question and is it possible to recruit sufficient numbers?</summary>
