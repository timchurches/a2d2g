  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Antenatal depression, anxiety and the difficulties associated with adjusting to parenthood can have long-term negative effects on parents and their children. This study will test whether an 8-week self-help antenatal intervention with telephone support will reduce postnatal negative mood and parenting stress, increase health service uptake, as well as facilitate adjustment to parenthood in couples receiving the program compared to couples not receiving the program. 100 women with elevated scores (&gt;12) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and/or the Risk Assessment Checklist (RAC) and their partners, and 100 women with scores below the threshold (&lt;13) on the EPDS and the RAC and their partners will be randomised to either intervention or control groups. Participants will be assessed by self-administered questionnaires at 20-32 weeks of pregnancy and 12 weeks postpartum.</summary>
