    <interventions>The LLTTF programme is life skills educational course based on CBT principles. The programme will be facilitated by the Lead researcher Doctorate of Clinical Psychology Candidate James Martyn. The facilitator will undergo weekly supervision regarding the classes with a registered clinical psychologist who specialises in older adult health (Associate Professor Paul Merrick). Classes will run once a week, for eight weeks, with classes taking approximately 1.5 hours. Measures will be taken each week, which will also act as an indication of attendance. 

The programme is designed to guide individuals to construct a self-assessment of their current experiences in a supportive group environment, while also enabling members to develop the life skills necessary to deal with challenges common to symptoms of depression and anxiety, both in and out of class. As such, the programme is a group-guided self-help course, not a therapy group. The programme utilises PowerPoint slides, lecture notes/scripts, worksheets, and self-help workbooks specific to each class topic. The self-help workbooks are also designed to facilitate the practice of CBT skills predominantly out of the class context throughout the following week. Each class contains a mixture of didactic teaching, question and answers, as well as group- and pair-based activities. Weekly class topics are titled: 1) Why do I feel so bad?; 2) I cant be bothered doing anything; 3) Why does everything always go wrong?; 4) Im not good enough (low confidence); 5) How to fix almost everything; 6) The things you do that mess you up; 7) Are you strong enough to keep your temper?; 8) Ten things you can do to help you feel happier straight away. Both the class content and the materials provided use everyday language and avoid professional terminology so as to make the CBT information easily understandable and applicable. Each class involves 10-15 minuet tea and coffee time, 15 minutes for session psychometric measures, and 70 minutes of class activity time. The total time will be no longer than 105 minutes. </interventions>
    <comparator>I will be running only one group with no wait-list or controls. The statistical analysis I will be using is called Multi-Level Hierarchical Modeling. This allows the investigation of both within &amp; between-subject variables. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Depression will be measured using a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) with scores greater than 4 and less than 20 included in the study, as well as a Visual Analogue Scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis will be measuring trajectories of change at ten time-points. One measure will be taken during screening. Eight measures will be taken weekly at the start of the eight classes. Finally, one measure will be taken at an eight-week follow-up. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Anxiety will be measured using a Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAI) as well as a Visual Analogue Scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis will be measuring trajectories of change at ten time-points. One measure will be taken during screening. Eight measures will be taken weekly at the start of the eight classes. Finally, one measure will be taken at an eight-week follow-up. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life will be measured using a Quality of Life and Enjoyment Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) as well as a Visual Analogue Scale. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis will be measuring trajectories of change at ten time-points. One measure will be taken during screening. Eight measures will be taken weekly at the start of the eight classes. Finally, one measure will be taken at an eight-week follow-up. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Engagement will be measured using a purpose-designed Participant Engagement Questionnaire that has three visual analogue scales asking participants their satisfaction with their reading, thinking, and application of skills out side of class. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Participants will be asked to complete the engagement questionnaire at eight time points. Time points will be weekly, from the second class and at the final two-month follow-up. The engagement measure will only be administered from the second class, as the measure asks about their engagement with class materials outside of the class over the previous week.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be required to be community dwelling (i.e., living independently without the current need for ongoing part-time or full-time assistance such as residential care) and be between 60 and 75 years of age. Additionally, participants must present with mild to moderately-severe symptoms of depression, with scores of between 5 (below 5 reflects minimal symptoms) and 19 (above 19 reflects severe symptoms) on the PHQ-9. Participants must be able to read, write, speak, and understand English, must be able travel to the classes, and not be currently receiving psychotherapy. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Individuals will not be asked to participate in the study if you fail to meet the inclusion criteria. Additionally, individuals will not be included if they state that their doctor or anyone else has expressed any serious concerns about your cognitive functioning. Finally, they will also not be able to attend if they are currently receiving psychotherapy or they have a current diagnosis (or serious concerns about) alcohol abuse, substance abuse, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or borderline personality disorder. Individuals who fail to meet the aforementioned criteria will be informed via letter that they did not meet criteria and will not be asked to continue in the study. However, unsuccessful applicants will be provided with information concerning where they can access alternative LLTTF content. </exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Non-randomised trial</allocation>
    <concealment>As the classes are non-randomised, there is no allocation to treatment. All individuals who show interest in the study are sent an information pack with screening material. Material is returned in a pre-paid envelop to one of the study supervisors. The supervisor de-identifies the information and gives the questionnaires to the primary investigator to score. The Investigator scores the information, any information that is found to not meet criteria is discussed with the primary supervisor, and then the individual is told of this decision by mail. They are however provided with alternative ways of accessing the content on their own behalf. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Primary analysis will be performed using multi-level modelling (MLM; Singer &amp; Willett, 2003). The use of MLM allows for time to be treated as a continuous variable, separate to that of other individual variables of interest. This enables different levels of longitudinal data to be simultaneously investigated. In contrast to examining group averages over time, MLM allows the development of individual growth models. In doing so, individual trajectories can be established, which enables the investigation of both within- and between-subject variables. That is, relationships can be derived from within an individuals data over time (Level 1) and in the data between individuals (Level 2; Kwok et al., 2008). MLM is also advantageous in that its assumptions regarding a sample and its size are flexible enough to accommodate factors such as an unbalanced designs, attrition, and missing data. Therefore, given the benefits and flexibility provided by MLM, particularly with longitudinal data sets, there is good rationale for the use of MLM in the proposed study.

Upon investigating the best analysis for my proposed study, a known issue was that it would be very difficult to gain a sufficient sample size given a number of practical study limitations. With this in mind, the primary researcher choose the best analysis (with statistical consultation) that provides enough descriptive information (individual and group trajectories) that can be used alongside inferential analysis (creating hierarchical prediction models) with lower power. Rather than a pre-post design, this analysis provides much richer information, showing shapes and stages of change over time. These facts in addition to the amount of variables needed to calculate a power analysis for MLM, the small amount of research done with group low-intensity work to obtain data to estimate data for a power analysis, and the differing arguments in literature as per the minimum sample size in each level, thereby combined to make an official power or sample size analysis too difficult. With this in mind, we will be doing a retrospective power analysis. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study has two aims. First, the study aims to investigate the effect of a group-based CBT self-help programme (LLTTF) on community dwelling older adults ratings of depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Second, the study aims to investigate whether there is a positive relationship between community dwelling older adults engagement with the LLTTF programme and improvements in their perceived ratings on primary outcome measures.</summary>
