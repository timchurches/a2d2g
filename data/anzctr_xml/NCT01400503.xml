  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Patients with Adverse Events - An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of multicentric Castleman's disease patients evaluated for assessment of atypical IL-6 splice variants or cleavage fragments - Pharmacodynamic biomarker evaluations include assessment of atypical IL-6 splice variants or cleavage fragments.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of multicentric Castleman's disease patients evaluated for assessment of C-reactive protein - Pharmacodynamic biomarker evaluations include assessment of C-reactive protein.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of previously responding multicentric Castleman's disease patients and siltuximab-naive patients who maintain disease control - Disease assessments (including cutaneous assessments), are provided as a guide for assessing multicentric Castleman's disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 6 years</timepoint>

      <outcome>Multicentric Castleman's Disease Symptom Scale scores - Multicentric Castleman's Disease Symptom Scale scores questionnaire will only be completed by the sub-population from the C0328T03 study. These scores will be calculated as a measure of severity of symptoms.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to 12 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of glycoform clearance analysis - For evaluating the clearance and degradation of glycoforms after administration of siltuximab, 6 serum samples will be collected from 5 former C0328T03 patients (a limited number of samples are needed for this analysis).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assessment of in vivo protein degradation analysis - Siltuximab will be isolated from the serum samples using an anti-Id antibody. The purified protein will be analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy techniques (intact mass and peptide mapping).</outcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Has multicentric Castleman's disease

          -  Have previously been enrolled in Study C0328T03 or CNTO328MCD2001 (either treatment
             arm)

          -  Have had their last administration of study treatment (siltuximab or placebo) less
             than 6 weeks (window of plus 2 weeks) prior to first dose

          -  Patients must not have had disease progression while receiving siltuximab. For those
             patients originally assigned to placebo in the CNTO328MCD2001 study, patients who have
             received less than 4 months of siltuximab following crossover will also be eligible
