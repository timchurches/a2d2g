  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Remission at Week 8 - Remission in participants was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of Ulcerative Colitis . It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of centrally read flexible proctosigmoidoscopy and physician global assessment (PGA), each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher score indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Mucosal Healing at Week 8 - Mucosal healing in participants was defined by Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1. The Mayo endoscopic subscore consisted of the findings of centrally read flexible proctosigmoidoscopy, graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Clinical Response at Week 8 - Clinical response in participants was defined by a decrease from baseline in Mayo score of at least 3 points and at least 30 percent, with an accompanying decrease in the rectal bleeding sub score of at least 1 point or an absolute rectal bleeding sub score of 0 or 1. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible centrally read proctosigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher score indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Endoscopic Remission at Week 8 - Endoscopic remission in participants was defined by Mayo endoscopic subscore of 0. The Mayo endoscopic subscore consisted of the findings of centrally read flexible proctosigmoidoscopy, graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission at Week 8 - Clinical remission in participants was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible centrally read proctosigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.

      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Symptomatic Remission at Week 8 - Symptomatic remission was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point, and 0 subscore for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible centrally read proctosigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher score indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Deep Remission at Week 8 - Deep remission in participants was defined by a total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1 point and 0 subscore for both rectal bleeding and endoscopic subscores. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible centrally read proctosigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher score indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Week 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Partial Mayo Scores - A partial mayo score (mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA) and each grading from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Partial Mayo Scores at Weeks 2, 4 and 8 - Change in Partial Mayo scores at Weeks 2, 4, 8 relative to baseline were reported. A Partial Mayo Score (Mayo score without endoscopy) ranges from 0 (normal or inactive disease) to 9 (severe disease) and calculated as the sum of 3 subscores (stool frequency, rectal bleeding and PGA) with each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 8</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Total Mayo Score at Week 8 - Change in total Mayo scores at Week 8 relative to Baseline was reported. Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of UC. It consisted of 4 subscores: stool frequency, rectal bleeding, findings of flexible centrally read proctosigmoidoscopy and PGA, each graded from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more severe disease. These scores were summed up to give a total score range of 0 to 12; where higher score indicating more severe disease.</outcome>
