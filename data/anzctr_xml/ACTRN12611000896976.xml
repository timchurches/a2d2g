  <interventions>
    <interventions>Music Therapy: 10 group sessions. 1 session each week for 10 consecutive week. Each session of 60 minutes length. The sessions will be facilitated by a trained music therapist. 

Music therapy is a client centred therapy. The exact structure of sessions depends on the presentation of participants. Sessions are likely to include improvised music making and/or the singing of familiar songs as the therapist encourages, supports and accompanies clients active music making. Clients may contribute during sessions by speaking, singing and/or playing instruments that are accessible to them.</interventions>
    <comparator>There is only one treatment group in this study. The participants act as their own control. Each participant initially has 4 weeks of standard care only (control) followed by 4 weeks of music therapy (intervention) and standard care.  Standard care is the delivery of regular services by the Mental Health Services for Older People team to assist the client as decided by the weekly Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meetings. This includes interventions from professionals within the team such as psychiatrists, psychologists, community nurses, social workers and occupational therapists.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research will study the effect of group music therapy on older adults with psychiatric disorders. The participants will be clients of the Mental Health Services for Older People (MSHOP) team at Counties Manukau District Health Board. There will be 12 participants. Each participant will initially have a period of at least 4 weeks of standard care by the MHSOP team. They will then receive 10 consecutive weekly 60 minute group music therapy sessions, along with continued standard care by the MHSOP team. They will be assisted to complete 3 questionnaires during the research process. These questionnaires will assess level of anxiety, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Each questionnaire will be answered 5 times: 4 weeks before the start of music therapy, before the 1st music therapy session, after the last music therapy session, week 4 and week 10 after the last music therapy session. At the end of the music therapy sessions, the participants, the session co-facilitator and family members who attend the session will participate in a group semi-structured interview session about their experience of the music therapy sessions. It is anticipated findings of this study will demonstrate positive effects of music therapy for this client group and warrant a larger study.</summary>
