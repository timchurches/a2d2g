  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Participants will be enrolled into the study by an independent nurse, research assistant or doctor who will determine if they are adults between the age of 18-50 years, presenting with an acceptable uncomplicated history of acute alcohol intoxication (no injuries, no overdose, no psychiatric conditions requiring ongoing investigation or treatment), with an otherwise unremarkable physical examination.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Children and young people less than 18 years of age, people with intellectual or mental impairment, women who may be pregnant and the human fetus are excluded from this study. Patients who refuse breath alcohol level analyser, IV cannula insertion, and bloods testing will be excluded as well. Patients who are found to have significant injuries (i.e head injury) or concomitant conditions (overdose) requiring further investigation or treatment will also be excluded. Patients requiring airway support more than a nasopharyngeal airway or Gudell airway (i.e. endotrachael or nasotrachael intubation) will be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Waiver of consent has been obtained for this research. Every patient that is eligible based on inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.  Randomisation is done by an independent statistician. 

Within the blocked design, odd numbers are allocated to the control group and even numbers are allocated to the treatment group. The allocation to either control or treatment group is printed on a 4x6cm paper, folded in half three times, then placed in individual sequentially-numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE). These envelopes are to be opened only after a patient is ready for allocation to either control or treatment group.</concealment>
    <sequence>An independent statistician will generate the number sequence using computerized sequence generation.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our study aims to fill a knowledge gap about a highly relevant question for emergency medicine that has not had any solid research behind it. We aim to prove or disprove if there is any evidence in giving intravenous 0.9 NaCl to the length of stay and symptoms of patients presenting to the emergency department with alcohol intoxication. We will also consider the economic costs of providing intravenous saline and associated ED stay for these patients compared to observation alone.</summary>
