  <interventions>
    <interventions>Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) - EMDR is a form of psychotherapy that was developed by Francine Shapiro to resolve the development of trauma-related disorders caused by exposure to distressing events.  The theory suggests that when distressing experiences occur they may overwhelm usual cognitive and neurological coping mechanisms.  The memory and associated stimuli of the event are inadequately processed, and are dysfunctionally stored in an isolated memory network.  The goal of EMDR therapy is to process these distressing memories, using dual attention stimuli (by way of bilateral stimulation e.g. eye movements, tones, or tapping), while triggering a physiological state that facilitates information processing, therefore reducing the distress and allowing clients to develop more adaptive coping mechanisms.

Duration of EMDR: 3 x 75min sessions over 2 or 3 consecutive weeks

Method of administration: one-on-one sessions with a clinician</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator (active) treatment: Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) - MBRP is a treatment approach developed at the Addictive Behaviors Research Center (University of Washington) for individuals in recovery for addictive behaviors.  It integrates mindfulness meditation practices with traditional relapse prevention strategies.  The program is designed specifically to help prevent or manage relapse for clients with alcohol and other substsance use problems through practices that foster increased awareness of triggers, habitual patterns, and automatic reactions.

Duration of MBRP: 3 x 75min sessions over 2 or 3 consecutive weeks

Method of administration: one-on-one sessions with a clinician


Placebo (control) treatment: Cognitive training to improve memory, attention, executive functioning, and problem solving skills.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a well-established first line psychological treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.  In the addictions field, it has been suggested that clients presenting with addictions have a concomitant history of trauma, and comorbidity rates of up to 75%.  However, few studies to date have documented the use of EMDR in this area, and its efficacy as a treatment for addictions remains unclear and less well established in the literature.  In the utility of EMDR for the treatment of alcohol dependency, the limited research available has suggested promising results in reducing craving for alcohol.  The experience of craving for substances has been suggested by researchers to be one of the factors maintaining alcohol/drug use, as well as a precipitating factor for relapse.  Implications for establishing the efficacy of EMDR in addiction treatment therefore includes the potential to improve existing relapse prevention programs, and consequently to reduce relapse rates.  

The current study aims to examine and evaluate the application of EMDR in the treatment of individuals with substance dependence.  Specifically, the efficacy of an EMDR treatment that targets the experience of craving for substances will be investigated.  Research questions for the study are as follows:
1.  Is the application of EMDR in targeting craving effective as an adjunct to treatment for substance dependent individuals? 
2.  How does adding EMDR to a standardized treatment program for substance dependence compare to the:  
(a) addition of an active relapse prevention program (Mindfulness-based relapse prevention, MBRP)? and 
(b) addition of a program unassociated with craving and relapse prevention (cognitive rehabilitation)?</summary>
