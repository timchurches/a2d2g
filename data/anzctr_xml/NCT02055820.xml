  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study of venetoclax administered orally in
      combination with rituximab (R) or obinutuzumab (G) and standard doses of cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine and oral prednisone (CHOP) in participants with Non-Hodgkin's
      Lymphoma (NHL). The study will consist of 2 stages: a dose-finding Phase Ib stage and a Phase
      II expansion stage. In the Phase I portion of the study, participants will be randomized to
      one of 2 treatment arms venetoclax in combination with R-CHOP (Arm A) and venetoclax in
      combination with G-CHOP (Arm B) and will explore the doses of venetoclax in combination with
      R-CHOP and G-CHOP. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of venetoclax in combination with R-CHOP
      and G-CHOP will be determined during the dose-finding stage. For the Phase II portion of the
      study, the venetoclax dose for venetoclax + R-CHOP is on a non-continuous dosing schedule as
      determined by the Phase Ib portion of the study based on safety and tolerability observed in
      participants treated in the dose escalation portion of the study.</summary>
