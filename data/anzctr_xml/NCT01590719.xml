  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of onartuzumab (MetMAb) in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with
      metastatic HER2-negative adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Patients
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either onartuzumab (MetMAb) or placebo in
      combination with mFOLFOX6. Patients may continue to receive onartuzumab (MetMAb) or placebo
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision to
      discontinue treatment.</summary>
