The Trial Coordinator will verify the completeness of the eligibility checklist upon receipt of the document and follow up with the participating centre in the event of a discrepancy.
Participants will be randomised in the ratio of 1:1 using the minimisation technique. 
This is not a blinded study, treatment allocation is known.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be stratified by T stage (T1 or T2a) and whether medically operable or inoperable. Randomisation will be by the minimisation technique.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary> The purpose of this study is to investigate whether radiotherapy given as three large doses over a period of two weeks (hypofractionated radiotherapy) is more effective than standard radiotherapy for patients with non-small cell lung cancer that has not spread beyond the lung. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you aged 18 years or above and have a confirmed diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer within 6 weeks of study enrolment. Study details Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive the current standard of care treatment, which consists of chemotherapy and radiotherapy given in a number of small doses over a period of about 6 weeks. Participants in the other group will instead receive hypofractionated radiotherapy (HypoRT) in three large doses over a period of 2 weeks. All participants will be regularly monitored for up to 2 years in order to evaluate treatment response, survival, toxicity and quality of life. This will help us to determine whether hypofractionated radiotherapy is more effective, results in longer life expectancy and if it is just as safe as standard fractionated radiotherapy.</summary>
