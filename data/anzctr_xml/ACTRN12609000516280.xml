  <interventions>
    <interventions>creating laparotomy incision on the skin surface using the flat stainless-steel diathermy blade on 40W pure-cutting current. Diathermy blade has blunt tip and produces cutting effect by vaporising cells.

    <comparator>standard stainless steel scalpel with sharpened edge physically cuts the skin. Half of the incision is done using this standard scalpel and surface incision time is similar to the diathermy technique of few seconds</comparator>

    <concealment>patients are invited to participate in the trial following the consent for the operation required and are ensured that their participation or refusal of the trial will not affect their treatment.  Treatment allocation are based on computer generated sequence to ensure approximately equal number in each group.  The allocation is revealed to the surgeon immediately prior to the operation by a third party by referring to the randomisation table.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>each patients served as their own control with the full length of the scar approximately divided by two at the level of the umbilicus.  Each patient receive half of the length of the skin incision with diathermy and the other half with standard surgical scalpel.  Randomisation determines whether the upper or the lower half receives the intervention.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main purpose of the study is to compare the difference, if any, in the appearance of the surgical scar between the the diathermy blade and the standard surgical steel scalpel.  The blunt diathermy blade produces a cutting effect by passing electric current and vaporise the skin cells while the standard surgical scalpel physically cuts the skin. Anecdotal experience suggest there is no difference in the appearance of the scar between the two instruments.  However, the sharp surgical blade remains in common use, albeit almost exclusively for skin incision only in modern day abdominal surgery, because the general perception is that the diathermy will cause charring of the skin and thus results in poorer scar appearance.  The presence of the sharp blade poses significant and potentially avoidable risk of sharps injury to the entire surgical team. The study hypothesis is that there are no visible difference in the appearance of the scar between the diathermy and the scalpel.</summary>
