  <interventions>
    <interventions>Using a cluster randomised controlled trial design, 60 sites (30 intervention and 30 control) from 40 general practices and 20 Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services will be recruited. The intervention arm will receive the electronic decision support system for a period of 12 months. Features of HealthTracker include:
(1) Point of care decision support providing screening and management recommendations based on national guidelines; (2) A risk communication interface for discussing CVD management options with patients; (3) Access to a clinical audit tool that will provide immediate feedback on performance against a range of CVD-related indicators; (4) participation in a quality improvement component in which de-identified, peer-ranked monthly reports will be provided along with support to develop strategies to improve performance. Health staff will use some or all of these features at their discretion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control sites will continue with the usual care without access to the HealthTracker system. This includes use of any other tools and calculators and routine participation in auditing and other quality improvement activties.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of eligible patients receiving timely and appropriate measurements of their CVD risk at end of study. 

Appropriate measurement of CVD risk factors is defined as having recorded or updated in the record all the essential risk factors for measurement of CVD risk (smoking status, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in previous 12 months, total cholesterol and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in the previous 24 months) among those in whom risk assessment is guideline-indicated. Unless explicitly recorded, diagnoses of diabetes or left ventricular hypertrophy will be assumed to be absent. 

This clinical information will be extracted from the patient's electronic health record using a data extraction tool at baseline and at end of study. This tool will capture any new information entered during the course of routine health care.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The proportion of eligible patients assessed at high CVD risk receiving appropriate treatment for their CVD risk factors at end of study. 

High CVD risk is defined as a calculated 5-year CVD risk of &gt;15%, the presence of CVD or the presence of any clinically high risk conditions (as per NVDPA recommendations). 

Appropriate treatment for people at high CVD risk is defined as a prescription for at least one BP lowering medication and a statin for people at high risk without CVD; or a lowering of their 5 year CVD risk to &lt;15%; 

Appropriate treatment for people with an established diagnosis of CVD is defined as a prescription for at least one BP lowering medication and a statin and an antiplatelet agent (unless contraindicated by oral anticoagulant use). 

A data extraction tool will be used to extract risk factor information, diagnoses, and medication prescribing. Data will be extracted from the electronic record at baseline and again at end of study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measurement of individual vascular risk factors (smoking status, Blood Pressure, Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, Body Mass Index, Urinary Albumin to Creatinine ratio, estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) at end of study.

A data extraction tool will be used to extract risk factor information, diagnoses, and medication prescribing. Data will be extracted from the electronic record at baseline and again at end of study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intensification of medication prescribing among patients at high CVD risk. 

BP Intensification is defined as a new prescription for an additional class of BP drug at end of study when compared with baseline. 

Lipid  intensification is defined as a new prescription for an additional class of lipid lowering drug at end of study when compared with baseline.

Antiplatelet intensification is defined as a new prescription for an antiplatelet medication at end of study when compared with baseline for the high risk population with established CVD.

A data extraction tool will be used to extract risk factor information, diagnoses, and medication prescribing. Data will be extracted from the electronic record at baseline and again at end of study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in mean Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, Total Cholesterol, LDL Cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and Triglycerides. A data extraction tool will be used to extract risk factor information, diagnoses, and medication prescribing. Data will be extracted from the electronic record at baseline and again at end of study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>New cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease diagnoses. A data extraction tool will be used to extract risk factor information, diagnoses, and medication prescribing. Data will be extracted from the electronic record at baseline and again at end of study.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At end of study (approximately 12 - 18 months when follow-up has ended).</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Based on our prior research we have found that a large number of people are missing out on best practice care and this is leading to many avoidable deaths, especially from heart attack and stroke. HealthTracker is an electronic system that provides tailored management advice to staff and patients to reduce the risks of heart attack and stroke. There is a large body of international evidence that has shown electronic decision support systems lead to better quality care. Despite this, development of these systems in Australia has been limited and HealthTracker is the first of its kind to be used in primary health care services.

In the study, we will conduct:
1. Health service audits at the beginning and again at the end of 12 months. Anonymous data is collected on how well cardiovascular risk factors are measured and whether people at high risk of heart attack or stroke are being prescribed the recommended medicines. Comparisions will be made between the group who received the HealthTracker software and the group that did not.
2. Interviews with selected health staff and patients are being conducted to understand the usefulness and acceptability of HealthTracker.
3. Video or audio recording of some healthcare consultations between staff and patients will be conducted to better understand how HealthTracker is actually used in practice.</summary>
