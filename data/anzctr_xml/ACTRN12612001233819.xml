  <interventions>
    <interventions>Oral Vitamin D supplementation (50,000 IU cholecalciferol) or placebo taken once a fortnight over 11-12 weeks of pre-season training for the New Zealand ITM Cup domestic rugby union competition.  The duration of treatment is designed to coincide with local performance testing (done at 5 and 11 weeks in one squad, and after 6 and 12 weeks in the other squad).  The supplementation is taken as a single oral tablet (Cal-D-Forte, PSM Healthcare Ltd, Auckland NZ) once a fortnight.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants were enrolled after hearing about the research study at a presentation, or via their Strength and Conditioning Coach.  Randomisation was stratified by location (Otago or Southland) and by training regime (by strength training, power training or hypertrophy training for example). A third party (not involved with the research group or with the squads) placed the allocated treatments into white containers with each participants initials on them, which were provided to the squads strength and conditioning coaches.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation was stratified by location (Otago or Southland) and by training regime (by strength training, power training or hypertrophy training for example).  The stratification information for each squad was sent to a statistician off-site, who used computerised sequence generation to allocate treatment 1 or 2 (placebo or vitamin D) to each participant enrolled.  A third party then placed the allocated treatments into white containers with each participants initials on them, which were provided to the squads strength and conditioning coaches.  The strength and conditioning coaches then facilitated access to the participants bottles once a fortnight, to ensure compliance.  All of this was done independently to the researchers, to ensure double-blind status was maintained.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a recent survey of Dunedin and Invercargill residents, 49% had low serum Vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D may be important for the growth, repair and function of skeletal muscle, yet little is known about the effects of vitamin D supplements on muscle and athletic performance.  Our project is designed to determine whether rugby union players in Otago and Southland are deficient in vitamin D, and whether supplementing them with vitamin D enables them to gain more muscle mass, and become stronger and faster as they progress through their pre-season training.</summary>
