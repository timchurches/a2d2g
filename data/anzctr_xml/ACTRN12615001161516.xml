  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants watched a video simulation in which a neurologist informed an individual (actor) that their family member had experienced a stroke, and described tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) therapy as an option for treatment. The simulation lasted around 5 minutes, the approximate amount of time clinicians have available to convey stroke treatment information. The neurologist was provided with a hypothetical scenario which involved a stroke patient eligible for tPA. During the simulated consultation, the neurologist described the treatment options available to the patient using the essential communication strategies developed by an expert advisory group, which related to: 1) the environment in which the discussion takes place; 2) introduction and purpose of the discussion; 3) information provision; 4) risk communication; 5) addressing emotions and assessing understanding; 6) summarising the discussion. There was no wash-out period between the viewing expert consensus and usual care communication.</interventions>
    <comparator>Participants watched a video simulation in which a neurologist informed an individual (actor) that their family member had experienced a stroke and described tPA therapy as a treatment option. The video lasted approximately 3 minutes. The neurologist, actor, and scenario provided were the same as the expert communication scenario. The neurologist was instructed to use their usual routine of providing information about stroke and tPA treatment, and was not given any specific directions or advice regarding communication strategies. While usual care may vary, this simulation involved the neurologist providing a recommendation for tPA treatment, and information about the risks of treatment. Visual information was not given, and little information about the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes associated with no treatment was provided. To avoid contamination, the usual care video was recorded prior to the neurologist being instructed on the communication strategies to employ for the expert communication video.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Mean knowledge of stroke treatment score as assessed via the following 5 multiple choice items. Participants were asked to select the true statement.
1) Stroke is caused by:
 - A blockage in the lung
 - A blockage in blood flow to the heart
 - A blockage in blood flow in the brain

2) tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) treatment works by:
 - Thinning the blood to dissolve the clot
 - Reducing inflammation around the clot
 - Causing tissue damaged by the stroke to re-grow

3) tPA treatment:
- Only has risks
- Has both risks and benefits
- Only has benefits

4) tPA treatment:
 - Cannot not save lives
 - Can reduce the amount of brain damage caused by stroke
 - Cannot cause bleeding

5) Out of 50 people treated with the clot busting medicine, approximately how many would experience bleeding in the brain as a side effect of the treatment? 
 - 1
 - 15
 - 20</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Hypothetical treatment choice assessed via Imagine that you were in the position of the patient discussed in the video, would you choose to have the clot busting treatment? Response options ranged Yes, definitely, Yes, probably to No, probably not, No, definitely not (1 - 4).</outcome>

      <outcome>Hypothetical treatment choice for a family member assessed via Imagine that you were in the position of the person in the video and had to make a decision about treatment for a family member. Would you choose for your family member to have the clot busting treatment? Response options ranged Yes, definitely, Yes, probably to No, probably not, No, definitely not (1 - 4).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following viewing of video 1 and again after video 2.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Acceptability of the communication strategy and information provided in the video as assessed via 16 items using a 4-point likert scale (1 = strongly agree; 4 = strongly disagree). Given the ratings were from the perspective of the family member, not the hypothetical stroke patient, items were derived from the Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS). The DSC measures personal perceptions of choice uncertainty, factors contributing to uncertainty, and effective decision making.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Preferred communication method was identified by asking participants "If you had to make a decision about whether you wanted clot busting treatment to be given to a family member, which style of information giving would you prefer?". An additional 6 items regarding the reasons for their preference were assessed on a 4-point likert scale (1= strongly agree; 4 = strongly disagree).</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>A sample of 150 patients has allowed detection of a true difference in the mean stroke knowledge scores between groups of +/- 0.26 with 80% power at the 5% significant level.  

Descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, frequencies and percentages were calculated to describe both the demographic characteristics of consenters, and survey responses. Gender of consenting and non-consenting patients was compared using chi-squared tests. The analysis sample is defined here as all the participants that were randomised to a particular condition order, viewed the first video and responded to at least one survey item. Knowledge scores were calculated by summing the number of correct responses to give a score out of five for each participant. Mean knowledge scores after viewing the first video were compared between groups using the independent sample t-test, and individual knowledge items were compared using binomial tests. Responses to the treatment decision items were collapsed into a dichotomous variable (yes, definitely/yes, probably vs. no, definitely not/no probably not). Treatment decisions for the patient and the family member after viewing each communication video were compared using McNemars test (assuming no period effect), separate tests were also performed based on order of randomisation. Acceptability of the communication methods after viewing each video were compared using McNemars test. Responses to the acceptability items were collapsed into a dichotomous variable (strongly agree/agree vs. strongly disagree/disagree). Differences in the proportions of communication method preferences after viewing both videos and reasons for communication preference were assessed using binomial tests. To check for order effects, differences in the proportions of communication method preference according to order of video presentation was assessed using binomial tests.

Missing knowledge and preferred communication responses were imputed by assigning the most frequent value of all available responses within each randomised condition. Missing reasons for preferred communication ratings were imputed by assigning the most frequent value of all available responses within their identified communication preference. Missing treatment decision and acceptability ratings were imputed by assigning the most frequent value of all available responses within each randomised condition and assuming the response had not changed. A threshold of 5% was set for the significance level of all hypothesis tests.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Despite thrombolytic therapy using intravenous tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA) being a recommended treatment for appropriately selected ischaemic stroke patients, use of this treatment remains low. tPA is only provided to 7% of ischemic stroke patients within Australia. A number of factors including, risk of haemorrhage, limited time-frame of 4.5 hours from stroke onset in which the treatment can be given, and difficulties obtaining informed consent, may be factors limiting the administration of this therapy. 

Patients with acute stroke are often mentally and physically unable to discuss treatment options, and the challenge of obtaining informed consent is only exacerbated in situations that require immediate action. In such situations alternative forms of consent must be sought and the treatment decision may become the responsibility of the patients next of kin. Little attention has been paid to the decision making process for patients and their families in such situations.

Given the need for an immediate treatment decision to be made, clinicians need to convey the  potential benefits and risks of tPA treatment in order for family members to provide informed consent. Employment of best practice communication guidelines may aid the decision making process for family members and help clinicians to clearly convey the recommended treatment for ischaemic 
stroke patients.

Aims: The purpose of the study was to compare, using a randomised controlled crossover trial among hospital out-patients, the effect of an expert consensus communication strategy compared to a usual care communication strategy (shown via video) on 1) participant knowledge of stroke treatment; 2) treatment decisions for tPA treatment for a) patients and b) a family member; 3) the acceptability of the communication strategies; and 4) the preferred communication strategy.</summary>
