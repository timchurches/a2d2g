  <interventions>
    <interventions>As part of usual care, patients will be advised to consume 2 commercially available meal replacements, either a shake or a bar, for two meals a day and a commercially available energy controlled normal meal for one meal a day.  Patients will also be advised about fruit and vegetable intake and recommended to have two and five serves respectively.  Duration of the diet will be prescribed on an individual basis for between 2-6 weeks prior to surgery.
The overall duration of the study will be six months. Patients will be recruited as they are assessed as being eligible for surgery.  Each patient will be observed for up to six weeks.</interventions>
    <comparator>An additional group of patients that had bariatric surgery between January 1st 2010 and April 18th 2011 will also be invited to participate in the study.  They will be identified by their treating physician and if appropriate, will be contacted by phone to ask if they would like to participate.  If written approval is received they will be contacted again by phone and interviewed about their weight loss and their compliance with the diet.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the pre-operative very low energy diet on liver function tests and weight loss, and to correlate these outcomes with compliance to the program.  Our hypotheses are:
1. Pre-operative weight loss will be associated with an improvement in liver function tests
2. Increased compliance to the program will be associated with greater weight loss</summary>
