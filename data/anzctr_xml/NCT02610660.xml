    <inclusivecriteria>-  Patient must be an incident patient, i.e.newly diagnosed with PH

          -  Age at time of diagnosis is at least 3 months and less than 18 years

          -  Patients must present with PH belonging to one of the following categories

               -  Group 1 according to updated Nice clinical classification

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The TOPP-2 registry is an international, non-interventional, prospective registry including
      children and adolescents newly diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension (PH) to gain further
      insights in the disease course and long-term outcome of PH in childhood.

      Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard medical care, as determined
      by treating physicians in their daily clinical practice. The TOPP-2 registry is specifically
      designed to capture the variables that have been proposed as treatment goals in PePH and the
      reasons for changes in treatment strategy.

      The TOPP-2 registry uses the new clinical classification of PH as outlined at the 5th World
      Symposium for Pulmonary Hypertension (WSPH) in Nice 2013 and includes new characterizations
      for children with PH.

      The registry is planned and implemented under the scientific leadership of the Association
      for Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension (PePH), independently from the financial sponsors.</summary>
