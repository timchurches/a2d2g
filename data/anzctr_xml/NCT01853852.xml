             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longest).

          6. Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          8. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GR181413A/AT1001 (migalastat hydrochloride) is a low molecular weight iminosugar, an analog
      of the terminal galactose group that is cleaved from the substrate GL-3. This compound was
      researched and developed as a drug for treatment of Fabry disease. This study, MGM115806,
      will be the first administration of GR181413A/AT1001 to Japanese subjects to investigate the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses in healthy Japanese adult
      subjects. Approximately 12 subjects will receive three treatments of 50, 150 and 450 mg
      GR181413A/AT1001 under fasted conditions plus placebo in a dose ascending crossover design.
      Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety assessments will be performed
      following each dose. The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of GR181413A/AT1001 after
      single oral doses of GR181413A/AT1001 at the dose levels of 50, 150 and 450 mg under fasted
      conditions will be assessed.</summary>
