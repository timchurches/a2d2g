  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will receive faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via enema from donor stool.   Participants will receive enemas weekly for three weeks in total. 

Faecal transplants will contain stool from healthy donors who are rigorously screened for infection or co-morbid conditions prior to donation. The stool donations are processed by the principal investigator who is a physician (FRACP) and clinical microbiologist (FRCPA). The stool is transferred to an anaerobic biosafety chamber within 2 hours of passage to preserve the microbes and blended with sterile normal saline and pharmaceutical grade glycerol within the chamber. The final composition of the faecal transplant contians 25% stool, 65% saline and 10% glycerol. Individual transplants are frozen at -80C . The transplants from a minimum of 3 to a maximum of 10 donors will subsequently be pooled prior to the transplants being administered so that every participant in the trial receives the same FMT.   

Each transplant consists of a 200mL enema. These will be administered by one of the study investigators all of whom are trained physicians. The procedure should take no more than 30 minutes.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size for the study was calculated using a binary outcome superiority trial power calculation. From animal study data, we expect at least an approximately 80% success in the intervention group and a 20% elimination rate in the placebo group. Significance level (alpha) was 0.05 with a power of 90%. This yielded a sample size required per group of 10 with a total sample size of 20.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The emergence of bacteria or germs that have become resistant to most antibiotic treatments is an urgent public health problem. Often called superbugs, these germs have the ability to resist treatment with almost all antibiotics and can infect hospitalized as well as healthy people in the community. Superbugs transform previously easily treated minor infections into life-threatening conditions with very few treatment options.  So far efforts to reduce superbug spread in our hospitals have failed to halt the global spread of these organisms. Nor are there new antibiotics in production to deal with this problem. New innovative approaches are needed to deal with this emerging threat. 

The faecal microbiota transplant, also called FMT, is a procedure where stool is collected from healthy donors and delivered to the gut of the recipient.  This is done with the goal of the healthy bacteria from the donor replacing the harmful bacteria in the recipient. The FMT procedure is already proven safe and effective in treating patients with another type of bacterial gut infection called Clostridium difficile.  FMT has also been shown in animal studies and human cases to eliminate gut carriage of certain superbugs called multi-resistant gram negative bacteria. The elimination of gut carriage would both prevent superbug infections developing in the individual and also prevent the spread of these organisms to other persons.

In order to address this growing problem we have designed a study to test the effectiveness of FMT in people who have suffered from recurrent infections with a type of superbug. The goals of this study are to determine if FMT can result in clearance of superbug bacteria from the stool and to observe the effect of FMT on rates of recurrent infections in study participants. In collaboration with South Australian experts in this field the stool will be analysed to determine how FMT affects the range of germs in the gut and their ability to become resistant to antibiotics. 

If successful this study will represent a major scientific advance in our ability to prevent superbug infection and spread. It will open up new treatment possibilities for patients who suffer from superbug infections and benefit the community at large by giving us a new tool to stop the spread of superbugs to others.
