  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Depressive disorder in adolescents is common and largely untreated.  Cognitive-behavioural therapy has been found to be effective in treating mild to moderate depression.  Being a structured therapy it lends itself very well to a computer medium to be used as a self-help programme.  As young people are frequent users of modern technologies, utilising computers in the design of health interventions seems a reasonable choice.  However, to date no computerised CBT programmes have specifically targeted adolescents.  Computerised intervention has the potential to be an inexpensive, low risk and widely available depression treatment.  This study pilots two self-developed computer resources (comapring CBT-based programme with a control psychoeducation/self-care message) to treat mild-to-moderate depression in adolescents attending secondary schools.  The aim of the study is to assess the resource's feasibility, acceptability and appeal with a view of refining it and carrying out a larger trial in the future.</summary>
