    <interventions>IBCSG 30-04 / NCIC CTG MA.27 is co-ordinated by the National Cancer Institute of Canada, Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG).  The International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) is participating in the NCIC CTG MA.27 trial, and the ANZ Breast Cancer Trials Group (ANZ BCTG) contribution is part of the IBCSG collaboration.  The trial is conducted in Australia and New Zealand by the ANZ Breast Cancer Trials Group.

This study will investigate which of two drugs (exemestane and anastrozole), if either, is better at preventing a recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women with receptor positive, adequately excised, primary breast cancer.

IBCSG 30-04 / NCIC CTG MA.27 is an international, multicentre, randomised phase III clinical trial of 5800 postmenopausal women who have had histologically or cytologically confirmed, receptor-positive primary breast cancer.
 
Women will be randomised in a 2-arm design to receive one of the following:

a. Exemestane 25mg 
b. Anastrozole 1mg

All treatment will be on a daily basis for 5 years until recurrence or second malignancy is documented.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare event free survival between women treated with exemestane or anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. The total duration of the study will be about 5 years.</outcome>
      <timepoint>It will be measured when 847 events have been observed.  It is estmated that 3.2 years of accrual and another 2 years of follow up will be required.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare overall survival and time to distant recurrence of women treated with exemestane with that of those receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim analyses are planned for this study when 282 and 564 events are observed.  It is projected that the analyses would be performed 2.7 and 3.9 years after the first patient is entered.  Assuming a hazard ratio of 0.80 between exemestane and anastrozole is being detected, with a two-sided 5% level and 90% power, a total of 5800 patients accrued over 3.2 years will be needed and another 2 years of follow-up before 847 events are observed at the final analysis.  The total duration of the study would be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare incidence of new primary contralateral breast cancer in the different treatment groups.</outcome>

The total duration of the study would be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare incidence of all clinical fractures and specifically hip and vertebral fractures in the different treatment groups.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Two interim analyses are planned for this study when 282 and 564 events are observed.  It is projected that the analyses would be performed 2.7 and 3.9 years after the first patient is entered.

The total duration of the study would be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare cardiovascular morbidity and mortality between exemestane and anastrozole.</outcome>

The total duration of the study would be about 5 years.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To examine whether breast density changes with aromatase inhibitor therapy and also whether these therapy-induced changes are associated with plasma hormones and growth factors.</outcome>

      <outcome>Drug levels of exemestane or anastrozole, genetic variation and breast cancer recurrence or contralateral events.</outcome>
