Treatment: drugs: Trastuzumab
4 mg/kg i.v. loading dose on Day 1, followed by 2 mg/kg i.v. weekly; or 8 mg/kg i.v. loading dose, followed by 6 mg/kg i.v. every 3 weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or death.

Treatment: drugs: Taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel)
Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks, or paclitaxel administered in a dose of 75 mg/m2 i.v. weekly or 175 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks for at least 18 weeks, or more at the discretion of the investigator. Choice of taxane at the discretion of the investigator. Taxane may be administered at the same time, or 24 hours after, administration of trastuzumab.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0 Guidelines - CR was defined for target lesions (TLs) as the disappearance of all lesions, and for nontarget lesions (NTLs) as the disappearance of all nontarget nonmeasurable lesions. PR was defined for TLs as at least a 30 percent (%) decrease from baseline (BL) in the sum of longest diameter (SLD) of TLs. 95% confidence interval for one-sample binomial using Pearson-Clopper method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline (BL); Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease or Death - Duration of response was defined as the time from first confirmed CR or PR until death or progressive disease (PD). For TLs, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the SLD of the TL, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since the beginning of treatment or the appearance of one or more new lesions. For NTLs, PD was defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non target non-measurable lesions. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of Response - The time, in months, from when the response (CR or PR) was first noted until the date of documented PD, death, or withdrawal, whichever occurred first. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Percentage of Participants With Progressive Disease - PFS was defined as the time from day of first study drug infusion until death or PD. Participants were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-Free Survival - The time, in months, from BL to PFS event.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Treatment Failure - Treatment failure was defined as the time from first study drug infusion to failure. Failure was defined as any of the following: PD, death, withdrawal due to adverse event (AE) or lab abnormality, or refusal of treatment. Participants were censored at the last date recorded in the case report form (CRF) or the date of withdrawal.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Treatment Failure - The time, in months, from BL to treatment failure.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Benefit According to RECIST Guidelines - Clinical benefit was defined as stable disease (SD) for 6 months or longer, or a confirmed overall response of CR or PR. For TLs, SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest SLD since the beginning of treatment. For NTLs, SD was synonymous with incomplete response and defined as the persistence of one or more NTLs and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>BL, Day 1 of Weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 37, and 52, at the last administration of study treatment, every 24 weeks thereafter until disease progression for up to 6 months after the last participant was recruited</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This 2 arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous Herceptin with or without
      a taxane for the first line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in women who have relapsed
      at least 12 months after a minimum of 10 months of (neo)adjuvant treatment with Herceptin for
      HER2-positive early breast cancer.Patients will receive either Herceptin monotherapy (loading
      dose of 4mg/kg iv, followed by weekly doses of 2mg/kg iv, or 8mg/kg loading dose followed by
      3-weekly doses of 6mg/kg)or Herceptin + a taxane (docetaxel 100mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks, or
      paclitaxel 175mg/m2 iv every 3 weeks or 75mg/m2 every week). The anticipated time on study
      treatment is until disease progression, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.</summary>
