  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aerobic training consisted of a walking program with a frequency of three sessions per week for a period of 12 weeks. The sessions had a total duration of 30 minutes in the first six weeks, with an additional five minutes each week from week seven to 55 minutes a session that lasted until the end of training. During the training program, the target heart rate of each volunteer was monitored using a heart rate monitor (Polar, F4) and is the measure of individual control of the training that was provided for in accordance with age, with a gradual progression 65% to 75% of maximum heart rate predicted for age.</interventions>
    <comparator>The volunteers remained for a period of six weeks in the control situation, in which they were instructed to maintain their daily living habits and avoid realization of prolonged or strenuous physical activities.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Changes in anthropometrics variables (body mass, body mass index, waist circumference and waist-hip ratio).
Measurements were measured using a scale with a stadiometer (Welmy). The volunteers were instructed to use the same clothing, remove their shoes before each measurement, look at the horizon and let the arms along the body. For hip circumference, the tape was passed, flush, around the waist in the region located between the last rib and the iliac crest, a region that was stripped during the measurement. For hip circumference, the tape was placed flush around the hip area of greatest diameter. The readings were taken immediately after a full expiration.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome:  Changes in total cholesterol levels.
We obtained blood samples pre-prandial (after fasting for 12 hours) in the morning, so the patients would arrive for collection. Puncture was performed on the index finger, after cleansing with alcohol, using a steel disposable lancet to collect approximately 20 microlitos of blood was placed directly on the reagent strips and inserted into the device (Accutrend Plus - GCTL)for reading each measure.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Changes in triglyceride levels.
We obtained blood samples pre-prandial (after fasting for 12 hours) in the morning, so the patients would arrive for collection. Puncture was performed on the index finger, after cleansing with alcohol, using a steel disposable lancet to collect approximately 20 microlitos of blood was placed directly on the reagent strips and inserted into the device (Accutrend Plus - GCTL)for reading each measure.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Changes in  glucose levels.
We obtained blood samples pre-prandial (after fasting for 12 hours) in the morning, so the patients would arrive for collection. Puncture was performed on the index finger, after cleansing with alcohol, using a steel disposable lancet to collect approximately 20 microlitos of blood was placed directly on the reagent strips and inserted into the device (Accutrend Plus - GCTL)for reading each measure.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: Improves physical conditioning evidenced stimated Maximum Oxygen Consumption (stimated VO2Max) and the Total Exercise Time (ETT).  
To determine the variables of physical performance used a progressive test on a treadmill (Imbramed) until fatigue which represented the time when the volunteer reported an exhaustive effort on the scale of perceived exertion (PSE). To this end, we used the Stanford Protocol, which consisted of ten stages, lasting 3 minutes each, constant speed of 4.8 km/h and slope of 0% in the first stage. After each stage, there was an increase of 2.5% gradient, and the slope at the tenth stage represented 22.5%. The VO2max was estimated from the rate of metabolic equivalent (MET) complete the last stage of the treadmill exercise performed by the volunteer, with 1 MET represents 3.5 mlO2/kg/min.</outcome>
