  <interventions>
    <interventions>Liver resection was carried out under general anesthesia through a right subcostal incision. The surgery was performed to resect the tumor with a resection margin of at least 1 cm to tumor margin. Pringles maneuver was routinely used with a clamp/unclamp time of 15 minutes/5 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization  plus percutaneous radiofrequency ablative therapy: In this non-operation group,we give the patient transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment(injecting lipiodol 5-10 ml, amycin 40 mg, fluorouracil 1000 mg through femoral artery) first, then one week later we give radiofrequence ablation treatment guided by ultrasound.he whole procedure of percutaneous radiofrequency ablative therapy was as follows: Firstly the patient received general anesthesia and then check the location of tumor with ultrasound. The electrode was inserted into the tumor under the ultrasound guidance. Then the system was switched to the impedance mode. The output power was increased from 80W to 200W, lasted 3-10 minutes depending on the size and location of tumors. The patient received enhanced spiral CT or MRI in the second day and one month after RFA to evaluate the effect of RFA. If there was any tumor remaining active, RFA should be repeated until the tumor was complete necrosis.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of our study is to compare the preferences of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus percutaneous radiofrequency ablative therapy (RFA) and liver resection in the treatment of early small HCC. We suppose that TACE plus RFA can have equal or better effect.</summary>
