  <interventions>
    <interventions>Therapeutic intervention - at home chemotherapy treatment administered intravenously by a trained nurse. The treatment is as per usual care. For those randomised to the intervention group, cycles 1 and 2 are delivered in the hospital day unit and cycles 3 and 4 are delivered at home. The intervention duration will be 2 x  2 hour (maximum) cycles (cycles 3 and 4).

It is envisaged that most cycles will be 21 days in length. Treatment in most instances will occur on day 1  only, with 20 days until the next cycle. Hence, day 1 of the next cycle would be day 22 and so on.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is assessing the costs and patient related outcomes associated with chemotherapy delivered at home versus chemotherapy delivered in the hospital setting for breast cancer patients. 

Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are a female aged 18 years or above who is scheduled to receive at least four cycles of chemotherapy for breast cancer and are suitable for day-case administration. 

Study details
All participants in this study will receive their first two cycles of chemotherapy in a hospital day unit as per standard care. Provided that the participants do not experience any severe adverse events, they will then be randomly (by chance) allocated to receive their next two chemotherapy cycles either in the hospital day unit or in their home setting. In the home setting, chemotherapy will be administered intravenously by a trained nurse. Your chemotherapy treatment regime will not change. 

All participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires before, during and after chemotherapy treatment in order to evaluate their patient experience, quality of life, anxiety and depression, nausea and vomiting, and treatment safety. Treatment-related costs will also be analysed. It is thought that treatment at home may provide not only a better patient experience, but may deliver a more sustainable health service model of care for the WA Health Department.</summary>
