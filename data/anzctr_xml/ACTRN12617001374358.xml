  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be exposed to 24 hours of monitoring with a wearable ECG device.

The Alerte Digital Health ECG device is a small wrist watched sized device with two electrodes attached to their body. The device comprises of circuitry allowing live streaming to a smartphone via Bluetooth, and a rechargeable battery with approximate life of 24 hours. It has been developed to provide automated continuous, real time ECG interpretation with artificial intelligence and it has been configured for this study to focus on automated detection of atrial fibrillation.

The device has previously been validated for safety and accuracy in a laboratory environment, and subsequently in a clinical environment compared against a standard ward based hospital monitoring system.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Our goal is to produce automated continuous, real time ECG interpretation with artificial intelligence (AI), for detection of atrial fibrillation, utilising our wristwatch-sized ECG machine.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Patients will be observed with 24 hours of continuous monitoring.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To document the frequency and duration of atrial fibrillation, identified by the artificial intelligence, by applying the artificial intelligence to the ECG data acquired by the wristwatch sized ECG acquisition device. The ECG strips showing both sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation will be independently adjudicated by a cardiologist blinded to the diagnosis made by the artificial intelligence. Accuracy of the AI system will be determined by comparing the AF and sinus rhythm diagnosis from the AI system against the cardiologist gold standard.
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following 24 hours of monitoring.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To document the frequency and duration of other arrhythmias, specifically supraventricular arrhythmias but not atrial fibrillation (including atrial flutter), ventricular arrhythmias (including ventricular ectopics), and artifact identified by the artificial intelligence. This will be measured by applying the artificial intelligence to the ECG data acquired by the wristwatch sized ECG acquisition device. The ECG strips showing supraventricular arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias and artifact will be independently adjudicated by a cardiologist blinded to the diagnosis made by the artificial intelligence. Accuracy of the AI system will be determined by comparing the atrial and ventricular arrhythmias and artifact diagnosis from the AI system against the cardiologist gold standard.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following 24 hours of monitoring.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To document any discrepancy between the cardiologist scored ECG and the AI analysis. This data will be used to improve the training of the AI system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Following 24 hours of monitoring.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The exact AF burden (paroxysmal and persistent) in patients wearing the device, helping identify those in need of further investigation and/or anticoagulant therapy</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 24 hours of monitoring</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The heart rate in those with known persistent AF, to examine methods of using AI to devise a better surveillance strategy to detect (or prevent) early heart failure</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 24 hours of monitoring</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Levels of anxiety / stress reported by patients through a questionnaire that will be used to determine the heart rate variability in response to stress.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Before the 24 hours of monitoring, participants will be asked to complete a standardised medical questionnaire (DASS-21) to determine levels of stress or anxiety in their life. They will also be asked to complete a diary to record sleep quality and activities whilst wearing the device.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our goal is to produce automated continuous, real time ECG interpretation with artificial intelligence (AI), utilising our wristwatch-sized ECG machine. Our initial AI system will be focused on automated detection of atrial fibrillation. We have already developed a prototype ECG detection device and trained our initial AI system, which has undergone validation testing in a clinical environment. This study is intended to further develop our ECG system to be suitable for more widespread use.</summary>
