  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Phase 3, multicenter, international randomized controlled trial of a Very Early
      Mobilization(VEM) care rehabilitation protocol compared to standard post stroke care (SC).
      Participants receive either SC and VEM or SC alone in the acute phase of stroke up to a
      period of 14 days.

      Participants are followed up by a blinded assessor at 3 and 12 months post stroke to
      determine trial outcomes.</summary>
