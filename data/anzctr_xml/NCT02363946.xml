  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of
      ARC-AAT and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ARC-AAT and the effect of ARC-AAT on
      circulating levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin. The study will consist of two parts, Part A
      (conducted in healthy volunteers) and Part B (conducted in AATD patients) at up to 9
      escalating dose levels with 6 participants per dose level.</summary>
