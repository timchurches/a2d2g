  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Written informed consent.

          2. Patients of either gender, aged = 18 years.

          3. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or less than 2 years
             postmenopausal) must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree
             to continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 6 months after
             the last dose. Acceptable methods of contraception include abstinence, or double
             contraception: steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in
             conjunction with a barrier method (intrauterine device, condom etc.).

          4. Male patients must use a medically accepted method of contraception and must agree to
             continue use of this method for the duration of the study and for 6 months after the
             last activity administration.

          5. Karnofsky performance score = 60.

          6. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          7. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of -

               -  unresectable GEP NET (Grade I and Grade II according to WHO classification (2010,
                  Annex 01), functioning and non-functioning).

               -  unresectable lung NET Grade I and Grade II (low and intermediate grade) (Klimstra
                  et al 2010)

               -  malignant, unresectable pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma

          8. Documentation of progressive disease based on RECIST v1.1 under prior anti-tumor
             therapy within 6 months of entry in the study. Patients should not have received

             evaluation should be available for TGR evaluation.

          9. In countries where sunitinib or everolimus are marketed, patients with GEP NET and
             lung NET will be progressive under this prior anti-tumor treatment for the respective
             indication. Patients not suitable for everolimus/sunitinib therapy according to a
             tumor board decision (or comparable local practice) may also be enrolled into the
             study. Patients having everolimus/sunitinib therapy should have a wash-out phase of =
             4 weeks before the first treatment.

         11. Confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on technically evaluable tumor lesions

             entry.

          6. Prior or planned administration of a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical within 8
             half-lives of the radionuclide including any time during the current study.

          8. Chemotherapy = 3 months before enrolment.

          9. Pregnant or breast-feeding women: A pregnancy test will be performed at the start of
             the study for all female patients of childbearing potential (i.e. not surgically
             sterile or up to 2 years postmenopausal).

         10. Any uncontrolled significant medical, psychiatric or surgical condition (active
             infection, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, poorly controlled
             hypertension, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus [HbA1c =9%], uncontrolled congestive
             heart disease, etc.) or laboratory findings that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might jeopardize the patient's safety or that would limit compliance with the
             objectives and assessments of the study. Note: the patient should be able to tolerate
             high volume load.

         11. Current history of any malignancy other than NET within 5 years of enrolment except
             for fully -resected non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ. Current
             history of malignancy; patients with a secondary tumor in remission of &gt; 5 years can
             be included

         12. Any mental condition rendering the patient unable to understand the nature, scope and
             possible consequences of the study, and/or evidence of an uncooperative attitude.</exclusivecriteria>
