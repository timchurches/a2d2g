  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine whether a tailored educational package can reduce psychological distress in women with breast cancer who are referred for radiotherapy. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a woman aged 18 years or more who has been diagnosed with breast cancer for which you are about to commence a course of radiation therapy that will be more than 4 weeks. Trial details Participants in this trial will be allocated to one of two groups. One group will receive the standard information provided in radiation oncology. The other group will undergo an innovative radiotherapy program, consisting of two one-on-one 20 minute educational sessions with their radiotherapist. During the consultations the radiation therapist will discuss the procedure that is about to occur, what will be expected of the patient, any immediate discomfort or pain they should anticipate, and any short or long term side effects that may result from the procedure. Participants will be assessed on four occasions before and after treatment to determine their psychological distress levels, specific concerns about radiotherapy, knowledge of radiotherapy, and preparedness for treatment.</summary>
