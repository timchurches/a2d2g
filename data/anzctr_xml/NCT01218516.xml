  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Farletuzumab
Other interventions - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - Paclitaxel
Treatment: drugs - Pemetrexed
Treatment: drugs - Cisplatin

Active Comparator: Farletuzumab plus Chemotherapy - During Combination Therapy, farletuzumab will be given with a protocol-approved platinum doublet (either carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/pemetrexed, or cisplatin/pemetrexed) for at least 4, but not more than 6, cycles. Participants who experience clinical benefit from the Combination Therapy will enter the Monotherapy Phase and receive farletuzumab as monotherapy until disease progression.

Placebo Comparator: Placebo plus Chemotherapy - During Combination Therapy, placebo will be given with a protocol-approved platinum doublet (either carboplatin/paclitaxel, carboplatin/pemetrexed, or cisplatin/pemetrexed) for at least 4, but not more than 6, cycles. Participants who experience clinical benefit from the Combination Therapy will enter the Monotherapy Phase and receive placebo as monotherapy until disease progression.


Other interventions: Farletuzumab
Combination Therapy: Farletuzumab 7.5 mg/kg will be administered intravenously on Cycle 1, Week 1 and Cycle 1, Week 2 (loading dose). Beginning on Cycle 2, Week 1, farletuzumab (7.5 mg/kg) will be administered intravenously on Week 1 of all additional cycles.
Monotherapy: Farletuzumab 7.5 mg/kg will be administered intravenously on Week 1 of every 3-week cycle until disease progression.

Other interventions: Placebo
Combination Therapy: Placebo will be administered intravenously on Cycle 1, Week 1 and Cycle 1, Week 2 (loading dose). Beginning on Cycle 2, Week 1, placebo will be administered IV on Week 1 of all additional cycles.
Monotherapy: Placebo will be administered intravenously on Week 1 of every 3-week cycle until disease progression.

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Carboplatin will be administered intravenously to achieve area under the serum concentration-time curve of 5 to 6 mg/mL^min [AUC5-6]

Treatment: drugs: Paclitaxel
Paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously

Treatment: drugs: Pemetrexed
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously

Treatment: drugs: Cisplatin
Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 will be administered intravenously

    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of farletuzumab versus placebo
      in combination with either a platinum agent (carboplatin) with paclitaxel or a platinum agent
      (carboplatin or cisplatin) with pemetrexed followed by farletuzumab or placebo on
      investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) as determined by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 or definitive clinical disease progression (eg, new
      occurrence of positive fluid cytology) in chemotherapynaive participants with folate
      receptoralpha (FRA)-expressing Stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung.</summary>
