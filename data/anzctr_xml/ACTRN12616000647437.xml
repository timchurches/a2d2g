20 - 30 minutes of a one-to-one session with the researcher occur once a week for four weeks.  A digital recording containing the trainingwill be developed as an easy device for participants to keep and practice should they wish.
Sessions content: 
Session 1 contains guided meditation ( breathing and relaxation techniques, the body scan) awareness, focus on the present moment and mindful coping skills.
Session 2 contains guided meditation ( breathing and relaxation techniques) and reflections about attitudes to acceptance through mindfulness practice.
Session 3 contains  guided meditation ( breathing and relaxation techniques) and reflections about meaning in life through mindfulness practice.
Session 4 contains a closure involving mindfulness of breath and body sensations, mindfulness of thoughts and feelings, the practice review and reflections about meaning in life.
All sessions are 20 - 30 minutes in length.
The facilitator is a Psychology graduate trained in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction.
To monitor adherence a register of attendance at sessions will be conducted.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample: 30 adults with advanced cancer who meet the inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in this study  by the Oncology Research Nurse coordinator from the Oncology department at the Christchurch Hospital. 
Sample size calculation: The sample size has been set by the qualitative aspect of the study. The quantitative aspect is viewed as a pilot study. The small sample size is acknowledged to unlikely to be able to find statistically significant differences on the primary outcome measure but is included to give establish effect sizes on this measure and therefore samples sizes needed for future research. A sample size of 30 participants could detect only a large effect size (.8 or above), with 80% power and a p-value of &lt;0.05.  Pilot studies by their nature, will not produce significant (i.e P&lt;0.05) results (Arain et al., 2010).
As the aim of this study is to demonstrate intervention efficacy in a single group, a sample in the range of 2025 will probably be adequate when population effect sizes are likely to be moderate or larger (Hertzog, 2008). A sample of 30 participants was established as adequate for this study, considering dropout rates and the possibility to go for a larger study in the future. For clinical trials of 80250 participants, total pilot sample sizes of 2040 would be adequate (Hertzog, 2008). This intervention study is grounded in the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training, the traditional MBSR training is applied in group sessions with up to 30 participants and one or two instructors (Carlson, 2013)
Qualitative data will be collected using semi-structured pre and post-interview questionnaires and the quantitative data will be collected using three measurement instruments: Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ II), Mindful Coping Scale (MCS) adapted version and the Meaning of Life Questionnaire (MLQ). Paired t-tests will be used to assess the group improvement on all outcomes for each group after completing the four (4) weeks of intervention. Paired t-tests were chosen to compare the means of data from the two related samples with observations before and after the intervention on the same participants (McDonald, 2014). A SPSS version will be used.
The interviews will be audio recorded. Recordings will be transcribed word for word; analysis will begin immediately. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Training individuals gravely ill in mindfulness practice can assist them in to become less reactive in the face of difficulties such as pain, the loss of capacities, managing relationships and facing death. This study aims to expand previous findings by using one-group pre-test post-test design to research the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention grounded on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to help adults with advanced cancer to cope with their life-threatening illness. A further aim of this intervention study is to assess the value of assisting people with advanced cancer to think about and discuss their own meaning in life and acceptance of their current situation. This study design is one-group pre-test post-test with mixed methods approach. Data collection and analysis will be carried out on the basis of this methodology. A sample of 30 adults with advanced cancer who meet the inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate in this study  by the Oncology Research Nurse coordinator from the Oncology department at the Christchurch Hospital. One 30 minutes session for 4 weeks will be conducted face-to-face with the researcher. As part of the intervention a digital audio recording containing the therapeutic intervention sessions, will be developed as an easy device for adults coping with advanced cancer. Participants will be asked to complete a small number of questionnaires and one interview once before and once after the 4 weeks of the therapeutic program, to find out changes in levels of mindful coping skills, attitudes to acceptance and reflections about meaning in life. Data analysis will commence during the data collection and after carrying out the study. Accordingly to the converged mixed methods design, qualitative and quantitative data will be analyzed separately, and then merged to investigate variances in mindful coping skills of the participants as well as acceptance attitude and meaning in life.
