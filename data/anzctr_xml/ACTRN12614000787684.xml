  <interventions>
    <interventions>The online sleep intervention is an adapted programme based on the Return2Sleep programme developed by Associate Professor Norah Vincent in Canada for people with insomnia. The programme contains interactive tasks and strategies to improve sleep. The programme has been adapted to facilitate its use for people with brain injury and the difficulties they experience. The programme contains 6 modules. Each module is completed once per week for 20 minutes for 6 weeks at the participant's home at a time convenient to them.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be screened via the telephone to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. If eligible, the first assessment will be conducted in-person at the participantâ€™s home (or preferred location) to obtain written consent and medical and sleep history. Participants identified as needing investigation for a possible sleep disorder will be referred to their general practitioner. Participants will be recruited through TBI service providers, self referral and community health care services. Participants will be allocated to groups by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Participants will be randomised to receive one of two online treatment programmes using stratified block randomisation  to uphold balance of recruitment site and injury severity [mild, moderate, severe] between the groups. Minim randomisation software will be used to conduct the randomisation. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Analysis of covariance will be used to obtain mean differences between the treatment arms, adjusting for baseline measurement, at each time-point. Covariates displaying chance imbalance will be assessed for confounding and potentially contribute to results adjustment. Missing covariate data in fewer than 20% of cases in either arm will be multiply imputed; in other cases the covariate will be eliminated from consideration. No outcome data will be imputed. Normality of the residuals will be evaluated and appropriate modifications of the analyses applied if necessary. The need to allow for clustering within centre will be assessed using appropriately applied F-tests. Primary analyses will be carried on an intention-to-treat analysis set, although per protocol analyses will also be conducted.  The sample size was determined based on enabling sufficient diversity in participant characteristics including ethnicity and TBI severity. As this is a feasibility study no formal power calculations have been conducted.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Many people who have had a traumatic brain injury experience on-going sleep difficulties that can have a significant impact on their ability to function in everyday life. Online treatments to improve sleep have been found to be effective for people with insomnia, however people with brain injury have been excluded from previous clinical trials. This feasibility study will examine if two online treatments can help to improve sleep for people following a brain injury. 36 people who have experienced a brain injury in the last 2 months to 3 years will be randomised to receive one of two online programmes that last for 6 weeks. Participants sleep quality and other outcomes influenced by sleep (such as cognitive functioning, mood) will be assessed before and after the treatment so that we can compare the results between the two groups. </summary>
