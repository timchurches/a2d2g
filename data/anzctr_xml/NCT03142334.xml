  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      in the adjuvant treatment of adult participants who have undergone nephrectomy and have
      intermediate-high risk, high risk, or M1 no evidence of disease (M1 NED) renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) with clear cell component.

      The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab is superior to placebo with respect to
      Disease-free Survival (DFS) as assessed by the Investigator in male and female participants
      with intermediate-high risk, high risk and M1 NED RCC.</summary>
