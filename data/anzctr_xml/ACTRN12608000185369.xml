  <interventions>
    <interventions>A written survey was conducted pre-operatively, at six and 12 weeks post-open heart surgery. Questions related to postoperative musculoskeletal pain of the spine, thoracic cage and shoulder, sternal clicking, a disability scale and compliance with the home exercise and walking program.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Visual Analogue Scale for pain for each of the following nine areas of the body: neck, left shoulder, right shoulder, upper back, front of chest, ribcage, lower back, left elbow/hand and right elbow/hand. These values were then added for each patient to give a total pain score (on a scale of 0?90). A higher score indicated greater pain.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to determine the extent of muscular and joint pain and shoulder disability in patients who have undergone open-heart surgery. Resarch questions are: what is the prevalence, type and area of musculsoskeletal pain, and shoulder disability pre-operatively, at six and at 12 weeks post-operatively? What is the prevalence of sternal clicking at 6 and 12 weeks post-operation. What is the level of patient compliance with home exercise advice?  What are the variables associated with the development of post-operative musculoskeletal complications? Hypothesis is that 30% patients develop new musculoskeletal pain post-open heart surgery which is apparent at 6 weeks post operation and that this pain will return to pre-operative levels by 12 weeks post-operation.</summary>
