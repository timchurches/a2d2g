  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subject is at least 18 years of age.

          -  If female, subject is not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             or hysterectomy), or is of childbearing potential and practicing one of the following
             methods of birth control: *condoms, sponge, foams, jellies, diaphragm or intrauterine
             device (IUD) *contraceptives (oral or parenteral) for three months prior to study drug
             administration) *a vasectomized partner *total abstinence from sexual intercourse

          -  If female, the results of a urine pregnancy test performed at screening (urine
             specimen obtained no earlier than 28 days prior to study drug administration) and a
             urine pregnancy test performed on Study Day -1 are both negative and the subject
             agrees to use a barrier method of contraception throughout the study.

          -  Subject is not breast-feeding.

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness.

          -  Subject has no significant history of cardiac, renal, neurologic, psychiatric,
             oncologic, endocrinologic, metabolic or hepatic disease that would adversely affect
             his/her participating in this study.

          -  Subject does not require and agrees not to take any of the following medications for
             the duration of the study: midazolam, triazolam, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride,
             pimozide, propafenone, flecainide, certain ergot derivatives (ergotamine,
             dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, and methylergonovine), rifampin, lovastatin,
             simvastatin, and St. Johns wort.

          -  Subject agrees not to take any medication during the study, including over-the-counter
             medicine, herbal medications, alcohol or recreational drugs without the knowledge and
             permission of the principal investigator.

          -  Subject has a Karnofsky Score greater than or equal to 70

          -  Subject has not been treated for an active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection
             within 30 days of screening. Subjects who are on stable maintenance therapy for an
             opportunistic infection may be enrolled after consultation with Abbott.

          -  Subject is naive to antiretroviral treatment (&lt; 7 days ARV treatment).

          -  Subject has a plasma HIV RNA level of greater than 1,000 copies/mL at screening.

          -  Subject agrees to take all doses of the lopinavir/ritonavir from the bottles provided
             by the sponsor (rather than take doses from a personal dosette box).

          -  Subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent form, approved by an
             Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), after the nature
             of the study has been explained and the subject has had the opportunity to ask
             questions. The informed consent must be signed before any study-specific procedures
             are performed.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subject has a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to
             lopinavir/ritonavir, tenofovir or emtricitabine or to drugs similar to study drug.

          -  Subject has a positive result on the screening tests for drugs of abuse.

             adherence with the protocol.

          -  Screening laboratory analyses show any of the following abnormal laboratory results:
             *Hemoglobin = 8.0 g/dL *Absolute neutrophil count = 750 cells/µL *Platelet count =
             50,000 per mL *ALT or AST = 3.0 x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) *Creatinine = 1.5 x
             Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)

          -  Subject has received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  For any reason, subject is considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable
             candidate for the study.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to compare the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity
      between once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir and to further
      characterize the pharmacokinetics of once-daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir.</summary>
