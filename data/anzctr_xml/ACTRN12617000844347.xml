  <interventions>
    <interventions>This intervention programme is targetted for parents of obese and overweight primary school children. It uses REDUCE intervention programme, which is developed based on the social cognitive theory (SCT). REDUCE is an acronym for REorganise Diet, Unnecessary sCreen time and Exercise. The theory explains behaviour as a reciprocal interaction between person, behaviour and environmental factors. Changing the childrens behaviours on dietary intake and physical activity requires improvement in parental knowledge, self-efficacy, healthy practices, parenting skills and environment that is conducive to change which help facilitate and influence the childrens engagement in healthy behaviours. The key components of SCT used include self-monitoring, goal setting, self-efficacy, problem-solving, relapse prevention and stimulus control. 

The intervention is provided to the parents in two phases. Phase one is a four-week group training using the REDUCE module. The training involves two face-to-face training and two sessions using Facebook. The face-to-face training is at week one and week four that take place at Universiti Putra Malaysia, half a day training for each session. It is delivered by the researcher who is a family health specialist. However, the intervention was developed to be delivered by paramedical staffs. The module has 8 units which covered on nutrition, physical activity, behavioural modification techniques and parental authoritative feeding style. The exercise tip in Unit 8 is delivered by a sport medicine specialist.  For the two sessions using Facebook, the units in the REDUCE module are uploaded weekly and parents can download the units at their own convenience, with no time limit. Parents are encouraged to read, understand, give comments, and post questions on the same day. The researcher designates one-hour session to provide feedback and discussion in response to any queries by the parents on the same day. To ensure confidentiality, this Facebook group was made private, which is a readily built-in feature of Facebook. All sessions are delivered to parents only, except for face-to-face session two where both parents and children are invited. 

The training phase is followed by a booster phase. The duration of the booster phase is three months and it comprises of weekly information, delivered via WhatsApp, containing the gist of the content of each unit that is provided during the four-week training, as well as health tips and performance feedback. The information in the booster session are extracted from the REDUCE module and formatted as a poster before sending to the WhatsApp dedicated group.  The booster acts as a refresher and to strengthen their knowledge of the targeted behaviours of the REDUCE programme. Parents are encouraged to communicate with the researcher and other parents in the designated WhatsApp group to improve knowledge and skills of the parents in achieving the targeted behaviours.

In total, for the training and booster phase, parents are in contact with the researcher weekly for 16 weeks. Parents adherence in Facebook is assessed by the number and percentage of seen in the Facebook. Parents adherence in WhatsApp is counted when they accessed the messages. To encourage participation in the social media, only members of the intervention group can access the dedicated social media groups (to assure confidentiality and privacy) and discussion are promoted among participantsresearcher and participantsparticipants. Parents are also encouraged to support each other freely in the social media to maintain high motivation.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is a wait-list control group that will receive the REDUCE intervention after the 6-month follow-up assessments are completed. To encourage participation and prevent drop-outs from the wait-list group, incentives are given to children after the childs physical measurements are taken and upon the return of the parent-completed questionnaire for each follow-up. These incentives are similar to those received by the intervention group which are mainly stationery materials.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in BMI z-score of the children. BMI z-score is derived from weight, height, gender and age using WHO AnthroPlus software. Height is measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a mobile Seca stadiometer, model 213 (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Weight is measured with light clothing, without shoes, and empty pockets, using a calibrated 2-point body fat analyser, portable scale, Omron Karada Scan, model HBF 212 (Omron, Kyoto, Japan). The measurements are recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg.</outcome>

      <outcome>Waist circumference percentile. Waist circumference is measured between the edge of the lower chest and iliac crest bone, with light clothing, using an outstretched tape meter (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) without any pressure on the body surface to the nearest 0.1cm.

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation is based on detecting BMI z-score differences between intervention and wait-list groups using the standard formula for trials using individual randomisation. A difference of 0.24 in BMI z-scores with a standard deviation of 0.48 is expected to be relevant, based on a previous study. Thus, n = 49 per group, at 95% level of significance and 80% power. The dropout rate is assumed at about 15% after randomisation; a minimum sample size of 56 parents per group is required to detect this difference with a two-sample t-test.

Data analyses are performed using SPSS version 22.0. Tests of normality are conducted on all data with interval and ratio scale using skewness, kurtosis, and graphs. For descriptive analysis, mean and standard deviation are used to describe continuous data and percentages are used for categorical data. 

For inferential statistics, students t-test and chi-square test/ Fishers exact test are used for continuous and categorical data, respectively. Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) analysis is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, adjusted for baseline covariates on both continuous and categorical outcomes.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is to test the effectiveness of a family-based intervention using face-to-face approach and social media in improving children's adiposity. The intervention was named as REDUCE (REorganise Diet, Uncontrolled sCreen time and optimise Exercise) intervention programme is targetted to reduce children's body mass index, waist circumference and percentage of body fat. This study involved parents that are randomly allocated into intervention group and wait-list control group. Parents are eligible if (a) their children are between seven and ten years old at recruitment, who is either overweight or obese and (b) they are willing to use social media to communicate. Parents are excluded if they reported that their children had a chronic medical illness or physical or learning disabilities

The intervention group will receive a four-month intervention programme and the wait-list group will receive the intervention 6 months post-training of the intervention group. The intervention involves two phases. Phase one is a four-week training programme consisting of two face-to-face sessions and two Facebook contacts; Phase two consisted of weekly boosters delivered via WhatsApp over a three-month period. The total contact time between researcher and respondents for the intervention is 22 hours.

Parents and children will be monitored at baseline i.e. before the start of the intervention, immediately post-training and 3-month- and 6-month post-training. Parents will be assessed on their knowledge (on nutrition, physical activity and obesity-related diseases), healthy lifestyle practices, authoritative feeding style and self-efficacy. Children will be assessed on their adiposity (body mass index, waist circumference, percentage body fat) and lifestyle behaviours (eating behaviour; consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, fruit and vegetables, and unhealthy snacks; physical activity and screen time). </summary>
