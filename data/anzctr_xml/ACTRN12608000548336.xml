  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised controlled trial of internet based program termed the Panic Program for treatment of Panic Disorder. The Panic Program is a package of six Cognitive Behaviour Therapy lessons focussing on Psychoeducation, Controlled Breathing, Cognitive Therapy, Behavioural experiments and graded exposure. Participants read the first 3 lessons in week one then fortnightly thereafter. After each lesson they will download "Homework assignments" to complete in their own time. Lessons are completed in the location of the participants choice; whether that be home, work or even internet cafe. In addition they participate in an online forum for futher education and support from peers and the treating clinician. They also have additional support from the treating clinician via email; responding to questions or providing feedback to homework assignments. The program will take 9 weeks in total to complete. All participants will meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM IV) criteria for Panic Disorder. The control group will be treated after the intervention group complete the course.</interventions>
    <comparator>Once the intervention group have completed the program the control goup will also be treated using the Panic Program.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our previous research indicates that the Shyness Program, an Internet-based treatment program for people with social phobia, is effective at helping people to learn to manage their symptoms of social phobia. 

This trial is to assess whether a similar approach to Panic Disorder would be as effective. CBT is well recognised as the treatment of choice for Panic Disorder and trials of internet based CBT have been shown to be effective, however they tend to have high drop out rates. We aim to see if retention is improved by addition of a clinician and if this treatment is effective.</summary>
