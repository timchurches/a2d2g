  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be given an 8-week group-based integrated pain management program supplemented with peer volunteers. There will be 16 sessions, with two 1-hour sessions each week. 
Session 1 of each week includes:
1) 30 minutes of interactive teaching and sharing - Contents include introduction of pain, impact of pain, drug and non-drug therapy, five sensation therapy (touch, smell, taste, hearing &amp; vision), making a photo album, paper fan, paper flowers and vase, dried flower bags and festival decorations;
2) 20 minutes of exercise - Specific exercises for shoulder and neck, back, arms, whole body and balancing and towel dancing will be taught; 
3) 10 minutes of entry and reviewing  I can do it booklet. The research assistant will lead the sessions and peer volunteers will assist.
Session 2 of each week will only be led by peer volunteers . It includes 30 minutes of revision, 20 minutes of exercise and 10 minutes of entry and reviewing  I can do it booklet.
Peer volunteers will be provided two training (2 hours each) before the commencement of the voluntary service. They will be informed on the procedure of the program, correct implementation of a variety of exercises and multisensory therapy, communication skills and personal safety. Demonstration of exercise and multisensory therapy will be shown to them. They will also pair up with nursing students and role playing, and to lead a presentation and demonstration in the second workshop.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Studies found that educational interventions were effective among older adults only in the short-term and those who participated in these intervention programs often fall back into their old habits upon completion of the program. As literature suggested that interventions including some type of social support have great potential to increase participation and adherence, it raises the question of whether the effects of an integrated pain management program can be extended with the use of peer volunteers. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of an integrated pain management program supplemented with peer volunteers in improving pain intensity, functional mobility, physical activity, loneliness level, happiness level and use of non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods among frail older adults with chronic pain.</summary>
