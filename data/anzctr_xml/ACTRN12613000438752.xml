    <interventions>Double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a probiotic supplement (Probio'Stick) with a placebo, followed by an open-label extension. The intervention requires the intake of a probiotic formula (Probio'Stick) containing two bacterial strains: Lactobacillus Helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 (3 x 10^9 colony-forming units/stick). More detailed information about the product can be found on the manufacturer's website, www.institut-rosell-lallemand.com. Participants consume 1 probiotic stick per day for a period of 8 weeks. The stick is in the form of an orodispersible powder which can be taken without water. Participants will be asked to record any sticks missed, as well as any unusual events in their life, in a study diary. Following the RCT, participants will be invited to enter an open-label trial for a further 8 week period with the same dose of Probio'Stick.</interventions>
    <comparator>The placebo group receives a placebo formula of identical taste and appearance, consisting of the same excipients as are in Probio'Stick (xylitol, maltodextrin (maize-derived), plum flavour and malic acid) without any active cultures. Participants consume one placebo stick per day for a total of eight weeks. They will then be invited to enter the open-label trial for a further 8 week period with the same dose of Probio'Stick (ingredients described above).</comparator>

Any serious medical condition for which major medical interventions are anticipated during the duration of the trial.

Any patient known to be allergic to the ingredients of the intervention.

Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

Any other medication with primarily central nervous system activity, including mood stabilizers. Participants must have been off of these medications for a minimum of four weeks prior to the trial.

Patients will be excluded temporarily if they have taken an oral antibiotic in the previous 6 weeks. If an antibiotic is begun during the course of the trial, that patient will be withdrawn from the study.

Renal, hepatic, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases

Participants will be asked to cease their use of any type of nutritional or herbal supplement known to enhance the immune system (e.g. vitamin C, vitamin E, Echinacea) for the duration of the study as these may affect the efficacy of the probiotics.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>If an individual meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria, he/she will be allocated to the next available number. All sticks (active ingredient or placebo) have been pre-packaged by a person outside of the study who holds the randomization code. A sealed envelope is kept at the lab for each participant, only to be opened in an emergency (i.e. a patient deteriorates significantly).</concealment>
    <sequence>We will set up 4 tables of random numbers (mix of 1s and 2s representing the probiotic or placebo) using www.randomization.com which provides web-based deterministic software which uses the pseudo-random number generator of Wichmann and Hill (1982) to randomize each subject to a single treatment by using the method of randomly permuted blocks. Although the site may modify the appearance of the software, the algorithms remain unchanged over time and previous versions always remain available. We will give these four sets to a person outside of the study, who will select one of them. All persons involved in running the study will not know which randomization code has been chosen. The person outside the study will then prepare a participant kit in advance which contains all the probiotic sticks required over the eight weeks for each participant. These kits are sequentially numbered and allocated to placebo or probiotic based on the randomization list. Once a participant’s eligibility has been confirmed they will be allocated the next sequentially numbered kit. In this manner, no-one involved in the study (the participant, PI, clinician and observer assessing the participant’s outcomes) will be aware of the participant’s allocated study group.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Due to the lack of any pilot data, the sample size (80) was selected based on similar studies in the literature. The largest human probiotics study to date is that of Diop, Guillou, and Durand (2008), which used a sample size of 75, who found that the consumption of probiotics significantly reduced 2 stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain and nausea/vomiting). Other studies more similar to the current trial have all used smaller sample sizes (e.g. Messaoudi, Lalonde, et al., 2011); therefore, we predict that recruiting 80 participants will be enough to give us a medium effect-size without overly straining our human and financial resources.

Baseline demographic and clinical variables will be examined for differences between the supplement group and the placebo group using analysis of variance  (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi square tests for categorical variables to ensure that the randomisation process was successful. If any significant differences are detected, subsequent analyses will involve controlling for possible confounding factors. Analysis of the outcome measures will involve conducting a series of mixed effect linear models, comparing randomized groups on the outcome measures at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks. The second set of analyses will compare the two groups on the blood levels of measured biomarkers at baseline and at 8 weeks. A series of chi-square tests will be used to compare the supplement group to the placebo group. All analyses will be done on intent-to-treat basis - each patient who provides informed consent and is randomized to either supplement or placebo will be included in their randomization group for analysis, regardless of compliance with treatment. If any patient drops out before the final eight week follow-up visit, the last-observation-carried-forward technique will be used to impute the missing values. Complete documentation will be kept on non-completers, and their reasons for dropping out of the study prematurely. The individual changes and the difference in the changes will be summarised with 95% confidence intervals derived from the ANCOVA. A two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 will be taken to indicate statistical significance. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of a probiotic supplement on the treatment of the psychological symptoms of depression. Developing research in both animals and humans suggests that some potentially beneficial (probiotic) bacteria which are lowered in states of stress and chronic illness may influence depressive symptoms through effects on the microbial gut-brain axis.  Most studies conducted on probiotics and psychological symptoms so far have used animal populations, with only a handful of small human studies having been published at the present time. The aim of this research is to strengthen the current field of research through providing a moderately large human study assessing the efficacy of a specific probiotic formula in treating the symptoms of depression. We will also measure IBS symptoms and related blood-based biomarkers in order to consider possible mechanisms of action.</summary>
