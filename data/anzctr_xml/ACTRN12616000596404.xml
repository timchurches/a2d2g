    <interventions>Weaning from mechanical ventilation is one of the most common activities undertaken in intensive care. Currently, the gold standard for weaning and assessing for extubation is a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).  Diaphragmatic ultrasound and electromyography are emerging tools that may have considerable utility in augmenting the decision making process surrounding weaning and extubation. We aim to assess diaphragmatic function via ultrasound and electromyographic activity analysis at the start and end of a spontaneous breathing trial. 

A spontaneous breathing trial consists of the patient being placed on a T-piece without PEEP and given enough supplemental oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturation. For a spontaneous breathing trial to be considered successful, it must last at least 30 minutes. 

Patients who are planned to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial as part of their usual care will be considered for the trial.

Ultrasound assessment of the right hemidiaphragm will be conducted within the first 5 minutes of the SBT and at 30 minutes. This will be conducted by a qualified  ultrasonographer with the patient lying at 45 degrees. Measurement of diaphragmatic excursion, speed of diaphragmatic contraction and diaphragmatic thickness (at end-inspiration and end-expiration) will be conducted at both assessments.

Measurements regarding diaphragmatic electomyography will also be recorded throughout the SBT. Diaphragmatic electromyography will be measured using an Edi catheter and Edi module of a Maquet Servo-u ventilator.  The Edi catheter consists of a modified nasogastric feeding tube equipped with a multiple-array oesophageal electrode that provides real time access to EAdi.

    <statisticalmethods>We propose to recruit 100 participants to the study. This is based on what can be feasibly obtained over a 1-year recruitment period as well as having sufficient numbers to conduct our proposed analyses. With 100 participants we expect 25-35 will fail the SBT. Of the successes we expect around 20% will fail extubation due to recurrent respiratory failure. This equates to approximately 15 participants expected to fail extubation.

Patients will be split into two groups; those that are deemed to fail SBT and those that pass. Ultrasound and EAdi derived diaphragmatic parameters as well as population and other measures will undergo between group comparison using Wilcoxon 2-sample test for continuous measures and Fishers exact test for categorical measures. Clinical significance of differences between the 2 groups will also be considered. All variables showing clinically or statistically significant differences between groups will be further considered for inclusion in a prediction model for successful completion of SBT using logistic regression. Due to the potential for overfitting a prediction model with limited expected numbers of events we will use forward selection for model building. 

Patients who successfully complete SBT will also be split into 2 groups based on success or failure of extubation. A similar analytical procedure as described in the previous paragraph will be used to compare the 2 groups although it is unlikely there will be sufficient failures for prediction modelling.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Weaning from mechanical ventilation is one of the most common activities undertaken in intensive care. Currently, the gold standard for weaning and assessing for extubation is a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). There is still a proportion of patients (up to 20%) that fail extubation due to recurrent respiratory failure following a successful SBT.

Both diaphragmatic ultrasound and electromyography are emerging tools that may have considerable utility in augmenting the decision making process surrounding weaning and extubation. This study will aim to assess diaphragmatic function via ultrasound and electromyographic activity analysis at the start and end of a spontaneous breathing trial. This data should enable the identification of the role of diaphragmatic function in both successful and unsuccessful SBTs. Completing this study will aid in understanding the role of diaphragmatic ultrasound and EMG in ventilator weaning and extubation.</summary>
