  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Betamethasone OR Dexamethasone Injectable
Treatment: drugs - Normal Saline Flush, 0.9% Injectable Solution
Treatment: drugs - Dexamethasone Oral Tablet
Other interventions - Sham Injection and/or oral placebo

Experimental: Arm 1 - Betamethasone OR Dexamethasone Injectable CT - fluoroscopic guided transforaminal lumbar epidural steroid

Experimental: Arm 2 - Normal Saline Flush, 0.9% Injectable Solution CT - fluoroscopic guided transforaminal lumbar epidural normal saline

Experimental: Arm 3 - Dexamethasone Oral Tablet:
Oral dexamethasone 15 day tapered dosing is as follows: (i) days 1-5, 4 mg morning and evening, (ii) days 6-10, 2 mg morning and evening, and (iii) days 11-15, 1mg morning and evening.

Other: Arm 4 - Sham Injection and/or oral placebo: CT/fluoroscopic guided (parameters set to zero) transforaminal lumbar sham (needle placement down to muscle and no injection of any fluid) AND placebo oral tablets taper.


Treatment: drugs: Betamethasone OR Dexamethasone Injectable
Procedural agents. The steroid and local anaesthetic preparation will be standardized to replicate current radiology interventional practices that use either particulate or non-particulate steroids. Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate/Acetate 5.7 mg/ml Injectable is a particulate corticosteroid and is used with the local anaesthetic bupivacaine 0.5% (1ml). Dexamethasone 4mg (1ml) is a non-particulate corticosteroid and is used with the local anaesthetic lignocaine 1% (1ml).

Treatment: drugs: Normal Saline Flush, 0.9% Injectable Solution
Procedural agents. The local anaesthetic preparation used with the Normal Saline Flush, 0.9% Injectable Solution, will be standardized to replicate current radiology interventional practices: either local anaesthetic bupivacaine 0.5% (1ml) or local anaesthetic lignocaine 1% (1ml).

Treatment: drugs: Dexamethasone Oral Tablet
Dexamethasone Oral Tablet: 15 day taper dosing is: days 1-5 8mg (4mg bd) , days 6-10 4 mg (2mg bd), and days 11-15 2 mg (1mg bd). The dexamethasone is over-encapsulated in a gelatine capsule that is identical to the placebo capsule in appearance.

Other interventions: Sham Injection and/or oral placebo
The sham Injection procedure is needle placement down to muscle at the designated spinal level and no injection of any fluid. The oral placebo is a gelatine capsule packed with filler.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim: In subjects with acute sciatica (= 4 weeks duration), this is a pilot comparative
      effectiveness study to evaluate feasibility and to determine final sample size for a future
      adequately powered randomised controlled trial of (i) CT-guided transforaminal lumbosacral
      epidural steroid injection, and (ii) oral dexamethasone, in a masked (blinded), randomised,
      sham injection and oral placebo controlled trial.

      Study Design: 60 patients with acute sciatica will randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive either (i)
      epidural steroid injection &amp; oral placebo, (ii) epidural normal saline injection &amp; oral
      placebo, (iii) oral dexamethasone &amp; IM sham-injection, (iv) IM sham-injection &amp; oral placebo.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is reduction of disability at 3 weeks using the Oswestry
      Disability Index. Secondary outcomes include reduction of disability at 6 and 48 weeks.</summary>
