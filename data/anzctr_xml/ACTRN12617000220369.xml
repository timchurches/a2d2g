  <interventions>
    <interventions>A randomised, double-blind, controlled, crossover trial will be conducted. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to either an intervention (Queen Garnet Plum juice) or a control arm (blackcurrant flavoured cordial) by independently computer-generated block randomisation. All researchers will be blinded to the allocation order and encoding broken after data analysis. 
Intervention: Each arm will last for eight weeks with a 4-week washout period in between, and thereafter allocation. Participants will receive 200mL/day of QGP juice (intervention arm) or commercially available blackcurrant cordial (control arm). Beverages will be delivered to participants homes weekly, in opaque plastic bottles. The QGP fresh fruit will be provided in-kind by Nutrafruit Pty Ltd and the juice produced and bottled by Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, Queensland, using a novel method to retain the bioactives. Unconsumed juice will be collected for compliance, and urinary biomarker metabolites assessed. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control treatment will be commercially available blackcurrant cordial which has similar amount of vitamin C as the QGPj but negligible amount of anthocyanin</comparator>
    <control>Placebo</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Other</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cognitive function and memory (a composite primary outcome) will be assessed using five cognitive tests, including;
1. The Rey auditory verbal learning test (RAVLT): measure of verbal learning and memory 
2. The Boston naming test: assesses confrontational naming related to semantic memory 
3. the trail making test (TMT): TMT A and B will evaluate executive function, with the relative difference between B and A used as the measure
4. Digit span backwards task: examines short-term memory storage and executive control processes
5. Category and letter verbal fluency: measure of executive function.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Anthocyanins are compounds found naturally in fruits and vegetables that provide the rich colour such as blue and deep red. These compounds possess strong antioxidant abilities which may protect the cells of the body from damage. 

Over recent years, there has been considerable interest in the health effects of diets that are high in plant foods, and particularly the role of anthocyanin content of foods. There is some research that has shown that intake of foods and beverages that are rich in anthocyanins may protect against age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration.  

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of consumption of  fruit juice for 8 weeks on blood pressure and memory and cognition in generally healthy older adults. 

The study will also determine if the fruit juice affects inflammatory markers in the blood (these are produced as the body's response to injury or infection) and insulin sensitivity (as measured using blood glucose and insulin values).
