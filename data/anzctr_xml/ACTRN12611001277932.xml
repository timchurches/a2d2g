  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chewing gum (single piece of sugar-free) three times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) for at least thirty minutes from the first mealtime postoperatively until discharge. Time to discharge will vary between patients. Patients are normally discharged once they are opening their bowels adequately, are managing a light diet, their pain is manageable with oral anlgesia, they are mobilising adequately to be safe at home, are able to manage their colostomy if applicable, there are no other complications from surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard postoperative management. This usually includes early (day 1 postop) and ongoing mobilisation, sips only of water until flatus then light diet as tolerated, analgesia as required, antiemetics as required, indwelling urinary catheter out as soon as mobilising, supportive intravenous fluids until sufficient fluid intake, bulking laxatives or codeine depending on bowel motion consistency, stoma nurse training if applicable, thromboprophylaxis, treatment of complications eg pneumonia, urinary tract infections, maintaining euvolaemia, wound care.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is some international evidence that chewing gum after abdominal surgery reduces postoperative pain and nausea, as well as reducing a complication of surgery called ileus. Ileus is a condition where the bowel (intestines) goes on strike for a short time. While the bowel is in ileus you cannot eat or drink and are reliant on intravenous care in hospital.  Ileus resolves without specific treatment but can take days or weeks and can cause secondary problems. Chewing gum may help reduce ileus by stimulating the bowel through a mechanism called the gastrocephalic reflex, though it is not fully understood. Results internationally are varied and may not be applicable to New Zealand as postoperative management is different in different countries.</summary>
