  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non-invasive low-level laser therapy using 808nm diode laser, energy per point 0.8J total power: 0.18W.

Participants will have partial braces placed on their upper back teeth, and they will attend the clinic 7 times during a 4 week study period for the laser to be applied, then on the 8th visit  (day 28) the braces are removed and the upper first premolars will be extracted. 

The study will end here and the patient will then continue normal orthodontic as needed.
Which will include full upper and lower braces and the patient will continue with comprehensive orthodontic treatment- alignment, levelling, space closure and detailing. The duration of orthodontic treatment is dependent on each patients individual need. They are no longer enrolled in the study at this point. 

The study period is only 28 days.

The low level laser therapy (LLLT) and sham laser is applied daily for the first 4 days of the study period, then weekly for 3 weeks.  Laser and sham are applied on Day 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21. The first appointment (day 0) takes 30 mins to place the braces and administer the laser (40s per side (total 80s) and visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess the pain. Then each subsequent laser session takes 40s per side (total 80s) each appointment is 5 minutes long to check on the braces and administer the laser and VAS. 

A qualified laser dentist administers the laser treatment 

The laser (for photobiomodulation) to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement is applied after the braces are placed and during buccal tipping of the upper first premolar. Laser therapy ceases 1 week prior to tooth extraction

The laser is applied along the first premolar root, at 4 points along the premolar root (mesial and distal of the crystal, mid root and apex) - in a shape of a mercedes sign. 
The laser is applied on both the buccal and palatal surfaces i.e. 8 exposure per tooth

28 days after the braces are placed, they are removed and the premolar tooth is extracted.

Adherence is strictly monitored, each patient is given a timetable prior to starting the trial to ensure they can attend all 8 sessions, and register of attendance is always taken. If a patient misses one appointment they are excluded from the study, although their orthodontic treatment will continue as per normal. </interventions>
    <comparator>Split mouth study, one side is experiment low-level laser and the other side is the control side where placebo/sham laser is used

Sham laser is administered using the same machine, but a piece of black absorbent paper is placed inside the laser (behind the tip) to block the laser beam. The laser is on, and makes the same sound but the beam is blocked.

Both the sham and actual laser beam is invisible to the naked eye so both the clinician and participant is blinded during this trial. As one dentist is the assistant and blinds the laser prior to each application. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Volume of orthodontically induced inflammatory root resorption craters

Samples are scanned with SkyScan 1172 desktop x-ray micro-tomograph system (SkyScan, Aartselaar, Belgium) and images are reconstructed with NRecon (Version 1.4.2; Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium)

Specifically designed software - NRecon (Version 1.6.9.18, Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium) reconstructed the image data from the SkyScan. This program utilises a modified Feldkamp cone beam algorithm to produce slice by slice axial reconstruction. The settings for NRecon were standardized for all of the images. The reconstructed slices were saved in 16-bit tagged image file format (TIFF) format. 

Root resorption crater analysis was performed using the imaging software program Fiji along with a custom macro Enigma. Each image slice needs to be converted to a binary image (black and white) prior to crater calculation. All of the axial slices of the image stack for each specimen are manually examined for resorption craters. 

Once a crater is identified, the crater is selected with a clipping tool and duplicated into its own image sequence to allow Enigma to calculate the individual volume of each crater in cubic millimetres. All measurements are carried out by one operator (D.N.) to reduce error and bias. The craters are grouped 1) according to their location on the root surface e.g. buccal, palatal, mesial or distal; and 2) according to their location in the vertical plane e.g. apical, middle or cervical. The vertical location is determined by measuring the total length of the root from the CEJ to the apex and dividing it into equal thirds. Total root resorption volume is also recorded for each tooth.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of low-level laser therapy in the management of orthodontic pain during orthodontic therapy and to see if it affects root resorption of teeth. The findings from this study will be compared to other related studies performed previously. By applying pain-free laser therapy on one side next to a tooth we hope to examine its effect on root resorption. This will increase our quality of care and help prevent this damage to patients teeth during treatment.</summary>
