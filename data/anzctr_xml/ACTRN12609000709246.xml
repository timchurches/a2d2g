  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Westmead Program is conducted in two stages. During stage 1, children are taught to to practice a speech pattern known as syllable-timed speech (STS) with their parents, daily. STS involves speaking with equal stress attached to each syllable. The treatment is administered by a trained speech pathologist during weekly or fortnightly clinic visits, lasting 30-60 minutes in duration. Treatment continues until stuttering is less than 1.0% syllables stuttered within the clinic and average weekly severity rating scores beyond the clinic are less than 2, for three consecutive weeks. At that point, participants progress to Stage 2 of treatment. The aim of Stage 2 is to maintain the low level of stuttering achieved during Stage 1 whilst gradually withdrawing treatment over approximately one year. The Westmead Program treatment group will be run simultaneously to the Lidcombe Program treatment group.</interventions>
    <comparator>The Lidcombe Program is conducted in two stages. During stage 1, parents are trained to provide verbal contingencies in response to their childs speech. The verbal contingencies for stutter-free speech are acknowledgement, praise and request for self-evaluation. The verbal contingencies for stuttered-speech are acknowledgement and request for self correction. Parents are required to administer these contingencies daily, during 10-15 minute structured conversations. Along with providing contingencies in structured conversations, parents are also required to give on-line feedback to their child in a wide range of unstructured conversations, occurring at times other than the treatment session. The treatment is administered by a trained speech pathologist during weekly clinic visits, lasting 45-60 minutes in duration. Treatment continues until stuttering is less than 1.0% syllables stuttered within the clinic and average weekly severity rating scores beyond the clinic are less than 2, for three consecutive weeks. At that point, participants progress to Stage 2 of treatment. The aim of Stage 2 is to maintain the low level of stuttering achieved during Stage 1 whilst gradually withdrawing treatment over approximately one year. The Lidcombe Program treatment group will be run simultaneously to the Westmead Program treatment group.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percent syllables stuttered (%SS). A %SS measure indicates the proportion of syllables in a speech sample that are associated with unambiguous stuttering. To calculate %SS, an electronic button press counter device will be used, where one button is pressed for each stuttered syllable and another pressed for every other syllable.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preliminary evidence has driven the development of an innovative treatment for early stuttering, called the Westmead Program. The treatment involves training children to practice a speech pattern known as syllable timed speech (STS) with their parents, daily. STS involves speaking with equal stress attached to each syllable and it is the best known means to control stuttering in a laboratory context. 

The current best practice treatment, the Lidcombe Program, has been replicated in randomised controlled trials; however, it does require considerable resources from families and clinicians. The purpose of investigating innovative treatments for early stuttering is to provide users with effective alternate approaches that have the potential to improve health care efficiency and client care. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the experimental treatment is at least as efficacious as the standard treatment.</summary>
