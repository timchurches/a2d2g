  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are 4 intervention arms including the sham control arm.
Group 1 (local point group) will receive needling to the primary local point/myofascial trigger point in the upper trapezius only. This group will receive a maximum of 2 needles dependant on whether their symptoms are unilateral or bilateral.
Group 2 (combination treatment group) will receive the same treatment as Group 1 with the addition of two distal points needled bilaterally (additional 4 needles). The most relevant points will be selected from the following pairings as determined by Chinese Medicine channel theory; SI3 &amp; BL60, LI4 &amp; ST37 or TE5 &amp; GB34. This group will receive 5-6 needles dependant on whether their symptoms are unilateral or bilateral.
Group 3  (distal points only group) will receive the same treatment as Group 2 with the omission of the local points in the upper trapezius muscle. This group will receive a total of 4 needles.
All needling/intervention groups will receive treatment from an experienced registered acupuncturist, which will involve insertion of the needles and retention for 20 minutes followed by removal and disposal of the needles. Standardised rotational manipulation will be applied to each needle upon insertion, at 5 minutes, at 10 minutes and at 15 minutes.
All treatment interventions will be performed on-site at the UTS TCM Outpatient Clinic. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be receiving the same treatment as Group 2 (combination treatment), however this treatment will be performed using a deactivated (diode removed) therapeutic laser device. This device will still emit sound and screen displays are still active, giving the impression that the device is performing as it is intended.
The credibility of this treatment will be measured using a Credibility Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ).</comparator>

    <concealment>Subjects will self-select for inclusion and be assessed against the inclusion criteria.
If they qualify they will be randomised into 1 of 4 groups through a computer generated randomised schedule based on order of contact.
The group allocation is revealed, by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule located off-site to the study, only to the treating practitioner who is blinded to the results of the outcome measures.
The outcome assessor is kept blind to the participants group allocation throughout the trial. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The size of 60 (20 per group) has been calculated as the appropriate number to obtain a statistically significant outcome based on the effect size noted in similar studies.
For within group analysis (pre vs post vs control) t tests will be used. In these circumstances, given:
* an effect size of 0.67.
* alpha of 0.05
* power value of 0.8,
*standard deviation of 0.71
*a valid group size would be n=19.
Based on these calculations 80 participants will be recruited, 20 per group, to account for potential dropouts.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The design of this study is a prospective single-blind parallel four arm randomised placebo controlled trial with repeated measures. The purpose of this study is to investigate various methods of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of myofascial pain in the upper trapezius muscle. 

This study is designed to test the following hypotheses; 1) There is no significant difference between needling locally and needling relevant distal points only in the treatment of myofascial pain; and 2) Needling a combination of both local and distal points is superior to needling either local points or relevant distal points alone in the treatment of myofascial pain; 3) Acupuncture is superior to placebo in the treatment of myofascial pain. 

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of four groups that will receive one of three types of acupuncture therapy, with the remaining group acting as a control group.</summary>
