  <interventions>
    <interventions>A population census will be conducted at month 0 &amp; 12 to screen the community for scabies and strongyloidiasis followed by a mass drug administration.  The following drugs will be given according to weight and pregnancy status regardless of disease status if the eligible drug has not been given in the previoius 7 days to treat scabies or strongyloidiasis.

-  weight 15 kg or more and not pregnant, oral ivermectin 200 microgram/kg immediately
- weight 6kg to &lt;15 kg topical 5% permethrin immediately &amp; 200mg (6-10kg) or 400mg (10-&lt;15kg) oral albendazole daily for 3 days	
- weight 3.5kg to &lt;6kg topical 5% permethrin immediately
- &lt;3.5kg topical 10% crotamiton daily for 3 days.

Retreatment at 2-3 weeks for those diagnosed with scabies and/or strongyloidiasis will be administered as the same treatment received 2-3 weeks prior.
Scabies
- non-pregnant and 15 kg or greater, oral ivermectin 200micrograms/kg 
- pregnant or =3.5 kg and &lt;15 kg, topical 5% permethrin 
- &lt;3.5kg, topical 10% crotamiton daily for 3 days
Strongyloidiasis
- Non-pregnant and 15 kg or greater, oral ivermectin 200 microgram/kg immediately
- 6kg to &lt;15 kg, 200mg (6-10kg) or 400mg (&gt;10kg) oral albendazole daily for 3 days
- pregnant females will be treated with oral ivermectin 1 week after delivery with 200 microgram/kg 2-3 weeks apart if not treated by local practitioners previously
- 0 to &lt;6kg discuss with medical supervisor before treatment

At month 6 and 18 participants diagnosed with disease in the previous 6 months will be followed up along with a percentage of negative participants.  Only those diagnosed with disease at these 2 time points will receive treatment that will be administered as 2 treatments 2-3 weeks apart.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. At month 12, demonstrate:
a) a reduction in scabies prevalence from 13% at month 0 to 8% or less.  Scabies will be diagnosed clinically and the results of the skin screening performed during the population census at month 0 &amp; 12 will be compared.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 0 and 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. At month 12, demonstrate:
b) a reduction in strongyloidiasis prevalence from 40% at month 0 to 20% or less.  A reduction in prevalence will be assessed at month 0 and 12 by comparing the proportion of positive stool samples for children aged &lt;12 years and the equivacol or positive serology results for those aged 12 years and older.  Stool specimens will be examined for larvae by microscopy and culture and IgG antibodies to Strongyloides ratti will be measured in serum samples.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 0 and 12</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Epidemiological features of scabies and strongyloidiasis infections in a remote Aboriginal setting including spatial and household clustering will be collected during the population census at months 0 &amp; 12 and the cross sectional survey at months 6 &amp; 18.  Demographic data will be collected on all participants at these time points to describe the epidemiological features.  The data will be stratified by age, gender, disease status, treatment given and household lot number using Stata 10 and Global Positioning System(GPS) mapping.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 0, 6, 12 and 18</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>a) Scabies/strongyloidiasis treatment failure and acquisition rates assessed at months 6 and 18.  The treatment failure and disease acquisition rates will be determined by comparing the faecal/serology results for strongyloidiasis and the skin screening results for scabies from the population census conducted at months 0 and 12 with the cross sectional survey results collected at months 6 and 18.  In exploring differences between susceptibles who did and did not acquire scabies/strongyloidiasis over the follow-up period, GEE will be employed given the potential for clustering by household. Simple (univariate) Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) will be performed for each explanatory variable of interest.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Month 6 and 18</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Proportion of participants reporting any serious adverse events.  Reporting of adverse events will be monitored 24-72 hours after administration of oral medications from a questionaire asked prior to administration of medication and compared with answers provided 24-72 hours after administration.  The adverse events will be reported as an overall percentage of those who completed the pre and post oral treatment questionaire.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A before and after study of scabies and strongyloidiasis prevalence in a remote Aboriginal community following the introduction of an ivermectin MDA delivered at months 0 and 12. The assessment of prevalence will be through a population census at months 0 and 12 with a cross sectional survey of treatment failure rates and acquisition rates at months 6 and 18.
All residents in the remote Aboriginal community are eligible for enrolment. Each household in the community will be visited by the research team to explain the project and obtain informed consent. The population census includes screening for scabies and strongyloidiasis and collection of non-specific disease markers.
Participants will then receive ivermectin if they are not pregnant, weight is 15kg or more and they have not been given ivermectin in the previous 7 days. Tretment regimens for those
not eligible for ivermectin are: - Pregnant
females will receive 5% permethrin cream only -weight &gt;3.5kg and &lt;6kg 5% permethrin only, if diagnosed with strongyloidiasis discuss with medical supervisor - weight &gt;6 kg and &lt;15 kg albendazole 200mg
(6-10kg) or 400mg (&gt;10kg)and 5% permethrin.
- weight &lt;3.5kg 10% crotamiton only
Participants diagnosed with scabies or
strongyloidiasis will receive a repeat treatment
after 2-3 weeks.</summary>
