Treatment: drugs - Placebo
Treatment: drugs - Gemcitabine

Experimental: Phase 1b 200 mg LY2228820 - Induction: Cycles 1-6 (21 day cycles)- 200 milligrams (mg) LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-10. Gemcitabine 1000 milligrams per square meter (mg/m^2) administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 3 and 10. Carboplatin dose Area Under Curve (AUC) 4 (mg-min/ml) administered IV over 30 minutes on day 3.
Maintenance: Cycles 7+ (28 day cycles)- 300 mg LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-14.

Experimental: Phase 1b 300 mg LY2228820 - Induction: Cycles 1-6 (21 day cycles)- 300 mg LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-10. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 administered IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 10. Carboplatin dose AUC 4 administered IV over 30 minutes on day 3.
Maintenance: Cycles 7+ (28 day cycles)- 300 mg LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-14.

Experimental: Phase 2 dose LY2228820 - Induction: Cycles 1-6 (21 day cycles)- Recommended Phase 2 dose of LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-10. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 administered IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 10. Carboplatin dose AUC 4 administered IV over 30 minutes on day 3.
Maintenance: Cycles 7+ (28 day cycles)- 300 mg LY2228820 administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-14.

Placebo Comparator: Phase 2 Placebo - Induction: Cycles 1-6 (21 day cycles)- Placebo administered orally every 12 hours on days 1-10. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 administered IV over 30 minutes on days 3 and 10. Carboplatin dose AUC 4 administered IV over 30 minutes on day 3.
Maintenance: Cycle 7+ (28 day cycles)- Placebo administered orally on days 1-14 to maintain blind.
