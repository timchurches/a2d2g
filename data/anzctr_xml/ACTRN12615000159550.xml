    <concealment>Patients aged 6 month and above with uncomplicated malaria who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with either artemether/lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and monitored for
42 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations.</concealment>
    <sequence>N/A
This surveillance study is 2 x one-arm prospective evaluation of clinical and parasitological responses to directly observed treatment for uncomplicated malaria with either 
artemether/lumefantrine or dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine. 

The study groups in both arms will be recruited sequentially (the first 88 patients will be enrolled in artemether+lumefantrine arm and the subsequent 88 cases will be enrolled in the dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine) and followed up prospectively. </sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>

    <designfeatures>This is a cohort prospective study in sequential enrollment. Two artemisinin-based  combinations will be tested: artemether+lumefantrine in one arm and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine in another arm. 

Patients will be enrolled first in the artemether+lumefantrine arm study and when the sample size of 88 is reached, the subsequent patients will be enrolled in the dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine  arm. This will be a sequential enrollment.

</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Currently the treatment failure rate to artemether+lumefantrine or dihydroarteminin/piperaquine in the study area is less than 5%. At a confidence level of 95% and a precision around the estimate of 5%, a minimum of 73 patients must be included per drug test. With a 20% increase to allow loss to follow-up and withdrawals during the 28-day (rtemether+lumefantrine) or 42-day ( dihydroarteminin/piperaquine) follow-up period, 88 patients should be included in the study per treatment arm per site. 

Excel WHO tailored database will be used for data management and analysis. Data will be analysed by two methods: the Kaplan-Meier method and per-protocol analysis.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>Title: Invivo efficacy and safety of artemether/lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine [DHA/PQP] for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in public health facilities in Tanzania.

Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of the current first and second line treatments to support updating of the national malaria treatment policy.

Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of artemether/lumefantrine and DHA/PQP for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria infections.

Study Sites: Ikwiriri and Kibiti in Rufiji district and Ipinda in Kyela district.

Study Period: The study will be conducted between  December 2014 to June 2015.

Study Design: Two cohorts prospective study in sequential enrollments.

Patient population: Febrile patients aged 6 months and above, excluding female minors 12-17 years, with confirmed uncomplicated P. falciparum infection will be enrolled. 

Sample Size: A total of 88 patients per treatment arm in each site will be enrolled.

Treatments and follow-up: artemether/lumefantrine given twice daily for three days and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine given once daily for 3 days. Clinical and parasitological parameters will be monitored over a 28-day (artemether/lumefantrine ) or 42-day (dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine) follow-up period to evaluate drug efficacy and safety.

Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients with early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response as indicators of efficacy.  Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Day 3 malaria positivity rate will determined. 

Secondary endpoints: The frequency and nature of adverse events

Optional exploratory endpoints:
to determine the polymorphism of molecular markers for artemisinin resistance.
