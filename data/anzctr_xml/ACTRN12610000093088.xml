  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>At present there is no standard 2nd line chemotherapy regime for patients with advanced malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) who progress after treatment with standard first line chemotherapy (i.e. pemetrexed and a platinum compound). BNC105P is a novel chemotherapy agent which has shown activity in MPM. In this study, BNC105P will be studied in a single arm, 2 stage, multi-centre design to determine its efficacy and safety as 2nd line chemotherapy for patients with MPM. All subjects will receive BNC105P on Day 1 and Day 8 of a 21 day cycle until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.  The primary endpoint will be tumour response, and secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival, adverse events, and quality of life. Correlative substudies will examine associations between potential biological markers and outcomes.</summary>
