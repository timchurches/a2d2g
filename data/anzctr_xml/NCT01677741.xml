    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Dabrafenib

Experimental: Part 1: Dabrafenib treatment - Three subjects will receive a single dose of 3 mg/kg dabrafenib on Day 1 and repeat dose will begin from Day 2, evenly divided in two daily doses. Once all 3 subjects have been fully evaluated for the first 28 days (including Day 15 PK) and no DLTs are observed, a next subject will be enrolled at the next higher dose levels (i.e., dose escalation to 3.75 mg/kg [+1] and may be further to 4.5 mg/kg [+2] and so on). If all 3 subjects have not been fully evaluated for the first 28 days or 1 DLT occurred, the fourth subject will be enrolled at the same dose level. If 2 or more DLTs are observed, the next subject will be enrolled at the next lower dose level (i.e., de-escalated to 2.25 mg/kg [-1] and may be further to 1.5 mg/kg [-2]). Similarly, the process is repeated for the fifth and sixth subjects in a cohort. All subjects will receive treatment till end of study.

Experimental: Part 2: Cohort 1 Low-Grade Gliomas with BRAF V600 mutations - Subjects with low-grade gliomas with BRAF V600 mutations will receive the single selected final dose (based on MTD and the age of the subjects) from Part 1 on Day 1. Repeat dosing will begin from Day 2, twice daily till end of study.

Experimental: Part 2: Cohort 2 High-Grade Gliomas with BRAF V600 mutations - Subjects with high-grade gliomas with BRAF V600 mutations will receive the single selected final dose (based on MTD and the age of the subjects) from Part 1 on Day 1. Repeat dosing will begin from Day 2, twice daily till end of study.

Experimental: Part 2: Cohort 3 LCH with BRAF V600 mutations - Subjects with LCH with BRAF V600 mutations will receive the single selected final dose (based on MTD and the age of the subjects) from Part 1 on Day 1. Repeat dosing will begin from Day 2, twice daily till end of study.

Experimental: Part 2: Cohort 4 Melanoma and PTC with BRAF V600 mutations - Subjects with other tumors with BRAF V600 mutations will receive the single selected final dose (based on MTD and the age of the subjects) from Part 1 on Day 1. Repeat dosing will begin from Day 2, twice daily till end of study.


Treatment: drugs: Dabrafenib
Dabrafenib is available as 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 75 mg capsules and as oral suspension (10 mg/mL for subjects unable to swallow capsules). Dabrafenib (either formulation) will be administered orally as a single dose on Day 1 and twice daily from Day 2, based on weight at the appropriate study dose level.

    <summary>This is a 2-part, study to determine the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral
      dabrafenib in children and adolescent subjects with advanced BRAF V600 mutation-positive
      solid tumors. Part 1 (dose escalation study) will identify the recommended Part 2
      (tumor-specific expansion study) dose and regimen using a dose-escalation procedure.
      Approximately 6 to 18 subjects will participate in Part 1 and will receive a starting dose of
      3 mg/kg and dose will deescalate or escalate between 1.5 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg) and 6
      mg/kg. Up to 6 subjects will be enrolled at one dose level dependent upon the number of
      subjects at the current dose level, the number of subjects who have experienced a dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) at the current dose level, and the number of subjects enrolled but
      with data pending at the current dose level. Escalation may proceed until either a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is established, or until the dose in which the median pharmacokinetic
      parameters consistent with exposure in adults are achieved. Cohorts may be added in order to
      evaluate additional dose levels. Part 2 consists of four disease-specific cohorts of subjects
      with tumors known to have BRAF V600 activation (pediatric low-grade gliomas, pediatric
      high-grade gliomas, Langerhans cell histiocytosis [LCH], and other tumors such as melanoma
      and papillary thyroid carcinoma [PTC]). Each cohort will enroll at least 10 subjects with a
      pre-dose and at least 1 post-dose disease assessment. In both the parts of the study, on Day
      1, a single first dose will be administered, and repeat dosing will begin on Day 2. PK
      sampling will be performed on Day 1 and Day 15 for subjects &gt;=25 kg in weight. For subjects
      &lt;25 kg and &gt;=10 kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected on Day 1 and
      Day 15. For subjects &lt;10kg in weight, blood samples for PK analysis will be collected after
      repeated administration on Day 15 only. Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout
      the study. Treatment with dabrafenib will be continued until disease progression or until no
      clinical benefit or development of an unacceptable toxicity, or until they withdraw consent
      or begin a new therapy. At the end of treatment, a final study visit will occur.</summary>
