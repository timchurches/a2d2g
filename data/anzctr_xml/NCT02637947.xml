Experimental: Magnetic navigation - Catheter ablation using magnetic navigation for ventricular tachycardia via remote magnetic navigation of a NaviStar RMT ThermoCool catheter, or other magnetically compatible catheter, via Stereotaxis's Niobe ES system.

Active Comparator: Manual navigation - Catheter ablation using manual navigation for ventricular tachycardia via a manually navigated Thermocool catheter, or equivalent catheter.


Treatment: devices: catheter ablation using magnetic navigation
elimination of cardiac arrhythmias through heating and destroying heart tissue with faulty electrical pathways through the use of Stereotaxis's Niobe ES System with the NaviStar RMT ThermoCool catheter or other magnetically compatible catheters.
