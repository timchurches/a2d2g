  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this Observational Study is long term follow-up of the Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus -1 (HIV-1) infected patients who have received a gene therapy product (anti-HIV-1
      Ribozyme [OZ1]) as part of an earlier phase 2 trial. Patients are seen twice yearly until 5
      years from initial infusion of study drug has elapsed and then yearly until withdrawal or
      study completion. The study will monitor for and record any ill effects from the gene therapy
      product to provide long term safety information.</summary>
