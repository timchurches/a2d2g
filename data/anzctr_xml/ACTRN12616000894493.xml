  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of ixazomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (ITD) for the treatment of multiple myeloma which has progressed despite one to three lines of previous therapy.

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to enroll in this trial if you are aged 18 or over, and have been diagnosed with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma for which 1-3 prior therapies have been administered.

Study details
All participants enrolled in this trial will receive ITD therapy, which involves taking a specific regime of oral tablets across four 28-day cycles. Participants will be assessed for adverse events and progression and survival outcomes until all patients remaining on study have been followed up for at least 12 months. .

It is hoped that the findings of this study will provide information on whether the addition of ixazomib to thalidomide and dexamethason (TD) therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

Individual patients will remain on study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal, whichever occurs first.</summary>
