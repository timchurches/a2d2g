  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a trial of amisulpride in the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder over a 24-week period. Atypical antipsychotic medications, such as amisulpride, are being used more and more to treat the debilitating effects of psychotic symptoms. The trial will be conducted over a 24-week period. It is expected that 40 patients will be recruited to this project. During the 24 weeks, parameters such as tolerability and safety will be assessed using a number of well validated Extra-Pyramidal Side Effects scales in addition to regular monitoring of vital signs, lab, and ECG results. Efficacy assessments will include the PANSS, CGI scales and an appropriate quality of life scale. Patients will also be administered a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline and 24 weeks to assess and monitor change in cognitive function. Data will be processed using standard statistical techniques.</summary>
