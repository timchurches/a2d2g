  <interventions>
    <interventions>One intervention was developed for the purpose of the study. This comprised a self-help workbook entitled Women Moving On: A workbook~journal for women moving forward after treatment for breast cancer. Self-management interventions have recently become a research focus, as they offer the benefits of being used in patients' own time, they overcome geographical barriers to attending psychological therapy, and are cost effective. 

The interactive workbook developed for this study provides information, suggestions and worksheets, a relaxation/meditation tape, survivors stories, and opportunities for journal writing.  The resource was based on themes derived from a series of focus-groups with breast cancer survivors (Oxlad et al., in press). The workbook was based on cognitive-behavioural strategies and emotional-expression, and encouraged women to actively process and engage in issues of relevance to them.  It contained sections on (i) maintaining the medical partnership, (ii) physical well-being, (iii) feeling alone, (iv) family and friends, (v) emotional recovery, (vi) spirituality, (vii) seeking closure, (viii) moving forward, (ix) living the life you want, and (x) local and national resources. Some of the themes for the workbook were suggested by a previously evaluated American workbook (Angell et al., 2003).
 
Participants were encouraged to read sections of the workbook over the course of 3 months. Participants in the treatment condition were contacted after 4- and 8-weeks in order to receive qualitative feedback about the workbook.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group received treatment as usual (TAU). At the end of the 6-month study period, participants in the control group received a copy of the workbook.</comparator>

    <concealment>All patients treated sequentially at one medical institution were offered the intervention by a clinical trials nurse after their active treatment was completed. Those who consented to participate were randomly allocated via a randomisation computer program to either the intervention, or to treatment as usual (TAU) by the clinical trials nurse. The randomisation schedule involved contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who was at the central administration (hospital) site. Therefore allocation was concealed.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Overall there were two aims of the current study. First, to assess the efficacy of a self-help workbook journal compared with treatment as usual, in attempting to improve coping, quality of life and psychological distress for breast cancer survivors. Second, to qualitatively examine how well the workbook was received. This was the first time a self-management intervention of this type was implemented in an Australian context.</summary>
