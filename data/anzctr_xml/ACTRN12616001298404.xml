  <interventions>
    <interventions>The CMAC D blade   and Glidescope are essentially meant for difficult intubations. In this present study we are comparing these two laryngoscopes in managing the difficult intubations. The limited extension of the neck will be simulated in patients with normal arirway anatomy, using manual in line axial stabilisation (MIAS) manouvre. CMAC D Blade is specially designed blade recommended by the manufacturer in managing the difficult airways. In this study we are testing the efficacy of CMAC D blade against Glidescope. MIAS is applied by an assistant ,standing beside the patient in front of the laryngoscopist with hands placed on the sides of the patients head and forearms resting on the patients chest. laryngoscopy will be done by single experienced anesthetist of consultant grade. Failure to intubate is defined as time taken to intubation exceeding more than 120 seconds or more than three unsuccessful attempts. The laryngoscopist grade the Intubation difficulty as per the Intubation Difficulty Scale Score (IDS). As per IDS score 0 score will be no difficulty and infinite score is impossible to intubate.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator is Glidescope  . Its essentially indirect videolaryngoscope and  specially meant for difficult airway management. MIAS manouvre will be employed in this group also</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>he CMAC D blades   and Glidescope are essentially meant for difficult intubations. In this present study we are comparing these two laryngoscopes in managing the difficult intubations. In C-spine injury scenarios, the standard positioning and intubation technique for direct laryngoscopy cannot be employed in order to minimize the cervical spine injury.In our study we are simulating a restricted neck movement using the application of manual in line axial stabilization [MIAS] maneuver in patients who are not having difficult air way predictors and no C-spine injuries, requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation for their contemplated surgical procedures.In this study we will try to simulate a scenario which we normally come across in trauma patients with C-spine involvement. .In this study we are comparing the efficacy of CMAC D blade against Glidescope </summary>
