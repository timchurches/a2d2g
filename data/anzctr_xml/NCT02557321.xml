  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is an international multicenter, open-label, sequential phase study of intralesional
      (IL) PV-10 in combination with immune checkpoint inhibition. Stage IV metastatic melanoma
      patients with at least one injectable cutaneous or subcutaneous lesion who are candidates for
      pembrolizumab will be eligible for study participation. In the Phase 1b portion of the study,
      all participants will receive the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab (i.e., PV-10 +
      standard of care). In the subsequent Phase 2 portion of the study participants will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either the combination of IL PV-10 and pembrolizumab or
      pembrolizumab alone (i.e., PV-10 + standard of care vs. standard of care).</summary>
