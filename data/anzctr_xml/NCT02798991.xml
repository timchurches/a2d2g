  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      gastrointestinal (GI) transit time and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers of repeat oral doses
      of GSK3179106 administered for 14 days in normal healthy subjects. It is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending cohort study. A total of 48 subjects will be
      randomized (8 subjects/cohort) with 3:1 allocation to GSK3179106 or matching placebo.</summary>
