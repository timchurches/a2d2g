  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be given the following premedication. The night before chemo (at least 12 hours prior to carboplatin): Dexamethasone 20mg orally, Loratadine 10mg orally and Ranitidine 150mg orally.  
Morning of chemo (at least 2 hours prior to carboplatin):Dexamethasone 20mg orally, loratadine 10mg orally
In chemo suite (at least 30 mins prior to carboplatin): Dexamethasone 20mg intravenously, ranitidine 50mg intravenously, ondansetron 8mg intravenously (unless contraindicated)
Patients will be asked about adherence with the premedications on the patient questionnaire completed prior to all chemotherapy.  All patients will be given the same premedication regime prior to all chemotherapy sessions. 
		</interventions>
    <comparator>Outcomes will be compared with historical data from The Royal Women's Hospital Patients who received chemotherapy during 2010 and 2011.  These patients received the following premedication on the morning of chemotherapy (at least 2 hours prior to carboplatin);

For carboplatin and paclitaxel regimen: Dexamethasone 20mg intravenously, loratadine 10mg orally, ranitidine 50mg intravenously, ondansetron 8mg intravenously (unless contraindicated)

For all other carboplatin containing regimens: dexamethasone 8mg intravenously, ondansetron 8mg intravenously (unless contraindicated)</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To document the incidence of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) in a population of patients receiving the defined premedication with second (or subsequent) line carboplatin for gynaecological malignancy. HSR will be documented using a HSR form where the investigator documents any symptoms occuring during or immediately after the carboplatin infusion and the patient records any symptoms occuring after discharge from the chemotherapy suite in a diary. </outcome>
      <timepoint>HSR symptoms will be recorded at the following time points for each cycle of chemotherapy with carboplatin:
1)Symptoms of acute HSR (i.e. HSR occurring during or immediately after carboplatin infusion) 
2)Symptoms of delayed HSR (i.e. those occurring after discharge from chemotherapy suite) </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the incidence of carboplatin HSR in patients receiving routine premedication with a defined historical control. This will be meausred using clincial assessment
</outcome>
      <timepoint>HSR symptoms will be collected by the Investigator and the patient using a diary during each cycle of chemotherapy and 28 days after chemotherapy with carboplatin.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To describe the nature and severity of carboplatin HSR symptoms (by CTC v4.0 classification) occuring in patients receiving the defined premedication</outcome>
      <timepoint>HSR symptoms will be collected by the Investigator and the patient using a diary during each cycle of chemotherapy and 28 days after chemotherapy with carboplatin.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To generate exploratory data on the relationship between clinical parameters (number of carboplatin cycles, co-administered chemotherapy agents, age, etc) and the incidence of carboplatin HSR, in order to make recommendation regarding stratification factors to be utilised in the randomised phase 2 eveluation of the premedication regimen (should this pilot justify progression to the second stage of evaluation).  This will be measured using clincal assessment</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study is evaluating whether premedication can prevent or delay the onset of carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions in women win gynaecological malignancy. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with a gynaecological malignancy, for which you will be commencing a carboplatin containing chemotherapy regime. Eligible patients will have already undergone at least one prior line of carboplatin containing therapy. Trial details All participants in this study will be given premedication with Dexamethasone, Loratadine and Ranitidine the night before chemotherapy, the morning of chemotherapy and about 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. These will be administered orally (by mouth) the night before and the morning of chemotherapy, and intravenously (directly into the vein) about 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy. All participants will be asked to complete a symptom diary, and will be clinically assessed in order to evaluate whether the study premedication can prevent or delay the onset of hypersensitivity reactions following chemotherapy with carboplatin. If it does (compared to a control group who receive their care in the past), then a subsequent larger randomised trial will be developed. </summary>
