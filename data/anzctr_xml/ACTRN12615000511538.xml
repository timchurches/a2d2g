  <interventions>
    <interventions>Drug: CTP-730
Drug: Placebo for CTP-730

Part 1: Four (4) dose/formulation combinations in total will be studied, with the first 3 formulations studied in a 3-period randomized, double-blind crossover fashion and the 4th formulation (a composite formulation, determined based on outcomes from the crossover) will not be randomized. 40mg will be administered once a day for Part 1.

Part 1 subjects will receive a single dose of CTP-730 in the morning following an overnight fast. Subjects will remain sequestered at the site until the last PK blood sample is collected at 48 hours post dose.

Part 2: A multi-dose exploration of the composite formulation of CTP-730 selected from Part 1, for 7-days. Up to 80mg will be administered once a day for 7 days.

The dose to be administered in Part 2 will be determined based on information obtained from Part 1 of the study. A single dose of the composite formulation will be administered daily for a total of 7 days.

Drug will be in the form of oral capsules.

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be taken to monitor adherence to the intervention.

There is a 7 day washout period between each period in Part 1.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo - Lactose Monohydrate

Placebo capsules will be administered in Part 2 of the study only. Part 2 will be conducted under a placebo controlled, randomized, double-blind design. A total of 10 subjects will be selected for Part 2 of the study where 8 subjects will be randomized to receive active treatment and 2 to placebo.</comparator>
