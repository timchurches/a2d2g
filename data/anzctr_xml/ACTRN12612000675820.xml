  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sixteen low-mid decile primary schools with minimum rolls of 150 in Dunedin (n=8) and Waitakere (n=8) cities will be randomly assigned to control and intervention conditions. The study processes in both study centres will closely mirror each other.

After an initial baseline assessment of all playgrounds carried out by a certified playworker, a series of meetings will be held with each intervention school (parents, Board of Trustees, teachers, and pupils) to decide what changes to play facilities and the play environment would be advantageous. Cost, potential popularity, existing structures, age restrictions, safety and space requirements, and availability will be taken into consideration. Once each school has decided what playground redevelopment they would like to have, the research team will assist the school wherever possible with obtaining additional funds. The development of the playground action plans and installation of new equipment/rules will take at least 12 months.
 
Anthropometry, physical activity (accelerometry), bullying and diet will be measured in 50 Year 2 (6-7 years) and Year 4 (8-9 years) children from each of the 16 schools at baseline, and at 12 months and 24 months. The wider school environment (policies, procedures) as it pertains to physical activity will also be evaluated at each time point.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control schools will carry on as usual and have been asked to make no changes to playground, physical activity or rules around play behaviour. Children in the control schools will be measured at the same time as the children in the matched intervention school at each time point.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Physical activity in terms of number of steps per day, and minutes of Moderate to Vigorous Activity (MVPA) at various times of the day. Measured using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers.</outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Excessive weight gain in terms of body mass index (BMI) z-score and waist circumference. BMI will be calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in metres squared. BMI will then be converted to z-scores using age- and sex-specific CDC reference data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Perceived bullying assessed using a peer-relations package (PRAQ-R) for use with students, parents and teachers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Forms of play that best promote activity. Assessed using the same playworker's evaluations of each school's play area and rating it according to a set schedule resulting an overall score for the whole school play environment. Additional assessment of this secondary outcome via small group interviews with students at the school. Both will be used in conjunction with accelerometery data.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nutrition assessed by a modified version of the Children's Dietary Questionnaire administered to parents.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 months and 24 months.</timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Selection of schools: Primary schools are the sampling unit and must be decile 1-6 (i.e. low-mid SES) based on 2008 New Zealand Ministry of Education decile ratings with a minimum roll of 150 in Dunedin (n=8) and Waitakere (n=8). A school will need to agree to participate before being randomly assigned to control or intervention conditions.

Selection of children: Each school will be asked to choose two Year 2 and two Year 4 classes. All of the children in these two classes will be invited to participate in the measurements (to obtain approximately 50 children per school). Consenting children will be measured at all 3 timepoints over the 24 month period.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Current school-based obesity prevention initiatives are often reliant on the expertise and enthusiasm of individuals. Given intensive curriculum demands, improving the number/quality of play facilities in schools may offer an innovative, cost-effective, long-term solution for increasing physical activity and improving body weight in children that may be more effective at reducing health inequalities. Sixteen low-mid decile schools in Waitakere and Dunedin cities will be randomised to control or intervention. Researchers will work with intervention schools to decide what changes to play facilities and attitudes to physical activity are required and assist in facilitating them. Anthropometry, physical activity (accelerometry), bullying and diet will be measured in 50 Year 2 (6-7 years) and Year 4 (8-9 years) children from each of the 16 schools at baseline, 12 months and 24 months. The wider school environment (policies, procedures) as it pertains to physical activity will also be evaluated.</summary>
