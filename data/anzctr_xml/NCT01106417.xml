    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of NeoFuse in
      subjects with a diagnosis of degenerative disc disease (DDD) at 2 or more adjacent cervical
      vertebral levels between C3-C4 to C7-T1. All subjects in this study will undergo 2 or 3 level
      anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with Anterior Cervical Plate Fixation.</summary>
