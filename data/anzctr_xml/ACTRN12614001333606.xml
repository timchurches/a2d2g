    <studytitle>A Study to Evaluate the Safety/Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of AD-6626 in Normal, Healthy Volunteers and Subjects Heterozygous for the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2*1/*2 Genetic Variant With and Without Alcohol Administration</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A Single-Center, 2-Part, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled, Single-Dose, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety/Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of a Single Dose of AD-6626 Administered Intravenously to Normal, Healthy Volunteers (NHVs) Without Alcohol Administration in Part A and to NHVs and Subjects Heterozygous for the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2*1/*2 Genetic Variant With Alcohol Administration in Part B</scientifictitle>

  <conditions>
    <healthcondition>This study is for healthy volunteers.  The intended use of  the investigational product is the treatment of acute alcohol intoxication</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Part A consists of sequential dose escalation with approximately 3 cohorts of subjects (8 subjects per cohort) given an intravenous dose of AD-6626 or placebo and 12 additional subjects given the dose of AD-6626 below the MTD.   The doses of AD-6626 are 100mg, 300mg and 750mg.
Part B consists of single intravenous administration of AD-6626 or placebo following oral EtOH administration in NHVs or subjects with the ALDH2*1/*2 (HeZ) genotype. The dose of AD-6626 will be determined from Part A of the study.  The oral EtOH dose will be 0.75 gm/kg or 0.5 gm/kg.  The AD-6626 will be given 10 minutes after the oral dose of EtOH.  Part B will include a cohort of NHVs from Part A who will receive either AD-6626 or placebo according to their Part A treatment assignments. </interventions>
