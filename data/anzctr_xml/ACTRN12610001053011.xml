  <interventions>
    <interventions>Surgery for intermittent exotropia, Bilateral lateral recti recession or recession/ resection. the recession of the lateral recti muscle involves weakening the muscle by pulling it back few mm [ each mm will weaken the muscle by 3 diopters] so the amount will depend on the degree of divergent squint. e.g to correct 30 diopters of divergent squint will need to weaken each lateral recti muscle by 5 mm on each side so in total 10 mm = 30 Diopters.
for the medial rectus resection means strengthening the muscle by cutting it { each mm will strengthen the muscle by 4 mm] and that is again depend on the amount of squint.
the duration of each procedure will be approximately 20 min / muscle.</interventions>
    <comparator>Active control, lateral recti recession procedure is the standard procedure for the intermittent divegernt squint. however some advocate recession/ resection procedure. so the aim is to compare the outcome of both techniques.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Comparison between two techniques for intermittent exotropia.,{Bilateral lateral recti reccession or medial/ lateral rectus recession/ resection regarding the success rate. and this is measured by diopter [ the surgery considered successful  if the residul squint is less than 10 Diopters</outcome>
      <timepoint>At 2 years after randomization</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Does the patch test alter the distance measurements and therefore the surgical target the effect of patch test.
we patch the involved eye for 20, 40 ,60 min at different intervals and do measure amount of squint in diopters</outcome>

    <sequence>The patients with intermittent divergent squint who need surgery will be randomized [via computerized sequence generation ] into 2 groups : group one will have bilateral ( both right and left eye) lateral rect recession. group 2 will have lateral  rectus recession and medial rectus resection on the same eye.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>the aim of this study is :
1.	To compare BLR recession and recess/resect for basic (N=D angle) intermittent exotropia
2.	To compare BLR  recession and recess/resect for and simulated divergence (N=D with +3s)
3.	To assess 20, 40, 60 mins patch tests to determine whether these are equivalent.
4.	Does the patch test alter the distance measurements and therefore the surgical target</summary>
