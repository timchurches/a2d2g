  <interventions>
    <interventions>Low-low beds are beds that are able to be lowered very close to the ground.  Regular hospital beds cannot lower as close to the ground as low-low beds. Being nursed in a low-low bed makes it more difficult for people with delirium and gait instability to put themselves at risk of falling without resorting to using physical restraints.  The model of low-low beds being used is the commercially available Huntleigh Healthcare "Sorrento" model.  The intervention wards will be observed without any low-low beds for 6 months, then they will have the low-low beds for a period of 6 months. The intervention wards will receive 1 low-low bed for every 12 regular beds they have on a ward.</interventions>
    <comparator>Hosptial wards targeted will not have any low-low beds at project outset.  The intervention group wards will receive 1 low-low bed for every 12 regular beds they have. The control group wards will not receive any low-low beds until the cessation of the trial follow-up period.  The control wards will be observed without low-low beds for a period of 12 months. Both groups of wards will otherwise continue to provide standard hospital care.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Accidental falls and injuries arising from falls as recorded on hospital incident reporting systems</outcome>
      <timepoint>Accidental falls accrued over a 6 month period will be collect prior to study commencement to generate a control phase for both groups of wards.  The intervention wards will then receive their beds during a 1 month period.  Falls will then be monitored for a further 6 month period on both intervention and control group wards.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Falls resulting in injury are different to the primary outcome (all falls) because of the rating of the severity of the outcome of the fall by the staff member documenting the fall. Approximately 30% of all falls (primary outcome) are anticipated to result in injury (secondary outcome)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Falls resulting in injury accrued over a 6 month period will be collected prior to study commencement to generate a control phase for both groups of wards.  The intervention wards will then receive their beds during a 1 month period.  Falls resulting in injury will then be monitored for a further 6 month period on both intervention and control group wards.</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>An expression of interest will be e-mailed to all patient safety officers in Queensland.  Patient safety officers in conjunction with ward unit managers will then provide gatekeeper consent for their ward (meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria) to participate.  These wards will be the "clusters" that are the units of randomisation.  Individual patients will not be directly approached to participate in this trial. Allocation will be conducted by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who will be off-site.</concealment>
    <sequence>Each ward of the 18 recruited wards will be matched on the basis of their recorded falls rates. A computer generated random number sequence will then by used separate one ward from each pair into either the intervention or control group.  One investigator will arrange the ward pairs such that one ward is listed first and the other second.  Another investigator (blinded to ward pairs and sequencing) and who is off site will develop the random number sequence and tell the first investigator which of the wards (the first or second listed ward) has been allocated to the intervention group on the basis of the next random number.</sequence>
