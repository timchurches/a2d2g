  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: surgery - Hyperbaric Oxygenation

Experimental: Hyperbaric oxygenation - Subjects in the HBO treatment group will receive a course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) in addition to normal trauma and general care. A total of 12 HBO sessions will be delivered over approximately 8 days. HBO treatment will be provided at 2.4 atmospheres absolute (ATA) pressure for approximately 90 minutes of oxygen therapy. Treatments should be twice daily for the first three days. Minor variability will be allowed with respect to timing and profile of each session.

No Intervention: No hyperbaric oxygenation - Patients randomised to this group will receive standard trauma care.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Study hypothesis :Hyperbaric Oxygen may prevent complications and improve outcomes in severe
      lower limb trauma. We propose to investigate this hypothesis by conducting an International
      multi centre randomised control trial of standard trauma/orthopaedic care with or without a
      concurrent course of hyperbaric oxygen treatments.</summary>
