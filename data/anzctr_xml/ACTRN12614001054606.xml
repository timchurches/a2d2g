  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two-arm study. Both Arm 1 and Arm 2 will be receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The ADT used is a combined androgen blockade with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (45mg EligardTrademark) and AR antagonist (50mg Cosudex/bicalutamide) for the first 4 weeks as per standard of care. After that, EligardTrademark will continue as monotherapy 6 monthly unless clinically indicated for complete androgen blockade. At 12 weeks into ADT, participants will receive 1500mg metformin (3x500mg daily, with meals) or placebo depending on the treatment arm allocated after randomization.

Metformin or Placebo tablets will be dispensed every 12 weeks. Participants will need to return the unused tablets to the research team before or after each dispensing for drug accountability purpose. Moreover, participants will have 6 weekly medical review.

Arm 1
Metformin hydrochloride 500mg tablet 
Dosage: 1500mg daily
Duration: 30 weeks
Mode of administration: Oral

</interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2 
Placebo
Duration: 30 weeks
Mode of administration: Oral

The placebo are biconvex, film coated tablets. They have everything the same as the Metformin tablet except without active ingredient. </comparator>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Molecular changes to the circulating tumour cells.  
Circulating tumour cells will be isolated using Stemcell Technology RosetteSep.  The isolated cells will be lysed. The chages will be assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the effects of combining metformin with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with metastatic prostate cancer.

You may be eligible to join this study if you are male, aged 18 years or above and have been diagnosed with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, for which you have not received any ADT.

Study details
Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will take 3 x 500mg oral tablets of metformin hydrochloride daily for 30 weeks, whilst participants in the other group will take 3 oral tablets of placebo (inactive treatment) daily for 30 weeks. 
Participants will be followed-up every 6 weeks for 54 weeks, in order to determine metabolic and tumour responses and tumour progression.
