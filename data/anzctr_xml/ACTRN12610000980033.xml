  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Communication and swallowing difficulties are a common sequelae for people who have suffered a stroke. These difficulties can affect interpersonal relationships, self image and community reintegration. This project is designed to evaluate the effect of a treatment program on the speech,
swallowing and quality of life of stroke survivors when delivered by a therapy assistant in a home based setting.
The intensive treatment program will include education, behavioural intervention and oral motor rehabilitation, with functional speech or swallowing practice. It is anticipated that patients who have intensive treatment will achieve improved outcomes in swallowing status and speech intelligibility as well as self-confidence and independence. Stroke survivor details will be collected and analysed with frequency of treatment and home practice to determine any barriers to treatment delivery and ability to practice on their own.</summary>
