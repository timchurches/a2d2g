  <interventions>
    <interventions>Following enrolment, each subject will be studied on three occasions, separated by at least 7 days, in a double-blind, randomized fashion. On each study day, following correct positioning of the intraduodenal catheter, intraduodenal infusion of (i) low dose (10 mg dissolved in 250 mL water) or (ii) high dose (30 mg dissolved in 250 mL water) of denatonium benzoate or (iii) control (250 mL water only) will be commenced, with 100 mL infused during t = Â­-60 to 0 min, and the remaining 150 mL infused over the next 90 min (t = 0 to 90 min). All doses are administered at study site by staff. During the latter period (t = 0 to 90 min), ID glucose will be infused at 2 kcal/min. At the end of infusions, a cold buffet meal will be given for evaluation of energy intake (t = 90-120 min). </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The small intestine is the key interface between ingested food and the human body, particularly given its capacity to sense the presence of nutrients in much the same way as the tongue, through activation of similar taste receptors. This taste perception can influence nutrient uptake, as well as the release of gut hormones and neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal motility, energy intake and blood glucose homeostasis. The purpose of the study is to provide proof of concept that intestinal bitter taste sensing has a favourable effect on metabolic control.

Specifically, the study will evaluate the hypothesis that activation of intestinal bitter taste receptors (by intraduodenal administration of a bitter chemical, denatonium benzoate) augments secretion of gut hormones, thereby increasing insulin, suppressing glucagon and ghrelin, and modulating antropyloroduodenal motility (to slow gastric emptying), with a consequent reduction of the blood glucose response to small intestinal glucose infusion and potentiation of the reduction in energy intake in healthy human participants.</summary>
