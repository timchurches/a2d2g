  <interventions>
    <interventions>The Relative Dose Response (RDR) test will be performed to assess vitamin A status. The test involves collection of blood samples of 0.5 mL each, before and five hours after a dose of vitamin A [Vitamin A Nepalm (Registered Trademark)] (Dose: 2000 IU/kg body weight) orally in a liquid solution form. In addition to the blood samples, samples of saliva will be collected using a proprietary swab specifically designed for newborn infants [Saliva Bio Infants's Swab; Salimetrics (Registered Trademark) USA]. An additional saliva sample will be collected at seven hours, as appearance of vitamin A in saliva may lag behind its appearance in blood. Collection of saliva is a painless procedure with no expected harm to the infant. Vitamin A levels will be measured in blood and saliva samples with high performance liquid chromatography which is a standard method of vitamin A measurement. </interventions>
    <comparator>All the study infants will receive one dose of vitamin A [Vitamin A Nepalm (Registered Trademark)] (2000 IU/kg weight of infant) orally, required for application of Relative Dose Response (RDR) test. The standard method of diagnosis (RDR) involves measurement of vitamin A in plasma just before and five hours after a dose of vitamin A. The comparison will be made between the plasma levels and saliva levels of vitamin A before and after the dose.</comparator>

      <outcome>Safety of vitamin A dose: All the infants will be monitored for possible adverse effect of vitamin A administration for 24 hours. 
1. Palpation of anterior fontanel (AF) for raised intracranial pressure at 24 hour: AF is palpated with infant in a quite state and held in the sitting position. Normal AF is flat, flushed with the skin and soft. (Cloherty, Manual of Neonatal care 7th Ed) A tense and bulging AF may indicate vitamin A adverse effect. The infants with tense and bulging AF with no known cause will have cranial ultrasound examination. 
2. Liver size palpation for hepatomegaly at 24 hours: Liver will be palpated and recorded in cm below costal margin in the mid-clavicular line. Liver function tests will be performed if hepatomegaly is observed. 
3. Skin changes: Infant will be examined at 24 hours for skin changes like desquamation of skin particularly palm and sole, mouth or lip fissures.

    <concealment>This is a diagnostic accuracy study. 30 eligible preterm infants will be enrolled. Relative dose response (RDR) test will be carried out using blood samples (Standard method of assessment of vitamin A status) to assess vitamin A status of the infants. RDR involves measurement of plasma (blood) vitamin A level before and five hours after vitamin A dose. We will collect saliva in addition to the blood samples to investigate if saliva levels of vitamin A correlate with blood levels. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation: Sample size calculation of 30 infants is based on a study by Saral et al (Saral Y, Coskun BK, Ozturk P, et. al. Assessment of salivary and serum antioxidant vitamins and lipid peroxidation in patients with recurrent aphthous ulceration. Tohoku J Exp Med. 2005;206:305-312) who observed a good correlation between plasma and salivary vitamin A using a sample size of 30. 
The data will be statistically analyzed using SPSS statistical package (SPS, version 9.0, Chicago, IL, USA).  Correlation between plasma and salivary vitamin A levels, and blood and saliva RDR values will be tested using Pearson r correlation analysis.  Statistical significance will be defined as p &lt; 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Vitamin A is essential for development and growth of lungs in preterm infants. Diseases characterised by abnormal lung development such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) may be linked to vitamin A deficiency. BPD is associated with long term breathing and developmental problems. 
Very preterm infants are at risk of vitamin A deficiency. Timely evaluation of vitamin A status of preterm infants may help to assess the risk of BPD and tailor vitamin A therapy based on the infants vitamin A status.  Current method of assessment of vitamin A is Relative Dose Response (RDR). RDR test involves collection of two blood samples from the infant, one before and one after a dose of vitamin A. Thus, the requirement of repeated blood sampling, which is an invasive procedure and also increases risk of anaemia, is a major disadvantage of current RDR test. Therefore, a minimally invasive method with least harm is required. 
Aim: 1) To compare salivary vitamin A with blood vitamin A, and RDR using saliva with RDR using blood; 2) Assess safety of the test
Participant group: Participants will be preterm infants admitted in King Edward Memorial Hospital, less than 30 weeks gestational age at birth and 21 to 28 days of life, and tolerating milk feeds. 
Project design and Methods: An informed consent will be obtained from the parents of the eligible infants. RDR test will be performed. The test involves collection of blood samples of 0.5 mL each, before and five hours after a dose of vitamin A (2000 IU/kg body weight). Along with the blood samples, samples of saliva will also be collected using   proprietary swab specifically designed for infants. An additional saliva sample will be collected at seven hours, as appearance of vitamin A in saliva may lag behind its appearance in blood. Collection of saliva is a painless procedure with no expected harm to the infant. Vitamin A levels will be measured in blood and saliva samples with high performance liquid chromatography which is a standard method of vitamin A measurement. All the study infants will be monitored for 24 hours for adverse effect of vitamin A.
Expected outcomes: A study in adults showed a good correlation between salivary and blood vitamin A in adults. We expect that salivary vitamin A level will correlate with blood vitamin A in preterm infants and will be useful to assess vitamin A status of preterm infant
