  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete self-administered questionnaires for the severity of symptoms, quality of life and medication use during the 2-week run-in period. After randomisation at the first visit to the clinic laboratory during the treatment period, the registered acupuncturist will provide detailed instructions to each participant in a 15-minute session on a one-on-one basis. Each participant will also receive an information sheet ("Location of 5 Acupoints for Self-administered Acupressure") showing the details of the location of acupuncture points and administration. 

Participants in specific acupressure group will perform self-administered acupressure to five specific acupuncture points bilaterally, including Hegu (LI 4), Shangxing (GV 23), Zanzhu (BL 2), Yingxiang (LI 20) and Fengchi (GB 20). Participants will apply pressure to each acupuncture point for one minute, twice a day for four consecutive weeks. Participants will be asked to have a 10-minute one-on-one weekly visit for the four-week intervention period. The same acupuncturist will reinforce the participants' self-administered acupressure skills in every visit during the treatment period and ensure their techniques are correct.</interventions>
