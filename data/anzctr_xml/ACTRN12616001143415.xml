  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will be asked to perform 2 separate bouts of aerobic treadmill walking exercise, around 1 to 2 weeks apart, in order to assess exercise induced  analgesia/hyperalgesia. The exercise will be supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist or a registered physiotherapist. The duration of the exercise will be 10 to 25 min, depending on the fitness and walking capacity of the participant. The two sessions of treadmill walking will be performed at different intensities, one at low intensity (Rating of Perceived exertion (RPE) 9-10 out of 20  light exercise) and one at a higher intensity (RPE 12-13 out of 20  moderate exercise). The order of the walking intensity will be randomised using a computer-generated table.
Participants with PD will be asked to wear an activity and sleep monitoring device on their wrist and their waist for 7 consecutive days between the two treadmill walking sessions. </interventions>
    <comparator>The exercise-induced analgesia/hyperalgesia response of the participant's with Parkinson's disease at the two different walking intensities will be compared to that of age and gender-matched participants without Parkinson's disease and pain.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed project aims to investigate: 1) if aerobic exercise in the form of treadmill walking acutely relieves pain through exercise-induced analgesia (EIA); 2) if any EIA varies with the dose of exercise; and 3) the relationships between measures of pain and EIA with physical activity levels, sleep and mood in people with PD. 
We hypothesize that people with Parkinson's disease will have the usual exercise-induced analgesia response to exercise, and that this response will be stronger with a higher dose of exercise. We hypothesize that increased physical activity, better sleep and better mood will be associated with a better exercise-induced analgesia response and with less pain in people with Parkinson's disease.</summary>
