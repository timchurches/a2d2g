  <interventions>
    <interventions>The effect of a spinal movement program taught to children in schools and repeated daily at home. The children are taught 4 simple spinal exercises that are completed in standing and take approximately 2 minutes. Additionally the children are given information about back care. The children are taught the exercises in school on day 0 of the study. Baseline data about previous and current low back pian episodes are collected from children at day 0.  The children subsequently receive 6 school visits each lasting 15 minutes over the following 10 months. The exercises are reviewed at each visit to encourage the children to do the exercises in a standardised way. They are encouraged to repeat them daily at home preferably while cleaning their teeth. Following each visit (within 10 days of the visit), the children complete an on-line survey to report low back pain episodes and exercise adherence.</interventions>
    <comparator>No exercise (standard back information).  The interventions in the control group are the same in every way to the intervention group except that children are not taught the spinal exercise program. 
The control group receive an initial visit at day 0 to obtain baseline data and additionally the children are given information about back care.  The children receive 6 school visits over the following 10 months where the back information is reviewed. Following each visit (within 10 days of the visit), the children complete an on-line survey to monitor any low back pain episodes.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Episode of low back pain.
Low back pain is defined as activity limiting pain lasting more than one day in the area on the posterior aspect of the body from the bottom of the 12th rib to the lower gluteal folds.  A diagram will be supplied to all participants showing this specific area.
Participants are monitored for any low back pain in the previous week in the area defined,  plus one or more of the following
1. Pain lasting more than one day 2.Required the participant to stay off school. 3.Required the participant to stop school sports. 4.	Required a visit to a doctor or other medical person,  (physiotherapist,  nurse /chiropractor /osteopath/other)

Survey:
The participants are asked the following questions at each  of the 6 surveys following commencement of the intervention:

1. Have you had back pain in the area shaded in the picture in the LAST WEEK?

2. How many days did it last?  1   2  3  4  5  6  7  more than 7


3. Did you stay off school because of this back pain?   

4. Did you stop school sports because of this back pain?

5. Did you see a health professional such as a doctor, physiotherapist, nurse, chiropractor, or osteopath because of this back pain?
                                                                                                
6 Did  you do the MYSPINE EXERCISES this week?
Every day. Every second day. 	About twice. About once. Not at all

7. The reasons I sometimes did not do my exercises:  
Sickness/injury. Forgot. Can't remember how to do the movements. Find the movements uncomfortable. Too busy</outcome>
      <timepoint>Back pain data is collected at day 7, day 21, day 49, day 105, day 161 and day 270</timepoint>

    <concealment>Several schools were chosen from a database of primary schools in the North Shore region, Auckland North, New Zealand. They were chosen from a convenient geographical area. Randomisation was undertaken using computer generated random number tables. Each participating school was allocated a number. Schools were randomly assigned by a blinded researcher into Group 1 (no intervention control) or Group 2 (spinal movement group).</concealment>
    <sequence>Schools were randomised by an off site researcher. A list of deidentified schools and the numbers in each group were randomised by an off site researcher after stratification for student numbers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children report episodes of low back pain as young as 9/10 years old. There are no confirmed risk factors for low back pain in children. However, we know that the most important predictor of an episode of low back pain is a history of low back pain. We have compelling evidence that exercise is helpful in reducing recurrence for adults with a history of low back pain. We wish to test the hypothesis that if we regularly perform controlled spinal movements and increase attention to and awareness of the low back we can reduce the chances of future low back pain. This study will investigate: 1.Whether a short daily routine of spinal movements reduces the prevalence of first episode low back pain in children aged 8-11years. 2.Whether children aged 8-11years can develop regular exercise habits and adhere to a brief daily exercise routine. 3.Reasons for non adherence where this occurs.</summary>
