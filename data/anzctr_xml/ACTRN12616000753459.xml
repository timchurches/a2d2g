    <interventions>MiniMed (Trademark) 670G Insulin Pump Hybrid Closed Loop System. 

This system consists on an insulin pump (Medtronic 670G), a continuous glucose monitoring system (3rd generation Enlite sensor), and an algorithm within the insulin pump that calculates background (basal) insulin delivery according to changes in the sensor glucose value. The insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor communicate wirelessly.
.The pump is small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, and is usually carried clipped to a belt. The pump is water resistant and is built to last 4 years. The hybrid closed-loop control algorithm is inbuilt into the insulin pump hardware.
The glucose sensor is the size of a 20 cent coin and clips on to the subcutaneously inserted glucose sensor. The sensor has an "inserter" and participants will be trained to insert the sensors themselves by a diabetes educator.
The insulin pump and glucose sensor transmitter communicate wirelessly, with a range of approximately 6 meters.

Participants who are randomised to the hybrid closed loop system will be trained by a diabetes nurse educator.

During the run-in phase all participants will receive education sessions on continuous glucose monitoring, and for those randomised to the hybrid closed loop system will have additional training. The following is an outline of the visit history during the run-in phase which also describes the duration and frequency of sessions, and also the post randomisation training required for those participants who go on to the intervention.

Visit 1: Screening and Consent (4 hours)

1. Confirm participant is able to take part in the study.
2. sign a consent form. 
3. Collect baseline data including height, weight and current diabetes
treatment.
4. Ask the participant to complete some questionnaires about diabetes.
5. Collect a blood sample

Visit 2: Run in and Education Planning	(2  8 hrs)
This visit is to plan individual education programs to review carbohydrate counting and teach those that dont know how to do this. 
1. Participants currently on pump therapy will see a dietician (1-2 hrs) to review carbohydrate counting and a diabetes educator to assess pump download capability and review settings 
2. Participants on injections will have between 1  3 sessions with a dietician to teach carb counting if required (which may be extended over 3 weeks if required). Participants on injections will get an individually programmed Aviva Expert glucometer to help with carbohydrate counting. Participants will not be able to continue with the rest of the study until this is learned.


Visit 3: Sensor Insertion and Training	(4 hours)
All participants will be asked to come in the Research clinic to be fitted with a blinded sensor 
1. We will teach the participant how to insert a sensor and give you a Contour Next
glucometer (to use in addition to your usual glucometer) to record
BGLs at least 4 times a day
2. We will also give a logbook and ask participants to record signs and
treatment of a hypo, time off work/school and insulin dosing (MDI
patients) 

Visits 4 and 5: Sensor Download	(30 mins each)
These visits will occur at 7 and 14 days after visit 3 to:
1. Download the sensor and glucometer data 
2. Change the sensor and transmitter
3. Check that the log book is up to date 

Visit 4 and 5 may be able to happen at the participant location.

Visit 6: Sensor Download and Randomization	(4 hours)
At this visit we will:
1. Check that sensor data is complete (if not participant will be offered a further 2 weeks of CGM collection to stay in the study)
2. Collect diabetes clinical data as in Visit 1
3. Collect logbook data
4. Participants will then be randomized to either stay on usual treatment (Control Group), or to the hybrid closed loop system (Intervention Group).


Visit 7: Entry into Study Arm	(1 hour)
The schedule for this visit will depend on randomization and baseline therapy: 

(i)	Control Group
1. Both injections and pump participants will be issued with a new
logbook


(ii)	Intervention Group
1. Injections to HCL: Participant to come in for the following visits to teach how to operate the pump, insert sensors and use the hybrid closed loop function (HCL):
Visit 7A: (4 hours) Initial Minimed 670G insulin pump training with a diabetes educator
Visit 7B: Return to the clinic within 3 days to observe insulin line change if required. We will contact participant by phone/email as often as required to see how they are managing and ask them to upload your pump every week 
Visit 7C: (2 hours) 2 weeks after starting on the pump we will ask the participant to come in to the research clinic for sensor training. This will include inserting and changing the sensor and setting alarms. We will provide the participant with a sensor user guide and enough sensors for the duration of the study
Visit 7D: (1-2 hours) This session will occur a minimum of 3 days after sensor training and will focus on learning how to initiate and operate the hybrid closed loop function. There will also be the opportunity to practice sensor change. When starting closed loop we will ask the participant to avoid excessive exercise for 48 hours. We will issue a new logbook to include documenting problems with the pump and sensors. We will continue to contact the participant by phone/email each week (or more often if required) over the next 4 weeks and ask the participant to upload the pump weekly

Pump to HCL: We will ask the participant to come in to the clinic for the following visits to teach them how to operate the pump, insert sensors and use the closed loop function:
Visit 7A: (1  4 hours) This session is to provide sensor and Minimed 670G pump training. This will include linking the sensor to the pump. We will provide them with a sensor user guide and enough sensors for the duration of the study
Visit 7B: (1  2 hours) Following 3  7 days of using the sensor collection we will ask the participant to return to the clinic to change the sensor and show them how to start closed loop. This visit will be the same as Visit 7D (see above)

Visit 8 (1 - 2 hours) face to face review (all participants), 4 weeks post randomisation 

Visits 9,10: (30 mins each). At week 11 and 12 post randomisation to collect blinded CGM

Visit 11 (approx 4 hours). Mid point of study 13 weeks post randomisation. Repeat collection of auxological data, clinic data, and psychology questionnaires

Visit 12,13, 14 (30 mins each), a week apart starting from week 23 post randomisation. To collected final blinded CGM.

Visit 15 (4 hours), final study visit to complete biomarkers, clinical, auxological and psychology measures.


The overall intervention period is 7 months (one month run in, and 6 months post randomisation).

Adherence will be monitored by a data monitoring service at the NHMRC clinical trials centre. This will be done by examining the hybrid closed loop system pump download data - which includes and adherence report. All data is intention to treat analysis, so participants will be under no pressure to continue the intervention if they wish to withdraw</interventions>

    <sequence>Randomization will be stratified based on 4 variables: Time spent in target sensor glucose range (3.9 – 10mmol/L) – with participants evenly split above and below 55% time in target range, age, diabetes duration, and centre site. 

Minimisation of variation in gender, age, diabetes duration, and centre site will be undertaken at randomization (baseline visit 2). Minimisation is a method of ensuring excellent balance between groups for known prognostic factors. It is a method of dynamic or adaptive randomization, in which the allocation of the next participant into the trial depends on the characteristics and allocation of participants already randomized. The algorithm works by minimizing the imbalance across multiple factors during each participant allocation. This will be performed using appropriate software, for example MinimPy.

    <statisticalmethods>All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and STATA version 11.2 (StataCorp). The analysis population will be the intention-to-treat population, which will be defined as all participants who are randomised and have at least 1 visit after baseline. P-values &lt;.05 will be considered statistically significant and 2-sided P-values will be reported. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize participants at study entry


The primary objective, average % time spent in target glycaemic range (sensor glucose level 3.9 - 10 mmol/l) during 6 months, will be analysed using Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline percentage score and site. Least square means and least square mean differences and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment group and between groups. In the event that data are not normally distributed the MannWhitneyWilcoxon (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum) Test will be employed which tests the medians. In addition if data are skewed, bootstrap methods will be used which allows for a non-parametric test of the arithmetic means. Bootstrap methods simply estimate the distribution of the statistic through resampling with replacement (many times) from the original data population. These methods will also be employed for average % CGM as outlined in the secondary objectives. 

Coefficient of variation will be reported for each group: bootstrap methods will be used to estimate variability as appropriate

Rates of hospitalisations for severe hypoglycaemia and moderate hypoglycaemia as per participant log will be analysed as unadjusted incidence rates based on the Poisson distribution. Incidence rates and incidence rate differences will be presented with their associated 95%confidence intervals calculated as exact Poisson confidence limits. In addition, where appropriate Poisson or negative binomial regression models will be fitted e.g. moderate hypoglycaemia events from the participant log. If there are a high proportion of zero counts, zero inflated Poisson (ZIP) or zero inflated negative binomial models (ZINB) will be considered. If counts are sparse then rates will be reported descriptively only. Number of hospitalisations due to diabetic ketoacidosis events and other safety outcomes will be tabulated and presented as n and %.

Continuous outcome measures (including psychosocial) collected at baseline and endpoint will be analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline score and site. Measures collected at baseline, 3 months and endpoint (e.g. HbA1c, Fasting blood glucose , Mean CGM glucose, Hypoglycaemic Fear Survey-II Worry scale, Child State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status and change version , Problem Areas in Diabetes, Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia: GOLD SCORE) will be analysed using mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for baseline score (where appropriate), group, period (baseline, 3 months, 6 months) and site. A random term for individual will also be employed if deemed appropriate. Least square means and least square mean differences and their associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each group and between groups. Unstructured covariance matrix will be used unless other covariance structures are more appropriate as determined by the Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Human technology interaction analysis will be reported Exploratory; descriptive analysis.

A separate economic analysis will be conducted. using measures (e.g. QALYs calculated from the EQ-5D) collected during the trial.

Performance Parameters will be reported descriptively (n, % for categorical measures and n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous measures) 

Sample Size Calculations:

Sample size is computed for a parallel design RCT with 2 groups comparing a hybrid closed-loop system with usual care in individuals with type 1 diabetes with HbA1c &lt;10.5%; with time in range 3.9  10mmol/L at 6 months as primary outcome. Sample size is computed for a paediatric study age 12-&lt;25 years old.
To estimate the total sample size, data from the JDRF CGM RCT were used..  There were N=97 12-&lt;25 years of age, who used injections or pumps at enrolment, had a baseline HbA1c value &lt;10.5%, were randomized to the control group (usual care), and had blinded CGM data at randomization and at 6 months. The confidence interval for the effective SD (after adjusting for baseline) was 15% for the younger group.
Assuming parallel groups, normal distribution for the treatment effect, a 1:1 allocation, a 2-tailed test with null hypothesis stating that the difference is zero, no corrections for multiple comparisons, and a type I error = 5%, the following total sample size is required:

To detect a 10% difference, using an SD of 13%, and 85% power, 64 subjects are required in each arm. Allowing for  20% predicted drop-out, 80 subjects will be enrolled to each arm (160 total participants).

This study is also powered to detect a difference in time spent in the hypoglycaemic range (&lt;3.9mmol/L) using the same JDRF CGM RCT data. Since time below 3.9mmol/L at 6 months is not normally distributed, its mean was estimated using a robust procedure. On the other hand, since differences in time below 3.9mmol/L from randomization to 6 months are normally distributed, the SD and the effective SD were estimated using the raw/untransformed data. 
The two point estimate and 95% CI confidence intervals for the effective SD 6% (95% CI: 5% to 7%). The estimated robust (MM estimate that down-weights outliers means for % time below 3.9mmol/L at 6 months is 5.7%.
The required total sample size (assuming parallel groups, normal distribution for the change in treatment effect, a 1:1 allocation, a 2-tailed test with null hypothesis stating that the difference is zero, no corrections for multiple comparisons, and a type I error = 5%) is:

12-&lt;25 years: 100 participants required to detect a 60% reduction in time spent &lt;3.9mmol/L (using a 6%SD and 80% power). This is less than the 160 recruitment target to demonstrate an improved time spent in range.

    <summary>BACKGROUND: Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin delivery, with automatic glucose sensing and insulin delivery reducing patient intervention, offers the potential to improve glycaemic control compared to conventional therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes. Superior glucose control has been demonstrated with lower rates of hypoglycaemia in many in-clinic studies, diabetes camp studies, hotel studies, and now in the first emerging short term outpatient studies using HCL systems. 
The primary rationale is to assess glycaemic control with the use of the HCL system versus standard therapy (either injections or standard pump therapy), including time in target range, as well as glycaemic excursions either hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia. We will explore the impact of this system on fear of hypoglycaemia and quality of life and other psychological measures. We seek to quantify the economic impact of HCL compared to standard therapy for translational purposes.

AIM: To compare the proportion of time spent in target glycaemic range (sensor glucose level 3.9 - 10 mmol/l) while using HCL or using standard therapy (MDI and CSII).

METHOD: Multi-centre randomized controlled trial in 160 patients aged 12  25 years with type 1 diabetes, comparing HCL with standard therapy (MDI or CSII) for 6 months.

OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the difference in the proportion of time the sensor glucose level is in target range (3.910 mmol/L) during HCL insulin delivery vs standard therapy (MDI and CSII), measured 23-26 weeks post-randomisation.
