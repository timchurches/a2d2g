    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Reported number of adverse events.  Adverse

    <secondaryOutcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Worsening clinical status.
Worsening clinical status will be defined by the presence of two or more of the following: (i) ? 20% deterioration in 6MWD (ii) escalation of medical therapy (increased dose of medication or
commencement of intravenous epoprostenol); (iii) deterioration (?1) in WHO functional class; (iv) development of
right heart failure (as indicated by increased jugular venous pressure, new/worsening hepatomegaly, ascites or
peripheral oedema); (v) oedema that does not respond to oral diuretics; (vi) hospitalisation for PAH; (vii) listed for
transplantation; (viii) progressive worsening of dyspnoea and exercise tolerance at rest or on exertion over the past
3-5 days; (ix) deterioration in ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2) refecting worsening gas exchange.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Throughout study period should a subject's condition worsen according to the above criteria</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resting echocardiogram ? to asses right ventricular size and function, right atrial size, pulmonary arterial systolic pressure
(PASP) and where PASP cannot be determined, pulmonary acceleration time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12 and 24 weeks</timepoint>

    <concealment>Subjects will be recruited by medical staff from the Pulmonary Hypertension Unit at Royal Perth Hospital.  Subjects will be randomly allocated to the exercise or control group following baseline assessment using a randomisation table.  Allocation will be performed by the physiotherapists supervising the exercise group, who are not involved in the assessment of the subjects.</concealment>
    <sequence>To achieve balanced groups. subjects will be stratified based on their 6MWD being &gt; or = 70% of their predicted 6MWD.  A randomisation table will be generated, one for each group.</sequence>
