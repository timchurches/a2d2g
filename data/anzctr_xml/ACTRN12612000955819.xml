  <interventions>
    <interventions>In this open trial participants will receive access to an 8 week internet-delivered education course, the UniWellbeing Course, which teaches participants how to manage symptoms of anxiety and low mood. All participants will have at least mild symptoms of anxiety or low mood (GAD-7 total score of &gt;4 or PHQ-9 total score of &gt;4).

The UniWellbeing Course comprises 5 online lessons, which describe evidence-based cognitive behavioural and interpersonal therapy strategies for managing cognitive, behavioural, and physical symptoms of anxiety and low mood. One lesson will be completed every 7 to 10 days. Each lesson will take about 15 minutes to read. Participants will also have access to summaries of each lesson, and will read anonymous stories about other people with anxiety and low mood, taking a further 20 minutes per week. All participants will also receive 10-20 automatic emails to promote adherence and engagement, and brief weekly (&lt;10minutes week) supportive telephone calls from a therapist at the Macquarie University Campus Wellbeing Service. 

Study questionnaires will be administered at application, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 2-months post-intervention. These will take about 20-30 minutes to complete.</interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from students attending the triage service at MQCW over a 2 month period from September 2012. As part of that service, students are interviewed by trained and supervised MQCW staff. Students will be assessed for risk by the MQCW staff, and those at elevated risk will be referred for immediate treatment or referral. Those who do not require urgent intervention and who report symptoms of stress, anxiety, or low mood will be informed about the aims of this study, and invited to apply. Those interested will completed Informed Consent procedures and will be given access to a computer by the MQCW staff to complete a brief, online registration process and will create a user-id for the online UniWellbeing Course. This online registration process involves completing questionnaires of symptoms of depression and anxiety, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item and Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 item questionnaires, respectively. Applicants with scores too low or too high on these questionnaires will not be eligible but will be referred to other services by MQCW staff, while eligible applicants will be asked to provide demographic details. Participants who meet eligibility criteria will be given access codes to begin the intervention.</concealment>
