  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome: incidence, severity and duration of upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal (GI) illness. Both outcomes will be measured by the use of online daily self reported illness logs. Participants will indicate the type and intensity of symptoms they experience on the log. Logs are checked weekly by the research team and participants contacted to confirm any anomalies.

The data will be analysed using SASS</outcome>

    <exclusivecriteria>All participants will be required to declare their use of dietary and/or ergogenic aids that may influence underlying immune function and/or exercise performance. All participants on immuno-modulatory medications will be excluded, including those on steroid based anti-asthma treatments. Subjects who have been on antibiotic treatments in the previous month will also be excluded. A daily illness log will be used to monitor training, health status, diet, use of supplements and other therapeutic agents. Subjects with any symptoms of gastrointestinal disease, such as Crohns disease, coelic disease and so on will also be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is increasing interest in the use of nutritional supplements to improve health and wellbeing. Probiotics are proposed to boost immunity and reduce susceptibility to infection. Common infections, such as URTI, are a significant burden on the community. There is growing body of evidence that probiotic supplementation may reduce the prevalence of URTI and GI illness in the general population.

Hypothesis: That a probiotic supplement will enhance immunity and ameliorate the heightened susceptibility to upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and gastrointestinal tract illness in active well-trained community individuals.</summary>
