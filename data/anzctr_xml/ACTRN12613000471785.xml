  <interventions>
    <interventions>Peripheral venous cannulation by an experienced anaesthetic registrar prior to admission to theatre/surgery.  This will be timed and recorded as successful or unsuccessful by the assistant.  The registrar is blinded to the intervention.  

The assistant lightly taps on the dorsum of the patient's hand, over the previously rated vein (by anaesthetic registrar) for 20 seconds.  This occurs only once prior to reassessment of the vein and cannulation by the anaesthetic registrar.</interventions>

      <outcome>The primary outcome to be evaluated will be whether or not the treatment (tapping) reduces the number of attempts to cannulate a patient undergoing elective surgery.

      <timepoint>Direct measurement of number of attempts and time taken (usually within 5 minutes)</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement of perceived ease of cannulation is rated immediately in front of the patient once the intervention (tapping/no tapping) has occured.  The vein is rated prior to cannulation and then compared to the rating after the intervention.  

This was rated using the prevalidated scale by: 

Lenhardt R, Seybold T, Kimberger O, Stoiser B, Sessler D. Local warming and insertion of peripheral venous cannulation: single blinded prospective randomised controlled trial BMJ: 2002; volume  325 pp 409

The details of the scale used:

Veins were classified as
(1) clearly visible and easily palpable
(2) veins visible and palpable 
(3) veins barely visible and palpable, 
(4) veins viable but not palpable
(5) veins neither visible or palpable
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Using the prevalidated scale above, assessment occurs before and after each intervention/no intervention (in front of the patient).</timepoint>

    <concealment>This is a prospective, randomized, single blinded study to be conducted in Day of Admissions Unit (DOSA) at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. 

Admission of patients will be as per normal DOSA procedure. Informed consent will be obtained from patients awaiting same-day elective surgery who require a venous cannula. 

Patients will be randomised into two groups, tapping (group T) and non-tapping (group NT) using pre-arranged random number generator, independent of the two study investigators.

Allocation is concealed by sealed opaque envelopes, only opened 10s prior to patient intervention by the assistant.</concealment>
    <sequence>Method used for allocation to intervention in this randomised controlled trial is simple randomisation using a computerised sequence generator.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>As no pilot study was conducted, the sample size was calculated based on previous similar studies attempting to identify differences in interventions for ease of peripheral cannulation. [previously referenced Ledhart paper] We calculated that a total of 120 subjects were required to detect a 20% difference in mean time to perform a cannulation  between the groups with a power of 0.80 and a type 1 error rate of 0.05 .
Our initial aim was to recruit 120 patients, however due to time and resource constraints, we limited our recruitment to 100 participants.


Intention to treat analysis to occur.

For the primary outcome of  successful cannulation on first attempt, a logistic regression model was used to explore the association between randomization group and whether first attempt cannulation was successful.

For the secondary outcome of time to successful cannulation a linear regression model was used.

For the secondary outcome of improvement of perceived ease of cannulation,
a Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was performed to analyse the difference between paired rankings across the two groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Peripheral intravenous cannulation is a commonly performed procedure. The insertion of an intravenous cannula is usually uncomplicated, however it can be difficult in certain patients, including hypovolemic or critically ill patients, IV drug users, patients having repeated courses of chemotherapy, and obese patients. 

Perceived ease and efficiency of cannulation is related to the experience of the cannulator. It has been shown that, when certain manoeuvres are performed, for example, warming the skin prior to insertion of a peripheral venous cannula, both the time taken for insertion and number of attempts required for cannulation are reduced. A randomised controlled trial evaluated ultrasound guided peripheral venous cannulation in patients with a history of difficult intravenous cannulation, however it found no significant difference between the two groups in time to successful cannulation, number of attempts or number of subjects in whom IV cannulation was successful on the first attempt. 

It is common practice for health professionals to tap a vein, prior to cannulation, on the assumption that it will improve the perceived ease of cannulation and therefore the likelihood of successful cannulation. This assumption is based on anecdotal evidence and a rigorous investigation of the effect of tapping of the vein on the time taken and the number of attempts required to cannulate has not been undertaken. 

The optimisation of conditions is important for this commonly performed procedure. Failed attempts at cannulation can lead to fear induced vasoconstriction by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in subsequent attempts being more difficult. Multiple attempts at cannulation are also unpleasant for the patient.  

We investigated whether or not tapping of a selected vein prior to cannulation improved the perceived ease of cannulation and the success of cannulation.
