  <interventions>
    <interventions>Non invasive ventilation (NIV) will be applied through a helmet, which is a transparent latex-free polyvinylchloride hood, or by mask. The ventilator will be set with the same positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and inspiratory support applied to the patient before extubation. During the first 24 hours, NIV will be maintained continuously. Thereafter brief discontinuation (less than 5min) will be tolerated for nursing the patients (face, oral hygiene) or to change the non invasive interface. To enhance patient tolerance to NIV, a mild sedation with low doses of remifentanyl (0.025-0.15 microg/kg/min) and/or clonidine (bolus 1 microg/kg/min, than 0.003-0.01 microg/kg/min, max 750-900 microg/die) and/or propofol (10-50 mg/hr) will be allowed. Alternation of interfaces (helmet and mask) will also be accepted during the study period to increase patient tolerance. PEEP will be reduced by 2 cmH2O per hour whenever the PaO2/FiO2 ratio will exceed 225, to a minimum level of 8 cmH2O. No decrease in PEEP will be undertaken if PaO2/FiO2 ratio is below 225. In this case, the attendant physician will re-evaluate the patient after 6 hours. Inspiratory support will be reduced by 2 cmH2O per hour to maintain PaCO2 &lt;= 50 mmHg and pH &gt;= 7.35, to a minimum level of 10 cmH2O. When NIV is set at the minimum levels of PEEP and inspiratory support (8 cmH2O and 10 cmH2O, respectively) and the PaO2/FiO2 is higher than 250, a 30-minute spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a Venturi mask 35% will be attempted. The SBT will be interrupted and NIV resumed in case of severe dyspnea, activation of accessory muscles, and paradoxical abdominal motion, respiratory rate (RR) &gt; 30 breaths/min, SpO2 &lt; 90%. At the end of the trial an arterial blood gas analysis will be performed: the patients will be considered successfully weaned off NIV if pH &gt;= 7.35, PaCO2 &lt;= 50 mmHg and PaO2 &gt;= 70 mmHg.
The total duration of NIV treatment will depend on how quick, according to the established algorithm, will be the weaning process and it can vary on a case by case basis.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is composed by patients invasively ventilated that will be weaned off the ventilator decreasing the PEEP and pressure support but with the endotracheal tube in place. In the control group, PEEP will be reduced by 2 cmH2O per hour whenever the PaO2/FiO2 ratio will exceed 225, to a minimum level of 8 cmH2O. No decrease in PEEP will be undertaken if PaO2/FiO2 ratio is below 225. In this case, the attendant physician will re-evaluate the patient after 6 hours. Inspiratory support will be reduced by 2 cmH2O per hour to maintain PaCO2 &lt;= 50 mmHg and pH &gt;= 7.35, to a minimum level of 10 cmH2O. When pressure support ventilation (PSV) is set at the minimum levels of PEEP and inspiratory support (8 cmH2O and 10 cmH2O, respectively) and the PaO2/FiO2 is higher than 250, a 30-minute SBT will be attempted. In the control group, the SBT consists in making patient breathing through the circuit of a flow triggered ventilator, set to deliver 5 cmH2O of PEEP and 5 cmH2O of inspiratory support at 35% oxygen. The SBT will be interrupted and increased the total support in case of severe dyspnea, activation of accessory muscles, and paradoxical abdominal motion, RR &gt; 30 breaths/min, SpO2 &lt; 90%. At the end of the trial an arterial blood gas analysis will be performed: the patients will be extubated if pH &gt;= 7.35, PaCO2 &lt;= 50 mmHg and PaO2 &gt;= 70 mmHg.
The total duration of invasive mechanical ventilation treatment will depend on how quick, according to the established algorithm, will be the weaning process and it can vary on a case by case basis.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>According to data from the previous study by Vaschetto et al. (Intensive Care Medicine (2012) 38:15991606), the sample size has been so calculated:
1) H0: mean ICU length of stay in the intervention group equal to the control group = 21;
2) H1: mean ICU length of stay of intervention group = 15 vs. mean ICU length of stay of control group = 21;
3) Standard Deviation of ICU length of stay in intervention (11) and control group (13);
4) Study design: multicenter RCT;
5) Significance: 5%;
6) Power: 80%;
7) type of comparison: 2 tails;
8) Statistic Test: t-test with Satterthwaite correction.

According to these hypothesis, 65 patients for each group are needed.

The two groups will be compared by using the MannWhitney test. Frequency distributions will be compared by using chi-square test.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Although mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment, endotracheal intubation is the most important risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia and increases patients discomfort and need for sedatives, which increases in turn the time spent on mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit length of stay. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) may be used (1) to prevent the occurrence of impending (but not established) acute or post-extubation failure, (2) at an early stage, when respiratory failure is already established, to avert the need for endotracheal intubation, and (3) as an alternative to invasive ventilation at a more advanced stage of acute respiratory failure or to facilitate the process of weaning from mechanical ventilation. No controlled randomized study, however has so far investigated the potential role of NIV in the weaning process of patients with acute lung injury (ALI). The aim of the present study is to investigate whether early extubation followed by NIV application (intervention group) may reduce the ICU length of stay as compared to conventional weaning in patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure secondary to ALI or acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). We will performed a prospective randomized multicentre controlled trial. One-hundred-ten patients with ALI will be randomize to receive weaning via early extubation followed by NIV application (intervention group) or via endotracheal tube in place (control group). We expect to find that NIV application by well-experienced centers, will reduce the ICU length of stay as compared with the traditional weaning process via endotracheal tube.</summary>
