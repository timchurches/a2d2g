  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants admitted for treatment for endometrial cancer (usually involving a hysterectomy) undergo a uterine wash during the gynaecological procedure.  The wash, which will take less than 5 minutes to collect, will contain  enzymes called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPS), which are released into the uterine cavity in patients with endometrial cancer. Uterine washes will be transported to a test laboratory to be analysed for MMP levels using standard lab techniques. This testing will take a few hours to complete.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group is made up of participants who are known to not have endometrial cancer. These participants suffer from unrelated gynaecological conditions that still require them to undergo hysterctomy (ie prolapse). The uterine wash procedure and testing will be performed as that described for patients with endometrial cancer. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main aim of this study is to assess the ability of a new test to detect endometrial cancer in post-menopausal women. The diagnostic test being evaluated involves performing a wash of the uterus and collecting this wash fluid for analysis of markers that are shed from cancer cells. Two different laboratory testing methods will be used to obtain information that will enable us to develop a more cost-effective, sensitive and specific test for detecting early stages of endometrial cancer.

Who is it for?
This studyis open to peri- and post-menopausal women aged 45-80 years with endometrial cancer and who are currently undergoing a hystrectomy procedure.

Trial details
In this study you will undergo a uterine wash procedure while under general anesthetic prior to hysterectomy procedure. The wash sample is then tested for specific MMPs.  </summary>
