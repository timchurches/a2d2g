  <interventions>
    <interventions>The purpose of this study is to analyze the biomechanics of landing before and after calf stretching for healthy athletes with limited ankle dorsiflexion. Participants will be divided into two groups; intervention (calf stretching) and control (arm stretching). The training program will involve 30 sessions consisting of a total of 10 minutes static stretching performed five times a week for 6 weeks. The program will be demonstrated by a physiotherapist at the beginning of the trial and a printout with the exercises will be provided to participants so that they can perfrom at home. The calf muscles of both legs will be stretched in four different positions. Each stretch will last 30 s for each position with a rest period of 30 s between stretches. Each stretch will be performed at the maximum dorsiflexion tolerated by the subjects. The following exercises will be used: (1) standing calf stretch, (2) standing calf stretch with foot on wall, (3) long sitting calf stretch, (4) standing calf stretch on step. A daily exercise check list will be used to monitor compliance. </interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will follow a stretching program of identical frequency and duration as the intervention group. The following exercises will be used: (1) Wall Stretch (biceps), (2) Hand Down Spine (triceps), (3) Elbows Back (pectoralis) (4) Shoulder cross (Deltoid muscles). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 1: Compare the change of the ankle dorsiflexion range of motion in control group and intervention group.  Data will be collected maximal ankle dorsiflexion range of motion at weight-bearing. The joint angle of the ankle dorsiflexion will be measured using a smart phone application. This method achieved high reliability, with an ICC of 0.97. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Before and after 6-weeks intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 2: Data will be collected ankle, knee, hip joint range of motion, valgus angle (knee joint), maximum ground reaction force during drop vertical jump (DVJ) task as a sagittal plane movement. All subjects perform DVJ on a force plate. Three-dimensional whole body kinematics will record using 17 reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks on the trunk, pelvis and the right leg via self-adhesive, double-sided tape. Marker trajectories will record with a 14-camera motion analysis system at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The participants will perform drop vertical jump task before and after 6-weeks intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 3: Data will be collected ankle, knee, hip joint range of motion, valgus angle (knee joint), during lateral reactive jump (LRJ) task as a horizontal plane movement. Three-dimensional whole body kinematics will record using 17 reflective markers placed on anatomical landmarks on the trunk, pelvis and the right leg via self-adhesive, double-sided tape. Marker trajectories will record with a 14-camera motion analysis system at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The intended sample size with a justification (where appropriate):
  A priori power calculation was conducted using the G*Power statistical package. Calculations were based on the following parameters: 2-sided test, power of 0.80, alpha of .05, The effect size was 0.80. The number of subjects in each group, according to this calculation, was 15.
Statistical Analysis:
  Statistical analysis will perform using SPSS Version 18 for Windows. The ten successful trials of each subject will averaged and served as the basis for the statistical analysis. We will performed with the Mann-Whitney U test for non-parametric variables due to the small number of subjects in each group.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The injury of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a typical injury of the knee joint that occurs during sports. According to recent studies, ACL injury mechanisms are multifactorial, resulting from the interplay of various factors. One potential injury risk factor of the ACL is limited ankle dorsiflexion. Dorsiflexion range of motion may alter lower-extremity landing mechanics in a manner, which predisposes athletes to injury. Our purpose is to clarify the effect of stretching by evaluating landing task biomechanics related to ACL injury before and after ankle dorsiflexion stretching.</summary>
