    <interventions>Clinically integrated e-learning based course
The curriculum is subdivided into five modules each of which addresses core competencies in evidence-based practice. These modules are:
1. Asking and framing clinical questions.
2. Searching for the evidence
3a. Critical appraisal of primary randomised controlled trials
3b. Measures of effectiveness
3c. Critical appraisal of systematic reviews of intervention studies
4. Applicability of the evidence to the patient
5. Implementation of the evidence into practice

Each module consists of self-directed e-learning sessions, clinically integrated learning and teaching activities and pre-and post course assessment (multiple choice questions) and are taught consecutively over a period of 5-6 weeks.
The e-learning sessions provide the theoretical knowledge for each module. Each session takes about 20 -30 minutes to complete
A facilitator guides the learner through the course and helps identifying learning opportunities in a clinical setting, during ward rounds and daily meetings and to apply the gained knowledge to a clinical case scenario.</interventions>
    <comparator>Traditional lecture based course
Five lectures, with the same learning objectives and content as the e-sessions in the intervention group, are being delivered to the learners over 5-6 weeks by a tutor (using power point presentations).  Each lecture takes around 30 -60 minutes.</comparator>
