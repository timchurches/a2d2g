Note: Mixed histologies (except small cell) permitted if predominately TCC by IHC.
2. Patients must have evidence of metastatic disease, but measurable disease is not mandatory. To be considered evaluable for the overall response rate (complete and partial response), patients must have at least one measurable lesion as follows:
*X-ray, physical exam greater than or equal to 20 mm
*Conventional CT scan, MRI greater than or equal to 20 mm
*Spiral CT scan greater than or equal to 10 mm
3. Male or female, 18 years of age or older.
4. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 at study entry
5. Adequate hematological, renal and hepatic functions as defined by the following required laboratory values obtained within 14 days prior to randomization. If anemic, patients should be asymptomatic and should not be decompensated.
*Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 1.5 x10^9/L (1,500 cells/mm3)
*Platelet count greater than or equal to 90 x10^9/L (100,000/mm3)
*Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 90 g/L

6. Patients may have had prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy for completely resected disease, provided it was completed at least 12 months prior to randomization. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects to less than or equal to Grade 2 from any prior treatments. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy will be considered to have been first line therapy in the metastatic setting if the patient progressed within 12 months of the last dose.
7. Patients must have received one and only one prior chemotherapeutic regimen which included a platinum (at least one cycle) for metastatic/recurrent disease. Treatment must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to randomization in this study. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects to less than or equal to Grade 2 from any prior treatments
8. Patients may not have had any prior therapy with a taxane in any setting.
9. Patients may have had prior investigational agents but these must have been discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to randomization. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects less than or equal to Grade 2 from any prior treatments.
10. Prior treatments with radiation therapy in the adjuvant and/or metastatic setting are permitted provided that at least 2 weeks have elapsed since the last fraction of radiation therapy and all treatment related adverse events are less than or equal to Grade 1 at the time of randomization.
11. Patients may have had prior surgery provided that at least 4 weeks elapsed between the end of surgery and randomization onto the study. Patients must have recovered from any acute toxic effects less than or equal to Grade 2 from any prior treatments.
12. Patients may have peripheral neuropathy from previous treatments assuming it is less than or equal to Grade 2.
13. Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the health and demographic, quality of life, and health utilities questionnaires in either English or French. The baseline assessment must be completed within required timelines, prior to registration/randomization. Inability (illiteracy in English or French, loss of sight, or other equivalent reason) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the questionnaires will make the patient ineligible.
14. Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in the trial to document their willingness to participate.
15. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to randomization. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, "effective contraception" also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention) defined as a hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or vasectomy/vasectomized partner. However, if at any point a previously celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for use of contraceptive measures outlined in the protocol, he/she is responsible for beginning contraceptive measures.
16. Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow up. Patients registered on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1.5 hour's driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete documentation of the treatment, adverse events, response assessment and follow-up.
17. In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient randomization.

    <statisticalmethods>Correlative Study and Pharmacogenomics Analyses 
For all consenting patients, archival diagnostic tumour tissue and baseline whole blood will be collected and banked. 
The following analyses will be performed for each treatment regimen. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize biomarkers for responders versus to assess relationship between response and biomarkers, a logistic regression analysis will be performed with effects for biomarker and treatment regimen in the model. To assess the relationship of overall survival (and PFS) with biomarkers, a Cox regression analysis will be used with effects for biomarker and treatment regimen in the model. In addition, for SPARC and other biomarkers with binary measures, survival will be summarized by median survival time for each biomarker category along with the hazard ratio. For each treatment regimen, the Kaplan-Meier curve for survival will be presented graphically for each biomarker category and differences in the curves will be tested using the log-rank test. 
Health and Demographic Questionnaire Analyses 
Much of the analyses of this questionnaire involve the inclusion of elements of the HDQ as confounders or potential interactors with QoL, health economics, correlative, co-morbidity and baseline patient characteristics, and other HDQ elements for the primary and secondary outcome measures. As such, these analyses are described in the appropriate correlative, QoL, and health economic sections. The HDQ data will also be used in a descriptive manner (i.e. comparing the BL.12 trial population with demographic data derived from the larger non-trial population of patients). When quantitative analyses are needed to understand how the HDQ variable affects other potential confounders or primary and secondary outcomes, regression methods will be utilized.

Assuming a median survival of 4 months with paclitaxel, the study is designed to detect a one third reduction in the hazard of progression with nab-paclitaxel (PFS HR equal to 0.67) which translates into a 50 percent median PFS improvement of 2 months (i.e. from 4 to 6 months). Using a 1- sided 5 percent significance test with 81percent power, 155 events are required. This will be achieved with an accrual rate of 5.5 patients per month for 36 months with a follow-up period of 4 months. The estimated sample size will be approximately 199 patients which will allow for lost to follow-up or withdrawal of consent.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of nab-paclitaxel compared to paclitaxel in patients with advanced urothelial cancer. 
Who is it for? 
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have been diagnosed with metastatic or locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary tract (bladder, urethra, ureter, renal, pelvis), which has progressed on or after a platinum containing regimen. 
Study details 
Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive intravenous infusions of the chemotherapy drug Paclitaxel every 21 days. Participants in the other group will receive intravenous infusions of the chemotherapy drug Nab-Paclitaxel every 21 days. Treatment will continue indefinitely as long as you are responding and able to tolerate the drug well. 

All participants will be followed-up for up to 42 months in order to evaluate disease response, survival, toxicity, and quality of life. This research is being done because currently there is no effective treatment for advanced urothelial cancer that has progressed after prior chemotherapy.
