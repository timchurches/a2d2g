  <interventions>
    <interventions>Cyclists completed two 90 min cycling trials (80 min at 60% maximal aerobic power followed by a 10 min maximal time trial) separated by 1 day.  Exercise trials were preceded 2 h by either a calcium-rich (mean +/-  SD; 1352 +/-  53 mg calcium) dairy based meal or a control meal (46 +/-  7 mg calcium). The calcium-rich meal consisted of rolled-oats cooked with calcium-fortified (Tricalcium phosphate, Nano-calcium) milk, yoghurt and additional milk.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control meal provided oats cooked with water and served with tinned fruit and nuts. The calcium content was 46 +/- 7 mg.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome of this study was the effects of a calcium pre-exercise meal on the exercise induced changes in bone turnover (formation and resoprtion). This was measured as the average serum concentration of Cross Linked C-Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTX-I), Cross Linked C-Telopeptide of Type II Collagen (CTX-II), Parathyroid Hormone (PTH), and bone formation (Procollagen I N-Terminal Propeptide (PINP) measured using Enzyme-Linked immunoSorbent Assay (ELISA)</outcome>
      <timepoint>pre-trial (time = 0 min); pre-exercise (t = 115 min); and immediately post-exercise (t = 210 min), 40 min post-exercise (t = 250 min), 100 min post-exercise (t = 310 min) and 190 min post-exercise (t = 400 min)</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cycling time trial performance measured as the average work completed in the final 10 min of the cycling trial. Average work is measured using a Wattbike ergometer (Nottingham, UK) which estimates power using a load cell placed near the chain of the ergometer. </outcome>

    <concealment>Following approval from the Australian Institute of Sport Ethics Committee, emails advertising the study were circulated to all State Sport Institutes and Cycling Coaches, athletes previously involved in such studies and training camps and National Road Series team managers and athletes. 

The Australian National Road Series had 107 female cyclists registered at the time of this study and an average (+/- SD) race attendance of 47 +/-  16.  Of this population, 33 cyclists expressed interest in participating and 25 met the inclusion criteria (17 to 32 y; greater than or equal to 18 mo racing experience; no medical condition affecting calcium homeostasis, able to commit to 10 d camp).  The additional participants included an international professional, an ultra-endurance mountain biker and 5 well-trained National club-level cyclists.  

This was a counterbalanced crossover design meaning that subjects served as their own control. The order with which they received the experimental and control treatments was randomised. 
Subjects were randomised into one of two groups that were balanced for menstrual phase (luteal or follicular which was confirmed with measures of oestrogen and progesterone on trial day one; ovulation was avoided), menstrual regularity (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea or regular) and use of contraceptives (oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive devices, implants or injections).  
Allocation concealment was not carried out.  The same person who determined eligibility also determined group allocation. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Group 1 received the control treatment meal first and group 2 received the treatment (calcium-rich) meal first.  Subjects were sorted based on menstrual regularity (irregular or regular) and use of contraceptives. Subjects were then randomised into groups 1 and 2 using a computerised sequence generation (www.random.org) so that each group had an equal number of subjects who had a regular menstrual cycle and of those an equal number who were in their follicular or luteal phase; irregular menstrual cycle; or were using a contraceptive device. 
This was deemed more appropriate than using a random number generator prior to accounting for menstrual status, as menstrual status is known to effect calcium homeostasis and so balancing the groups was prioritised. </sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: An issue of high importance to the AIS is the prevention/treatment of low bone density in athletes: low bone mineral density (BMD) is common in both male and female cyclists. This may be because of a lack of weight-bearing activity, menstrual disturbances, and low energy availability due to weight loss practices or the high energy expenditure. An additional risk factor of interest is the acute effect of sweat calcium loss. These sweat calcium losses during prolonged exercise may cause a significant decline in blood calcium concentrations during training. The body protects blood calcium levels by stimulating the bones to release calcium into the blood to restore levels, and increasing bone re-absorption. 

Purpose: to determine whether a high calcium pre-event meal can reduce levels of hormones that are
responsible for increasing bone resorption. 

Hypothesis: based on previous findings involving calcium-fortified water, it is hypothesised that a calcium-rich dairy based meal will reduce the exercise induced rise in biomarkers of bone resorption observed during cycling. </summary>
