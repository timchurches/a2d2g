  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention participants will receive 6 intensive telephone based education and support calls every 2 weeks from specially trained (Asthma Foundation NSW (AFNSW) InfoLine staff. Discussions will be supported by relevant AFNSW copyrighted resources, which may be hard copy by mail, web links or emailed resources. Telephone calls are expected to last between 5 and 10 minutes.  The sessions will  include completion of questionnaires that will be used to individualise the coaching received.  Coaching may include asthma education, trigger identification and avoidance as well as adherence strategies and goal setting etc.  </interventions>
    <comparator>Usual AFNSW service - Each participant will have a single phone call with the AFNSW InfoLine as per the usual service.
This service provides evidence based information and advice on asthma and answer any questions they might have.  The length of call is dependent on the caller's needs. </comparator>

  <eligibility>

    <concealment>Potential participants will have phoned the AFNSW Infoline service.  Following the usual Infoline service the phone counsellor will inform the potential participant that AFNSW is conducting a study.  Brief verbal information may then be provided regarding the study and if interested a four question eligibility screening will be asked. The four questions are: are you over 18 years of age? ; have you been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor? ; do you currently take an asthma preventer inhaler? ; have you been diagnosed with another lung condition?  

If the potential participant is eligible and interested then their contact details will be collected and an email or letter will be sent containing the Patient Information Statement (PIS) and Patient Consent Form (PCF).  A reminder follow up call will be made after one week. 

Participants will be allocated to either intervention or control group by the Infoline service counsellor. The participant will not be told which group they are in. 
</concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation will occur at the level of the telephone call. Each alternate call will be allocated to the intervention group.  </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Quantitative outcome data will be analysed using parametric and non-parametric statistical methods to determine any differences in outcome measures of the intervention compared to control groups. 
Qualitative data from post-service participant and telephone counsellor interviews will be content analysed for emergent and anticipated themes, following transcription of audio recorded interviews.
