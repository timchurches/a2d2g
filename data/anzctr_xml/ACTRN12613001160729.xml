  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two-arm, randomised controlled trial of a GP administered Green Prescription (GRx) (a prescription given to encourage patients to access assistance to support increased activity)  plus Kia Akina (a community based obesity recovery network) versus a GRx alone among people who are obese (BMI &gt;30) (kg/m2) recruited from a routine consultation with their primary care physician. Initially this study will run for 12 months, but if the Kia Akina network is shown to be effective all participants in the Kia Akina arm of the study will be encouraged to continue their involvement with this network and participants in the GRx alone arm will be invited to join this network. 

Participants in the Kia Akina arm will be encouraged to become involved in the exercise opportunities outlined by the GRx prescription and will be invited to attend at least one of two introductory Kia Akina workshops (3 hours duration), followed by any or all of the following Kia Akina components: six-monthly workshops (3 hours duration), fortnightly support groups (45-60 minutes duration), a weekly email message with ensuing discussion, a weight loss buddy system involving daily texting and daily motivational text messages. 

As the risks of serious adverse events occurring in this study are assessed to be low, a Data Safety Monitoring Committee is not deemed necessary for this study. Instead two forms of monitoring have been established i) A Trial Steering Committee - comprising the PI and a group of three specialist advisors - will provide overall supervision of the trial to ensure that it is being conducted in an ethically safe, and scientifically sound manner; ii) the Trial Management group comprising all of the name investigators on this study will monitor the day to day running of this study. </interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator group in this study is an active control group who will receive the standard treatment of a Green Prescription (GRx) alone. 

Participants randomised to GRx alone will be encouraged to become involved in the exercise opportunities outlined by that prescription. Control participants will be informed that they will have the first opportunity of joining the Kia Akina network if it is shown to be effective at 12-months. </comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participants will be recruited from three General Practices in Christchurch, New Zealand. Following initial identification by the GP/nurse each participant will have their height and weight measured, will complete a physical fitness test and will have a GRx administered by the referring GP/nurse. Contact details of each recruited participant will then be relayed to a National Addiction Centre researcher who will arrange for baseline measures of well-being, psychological health and eating compulsivity to be completed on-line (although pen and paper administration will be made available for those who would prefer this). Once these baseline measures have been completed randomisation will occur. 

The schedule for randomisation will be prepared by a biostastician. Application of the schedule will be undertaken by an administrative staff member of the National Addiction Centre, independently of the study investigators.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation procedure will involve stratification for gender and primary care venue and will be arranged in permuted blocks. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Participants will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 ratio to experimental and control groups. The primary outcome measure will be the clinically significant standard of a 5% reduction in weight. On the basis of the known natural history of traditional approaches to weight loss intervention, 5% of the control participants are expected to achieve this goal at 12 months. However, on the basis of our experience to date with the Kia Akina programme, we expect at least 25% of participants to achieve this goal. Using a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, there is 80% power to detect a difference in control and experimental participants at 5% and 25% proportions respectively who achieve the treatment goal at 12 months, with a sample size of 98 participants.

The analysis will be conducted using an intention to treat strategy, utilising the technique of last observation carried forward to manage data from participants who do not have 12 month observations. It is anticipated that less than 10% of participants will be non-contactable at 12 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Obesity is one of the most pressing health conditions of our time, affecting nearly 30% of all New Zealand adults. There is the real threat of obesity crippling the affordability of the public health care system through the costs of associated chronic diseases, and bariatric surgery, a relatively effective intervention, yet limited in terms of numbers of patients who can be treated. The need for effective, non-surgical treatment approaches has never been greater. This research provides the opportunity to enhance much needed collaboration between specialist and primary care services and is itself an exciting new development in non-surgical approaches to obesity treatment. Utilizing a food addiction approach to obesity, which recognises obesity as a chronic relapsing condition, this approach opens up new avenues of intervention with obese people. 

The focus of this study is a lifestyle change approach to obesity involving a recovery network called Kia Akina, piloting of which has shown promising results. This research will test the effectiveness of Kia Akina in obese people recruited from primary care by comparing their 12-month weight-loss outcomes with a group randomised to receive an exercise referral, called a Green Prescription, alone. 

If shown to be effective, Kia Akina will be developed in manageable stages as a non-commercial, low cost network for obesity recovery throughout New Zealand, strongly connected with primary care services and linked with ongoing research.
