    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of exacerbation symptoms, assessed by parental recording of cough and sputum production.</outcome>

      <timepoint>Measured at time of hospitalisation (if applicable) or resolution of symptoms. Measured from enrolment for up to 18 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Detectable difference in serum laboratory assays: CRP, serum amyloid a, IL-6, IL-10, IP-10 (Only done when possible i.e not all children will have bloods taken). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Measured at baseline, and start and end of respiratory exacerbations. Total duration is from enrolment for up to 18 months.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Aged less than 18 years.
Bronchiectasis, as defined by HRCT scan within the last 5-years  OR followed by a respiratory physician for treatment of bronchiectasis if diagnosed earlier.

Severe (hypoxic, dyspnoea or hospitalisation required) or recent exacerbation (in the 4 weeks prior to study enrolment). Known hypersensitivity to penicillins or macrolides. Taking regular maintenance antibiotics of the same class as the investigational antibiotics (macrolides and penicillins), or has taken macrolides or penicillins in the 3 weeks prior to study enrolment. Current or recent (within 4 months prior to study enrolment) identification of pseudomonas organism in the airways.</exclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our national study aims to improve the management of acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children, a lung condition that is common in Indigenous people worldwide, and also occurs in non-Indigenous people. This study aims to discover whether treating acute exacerbations of bronchiectasis with oral antibiotics is effective at resolving the exacerbation more quickly than not treating with antibiotics. The results of this study will impact on national and international guidelines and substantially advance knowledge on exacerbations of childhood bronchiectasis.</summary>
