  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of topical p-menthane-3,8-diol
      (PMD)-rich Corymbia Citriodora oil (Citriodiol®) in children with impetigo. Citriodiol® is
      already known to be effective as an insect repellent and is safe in its topical application.
      The investigators have also found in our laboratory that it is bactericidal against
      Staphylococcus aureus, the bacteria responsible for causing impetigo. Parents are always
      searching for a natural alternative to antibiotics (the current gold standard treatment for
      impetigo), and the investigators believe Citriodiol® could provide this possible alternative.</summary>
