  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>- Participants who experienced virologic failure during or after
        treatment with ABT 493/ABT-530 in an AbbVie hepatitis C virus (HCV) parent study.
        Participants who have experienced virologic failure during or after receiving
        ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r + dasabuvir (3D), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/r (2D) in AbbVie HCV
        parent study may be enrolled at AbbVie's discretion.

          -  Cirrhotic participants must have compensated cirrhosis, (Child-Pugh score of less than
             or equal to 6) at screening and no current or past evidence of Child-Pugh B or C
             Classification or no clinical history of liver decompensation, including ascites noted
             on physical exam, hepatic encephalopathy or esophageal variceal bleeding.

          -  Cirrhotic participants must have absence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as
             indicated by a negative ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) within 3 months prior to Screening or a negative US at
             Screening.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>- History of severe, life-threatening or other significant sensitivity
        to any study drug or drug component.

          -  Female participant who is pregnant, breastfeeding or is considering becoming pregnant
             during the study or for 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or as directed per
             the local ribavirin label.

          -  Recent (within 6 months prior to study drug administration) history of drug or alcohol
             abuse that could preclude adherence to the protocol in the opinion of the
             investigator, and failure in an AbbVie HCV parent study due to non-virologic reasons.

          -  Positive test result at screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

          -  Screening laboratory analyses showing creatinine clearance less than 30 mg/dL.

          -  Discontinuation from previous AbbVie HCV clinical studies for reasons other than
             virologic failure (e.g., non-adherence, lost to follow-up, and/or the occurrence of an
             adverse event).

          -  Receipt of any HCV treatment after failing the treatment regimen in the AbbVie HCV
             parent study.</exclusivecriteria>
