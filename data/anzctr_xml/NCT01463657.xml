  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Juvéderm® Ultra Plus
Treatment: devices - ELAPR002

Experimental: ELAPR002 - Each treatment will consist of up 15 injections in total, each consisting of up to 0.1 ml of product, delivered to the mid to deep dermis of the skin of each NLF using a 27G needle. The needle will be inserted at an approximate angle of 30o parallel to the skin, and the product may be injected by a retrograde injection or by deposition of a bolus. ELAPR and the control may be implanted parallel or perpendicular to the NLF. Exactly the same technique will be used for the treatment of both NLFs for each patient.

Active Comparator: Juvéderm® Ultra Plus - Each treatment will consist of up 15 injections in total, each consisting of up to 0.1 ml of product, delivered to the mid to deep dermis of the skin of each NLF using a 27G needle. The needle will be inserted at an approximate angle of 30o parallel to the skin, and the product may be injected by a retrograde injection or by deposition of a bolus. ELAPR and the control may be implanted parallel or perpendicular to the NLF. Exactly the same technique will be used for the treatment of both NLFs for each patient.


Treatment: devices: Juvéderm® Ultra Plus
Patients will receive either ELAPR002b or ELAPR002d for the treatment of one NLF, and Juvéderm® Ultra Plus for the treatment of the second, opposite NLF. Treatments will be provided on Day 1 and repeated on Day 29 (if required at the discretion of the investigator) Day 57 (if required at the discretion of the investigator)to achieve OCR.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the effect of two formulations of ELAPR on change from baseline of the severity of the Nasolabial folds against a Wrinkle Assessment Scale of Nasolabial folds score at 24 weeks vs. active control - The primary efficacy variable is the change in Wrinkle Assessment Scale (WAS). The values for WAS recorded at each visit will be summarized by treatment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess the acute safety of ELAPR - Adverse event profile will be collected.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess chronic safety of ELAPR - A serum sample will be collected at Day 1, 29, 85, and Day 169, or at the completion visit in the event of early withdrawal or early termination and stored for a maximum of 5 years for the development of an assay to measure circulating anti-tropoelastin antibody levels.</outcome>
