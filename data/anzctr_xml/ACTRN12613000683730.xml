  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study was to evaluate hearing aid handling skills for new and experienced users and to assess if such skills influence users benefit and satisfaction. 74 participants with mean age of 70.43 years were divided in two groups: experienced (n=37) or new hearing aid users (n=37). Both groups performed the tasks of "Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test" (PHAST) which were a test scored on a five-point Likert scale - high scores indicate better hearing aid handling skills. Experienced users also answered the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) and the hearing aid benefit for handicap reduction was calculated by the hearing handicap inventory (HHIA/HHIE). A unique evaluator assesses the PHAST and the questionnaires.
It was just one session for one hour and a half to assess the questionnaires and the PHAST for both groups. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Purpose: To analyze the abilities to handling the hearing aids (HA) in new and experienced users and verify if this abilities relate to outcome measures of benefit and satisfaction with the use of these devices. Methods: 74 subjects (mean age = 70.43) were divided in two groups. Group A with experienced subjects (n=37) who use their HA for more than six months and Group B with new users (n=37) who use their HA for less than six months. Both groups performed eight tasks of the Practical Hearing Aid Skills Test (PHAST) which were scored on a five-point Likert scale. High scores indicate better ability to handle the HA. In addition, Group A were administered questionnaires about hearing handicap (HHIA/HHIE), benefit (APHAB) and the international inventory of results with HA (IOI-HA). Results: Median equal to 79% and 71% of the total score of the PHAST were obtained for Groups A and B, respectively, with no significant difference between the two groups. Moderate correlations were obtained between the question 2 IOI-HA and tasks 3 and 6 of PHAST, question 4 and tasks 2 and 5 and between the item 7 of the IOI-HA and tasks 1 and 6 of PHAST. There was no correlation between the results of PHAST and sociodemographic data (age, educational level and socio-economic) of the participants. Conclusion: There was no difference in the ability to handling the HA from new and experienced users. Such skills are not related to the benefit obtained from the use of these devices.</summary>
