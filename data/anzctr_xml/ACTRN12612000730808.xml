  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be enrolled in a 12-week online physical activity intervention. The interventions website is developed based on a theoretical framework (Theory of planned behaviour) and self-management principles. Participants are asked to regularly visit the intervention website over the 12 week period, however the number of times they access the website and the amount of time they spend on the website is left entirely to their own discretion. During this 12 weeks through the website participants will be able to access weekly education modules, view a library of resources, be able to self-monitor behaviours (view graphs and progress) and participate in discussion forums. In relation to self-monitoring behaviour's participants and will be asked to record self-care behaviours such as physical activity, blood glucose and blood pressure daily and weight weekly. Additionally, participants can set weekly physical activity goals for which they will receive feedback based on their physical activity progress. However, although participants are encouraged through weekly email reminder to make use of all areas of the website, the areas accessed and the utilisation of these tools is left up to the participants discretion.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group - the control group also have access to the website but can only access a static web page and links to external diabetes websites. The control group participants are not provided any encouragement to continue to visit the website over the 12 week period. So the the number of times they access the website and the amount of time they spend on the website is left entirely to their own discretion.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Self-reported physical activity behaviour was the primary outcome measure and was measured using the long form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ has been shown to be a valid and reliable instrument to measure physical activity among adults at a population level (Craig, et al., 2003) and has previously shown to be sensitive enough to detect behaviour change  in intervention research (Spittaels, De Bourdeaudhuij, Brug, et al., 2007; Spittaels, De Bourdeaudhuij, &amp; Vandelanotte, 2007). The IPAQ assess the frequency (days) and duration (minutes) of physical activity across five main domains: occupational, transportation, household, leisure time and sitting time. The frequency and duration of time spent in physical activity can be calculated to produce domain specific scores for walking, moderate and vigorous intensity activity.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12-weeks and 36-weeks (6 months post intervention)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes included a measure of physical activity beliefs according to the TPB, quality of life and satisfaction with the intervention. Physical activity beliefs were measured according to the specifications for the TPB (Ajzen, 1988). This TPB questionnaire has previously proven to be useful in identifying physical activity beliefs in the Type II diabetes population and has shown good internal consistency (Davies, et al., 2010). The first section consisted of four questions each for intention, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Each question was measured on a 7-point Likert scale and were randomised throughout. The second section consisted of questions to measure attitudes towards the behaviour using a 12 item semantic differential scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12-weeks and 6 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Quality of life was measured using the SF-12 which measures the overall physical (PHS) and mental health status (MHS) of individuals (Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Keller, 1996). The SF-12 is a short version of the SF-36 and contains 12 questions that can be answered within a shorter time frame (Burdine, Felix, Abel, Wiltraut, &amp; Musselman, 2000). The SF-12 asks questions across a number of dimensions, including; physical functioning, physical health, emotional health, physical pain, psychological well-being and health perception (Ware, et al., 1996). The sum of these scores provides a physical component and mental health component summary score used as a norm based standardised score (Ware, Kosinski, &amp; Keller, 1998). The SF-12 has previously been used in individuals with Type II diabetes (McKay, et al., 2002) and has been proven to be a valid and reliable measure of quality of life (Ware, et al., 1996).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 12-weeks and 6 months post intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Program satisfaction was measured for participants in the intervention group to examine overall website satisfaction and usefulness of various program features. The survey has been adapted from the Health-eSteps (Steele, et al., 2007a) and Diabetes NetPLAY (Liebreich, et al., 2009) and was completed at the 12-week post-intervention follow-up. The questionnaire contains 17 items measured using a 5 point Likert scale that ranges from 'strongly agree' to 'strongly disagree' in addition to three open ended questions for participants to record likes/dislikes and recommendations. The questionnaire assesses satisfaction, usability and usefulness of various website components including, online logbooks, goal-setting, education modules, feedback and email reminders.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The overall purpose of the final study is to undertake a randomised control trial to test the efficacy of an internet delivered physical activity intervention for individuals with Type II diabetes. The randomised control trial will consist of two groups, an intervention and control group. As previously described the intervention group will receive access to all aspects of the internet intervention, whereas, the control group will only be able to access a static web page containing links to external diabetes websites.
Specifically, the following hypothesis will be tested:

Hypothesis One: It is hypothesised that participants in both groups will report increases in physical activity behaviour, quality of life, physical activity intentions, subjective norms, attitudes and perceived behavioural control at 12 weeks;
a) It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will report significantly greater improvements in physical activity behaviour than the control group;
b) It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will report significantly greater improvements in their perception of quality of life than the control group;
c) It is hypothesised that participants in the intervention group will report significantly greater improvements in physical activity intentions, subjective norms, attitudes and perceived behavioural control than the control group;
Hypothesis Two: It is hypothesised that individuals in the intervention group will record significantly greater logins in comparison to the control group at the completion of the intervention period.
The combined outcome will provide a better understanding of the effectiveness of internet delivered physical activity behaviour change programs for secondary prevention of chronic diseases. Secondary aims are to explore factors within internet delivered programs which influence website usage in terms of engagement.</summary>
