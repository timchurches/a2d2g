    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Alectinib
Treatment: drugs - Atezolizumab
Treatment: drugs - Pemetrexed
Treatment: drugs - Cisplatin
Treatment: drugs - Carboplatin
Treatment: drugs - Gemcitabine

Experimental: Cohort A: Alectinib 600 Milligrams (mg) - This cohort includes participants with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive NSCLC. Participants will receive alectinib 600 mg orally twice in a day (BID) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.

Experimental: Cohort B: Dose Finding Phase (DFP) Alectinib - This cohort includes participants with rearranged during transfection (RET) positive NSCLC. Participants may receive alectinib 900 or 1200 mg orally BID until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death if the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is not established in any other clinical study. Participants may receive 750 mg or 600 mg, if it is unsafe to pursue the higher starting dose

Experimental: Cohort B: Dose Expansion Phase (DEP) Alectinib - This cohort includes participants with RET positive NSCLC. Participants will receive alectinib at the RP2D established in the DFP of Cohort B or a separate clinical study. Participants will continue receiving study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.

Experimental: Cohort C: Atezolizumab 1200 mg - This cohort includes participants with bTMB positive NSCLC. Participants will receive atezolizumab at a dose of 1200 mg administered by IV infusion every 21 days (Q21D) until disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.

Active Comparator: Cohort C: Pemetrexed, Cisplatin or Carboplatin - This cohort includes participants with bTMB positive, non-squamous NSCLC. Participants will receive 4 or 6 cycles of treatment, with each cycle being 21 days in duration. Carboplatin at a dose of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 or 6 IV or cisplatin at a dose of 75 milligrams per meter square (mg/m^2) IV on Day 1 of each cycle combined with pemetrexed at a dose of 500 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 of each cycle. Pemetrexed may be continued as maintenance therapy every 21 days (Q21D) as per local standard of care.

Active Comparator: Cohort C: Gemcitabine, Cisplatin or Carboplatin - This cohort includes participants with bTMB positive, squamous NSCLC. Participants will receive 4 or 6 cycles of treatment, with each cycle being 21 days in duration. Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m^2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle and cisplatin 75 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 Q21D or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m^2 IV on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle and carboplatin AUC 5 IV on Day 1 Q21D.


Treatment: drugs: Alectinib
Participants will receive 600 mg BID (Cohort A); 900, 1200, or 750 mg BID (Cohort B) or RP2D BID; orally until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent or death.

Treatment: drugs: Atezolizumab
Participants will receive atezolizumab 1200 mg IV infusion Q21D.

Treatment: drugs: Pemetrexed
Participants will receive pemetrexed 500 mg/m^2 IV infusion on Day 1 Q21D.

Treatment: drugs: Cisplatin
Participants will receive cisplatin 75 mg/m^2 IV on Day 1 Q21D.

Treatment: drugs: Carboplatin
Participants will receive carboplatin of AUC 5 or 6 IV on Day 1 Q21D.

Treatment: drugs: Gemcitabine
Participants will receive gemcitabine 1000 or 1250 mg/m^2 on Days 1 and 8 of every cycle (1 Cycle=21 days).
