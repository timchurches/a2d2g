  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will be delivered on 6 drinking occasions (nights) over a 12 week period. The intervention will consist of hourly Ecological Momentary Assessments and feedback. While on a night out, participants will receive hourly reminders to complete a very brief questionnaire through an online survey accessed via the SMS message. The questionnaire will involve hourly reports of their alcohol consumption and spending, where they are, and their mood. They will then receive an individually tailored feedback message via SMS in response to these data, which aims to stop or slow down their drinking, or avoid harmful consequences of drinking. Participants will be sent a weekly reminder to register for any upcoming nights to do the trial, and adherence will be monitored through logs of completed questionnaires.</interventions>
    <comparator>The first control group will complete alcohol-related assessments while on a night out, but will not receive feedback SMS. A second control group will not have any contact during the study period.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The main outcome measure will be the self-reported peak number of drinks consumed in a single occasion on the subject's most recent heavy drinking event in the past 3 months. This question is assessed through the question: "Think back over the last 3 months and try to recall the single occasion during this time period that you had the most drinks (i.e. your biggest drinking session in the past three months)." 

This question has been previously used as a measure of peak single occasion consumption (see: Dietze, P. M., Livingston, M., Callinan, S., &amp; Room, R. (2014). The big night out: What happens on the most recent heavy drinking occasion among young Victorian risky drinkers?. Drug and alcohol review, 33(4), 346-353.)</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our proposal is to take brief interventions, proven to have a significant impact on young people's drinking, and apply them in the mobile realm during actual drinking occasions. The intervention will consist of hourly mobile assessment and feedback. While on a night out, participants will receive hourly reminders to complete a very brief questionnaire through an online survey accessed via the SMS message. The questionnaire will involve hourly reports of their alcohol consumption and spending, where they are, and their mood. They will then receive an individually tailored feedback message via SMS in response to these data, which aims to stop or slow down their drinking, or avoid harmful consequences of drinking. The intervention will be delivered on 6 drinking occasions (nights) over a 12 week period. This study aims to determine the impact of a tailored brief intervention delivered by mobile phone on young people's high-risk alcohol consumption. We will use a randomised controlled trial design to generate high quality evidence of the impact of this intervention on single occasion risky drinking among young people.
This will be the world's first randomised controlled trial of a mobile delivered brief intervention to reduce alcohol consumption. </summary>
