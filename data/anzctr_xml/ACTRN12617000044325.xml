  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.	The trigger point therapy group will receive one session of myofascial trigger point therapy by an experienced physiotherapist. Treatment process will be repeated 3 times on each active/latent trigger point in seven following muscles: upper trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids, pectoralis minors, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minors. Pressure on each trigger point will be maintained for 30-60 seconds (&lt;1 minute), The whole treatment lasts between 20 and 30 minutes. These procedures are performed only once.
2.	The ultrasonographic (US)-guided subacromial injection group will receive corticosteroid injection into the subacromial bursa (Triamcinolone 1 ml of 10mg/1mL with 1% lidocaine is injected) by a physiatrist. This injection is performed only once.
3.	The combined treatment group will receive myofascial trigger point therapy and corticosteroid injection (Triamcinolone 1 ml of 10mg/1mL with 1% lidocaine) into the subacromial bursa. The injection administered immediately before myofascial trigger point therapy. These procedures/injection are performed only once.
4.    Since only one treatment is administered, fidelity issue is not applicable.
