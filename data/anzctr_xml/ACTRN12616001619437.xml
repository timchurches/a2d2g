  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Scientific studies have shown that urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs in 40 to 50% of people who sustain a spinal cord injury. Our local audit confirms a similar percentage at the Auckland Spinal Rehabilitation Unit (ASRU) with almost half of all our patients experiencing at least one episode of UTI following spinal cord injury. Our regular practice to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection is to increase fluid intake, provide appropriate care of the catheter system, ensure good hygiene with catheter use and, when possible, discontinue the indwelling catheter or discontinue and commence an intermittent catheterization program as soon as possible.  Infections are treated with increasing water consumption and appropriate antibiotics after checking a urine culture. 

We would like to know if d mannose reduces risk of UTI in people with spinal cord injury/impairment (SCI). D mannose, which is registered as a health supplement product in NZ, has been shown to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. D mannose is a natural sugar, which binds with bacteria and prevents adhesion of the bacteria to the bladder wall thus, presumably, reducing infection in the bladder. No studies have been done to determine D mannoses effectiveness in prevention of UTI in the spinal cord injury population. To test the effectiveness of d mannose in reducing UTI in SCI, we have developed a pilot randomised control trial (RCT) at ASRU and Middlemore Hospital (MMH).

    <publicnotes>What is the purpose of this study: 

Scientific studies have shown that urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs in 40 to 50% of people who sustain a spinal cord injury. Our local audit confirms a similar percentage at the Auckland Spinal Rehabilitation Unit (ASRU) with almost half of all our patients experiencing at least one episode of UTI following spinal cord injury. Our regular practice to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection is to increase fluid intake, provide appropriate care of the catheter system, ensure good hygiene with catheter use and, when possible, discontinue the indwelling catheter or discontinue and commence an intermittent catheterization program as soon as possible.  Infections are treated with increasing water consumption and appropriate antibiotics after checking a urine culture. 

We would like to know if d mannose reduces risk of UTI in people with spinal cord injury/impairment (SCI). D mannose, which is registered as a health supplement product in NZ, has been shown to reduce the risk of urinary tract infection (UTI) in women. D mannose is a natural sugar, which binds with bacteria and prevents adhesion of the bacteria to the bladder wall thus, presumably, reducing infection in the bladder. No studies have been done to determine D mannoses effectiveness in prevention of UTI in the spinal cord injury population. To test the effectiveness of d mannose in reducing UTI in SCI, we have developed a pilot randomised control trial (RCT) at ASRU and Middlemore Hospital (MMH).  

What will my participation in the study involve?: 

A randomised control trial is a study in which up to half of the participants do not receive treatment and the other half receive the trial drug, in this case, D mannose.  Randomisation of the participants means either you will be in the control group (no drug group) or in the intervention group (D mannose group).  If you are in the control group there will be no change in your management throughout your stay in Middlemore Hospital and at ASRU. If you are in the intervention group, you will receive 3 tablets of d mannose (UroFem) per day for the next 3 months. This medication will be charted in your medication chart and provided by the nursing staff just like other medications. If you miss taking a d mannose tablet, just continue with next scheduled dose.  There is no need to take any extra doses the next day.  A chart will be kept to record each tablet taken.  We will monitor you closely for any negative/adverse effects.  Previous studies have not identified any negative effects attributed to d mannose.  Although unlikely to occur, we will watch for any change in blood sugar levels in diabetic patients.  Monitoring for adverse/negative effects will be done on a weekly basis.  Should you have any questions or concerns, you are encouraged to contact your nurse or the person monitoring the medication at any time.  If you are discharged before the 3 month period ends, you will be provided with the remaining tablets for the 3 month period and a form for charting your tablets taken.  You will be contacted by phone once a week until the end of the trial period to ensure you have had no negative effects and to track your dosing of the medication. Your GP will be informed of your participation in the study.

Participating in the trial is voluntary.  Should you chose not to participate there will be no effect on your medical or rehabilitation care during your stay at MMH and/or ASRU if.  You may withdraw from the study at any time.  Your privacy will be maintained at all times.  Your name and any identifying details will be removed (de-identified) to protect your privacy.  

What are the possible benefits and risks of this study?

Potential benefit of this study: At the completion of the study we hope to identify that d mannose is an effective preventative treatment for UTI in people with SCI.  If you would like a copy of the completed study with results, we will be happy to send you a copy.  
Potential risk of this study: Considering d mannose is a dietary supplement and previous studies have not reported any significant adverse events, we expect minimal risk. However, considering d mannose is natural sugar, there may be a potential risk of changes in diabetic control and, even less likely, weight gain.  Both possibilities will be monitored weekly during the course of this 3 month study. 


Who pays for the study?

There is no cost to the participants.  If discharged before the end of the 3 month trial, you will be provided with medication to complete the trial period. 

What if something goes wrong?
In the unlikely event that you are injured due to this study, you will be eligible to apply for compensation from ACC, just as you would be if you were injured in an accident at work or at home. This does not mean that your claim will automatically be accepted. You will have to lodge a claim with ACC, which may take some time to assess. If your claim is accepted, you will receive funding to assist in your recovery. If you have private health or life insurance, you may wish to check with your insurer that taking part in this study wont affect your cover. 

What are my rights?
Whether or not you participate is your choice.  If you do not wish to take part in the study, you do not need to give a reason. If you chose not to participate it will not affect the medical or rehabilitation care you receive.  

What happens if I change my mind?
If you decide to take part now, but change your mind later, you can withdraw from the study at any time.
