  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive the intervention or usual care during a health care visit.

Intervention:  3-item partner violence screen (physical abuse; sexual abuse; feeling unsafe) followed by high risk assessment, brief supportive messages, partner violence information, community referral.  The screen items include: Within the last year, have you been hit, slapped, kicked, or otherwise physically hurt by someone? (if so, by whom); Within the last year, has anyone forced you to have, watch or participate in any sexual activities against your will (if so, by whom); and Is there a current or past partner that is making you feel unsafe?</interventions>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>There are two sites in the study: an emergency department and a general practice clinic. Emergency Department: Potential participants include women registered for care during 100 randomly selected 4 hour time blocks over a 12 week study recruitment period. General Practice Clinic (Hauora): Potential participants include all women crossing the threshold of the hauora. Includes women there for their own health care appointment, accompanying someone else for a health visit, or just stopping in (e.g. to make an appointment, pick up materials, etc). Recruitment will continue until the day in which 400 women are enrolled.
Inclusion Criteria:Non-acute (where immediate health care delivery is not a priority; in the emergency department setting triage &gt;=3); English Speaking (able to converse and comprehend every day English); Non-impaired (able to participate in and comprehend informed consent.</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recognizing that partner violence poses a significant health risk for women and children, professional and government organizations recommend that clients be screened for violence. Whether healthcare site-based partner violence early detection (screening) and intervention can reduce morbidity and mortality, however, remains untested. 

In this study we will invite women and young persons who are healthcare clients at selected study sites to participate in a clinical randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of a healthcare site-based partner violence screening and intervention protocol. 

Hypotheses include:
Compared to women in the usual care group, women in the screening and intervention group will, in the follow-up period, have significantly:
  Less violence
  More use of safety behaviours 
  More use of community resources 
  Higher self-reported general health
  Higher satisfaction with healthcare services
  Less parental stress

The effect of screening and intervention on violence in the follow-up period will be mediated by: 
  Acknowledgement of partner violence during the initial baseline healthcare visit (included in their diagnoses list)
  Socioeconomic status
  Problem drinking or drug use
  Depression
  Self-care measures.</summary>
