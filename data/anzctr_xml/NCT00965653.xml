  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This open-label randomized 2arm study will investigate the pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered tocilizumab in patients
      with rheumatoid arthritis who have shown an inadequate response to methotrexate. Patients
      will be randomized to receive tocilizumab 162 mg sc either weekly or every other week, in
      combination with methotrexate, for 12 weeks. Assessments will be made at regular intervals
      during treatment and on the 3 weeks of follow-up.Target sample size is &lt; 50 individuals.</summary>
