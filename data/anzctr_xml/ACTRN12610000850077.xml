  <interventions>
    <interventions>A patient centered intervention (PCI) will be used to deliver the acupuncture treatment. In this approach the treatment design, the specific acupuncture system, style and techniques as well as explicit rational for diagnosis and treatment is tailored by the acupuncturist delivering the treatment to meet individual needs, but remains structured through manualisation
Acupuncture treatment that may include: needles, moxibustion therapy, cupping, dietary and lifestyle advice that is specific to the acupuncture diagnosis made by the acupuncturist. After making an acupuncture diagnosis the acupuncturist will select the treatment outlined as documented in a protocol manual compiled by the study investigator. This manual will be compiled using expert opinion from published texts detailing recommended treatment in the use of threatened miscarriage. 
Treatment protocols will include:
Treatment based on an eight principals Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) diagnosis. 
A selection of acupuncture points for each TCM diagnosis along with the appropriate indications for the use of moxibustion and or cupping. 
Recommendations for dietary and lifestyle advice that is specific for each TCM diagnosis.
 Needling specifications for needling depths according to a recognised acupuncture text (Deadman, Al-Khafaji, &amp; Baker, 2001). 
Treatment consists of two treatments in the first week of entering the trial followed by a weekly visit until participants reach 12 gestational weeks. 
The initial treatment session will be 1 1/2 hours with the follow up sessions taking 3/4 of an hour. Each acupuncture treatment will involve a needling technique for obtaining deqi (the stimulation of the acupuncture needle to elicit a feeling of numbness, distension or heaviness around the acupuncture point) and a needle retention time of 20 minutes at each session.
 
A written sheet detailing dietary and lifestyle factors risk factors will also be given to women</interventions>
    <comparator>The active control group will receive touch care in the form of light pressure applied to non acupuncture points to provide nonspecific therapeutic effects.  
This touch treatment will consist of light pressure to each of the the following points  for a time period of 5 minutes for each point. 
With the points to used in the following order.
1 Dorsum of the foot. In the hollow distal to the junction of the 3rd and 4th metatarsal bones. Midway between the GB and ST channel, approximately at the level of the acupuncture point Liv 3. 
2 Lower Leg. On the anterior crest of the tibia, 7 cun below the base of the patella. 1 cun distal and 1.5 cun medial to the acupuncture point ST 37. 
3 Forearm. On the extensor surface of the forearm. Midway between LI and TH channels one cun distal and one cun lateral to LI 11
4 Hand. Dorsum of hand in the hollow distal to the base of the the 2nd and  3rd metacarpal bones.	Midway between the SJ channel and the extra acupuncture point  point Luozhen (M-UE-24), approximately at the level of the acupuncture point  SI 3. 
 5 Chest. Antero lateral aspect of the chest. Inferior border of the clavicle, 5 cun lateral to the midline. Midway between the ST and LU channels  at the level of the acupuncture points  ST 13 and LU 2. 


Treatment consists of two treatments in the first week of entering the trial followed by a weekly visit until participants reach 12 weeks gestation. The initial treatment session will be 1 1/2 hours with the follow up sessions taking 3/4 of an  hour.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Threatened miscarriage is a medical term used for vaginal bleeding during pregnancy when a baby is found to have a heart beat on ultrasound. While it is known that a majority of miscarriages in early pregnancy result from genetic abnormalities, there remain a percentage in which the cause remains unknown. 
It may be possible that amongst this group of women in which genetic abnormalities is not the cause for vaginal bleeding, acupuncture may be used as a treatment for threatened miscarriage. 
This study is designed to investigate if acupuncture can help women with threatened miscarriage and to examine their experience of receiving treatment. On entering the study women will be randomised into two groups  one group receiving acupuncture and one group receiving touch therapy, with both groups receiving diet and lifestyle advice. Treatment will continue until a pregnancy reaches 12 weeks gestation.  
During this study women will receive an ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation, women will be required to keep a diary, a follow up phone call at 18-20 weeks gestation and birthing records will be examined to record the health of the mother and baby at birth. Some women may also be asked for an interview on their experience of the treatment they received.</summary>
