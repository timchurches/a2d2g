    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>All patients presenting to the ED meeting the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. Patient consent will be waived due to the treatment being administered based on a Duty of Care. Enrolled patients will then be blindly allocated to one of three treatment arms. Identical treatment kits (containers) containing the 3 different treatments will be numbered sequentially which will only be used by the treating doctors once the patient has been recruited. There is no way that the treating doctor or research assistant will be aware of the allocation because all of the treatment kits will be identical and number for sequential use, so they will not know what is in the treatment kit even if they look at it.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aggressive behaviour related to psychostimulant abuse, poisoning and/or withdrawal, such as amphetamines, is an increasing problem in emergency departments. It can lead to patient harm, injury to staff and damage to hospital property if the situation is not rapidly controlled. Intravenous sedation can be difficult, particularly in smaller urban and regional hospitals because it requires sufficient staff numbers to restrain the patient to obtain intravenous access and can lead to needle-stick injuries. Intramuscular sedation with benzodiazepines, mainly midazolam, is unpredictable and can lead to over-sedating the patient or not sedating them enough, and may be associated with problems in this group due to benzodiazepine tolerance. Droperidol is a highly sedative antipsychotic medication that is rarely associated with complications. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of intramuscular droperidol and intramuscular benzodiazepines for sedation of aggressive patients with psychostimulant associated agitation in a randomised controlled trial. The study is designed to assess both the speed of onset and duration of sedation.</summary>
