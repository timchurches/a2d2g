  <interventions>
    <interventions>The participant will be randomised 1:1 to Photodynamic Therapy or Radiotherapy.

A Dermatologist will be responsible for the Photodynamic Therapy as part of their normal practice. Photodynamic Therapy involves the application of a topical photosensitising agent, Methyl Aminolevulinate Hydrochloride (MAL) cream, to the area to be treated. 160mg/g is applied with a 10mm margin at least 1mm thick. Occlusive and opaque dressing is then applied for 3 hours. 

The application of MAL makes Basal Cell Carcinoma/Bowen's Disease cells sensitive to a certain type of light. Illumination leads to the release of reactive oxygen species within the target tissue. Local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine by injection (subcutaneous or dermal) will be offered prior to illumination. 

The area is illuminated with noncoherent red light at a wavelength of 630 nm for a total dose of 37 joules/cm2. The light source is placed 5-8cm away, and parallel to the skin surface. The duration of illumination is approximately 9 minutes. When the area is exposed to the light source, neoplastic cells are destroyed by either necrosis or apoptosis. Illumination is given as two 'fractions' approximately 1-4 weeks apart. This treatment is available on Medicare at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator, Radiotherapy, uses high-energy radiation to kill Basal Cell Carcinoma/Bowen's Disease cells. The radiation is focused from outside the body onto the tumour.

The following modalities are allowed: Superficial X-Ray Therapy, Electrons, Brachytherapy Moulds, Tangential Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy, No Grenz. For Superficial X-Ray Therapy, a margin of at least 5mm is added to the lesions. For other therapies, a margin of at least 10mm is added to the lesion. Treatment depth is 5mm.

EVIQ guidelines will be followed for the dose. Options include:
- 60 Gy in 30 fractions, 2 Gy per fraction
- 55 Gy in 30 fractions, 2.2 Gy per fraction
- 50 Gy in 20 fractions, 2.5 Gy per fraction
- Field 2-5cm max: 45 Gy in 15 fractions, 3 Gy per fraction
- Or 40 Gy in 10 fractions, 4 Gy per fraction (3# per week)
Field 2cm max: 30-35 Gy in 5 fractions, 6-7 Gy per fraction (2-3# per week)</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is comparing photodynamic therapy with radiation therapy (RT) for superficial skin cancer. You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and have received a biopsy-proven diagnosis of superficial basal cell carcinoma or Bowens disease, for which you have received no previous treatment. To be eligible, surgery should have also been ruled out as an appropriate option, either because it is too great a burden, you are not capable of having surgery (usually due to comorbidity), or you have refused surgery. Participants in this study will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive photodynamic therapy, which involves the application of a topical agent to the area to be treated, and then application of a certain type of light. A red light will be placed 5-8cm away from your skin surface for approximately 9 minutes. You will receive two sets of treatment 1-4 weeks apart. Participants assigned to the other group will receive radiation therapy, which involves highly-focused radiation from outside the body onto the lesion site to destroy cancerous cells.  Our primary aim is to test whether photodynamic therapy is as effective as radiation therapy in terms of control of Basal Cell Carcinoma and Bowen's Disease. We will assess this through the use of photographic assessment and questionnaires.  All participants will have photographs taken of the lesion before treatment, and at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years post-treatment to assess the cosmetic outcome of treatment. All participants will also be asked to complete questionnaires before treatment, and at 3 months, 1 year and 2 years post-treatment to assess the effect of treatment on quality of life and patient satisfaction. Cosmetic outcome and cost efficiency will also be assessed.</summary>
