  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Patients meeting all of the following criteria will be eligible to participate in the
        study:

          1. Patients who have given voluntary written informed consent to participate in this
             study prior to conducting Screening (Visit 1) procedures;

          2. Patients 18 years of age or older with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes;

          3. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who agree to use appropriate birth control
             (double-barrier methods, hormonal contraceptives, or intrauterine device) for the
             duration of the study (women of childbearing potential is defined as all women who are
             not surgically sterile or are not at least 1 year post menopausal). All women of
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at Visit 1;

          4. All men (unless surgically sterile, as defined below) who have sexual intercourse with
             a WOCBP must agree and commit to use a highly effective method of contraception for
             the duration of the study (defined as the time of the signing of the informed consent
             form through the conclusion of patient participation). Highly effective methods of
             contraception include:

             i. Male subjects agreeing that they and their female spouse/partners will use adequate
             contraception (2 forms of birth control, one of which must be barrier method) or be of
             non-childbearing potential.

             ii. To be considered surgically sterilized, a male partner must have had a vasectomy
             at least 24 weeks before Visit 1;

          5. At Visit 1, patients must have a history of overt diabetic nephropathy, as defined by
             the following:

               -  A SCr measurement =1.3 (=1.25)mg/dL (111 µmol/L) for females or =1.5 (=1.45)
                  mg/dL (128 µmol/L) for males;

               -  At Visit 1 or 1.1 24-hour urine collection PCR &gt;1200 mg/g (130 mg/µmol) and, if
                  applicable for PS phase, at Visit 1S or 1.1S a 24-urine collection PCR &gt;600 mg/g
                  (67 mg/µmol)

               -  For eligibility determination, laboratory reported values of PCR will be rounded
                  up to 2 significant digits (e.g. =1150 mg/g to 1200 mg/g; =595 mg/g to 600 mg/g),

          6. Patients must have a SCr measurement &lt;3.0 mg/dL (265 µmol/L);

          7. Patients must have an eGFR of =20 mL/min/1.73m2, using the 4-variable Modification of
             Diet in Renal Disease equation in which eGFR = 175 x (SCr(mg/dL))-1.154 x
             (Age(years))-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.212 if African American);

          8. Patient must have a second screening SCr measurement at Visit 1.1 or 1.1S taken 1 week
             (± 2 days) after screening (Visit 1 or 1S). The value of the second screening SCr
             measurement must be &lt;3.0 mg/dL (265 µmol/L) for both genders and within 25% of the
             first screening measurement;

          9. Patients must be taking a single ACE-I or ARB at a constant dose for at least 26 weeks
             prior to Visit 1, where the dose of the ACE-I or the ARB is considered appropriate for
             that patient (can be zero to max dose approved by the FDA) and it is anticipated that
             the same dose can and will be maintained throughout the course of the study;

         10. Patients taking any blood pressure medications in addition to an ACE-I or ARB,
             including diuretics, must be on a stable dose for 13 weeks prior to Visit 1 (and Visit
             1S if applicable) with a seated blood pressure of = 150/90 mmHg;

         11. Patients not taking any blood pressure medications, including diuretics, other than an
             ACE-I or ARB must have a seated blood pressure = 150/90 mmHg at Visit 1 (and Visit 1S
             if applicable) and a seated blood pressure considered appropriate for the patient and
             one that can be sustained throughout the study.</inclusivecriteria>
