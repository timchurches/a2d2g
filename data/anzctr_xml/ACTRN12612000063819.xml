  <interventions>
    <interventions>BRAVE is an online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme for children and adolescents with anxiety and has two versions: one for children aged 7-12 and another for adolescents aged 13 plus years. The two versions of the programme are age-appropriate and designed to meet the developmental and cognitive level of younger children or adolescents. BRAVE is delivered by internet at home to the child and parent. BRAVE consists of ten 1-hour child sessions, 5 (in adolescent version) or 6 (child version) parent sessions and two booster sessions. Information is presented through interactive exercises, text, colourful graphics, animation, quizzes, and games. To avoid activities being skipped, most exercises require a response before the next screen can be accessed. Homework exercises are set at the end of each session. If a child or young person misses a session, the system sends out automatic reminders. The sessions are designed to be completed sequentially at weekly intervals (the next available session becomes accessible seven days after the previous one is completed). The therapist (BRAVE trainer) sends weekly emails to the child and their parents, with encouragement and feedback based on the interactive exercises. The therapist  also phones the family to assist them to complete an exposure hierarchy around session 5 which takes approximately 15-30 minutes</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to trial BRAVE, an online computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT)  programme for children and adolescents with anxiety in Canterbury following the earthquakes.
BRAVE is an innovative programme for the treatment of anxiety in children and adolescents and it was found efficacious in Australian trials, but we need to ensure that its content and delivery method are acceptable to New Zealand children and their families and that, ultimately, the programme is effective in our community. If successful, BRAVE could be made widely accessible to help all  New Zealand children with anxiety.

We will conduct an open trial of BRAVE with 40 children and adolescents. All eligible participants will be interviewed using a structured diagnostic interview to determine diagnosis status and severity. The interviews will be repeated at 6 months post-intervention to test the effectiveness of BRAVE.  We will measure the extent of change and compare our results with the Australian trials using our primary outcome measure of anxiety diagnoses, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS).  Self and parent ratings of anxiety, mood and emotional/behavioural difficulties will be collected at baseline, post-intervention and at 6 months.

We will measure uptake, adherence and satisfaction with BRAVE. We will explore the acceptability of the programme for children and their families in the New Zealand context. We will compare the effect sizes achieved in the Australian evaluations of BRAVE for children and adolescents with anxiety, to determine whether this mode of therapy is equally effective in treating anxiety in children and adolescents affected by the Christchurch earthquakes.</summary>
