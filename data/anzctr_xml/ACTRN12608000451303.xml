  <interventions>
    <interventions>The currently used device name is the LBKSS.  The device is a permanent implant that is fixed on the femoral and tibial components of the knee.  The implant is achieved in a single surgery and left permanently in place. 
Each subject will undergo a surgical procedure to implant a permanent knee support device that is an alternative to traditional knee surgeries to treat osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Feasibility of Implantation - This outcome will be assessed post-operatively based on successful completion of implantation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Intra-operative</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of adverse events - The endpoint for the evaluation of the safe performance of the LBKSS will be the frequency, duration, severity and outcome of adverse events collected during the procedure and throughout the study. The relationship of each observed adverse event to the device and the procedure will be assessed and recorded.  The severity of the adverse event and its reported relation to the presence of an LBKSS will also be characterized. 

Types of possible complications include those associated with surgery (i.e., anesthesia complications, bleeding, infection) and possible complications associated with the device (i.e., allergic reaction, device dislocation or instability, fracture, pain or irritation, tissue wear).  Adverse events will be classified as to the severity and relationship to the device/procedure, using a scale of mild, moderate, or severe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The follow-up time points for the study are 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for the 5 year duration of the study.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Patient Reported Outcomes - Pain Status (Visual Analogue Scale), SF-36, Western Ontario and MacMaster University (WOMAC), Oxford Knee Score, Lysholm, Tegner, and Hospital for Special Surgery Scale (HSS)</outcome>
      <timepoint>All Questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals through 2 years.  Select questionnaires will also be administered annually through 5 years.

The follow-up time points for the study are 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter for the 5 year duration of the study.


SF-36, WOMAC, And HSS will be administered annually after the completion of the 24 month visit</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a multi-center, prospective, open label, feasibility study enrolling up to 30 patients. Safety and feasibility are the primary objectives based on completion of surgical implantation and analysis of reported and observed adverse events.  A series of validated subject-completed questionnaires, a visual analogue scale for pain and formal orthopaedic examination, will be performed over the course of the 60 months at the following intervals: baseline, 24-48 hours post-op, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months.  X-ray and/or MRI data will be collected pre-operatively and the following post operative intervals, 2 weeks, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months.</summary>
