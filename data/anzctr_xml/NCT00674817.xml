  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>GSK961081 is a potent dual pharmacophore that demonstrates both antimuscarinic and
      beta-agonist pharmacology in preclinical studies, both pharmacologies being of long duration.
      If reproduced in man, GSK961081 has the potential to deliver a medicine that can be given
      once daily. The bronchodilatation after inhalation of single doses of GSK961081 alone and in
      the presence of the short acting beta agonist salbutamol and the short acting muscarinic
      antagonist, ipratropium bromide will be measured in this study. Any residual
      bronchodilatation post-inhalation of GSK961081 and demonstrated by addition of salbutamol or
      ipratropium bromide may provide an indirect assessment of the beta-agonist and antimuscarinic
      components of GSK961081</summary>
