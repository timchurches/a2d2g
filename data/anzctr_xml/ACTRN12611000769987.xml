  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients in this study have intravascular devices (IVDs) used in medical, surgical, anaesthetic and intensive care departments, and include adult and paediatric patients. Consenting patients will have their IVD secured with one of the following randomly assigned dressings and securements:
 
Arm 1: Tissue Adhesive. Tissue Adhesive (TA) is medical grade superglue (cyanoacrylate) used mainly to close skin lacerations/wounds as an alternative to sutures and staples.

Arm 2: Bordered Polyurethane dressing.  Bordered polyurethane dressings (BPUs) retain the central polyurethane component of standard polyurethane dressings with an added external adhesive border of foam or cloth fabric. 

Arm 3: Sutureless Securement Device. Sutureless Stabilization Devices (SSD) are used in addition to SPUs. They have a large adhesive footplate underlying a pad on the skin plus an Intravascular Device-locking clasp, or 

Arm 4 (Control): Standard Polyurethane dressing. Standard Polyurethane dressings (SPUs) are commercially-made plastic film dressings which are transparent and semi-permeable (to oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour).
 
The randomly allocated dressing will be applied until completion of therapy.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group patients will have their intravascular devices secured with standard polyurethane (SPU) dressings (as per usual care) until completion of therapy</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>IVD failure.  

Composite of any unplanned IVD removal, prior to completion of therapy. This includes dislodgement (complete), occlusion (IVD will not infuse, or leakage occurs when fluid infused), phlebitis (2 or more of pain, redness, swelling and a palpable cord), and infection (laboratory confirmed local or bloodstream infection). A composite measure was chosen since IVD failure is the outcome of importance to patients, with poor securement taking various pathways to the same endpoint.

The primary outcome of device failure is an objective measure, assigned by clinical staff (not research staff or investigators). This is routine clinical practice. Research staff will collect the primary endpoint from the medical records with additional information obtained from the clinical staff/patients if required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of IVD removal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>IVD dwell time.

Research staff will calculate Time in hours from insertion until removal using relevant information as recorded by clinical staff on a 1 page data collection sheet at the patient?s bedside and in the patient?s medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of IVD removal.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Costs. Direct costs to the hospital for the total episode of care, including costs of device replacement in addition to the effects of dressing choice.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For the period of hospitalisation</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Types of IVD failure. Analysed as secondary outcomes (dislodgement, occlusion, phlebitis, and infection).

Clinical staff will visually inspect IVDs at removal and identify reason for IVD failure documenting same in patient medical record and on study data collection sheet. This is an objective measure, easily assigned by clinical staff (not research staff or investigators). This is routine clinical practice. Research staff will collect the secondary endpoint from the medical records with additional information obtained from the clinical staff/patients if required.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At time of IVD removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device colonisation (&gt;15cfu).

IVD cultures will be performed by the RNs on IVD removal. IVD specimens (distal segments) will be placed in sterile tubes, . transferred to the laboratory, and roll-plated for semi-quantitative culture. After 24 h incubation, plates will be examined for bacterial colony counts. The plates will then be re-incubated for 72 hrs to enable growth of slow-growing species. Species identification will be determined morphologically, biochemically and if required genetically (e.g. diagnostic PCR). Samples will be scored for presence of bacteria, the total colony forming units, and species present.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Tips cultured on device removal on clinical suspicion of infection plus a random subset of 10% of devices</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin colonisation (&gt;15cfu) from a random 10% subset of devices.

Skin cultures will be performed by the RNs on IVD removal. Moistened sterile swabs will be used to swab skin at the IVD wound and then placed in transport media. Samples will be transferred to the laboratory, where swabs will be streaked onto non-selective agar. After 24 h incubation, plates will be examined for bacterial colony counts. The plates will then be re-incubated for 72 hrs to enable growth of slow-growing species. Species identification will be determined morphologically, biochemically and if required genetically (e.g. diagnostic PCR). Samples will be scored for presence of bacteria, the total colony forming units, and species present</outcome>
      <timepoint>Whilst IVD in situ and on device removal</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient and staff satisfaction ranked on a 10 point scale</outcome>
      <timepoint>At device removal or within 24 hours of removal</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Research nurses (RNs) will screen patients daily and liaise heavily with the staff responsible for inserting the majority of IVDs (emergency departments, IVD insertion services, intensive care, medical registrars and anaesthetists). All eligible patients (or their representative) will be approached for written informed consent by the RN or inserter. If this is given, the staff member will ring a telephone-based, randomisation service customised for the trial and be advised of group allocation. Computer generated allocation is provided by an independent randomisation service. Allocation is fully concealed until the patient is randomised.</concealment>
    <sequence>Computer generated. Randomisation will be stratified by device type (venous or arterial IVD) and by hospital site. Randomisation will be in a 1:1:1:1 ratio between the four study groups. Block randomisation will be used with random variation in block size.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Going to hospital usually means having an intravascular device (IV drip) in your vein or artery. Almost half of all IV drips fall out or fail because they are not well secured to the skin. This means patients miss out on treatment and have extra painful needlesticks to insert new devices. Serious infections can also occur. This study will find the best dressings to use on IV drips. Patients will have their drips glued in with medical superglue, or have one of two new dressings, compared with current usual care.</summary>
