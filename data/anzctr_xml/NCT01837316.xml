             History of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled cross-over study in 32 adult
      subjects with moderately severe asthma. In this study the bronchodilator effect of a single
      morning dosing of FF/VI combination 100/25 mcg will be determined by spirometry. After the
      screening the subject will be randomized and will be assigned to one of two treatment
      sequences (AB or BA, where A is placebo and B is FF/VI 100/25 mcg). Between the two treatment
      periods there will be a washout period of 7-14 days. A serial forced expiratory volume in one
      second (FEV1) measurements will be taken at 15, 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and
      72 hours post dose. Safety assessments will include vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs),
      adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests however, these will not constitute
      study endpoints. The results of the study will provide supporting information to prescribers
      on the bronchodilator effect of FF/VI over 72 hours.</summary>
