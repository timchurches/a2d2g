  <interventions>
    <interventions>Determine the latency time of anesthesia of four commonly anesthetics used in Podiatry. We will have 4 arms:

Arm 1: Bupivacaine 0,5% 
Arm 2: Bupivacaine 0,5% + ephinefrine 1:200.000
Arm 3: Lidocaine 2%
Arm 4: Lidocaine 2% + epinephrine 1:100.000

The dose administered: 2cc of anesthetic solution
- The duration of administration: 20 seconds
- The mode of administration: dorsal subcutaneous digital block.

Each group are considered comparator/control of the others groups

The infiltration with local anesthetisc will be do by a podiatrist-researcher specialized in toe surgery with 4 years experience.

We will select healthy volunteers, who sign a consent form and a healthy test to determine his health and determine inclusion criteria (ASA I) . The participants will be randomly allocated to one of the four groups using a randomisation table created by computer software.

A assistant will prepare the anesthetic solution and he will give the preparation to the researcher, who will infíltrate the patient. The patients and the researcher are blind to the type of local anaesthesia.  We will infíltrate 2cc of local anesthetics solution in the second toe single dorsal approach. The maximum time of infiltration is 20 seconds.


One assitant will start the chronometer after administration and stopping when the patient has no pain after the pin prick test, Every 10 second we will do a pin prick test in infiltrated toe to determine the pain sensitivity, until the participand has no pain, we record data of latency time in a logsheet. We will repeat until the participant has no pain manifestation.

To Assessed the local anesthetic safety profile we controlled the SO2 (oxigen saturation) with a Blood Oxygen Monitor in the infiltred toe and we compared the oxigen flow among groups. We controled the oxigen saturation after antesthetic adminitration  (1 min, 3 min, 5 min, 10 min,20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, 50 minutes, 60 minutes). We register a safety curve with the data of the differents groups.

The study procedure will be conducted at clinical area of Seville University (Spain)

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to establish if the latency time of anesthesia is conditioned by the use or not of epinephrine and if the use of epinephrine increase or decrease its latency time. The second purpose of the study is to establish a latency time of anesthesia of four commonly used agents (bupivacaine and lidocaine, with or without epinephrine).The Third purpose determine the safety of epinephrine use in toes-

Hypothesis: The adition of epinephrine to local anesthetics decrease the latency time of anesthesia
