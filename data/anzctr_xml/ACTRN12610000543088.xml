  <interventions>
    <interventions>All particiapnats will attend a single self managment seminar prior to commencement of the intervention. Self management for BCRL includes simplified self massage, exercise, the use of compression and appropriate skin care.
The intervention group will also attend Yoga classes. Yoga practice including adapted physical postures, guided relaxation and meditation delivered as 4 X weekly group classes of 90 minutes duration and home practice of 30 minutes 6X per week
