  <interventions>
    <interventions>It will be assess sacroiliacal joints using specific tests:
POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TEST
The test is performed supine and the patient's hip flexed to an angle of 90 degrees on the side to be examined: light manual pressure is applied to the patient's flexed knee along the longitudinal axisis of the femur while the pelvis is stabilized by the examiner's other hand resting on the patients contralateral superior anterior iliac spine. The test is positive when the patient feels localized pain deep in the gluteal area on the provoked side. 
PATRICK'S FABER TEST 
The patient lies supine: one leg is flexed, abducted and externally rotated so that the heel rests on the opposite knee. The examiner presses gently on the superior aspect of the tested knee joint. If pain is felt in the sacroiliacal joints or in the symphysis the test is considered positive. 
SYMPHYSIS PAIN PALPATION TEST
The patient lies supine. The entire front side of the pubic symphysis is palpated gently. If the palpation causes pain that persists more than 5 s after removal of the examiner's hand, it is recorded as pain. If the pain disappears within 5 s it is recorded as tenderness. 
LONG DORSAL SACROILIAC LIGAMENT TEST
The  patient lies on her side with slight flexion in both hip and knee joints. If the palpation causes pain that persists for more than 5 seconds after removal of the examiner's hand, it is recorded as pain. If the pain disappears within 5 s it is recorded as tenderness. 
ACTIVE STRAIGHT LEG RAISE TEST (ASLR test)
The patient lies supine with straight legs  and feet 20 cm apart. The test is performed after the instruction try to raise your legs, one after another, above the couch for 20 cm without bending the knee. The patient is asked to score any feeling of impairment (on the both sides separately) on a 6-point scale: not difficult at all=0, minimally difficult=1, somewhat difficult=2, fairly difficult=3, very difficult=4, unable to do=5. The scores on both sides are added so that the sum score can range from 0 to 10. 
MODIFY TRENDELENBURGS TEST
The patient stands on one leg and flexes the hip and knee at 90 degrees. If pain is experienced in the symphysis the test is considered positive. 
VISUAL ANALOG PAIN SCALE
Visual analog pain scale assesses the severity of pain on a numerical scale from 0 to 10, where 0 means  absence of pain and 10 severe pain.
QUEBEC SCALE
Quebec scale assesses the degree of disability in activities of daily living in pregnant women. Estimated twenty daily activities (out of bed, sleeping during the night, turning in bed, driving, standing 20 to 30 minutes, sitting for hours, climbing stairs, short walk (300 to 400m), long walks (a few kilometres), reach items on shelves, throwing the ball, short running (100m), taking food from refrigerator, making beds, wear socks, bending in the tub, moving chairs, opening doors, carrying two bags from the store, lifting and carrying things) on scale from 0 to 5  where 0 means performing activities without difficulty, 1 means performing activities with minimal difficulty, 2 means performing activities with some difficulty, 3 means performing activities with moderate difficulty, 4 means performing activities with greater difficulty and 5 means inability to performing activities.
All participants will undergo all of these tests.Tests will take a half an hour. Every day we will assess 12 participants every a half an hour over 6 months, at each individual session, supervised one on one with an physiotherapist. Each participants will only come in for a single visit, the test will take half an hour for each participants.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: Sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy leads to a reduction in quality and limit the activities of daily living in pregnant women. Causes of development sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy are combination of hormonal, biomechanical, circulatory and physiological changes. The purpose of this research is the ability to detect sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy using specific tests of physiotherapy assessment, detection incidence of sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy and to detect  sacroiliacal dysfunction by trimesters of pregnancy. Materials and methods: The sample consisted of an experimental group, 450 pregnant women in each trimester, which means that total number of pregnant women who were included in study was 1350 (N=1350). Over experimental group was conducted cohort study. In study were used following tests: posterior pelvic pain provocation test, Patricks-Faber test, modified Trendelenburg test, ASRL test, symphisis pain palpation test, long dorsal sacroiliacal ligament test, visual analog pain scale and QUEBEC scale. Results and discussion: For statistical analyses it will be used calculated the frequency (for determining the incidence of sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy and by trimesters of pregnancy) and t-test for high paired samples (for determining the existence and/or absence of statistically significant differences). Results should indicate the presence and/or absence of sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy, the incidence of sacroiliacal dysfunction by trimesters of pregnancy and possibility of detection sacroiliacal dysfunction using specific tests of physiotherapy assessment. Using Visual analog pain scale and Quebec scale are expected to detect intensity of pain and degree of disability during everyday activities in pregnant women. Conclusion: Application of diagnostic methods (CT, MRI, X-rays, fluorescent injection) during pregnancy is limited and it is necessary to rely on physiotherapy assessment in the diagnosis of sacroiliacal dysfunction. However, detection of sacroiliacal dysfunction during pregnancy is difficult of the lack of objective standards so.gold standards. The research results should detect incidence of sacroiliacal dysfunction in pregnancy and by trimesters of pregnancy and indicated that during pregnancy can/can not detect occurrence of sacroiliacal dysfunction using combination of specific physiotherapy assessment tests.</summary>
