    <statisticalmethods>With an expected drop out rate of 10 percent and a sample size of 25, the effective sample size will be 23. Power calculations are generated based on the effective sample size of 23.

a) Safety and tolerability
The probability of observing at least one subject experience an adverse event in a sample of 23 subjects receiving the additional treatment (including 5 percent dropout) is 0.99, if the probability of that event occurring is assumed to be 0.2. If the proportion of people who experience an adverse event is greater than 0.5, we will be able to say with 80 percent power and 5 percent statistical significance, that the probability of an adverse event is greater than 0.2.

b) Efficacy
Previous studies have shown that the median time to recurrence is 6.9 months for newly diagnosed GBM patients. If we are to compare to the historical median progression free survival time of 6.9 months, our study based on 23 patients will allow us to conclude with 5 percent significance and 80 percent power that the therapy has increased median progression free survival time. This calculation is performed assuming an accrual time of 24 months and follow-up of 18 months. Furthermore, the results from this study will allow us to design an adequately powered Phase III trial.

Overall survival and progression free survival will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method separately. Median Progression free survival will be determined using this methodology and 95 percent confidence interval will be calculated. Response rate and clinical benefit rate will be estimated with 95 percent confidence interval. Survival curves will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences will be tested using log-rank test statistics, p values less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is assessing the efficacy,  safety and tolerability of using T cell therapy targeting human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in treating brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme ). 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, have been diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme , and have not yet begun standard treatment for this disease .

Trial details:
Patients will be eligible if they have been recently diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme and are about to begin standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens.  A blood sample will be taken from patients prior to beginning standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy, in order to grow the cells for the experimental therapy. These cells, known as T cells (a type of white blood cell) will be grown in the laboratory from each patients blood sample.   After completing standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimens, all participants in this study will receive treatment with killer T cells (a type of white blood cell) which have been grown in the laboratory from the participants own white blood cells. Treatment consists of up to 6 infusions of T cells (given fortnightly or monthly, depending on the standard treatment regimen), and patients are monitored for 12 months afterwards to see if treatment is safe and to measure any reduction in tumour and amount of virus in the blood. 

Recent studies suggest that most gliomas carry a common virus, called human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which is normally controlled by killer T cells. The study aims to see if killer T cells grown in the laboratory and trained to recognise  components of the virus  can also kill HCMV infected gliomas. The standard first-line treatment is usually surgery, radiotherapy and a chemotherapy drug called temozolomide. If the cancer then grows back, there are no known effective treatments.
