    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A child who meets eligibilty criteria is enrolled and randomised to receive either azithromycin or placebo within strata of age (&lt;6months and =/&gt; 6 months) and ethnicity (Indigenous or non Indigenous).
Each child is allocated to the next randomly ordered treatment regime on a computer-generated list (permutated block design).  The treatment allocation is concealed by sticker until enrollment. Medications are in identical bottles labelles A, B, C or D (two codes per treatment).  A person independent of the study is responsible for allocating the treatment code and concealing the treatment allocation.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomisation sequence is generated from the website 'Randomization.com' (http://www.randomization.com) and concealed by a person not involved in the study.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In a previous study on bronchiolitis in Aboriginal children we found that 67% were from remote communties and required retrievals.  A recent study has also shown that almost 2.5% of Aboriginal children in Australia's Northern Territory will be hospitalised for bronchiolitis more than once before reaching the age of 18 months.  Multiple hospitalised respiratory infections and the severity of these  infections are risk factors for developing chronic lung diseases including bronchiectisis and asthma.  It is  planned that this study will provide an estimation of the effect of azithromycin on the severity of bronchiolitis in Aboriginal and non Aboriginal infants.  Assessing redmission for respiratory  illness within 6 months may provide some indication of the medium term benefit of a single dose of azithromycin, given to infants in the acute phase of viral bronchiolitis, in reducing the risk of further respiratory illness requiring hospitalisation.</summary>
