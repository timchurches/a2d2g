  <interventions>
    <interventions>24 hours intravenous antibiotic therapy followed by oral antibiotics to a maximum of 10 days.  
Intravenous antibiotics: We recommend flucloxacillin 2 grams given over 20-30 minutes every 6 hours, or cephazolin 2 grams given over 20-30 minutes 2-3 times daily (2 times daily if given at home, or 3 times daily if given in the hospital). Any antibiotic with acitvity against Steptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. is however allowable. The antibiotic used may differ according to patient allergies, but not physician discretion.
Following 24 hours of intravenous therapy patients are switched to oral antibiotics for 9 days. Total duration of antibiotics is 10 days.
Oral antibiotics: flucloxacillin 500 mg 4 times daily or cephalexin 500 mg 4 times daily. These medicines are administered by the patient, but are approximately at 6 hour intervals. Any antibiotic with acitvity against Steptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. is however allowable depending on patient allergies.

Adherence to oral treatment is determined by drug tablets remaining at study visits at days 3-4 and 7-10.</interventions>
    <comparator>72 hours or more intravenous antibiotic therapy determined by clinician preference followed by oral antibiotics to a maximum of 10 days.
Intravenous antibiotics: We recommend flucloxacillin 2 grams 4 tines daily infused over 20-30 minutes, or cephazolin 2 grams infused over 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times daily. Antibiotics are administered twice daily if patients are at home, or 3 times daily if they are in hospital. Any antibiotic with acitvity against Steptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. is however allowable depending on patient allergies but not according to physician discretion.

Following 72 hours or more of intravenous therapy patients are switched to oral antibiotics for the number of days remaining after IV therapy to total 10 days.
Oral antibiotics: flucloxacillin 500 mg 4 times daily or cephalexin 500 mg 4 times daily.
Any antibiotic with acitvity against Steptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. is however allowable depending on patient allergies.

Resolution of fever at visit 2 (72-96 hours).
Absence of progression of skin &amp; subcutaneous abnormalities at visit 2.
Absence of ongoing requirement for antibiotic therapy beyond the study period of 10 days.

      <timepoint>10 days</timepoint>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical resolution of erysipelas or cellulitis measured by blinded photographic assessment of affected lower limb
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Assessed at 3-4 days and 7-10 days at study visits when photos are taken and later compared with the photo of the affected area on recruitment by a blinded reviewer.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events include reactions to an antibiotic, such as a rash, or diarrhoea, or an infected intravenous cannula in the setting of intravenous therapy. All antibiotics administered intravenously are first administered in the hospital setting to observe patients for allergic reactions. Patients on intravenous antibiotics at home are reviewed twice daily at home, where they are asked about any new symptoms, and their cannula is inspected for signs of infection. Patients who are on oral antibiotics at home are reviewed at visits 2 (days 3-4) and 3 (days 7-10), and are asked to contact study coordinators if they develop any reactions. </outcome>
      <timepoint>10 days</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Disease recurrence within 30 days will be assessed via a telephone follow-up at day 30, where patients are questioned about their recovery and any recurrence of cellulitis since their 3rd visit at days 7-10.</outcome>

Randomisation for the study will be performed prior to the initiation of participant recruitment via random block allocation. </concealment>
    <sequence>Allocation of participants to either the short-course or standard course treatment arms of the study will be completed on enrolment into the study. Participants will be allocated the envelope with the lowest available study number, and allocation will then occur in ascending numeric order.
Sequentially numbered, opaque, tamper-evident envelopes will contain a slip with the treatment allocation. The participantâ€™s basic information including initials, unique study number and date of birth will be entered on this slip, and the number on the envelope will indicate the unique study number for that participant. A separate master list will be maintained containing the 8 digit participant number and initials, date of birth and hospital UR number of the participant.

    <statisticalmethods>Non-inferiority of short-course treatment will be assessed by comparing the tail of a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of successful resolution of cellulitis between the two treatment arms, with the stated non-inferiority margin of 10%. 
Sample size is calculated based on the one-sided hypothesis test for the difference of two proportions. Assuming an efficacy rate of 90% for both treatment arms, a one-sided significance of 2.5% and 80% power, to reject the null hypothesis of inferiority with a margin of 10% requires a sample size of at least 284 (142 in each arm).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cellulitis and erysipelas are common skin infections, and it is not known what the ideal duration of IV therapy is for treatment. This is a trial which commenced at Barwon Health in November 2012 is provisionally planned for expansion to multiple sites in Australia to study whether a short-course of IV therapy is not inferior to longer duration IV therapy. Over 300 participants are required for this trial. 

Patients who attend Geelong hospital emergency department, hospital wards, or hospital in the home (HITH) programs with a diagnosis of cellulitis and are planned for IV therapy are currently reviewed to determine if they fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the trial. Those who meet the criteria and agree to participate are consented to participation in the trial, and are then randomly allocated to either IV therapy of 72 hours or more (as an inpatient or on hospital in the home) or 24 hours IV therapy, both followed by oral therapy for a maximum of 10 days. Antibiotics that are used are those ordinarily recommended for cellulitis and are not experimental. 

Each participant is involved for approximately one month, including 3 visits over the first 10 days and a follow-up phone contact at Day 30. In order to determine that short course IV therapy is safe and effective when compared to longer durations, we measure the following things to determine that cellulitis has resolved: 
1)	That fever has resolved at 72-96 hours 
2)	That skin abnormalities have not gotten worse at Days 7-10 
3)	That ongoing antibiotic therapy is not required after 10 days. 
We also measure; time taken for fever to resolve, pain as reported by the patient, photos of the affected leg over the first 10 days, and whether there are any side effects that patients experience while on this trial. At 30 days the patient is telephoned to check that their cellulitis has not recurred.
