    <summary>This is a phase II, exploratory, open-label, single arm study of BYL719 monotherapy, a
      selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) alpha inhibitor, in adult patients with
      advanced metastatic breast cancer progressing after first line therapy. Patients with
      advanced hormone receptor positive tumors will be required to have an alteration of the PI3K
      pathway. Those patients with advanced triple negative breast cancers are genetically
      unselected for this study.</summary>
