  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to examine whether patients who have acute or early chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be treated effectively and safely with an
      interferon-sparing regimen that combines a new direct acting antiviral drug (sofosbuvir) with
      one of the standard treatments for chronic hepatitis C (ribavirin). In particular, this study
      will investigate whether treatment of acute or early chronic HCV can be shortened. The study
      will assess efficacy by looking at the proportion of people who clear the virus (have no
      virus detectable in their blood) at the end of treatment, and 1, 3 and 6 months after
      treatment.

      The hypothesis is that short course (6 weeks) dual therapy using sofosbuvir and RBV will
      result in successful virological eradication in the majority (=80%) of subjects treated for
      recently acquired HCV.</summary>
