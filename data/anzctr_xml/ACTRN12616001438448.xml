    <interventions>This is a single centre, randomised, double-blind phase 1 study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administrations of CSL312 in healthy subjects.

Subjects can participate in only 1 dose group and will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of either CSL312 or placebo by IV infusion or SC injection (abdomen). Study drugs will be administered at the study site by study staff. CSL312 is a fully human recombinant anti-FXIIa antibody (Factor XIIa antagonist monoclonal antibody), solution for injection.

The dose and infusion volume will be based upon the subject's body weight and the allowable drug concentration. Dose escalation requires Safety Review Committee review of available blinded safety, tolerability, PK and selected Pharmacodynamic (PD) data. 
Eight groups of 6 subjects are planned; 5 groups for IV administration and 3 groups for SC administration. Dosing and initial dose escalation will begin with the IV groups, and upon reaching the third IV group, the study will progress to the SC groups. Dose escalation within the IV and SC groups will then progress in parallel with the SC groups staggered to start after initial dosing in their respective IV groups. For all IV groups and the first SC group, 2 sentinel subjects per group will be randomised to receive CSL312 or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, and the remaining 4 subjects per group will be randomised to receive CSL312 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>Placebo (formulation buffer without CSL312) will be administered as an IV infusion or SC injection at the same frequency, volume and duration as the CSL312 infusion(s) / injection(s).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single centre, randomised, double-blind phase 1 study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single ascending doses of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administrations of CSL312 in healthy subjects.
A maximum of 48 subjects will be randomised into this study. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomised to receive either CSL312 or placebo. Dosing and initial dose escalation will begin within the IV groups, and upon reaching the third IV cohort, the study will also progress to an SC group. Dose escalation within the IV and SC groups will then progress in parallel with the SC cohorts staggered to start after sentinel dosing in their respective IV cohorts.
Blood samples will be collected at various time points for safety, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) evaluation, and immunogenicity (anti-CSL312 antibodies). Clinical evaluations will include electrocardiograms, vital signs, and physical examinations.
Safety follow-up will occur until approximately 84 days after dosing.</summary>
