  <interventions>
    <interventions>We would like to assess how fast basal cell carcinomas grow whilst patients are waiting for surgery on an elective basis.

The possiblities that can occur whilst observing these skin cancers are;
- No change in size
- Increase in size
- Reduction in size

This is an observation of what happens in the public hospital system compared to a private practice. No intervention will be done.

We aim to observe patients over a 9-12 month period.

The observation will be done at baseline and secondly at the time of surgery. The difference in sizes will be documented.</interventions>
    <comparator>Comparator group are the patients who undergo their surgery at a private practice.

Observation will occur over a 9-12 month period as well.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 1: Rate of basal cell carcinoma growth.

Measurements will be recorded by direct measurement with a ruler after the skin cancer is traced on transparent paper.

The second method will be with photographic measures with digital imaging.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 1: from baseline (that is, when first seen by a specialist oculoplastic surgeon) and secondly at the time of  surgery at the public hospital / private practice.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Factors that predict fast rate of basal cell carcinoma growth. The factors studied in this trial include:

1: Age
2: Sex
3: Immunosuppression
4: Previous skin cancer
5: Primary vs. recurrent skin cancer
6: Type of basal cell carcinoma

The above factors will be assessed using statistical analysis (correlation analysis) to determine if the above factors are statistically significant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoints for all the above: 9-12 months

It will be assessed at baseline - first specialist appointment with oculoplastic surgeon and secondly at the time of surgery.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we would like to assess the effect of waiting time on the growth of basal cell carcinomas or BCC's (a type of skin cancer) in the periocular (around the eye) region.

BCCs have traditionally been regarded as slow growing tumours that can take up to 10-15 years to double in size. However, this evidence is anecdotal and based more on self-reported cases rather than comprehensive studies. It is our experience that BCCs in the New Zealand population could double in size at a much faster rate.

We would also like to know if there are any patient-related factors that can predict which cancers will grown more quickly than others. This information could help us triage patients to having earlier surgery and how quickly we send certain patients to have surgery.</summary>
