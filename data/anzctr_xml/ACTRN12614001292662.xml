  <interventions>
    <interventions>All participants will receive an intravenous infusion of CRLX301 once every 3 weeks or once a week. 
The dosage of CRLX301 will be dependent on the cohort to which the participant is recruited. In Phase I, participants will be recruited to dose escalation cohorts in a step wise manner at increasing doses of CRLX301 until MTD (maximum tolerated dose). Provisional doses are:

Schedule 1 (once every 3 weeks dosing)
Cohort 1: 7.5 mg/m2
Cohort 2: 15 mg/m2
Cohort 3: 30* mg/m2
Cohort 4: 45* mg/m2
Cohort 5: 60 mg/m2
Cohort 6: 75 mg/m2
Cohort 7: 90 mg/m2
Cohort 8: 105 mg/m2
Cohort 9: 120 mg/m2
Cohort 10 (plus additional cohorts): 135 mg/m2 (increase dose levels by 15 mg/m2 for additional cohorts)
*The Safety Review Committee (SRC) is allowed to dose escalate from 30 mg/m2 to as high as 60 mg/m2. 

Schedule 2 (once a week dosing)
Cohort -1: 20 mg/m2
Cohort 1: 25 mg/m2
Cohort 2: 30 mg/m2
Cohort 3: 35 mg/m2
Cohort 4: 40 mg/m2
Cohort 5: 45 mg/m2
Cohort 6: 50 mg/m2
Additional cohorts: increase dose levels by 5 mg/m2 for additional cohorts or as recommended by SRC

In Phase 2a, all subjects will be treated at the dose determined in Phase 1 and cohort recruitment will be dependent on tumor type.

Treatment continues until progression of disease, dose limiting toxicity, or other protocol specified reason for study discontinuation.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of a new drug known as CRLX301 that can safely be given to patients with advanced solid tumours. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above, and have a confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor malignancy that is refractory (i.e. has not responded to treatment), or not a candidate for standard therapy. 

Study details
All participants in this study will be treated with the study drug, CRLX301, which is administered intravenously (i.e. directly into the vein). CRLX301 is a combination of a chemotherapy drug called "docetaxel" and a polymer (group of the same molecules bound together). The docetaxel is attached to the polymer and forms into tiny beads called nanoparticles. The nanoparticles circulate in the blood stream and may eventually build up in tumours, allowing more of the chemotherapy drug, docetaxel, to get into tumour cells and kill them. The CRLX301 nanoparticle with docetaxel inside is larger than docetaxel alone. Therefore, it is hoped that less of it may enter normal healthy cells, so that normal healthy cells are not harmed.

The study has 2 parts. In the first part of the study (Part 1) participant groups will receive increasing doses of CRLX301 once every 3-weeks or once a week schedule if tolerated. If the dose causes significant side effects that are intolerable for patients, then no additional patients will be enrolled at a higher dose. In the second part of the study (Part 2), participants will receive the highest dose of CRLX301 which is not expected to cause significant side effects that would require stopping the dosing of study drug. 

Participation in the study will require frequent clinic visits (at least weekly), to assess participants health and monitor side effects. Some visits may take up to 8 hours. Most other visits will last 2 - 3 hours depending on procedures required. These may be include: blood and urine sampling; physical examination; vital signs; medical history, performance status, concomitant medications and adverse events (AE) assessment; CT and bone scans; ECG; and tumour biopsy (second part of study only). After receiving CRLX301, additional blood samples will be required for some participants at 1 and 3 days; and 1 and possibly 2 weeks. Participants will continue to receive CRLX301 once every 3-weeks or weekly, unless they experience adverse events, in which case their CRLX301 may be delayed/given at a lower dose, or they may stop CRLX301. If participants experience unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, CRLX301 will be stopped and the participant will return for a safety follow up visit.

It is hoped that CRLX301 can be used to treat people with more chemotherapy in the tumour and with fewer effects on normal cells than with docetaxel alone.
