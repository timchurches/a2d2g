  <interventions>
    <interventions>4 months duration (February to June 2007).
The installation of a new observation chart into 4 wards (two at The Canberra Hospital and two at Calvary Hosptial) which was colour coded for a modified early warning score.
The modified early warning score was utilised as a track and trigger system whereby if the score reached more than 4, a junior doctor was contacted by the bedside nurse to review and manage the patient within a 30 minute timeframe. The Medical Emergency Team (MET) could be contacted if the patient fulfilled standard MET criteria.
In order for the wards to be part of the pilot program, more than 50% of the healthcare workers needed to have undertaken a novel education package, COMPASS. This was a program that bought physiology to the bedside and informed people of the use of the SBAR communication tool. (Situation, Background, Assessment, Response).
The data will be collected from case records of the patients in a deidentified manner.</interventions>
    <comparator>The historical group was obtained from the same four wards during the same part of calendar in 2006 (Feb to June 2006)
During this time, there was no change to the usual patient care so that there was no added education on the deteriorating patient and the general observation chart was utilised with no colour coding and no track and trigger system. Patient review relied on either the nurse contacting the doctor with their concerns or calling for a Medical Emergency Team (MET) if they fulfilled the standard criteria for a MET.
The data will be collected from the patient's case records in a deidentified manner.</comparator>

The data will be collected from the two hospitals' intensive care databases. Unplanned admissions are those that are not elective surgical patients or those that come from the emergency department.</outcome>

eg: Medical Emergency Team Review
From data from the hospitals' switch board and followed up with the relevant patient case record.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Patient adverse events occur in up to 17% of all hospital admissions. One contributing factor is the failure to recognise and appropriately manage deteriorating patients on the general ward. The ability to detect early deterioration allows early appropriate intervention and reduces unplanned admissions to intensive care unit (ICU) and unexpected deaths. In this study, a new ward observation chart will be installed into four wards (2 at The Canberra Hospital [TCH], 2 at Calvary Hospital [CH]), which will allow the recording of a modified early warning score. High scores will automatically trigger the nurse at the bedside to call an appropriately qualified medical practitioner for a timely review of the patient and initiate earlier management. We will review the morbidity and mortality of patients before and after this intervention</summary>
