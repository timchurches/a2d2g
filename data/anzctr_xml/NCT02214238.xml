  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PAP Treatment Efficacy - The participants apnea hypopnea index (AHI) will be assessed using the PSG data, device download data and the independent pressure-flow logger. The apnea-hypopnea index is the total number of sleep disordered breathing events divided by total sleep time.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 night in the sleep lab and 3 weeks use of the device in the home.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PAP Treatment Comfort - Participants will be administered comfort questionnaires regarding the comfort of all devices. The range of responses is 1 to 5 with 1 being very uncomfortable to 5 being very comfortable.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 night in the sleep lab and 3 weeks use of the device in the home.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>PAP Compliance - Participants therapy utilisation will be compared between the two devices using the device data download, and the independent pressure-flow logger.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After 1 night in the sleep lab and 3 weeks use of the device in the home.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will test the hypothesis that the modified positive airway pressure (PAP) device
      for OSA will be no worse than a market released product in terms of its treatment efficacy,
      comfort and patient compliance. Patients will have their treatment pressure titrated using
      polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory, and then in a random order will spend
      additional time undergoing PSG using both devices, and using both devices at home for 3
      weeks. Data will be collected from the PSG studies, device downloads, independent
      pressure-flow loggers, and custom questionnaires.</summary>
