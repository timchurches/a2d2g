  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double blind, randomised crossover trial. A single experienced doctor will perform all of the lumbar punctures (LP) under general anaesthesia. A standard LP needle (PORTLAND) will be used. Orientation of the bevel will be parallel to the long axis of the dural fibres. The doctor cannot be blinded to the needle type. All children will be given a sequence of 4 LP's during their treatment for cancer. Twice with each of the 22g and 25g LP needles. Following each procedure, parents will be given a 1 page questionnaire by the RA. The same RA will phone interview them on days 1, 3, and 7 with the same questions. On day 7 more detailed questions will be asked if the patient experiences any headache. These questions will look into issues such as, timing of headache, analgesia required and functional impact on the family.</interventions>
