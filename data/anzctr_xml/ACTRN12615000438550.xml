  <interventions>
    <interventions>There are two arms to this trial. Arm 1: Enhanced Monitoring. Arm 2: Treatment as Usual. Enhanced Monitoring involves patients being assessed by telephone after hospital discharge at 1, 3, and 9 months by a psychologist, and if patient indicates psychological problems they are referred to local specialists for treatment. Treatment as Usual involves being assessed by telephone by a psychologist at 1, 3, and 9 months but there is no specific referrals. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 9-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9.5 months.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as Usual includes follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 9 months following hospital discharge. At the 9 month assessment patients will be sent to specialist referral if needed. The duration of the study for any participant will conclude after the 9-month follow-up assessment, resulting in participation duration of 9.5 months.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The rationale of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of enhanced monitoring and referral to specialist services as a means of reducing PTSD after traumatic injury. This study compares the relative effectiveness of (a) Enhanced Monitoring and Referral, and (b) Treatment as Usual in reducing posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. It is
hypothesised that Enhanced Monitoring and will lead to greater symptom reduction than Treatment as Usual.    </summary>
