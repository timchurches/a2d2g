    <interventions>The online program, Coping, available at, https://e.unisa.edu.au/course/view.php?id=38.   The program, based on the Coping Planning approach to suicide prevention, comprises two self-paced online modules (Self-care and problem-solving) that are completed sequentially.  The modules include videos, text, videos and online activities to promote learning.   The modules can be completed in one sitting or over a period of a week.   The estimated time to complete the program is one hour.  The program is based on the Coping Planning approach to suicide prevention (Stallman, 2017)..  Participants receive a Completion Certificate after all learning activities are completed.  The certificate will be emailed to the research team as evidence of completion.  Partial completion is assessed using program analytics.
