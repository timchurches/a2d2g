Treatment: devices: Standard Holter/Investigational patch
The standard Holter and Investigational patch will be worn simultaneously for 24 hours. A single follow-up visit will follow in 2 days to remove both systems which will be sent away for analysis with the results of the standard system used, if pertinent, for patient management.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the *diagnostic yield and *ECG signal quality of the standard Holter with that of the Simple ECG Monitoring patch - Diagnostic yield is the proportion of patients for whom an arrhythmogenic source of symptoms is established, or ruled out. The two systems will be correlated following completion of blinded batch reviews.
ECG signal quality is scoring the ability of each system to record electrical activity from the atrium (P-waves)using the following scale: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Non-existent.</outcome>
      <timepoint>24 Hours</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Skin comfort or discomfort: Was skin irritated? - User will rate skin comfort on a pre-determined scale: none, mild, moderate, severe.
Clinician will examine and rate patient's skin irritation when device is removed, using a pre-determined scale: none, mild, moderate, severe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device comfort - Was device comfortable to wear? User will rate on a pre-determined scale: very uncomfortable, mildly uncomfortable, comfortable.
Was device inconspicuous under clothing? User will rate on a pre-determined scale: conspicuous, inconspicuous.
Was ability to sleep affected by wearing the device? User will rate on a pre-determined scale: yes, no.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Device stability and contact - Did the device stay in place in the chest location where it was attached? Clinician will evaluate visually, and rate on a pre-determined scale: yes, no.</outcome>
      <timepoint>48 Hours</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>User interface - Was the patient able to access the button on the device to 'mark' events, such as sensing an episode of palpitations? User will rate on a pre-determined scale: Yes, no.
Did the clinician find the device easy to attach to patient? Clinician will rate on a pre-determined scale with a rating of 1 through 5: 1 = very easy to attach and 5 = very hard to attach.
Did the clinician find the device easy to remove from the patient? Clinician will rate on a pre-determined scale with a rating of 1 through 5: 1 = very easy to remove and 5 = very hard to remove.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this research is to simplify the standard recording system of the heart
      rhythm. The investigators desire to improve the ease of monitoring the cardiac rhythm for 24
      hours. The investigators intent is to use a very small, innovative monitoring patch system
      that relieves the patient of wearing a cumbersome and uncomfortable recording system. This
      research trial will carry the title "The Simple ECG Monitoring" for Comparison of a Sternal
      ECG Recording System with a Standard ECG Recording System for Holter Monitoring. The data
      from the investigational device is for comparative purposes only. It will not be used by
      medical personnel for study subject treatment or diagnostic purposes.</summary>
