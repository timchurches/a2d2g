  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention for families, partners and carers is based on a relational model grounded in developed treatment guidelines (Project Air Strategy for Personality Disorders 2011). The group intervention includes a brief intervention workshop focusing on psychoeducation regarding personality disorders and awareness of relationship dynamics. The workshop is followed by group sessions (total of 8 hours) focussing on practical skills training in managing challenging relationship dynamics and enhancing support options. The duration of the workshop is 6 hours over one day, designed for about 25 carers per workshop. The group intervention is a 1 x 2 hour session per fortnight for 8 weeks. Groups are designed to commence a month after the workshop. The groups are designed for about 8 members each. The workshops and groups are facilitated by specialist family and carer clinicians.</interventions>
    <comparator>Waitlist Control - brief intervention workshop focusing on psychoeducation regarding personality disorders and awareness of relationship dynamics followed by a waitlist control period prior to being offered the group intervention. The waitlist control group will be offered the group intervention approximately 4 months after the workshop.</comparator>
