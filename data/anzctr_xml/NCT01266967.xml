    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Participants With BRAF V600E Mutation-positive Melanoma With Overall Intracranial Response (OIR), as Assessed by the Investigator - OIR is defined as the number of participants whose intracranial response was a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) assessed by investigators using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. CR is defined as disappearance of all lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters (e.g., percent change from Baseline). For the primary analysis, OIR was measured when all participants in both treatment arms had two post-Baseline disease assessments. Participants who had an intracranial response of not evaluable or a missing response were treated as non-responders. Confirmation assessments were to be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response were initially met and may have been performed at the next protocol scheduled assessment.</outcome>

      <outcome>Number of Participants With V600E Mutation-positive Melanoma With a Best Overall Response (OR) of CR or PR, as Assessed by the Investigator - OR is defined as the number of participants achieving either a CR (the disappearance of all target lesions) or PR (at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as a reference, the Baseline sum of the diameters [e.g., percent change from Baseline]) per modified RECIST, version 1.1. To determine the OR, the extracranial response was combined with the intracranial response.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to assess the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of
      an oral, twice daily dose of 150 mg GSK2118436 administered to subjects with BRAF V600E or
      V600K mutation-positive metastatic melanoma to the brain. Subjects in Cohort A will not have
      received any local brain therapy, and subjects in Cohort B will have received prior local
      therapy for brain metastases. Subjects will continue on treatment until disease progression,
      death, or unacceptable adverse event.</summary>
