  <interventions>
    <interventions>The StepUp  intervention is an 6-week pedometer-based physical activity program for children with physical disabilities. It comprises
1. a 1 hr one-on-one counseling session with the participant, their parent and a Novita physiotherapist to introduce the StepUp materials,
2. a pedometer,
3. the StepUp booklet, which provides advice on the benefits of physical activity for children with disabilities, tips to increase physical activity specifically tailored to children with physical disabilities, and a 6-week log book to allow participants to record and track their progress. Participants will be asked to submit a copy of their step counts to the overseeing therapist weekly via mail or email.
4. 3 x fortnightly follow-up phone calls from the Novita therapist (approx. 5 minutes in duration) to provide support and answer questions.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Physical activity is important for physical and psychological health, as well as for maintenance of physical function and independence in young people with physical disabilities. However, people with physical disabilities have difficulty finding appropriate avenues for physical activity. This project involves the development and evaluation of a novel and feasible pedometer-based physical activity self-management program for young people with physical disability. Given its low-cost, low-touch nature, once developed, this program could be readily incorporated into ongoing clinical services. </summary>
