  <interventions>
    <interventions>Breath hydrogen production and symptoms will be measured after drinking 6 different sugar solutions over 6 days (separated by at least 1 day in between, depending on symptoms).
The sugar solutions will be made up to 375ml with water, the sugars tested will include:
*Glucose- 50g in 375ml
*Sucrose- 50g in 375ml
*Fructose- 25g in 375ml
*Fructose- 25g + Glucose- 25g in 375ml
*Fructans- 10g in 375ml
*Fructans- 10g + Glucose- 25g in 375ml</interventions>
    <comparator>Each subject will act as their own control.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Breath hydrogen production will be measured every 20 minutes for the first 4 hours after drinking the sugar solution. Following this, hourly breath samples will be collected for an additional 8 hours.
Breath samples are collected by participants breathing into a special mouthpiece connected to breath collection bags. 
Prior to testing, participants were instructed how to take breath samples by connecting the mouth piece to the breath sample bag, inhale and exhale normally so that the breath sample bag was inflated fully, then seal the bag immediately so that minimal air escaped. 
Each sample will be subsequently analysed by researchers to test for hydrogen production. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Breath hydrogen will be measured every 20 minutes for the first 4 hours after drinking the sugar solution, and subsequently hourly for the following 8 hours (total 12 hours). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Symptom production will be measured via two symptoms diaries (completed at bed time each day). One diary uses a Likert Scale, whilst the other uses a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) which asks participants to rate the severity of their symptoms on a 100mm line. The diaries will include questions regarding bowel movements and frequency, abdominal pain and discomfort, wind, nausea, heartburn and tiredness/lethargy.
Possible risks, side effects and discomforts include some wind, bloating, abdominal pain and discomfort and a temporary (less than 24 hours) increase in the number of bowel actions. This is not expected to be any more than usual symptoms that IBS patients would experience. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Symptoms will be assessed at bedtime each day.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Our research team has identified dietary triggers that might be responsible for the induction of symptoms in the majority of patients with IBS. These triggers involve a group of small carbohydrates that are commonly found in a wide variety of foods. These carbohydrates can be poorly absorbed in the small intestine and include; fructose (in apples, pears and fruit juice), lactose (milk), fructans (onions), galacto-oligosaccharides (legumes) and sugar alcohols (stone fruits and artificial sweeteners).  We have named this group of compounds FODMAPs - Fermentable Oligo- Di- and Mono-saccharides And Polyols. There is already good evidence that the absorption of one of these FODMAPS; fructose, is greatly enhanced in the presence of glucose. However there is no data investigating this absorption method in IBS sufferers, specifically whether the addition of glucose to fructose eliminates symptoms.
We hypothesize that the addition of glucose will reduce breath hydrogen production and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms. </summary>
