  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious and least treatable form of stroke, accounting for at least 10% of the 20 million new strokes (including 50,000+ Australians) that occur in the world each year. Survivors of ICH are at high risk of recurrent ICH and other serious cardiovascular events. While there is strong evidence that this risk can be reduced by lowering the BP of patients after ICH, such as from the PROGRESS trial undertaken by several of the applicants, many patients with ICH do not receive blood pressure lowering and if they do, receive treatment so that their BP is inadequately controlled.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate the superiority of a combination of fixed low-dose generic BP lowering agents as a Triple Pill strategy on top of standard of care for the prevention of recurrent stroke in patients with a history of ICH and high normal or low grade hypertension in a large-scale, international, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial.</summary>
