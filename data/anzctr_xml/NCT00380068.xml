      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in WHO Functional Class - Change from baseline in World Health Organization functional class (WHO) at Week 24 is the incidence of participants that improved, had no change, or worsened. WHO categories are 1 to 4 with the worse category at 4. Improvement = a category change from baseline of &lt;= -1: change of -3 (eg, WHO from 4 to 1), change of -2 (eg, WHO from 3 to 1), change of -1 (eg, WHO from 2 to 1). Inversely, participants worsening are those with a category change from baseline of at least +1. No change in WHO functional class represents the percentage of participants with a change in category from baseline of 0.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline to Week 24 in SF-36 Health Survey Physical Functioning Scale - Change from baseline to Week 24 in the SF-36 health survey physical functioning scale. 10 activities rated by health limitations using 3 categories (1= Yes, limited a lot; 2= Yes, limited a little; and 3= No, not limited at all). The best score is 3 and the worst score is 1. Scores are transformed by subtracting the unit by the lowest raw score and dividing by the raw score range. The scores are then standardized with the 1998 General United States (US) population mean and standard deviation (SD). Finally, the scores are transformed to the norm-based scoring with a mean of 50 and SD of 10.</outcome>

    <summary>The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ambrisentan in
      a broad population of participants with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Secondary objectives of
      this study were to evaluate the effects of ambrisentan on other clinical measures of
      pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), long-term treatment success, and survival.</summary>
