                  episode lasting &gt;24 hours by symptoms,

               -  LA volume &gt;/= 100 cc

               -  Total AF history &gt;/= 10 years

          -  At least one episode of AF must have been documented by ECG, Holter, TTM, or telemetry
             strip within 24 months of inclusion in the study.

          -  Patients must be able and willing to provide written informed consent to participate
             in the study.

          -  Able and willing to comply with all pre-, post- and follow-up testing and
             requirements.</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Candidates will be excluded from the study if any of the following conditions apply:

          -  Patients with long-standing persistent AF &gt;1 year for which cardioversion
             (pharmacologic or electrical) has failed or will never be attempted.

          -  Patients with AF felt to be secondary to an obvious reversible cause.

          -  Patients with contraindications to systemic anticoagulation with heparin or Coumadin.

          -  Patients who have previously undergone atrial fibrillation ablation.

          -  Patients who are pregnant (by history of menses or pregnancy test if history is
             considered unreliable.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a multicenter, open, prospective, randomized trial. Patients with either
      paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation will be considered for the study. (For US, only
      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation will be considered.) Eligible subjects will be randomized into
      one of two arms in the study: (1) targeted CFAE ablation or (2) generalized CFAE ablation.
      Both techniques will then be followed by PVAI (pulmonary vein antral isolation) as part of a
      hybrid ablation strategy. The nature of the ablation procedures does not allow physicians to
      be blinded to the randomization.</summary>
