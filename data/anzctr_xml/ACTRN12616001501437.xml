    <interventions>After meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria, healthy volunteers are asked to undergo to ultrasound assessment of the diaphragm. While normally breathing, at rest, the investigator checks if none of both emi-diaphragm is affected by palsy or by some paradoxical motion.
Therefore, two types of measurement are record: 1) the cranio-caudal displacement and 2) the thickening fraction.

The cranio-caudal displacement is performed using a 3.55 MHz probe. The probe is placed immediately below the right or left costal margin in the midclavicular line, or in the right or left anterior axillary line and is directed medially, cephalad and dorsally, so that the ultrasound beam reaches perpendicularly the posterior third of the corresponding hemidiaphragm. The two-dimensional (2D) mode is initially used to obtain the best approach and select the exploration line; the M-mode is then used to display the motion of the anatomical structures along the selected line.
Patients are scanned along the long axis of the intercostal spaces, with the liver serving as an acoustic window to the right, and the spleen to the left. Normal inspiratory diaphragmatic movement is caudal, since the diaphragm moves toward the probe; normal expiratory trace is cranial, as the diaphragm moves away from the probe. In the M mode, the diaphragmatic excursion (displacement, cm), the speed of diaphragmatic contraction (slope, cm/s), the inspiratory time (Tinsp, s) and the duration of the cycle (Ttot, s) can be measured (Matamis et al. Intensive Care Med (2013) 39:801810).

The thickening fraction is evaluated in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the rib cage. The zone of apposition is the area of the chest wall where the abdominal contents reach the lower rib cage. In this area, the diaphragm is
observed as a structure made of three distinct layers: a non-echogenic central layer bordered by two echogenic layers, the peritoneum and the diaphragmatic pleurae. To obtain adequate images of diaphragmatic thickness in M mode and 2D mode, a linear high-frequency probe (C10 MHz) is necessary. The diaphragmatic thickness can be measured during quiet spontaneous breathing and during a maximal inspiratory and expiratory effort. An index of diaphragmatic thickening, the thickening fraction (TF) can be calculated using the M mode (TF = thickness at endinspiration - thickness at end-expiration/thickness at end-expiration) (Matamis et al. Intensive Care Med (2013) 39:801810).

    <statisticalmethods>We will enrol at least 300 healthy volunteers. The normal distribution will be assessed through the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parametric variables will be expressed as mean (standard deviation), while non parametric ones as median [25-75 interquartile range].
Differences between gender (male versus female) will be assessed through Student t-test or a Mann-Withney U test, as indicated.
The associations between ultrasonographic  measurements and antropometric data will be assessed through a linear regression analisys to produce a correlation coefficient. Differences will be considered as statistically significant for p values lower than 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ultrasound has been widely introduced in the clinical practice in the intensive care unit (ICU) to evaluate the diaphragm function in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Despite the increasing number of data in critically ill patients, a few is know about the normal measurements values in healthy volunteers. With the present study we aim to assess normal values of diaphragm ultrasound in a large population of healthy volunteers and to correlate them with some anthropometric data.
We will enrol at least 300 volunteers without neuromuscular disease, chronic respiratory disease or corticosteroid therapy. After excluding paradoxical movement or palsy of any of the two emi-diaphragm, we will evaluate the cranio-caudal displacement and the thickening fraction of the diaphragm. We will also collect anthropometric data (i.e. height, weight, gender, age).
After all data collection, we will describe the echographic measurements according to the anthropometric characteristics.</summary>
