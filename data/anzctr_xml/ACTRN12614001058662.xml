  <interventions>
    <interventions>Both control and intervention arms received the standard consent discussion as carried out by their treating surgeon. The experiment arm were facilitated to read the relevant section of the website, after having spoken to their surgeon about their planned operation. They were then directed to complete surveys relating to the outcome measures of this study. 

The orthopaedic units website (www.orthoanswer.org) was utilised as the patient education tool. The website was built employing best practice principles for design of medical education websites. It is written at a basic English reading level catering for patients with a reading level of grade 5 or above. It is designed as a walkthrough overview of each procedure along the lines of diagnosis and indications for surgery, complications, pre-operative, intra-operative and post operative care. It has been formulated with multidisciplinary input taking 3 years to design and implement.

The website takes approximately 10 - 15 mins to read the relevant section.

    <concealment>Patients were recruited from the Western Health orthopaedic outpatient clinic. All patients that were booked for five common orthopaedic procedures were eligible to participate in the trial. Patients were allocated according to randomisation sequence using the sealed envelope method. </concealment>
    <sequence>Computer randomisation was carried out by a random sequence generated by the STATA statistical software program. </sequence>

    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Results were analysed with the STATA statistical software package. Continuous data such as survey scores and age of patients is reported in terms of the mean and 95% confidence interval. The mean of continuous data between intervention arms is compared using the T-test.  Dichotomous data such as education is compared using z-test of two proportions. Age is compared using the chi-square test. 
To detect an improvement of 15% in the primary outcome measure of knowledge in the experiment group, which is in keeping with the observed magnitude of similar trials conducted previously, with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, a sample size of 100 patients per group was necessary.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The research question
Does exposing patients to a website containing accurate, free and easily accessible information related to the operation to be performed as part of the consent process improve the informed consent attained? This will be measured by accessing 3 end points:
	comprehension
	satisfaction
	anxiety

Hypothesis: The use of the Orthoanswer website, as an adjunct to standard consent procedures, significantly improves the satisfaction and comprehension of informed consent whilst decreasing anxiety levels concerning the operation.
