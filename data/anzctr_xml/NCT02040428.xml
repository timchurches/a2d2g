  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Subjects =18 years of age, requiring an elective or urgent, open aortic surgical
             procedure utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects in Japan between =18 and &lt;20
             years of age will require consent by the subject's legal representative

          -  Subjects must be willing to participate in the study and provide written informed
             consent.

          -  Presence of an appropriate Target Bleeding Site (TBS) along the anastomotic suture
             line, involving a synthetic aortic graft, as identified intra-operatively by the
             investigator;</inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or unwilling to receive blood products;

          -  Exposure to another investigational drug or device in a clinical trial within 30 days
             prior to surgery or anticipated in the 60 day follow up period after surgery.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  TBS is from a large defects in visible arteries or veins where the injured vascular
             wall requires repair and maintenance of vessel patency or where there would be
             persistent exposure of EVARREST Fibrin Sealant Patch to blood flow and/or pressure
             during absorption of the product;

          -  TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;

          -  TBS involves an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft

          -  TBS within an actively infected field;

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine;

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the investigator that may
             preclude conduct of the study procedure;</exclusivecriteria>
