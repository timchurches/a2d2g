    <statisticalmethods>Statistical advice has been provided by the Statistics Department of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research.   The proposed study period will be 12 months and based on estimates, there will be up to 500 patients potentially included in the study, at which point we will review our data to assess the need for further extension of this study.  Demographic and baseline data will be presented as frequencies/percent for categorical data or means/standard deviations for continuous data.  Continuous data will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the chi square test will be applied to categorical data.

The main aim of this study is to generate normal baseline ranges for ROTEM parameters in order to develop an algorithm for use in the pregnant population, therefore it is difficult to perform a sample size calculation for this purpose.   Statistical advice given has recommended the recruitment of as many patients as possible over a defined study period  .</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Recruitment of parturients will occur at the Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital (RBWH). There is increasing use of ROTEM(TM) for point-of-care coagulation monitoring in patients with massive haemorrhage, but there still remains limited data on reference ranges in normal pregnancies and subsequently limited understanding of the effects of complicated pregnancies on ROTEM(TM) interpretation.  With the recent implementation of ROTEM(TM) within the RBWH, reference ranges for the obstetric population need to be established to optimise interpretation of derived values.</summary>
