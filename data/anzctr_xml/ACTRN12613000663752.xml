    <statisticalmethods>Local data regarding recovery following tonsillectomy, acquired at four different time periods, was used as the basis for a power analysis. Assuming (from that study) the estimated the standard deviation for pain scores will be about 2.4 and the correlation between the follow-up measures will be about 0.8, 40 participants (20 in each arm) will be sufficient to demonstrate a 25% difference in post-operative pain scores between the two groups. For this trial statistical tests will be performed at the two-sided 0.05 level of significance.</statisticalmethods>
