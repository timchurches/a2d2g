  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to assess whether a new technique called facilitated endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is or is not superior to conventional ERCP for
      removing stones found in the bile duct at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. ERCP is
      an endoscopic procedure used to facilitate the radiological examination and subsequent
      manipulation of the common bile duct (eg. opening it up, which is called sphincterotomy).
      Both facilitated and conventional ERCP are performed as a separate procedure after the
      initial gallbladder surgery. This is a comparative study of these two techniques in a
      randomised clinical trial.

      The aim of this randomised clinical trial is to enable surgeons to decide whether placement
      of a plastic stent at the time of laparoscopic cholecystectomy will improve the success rate
      and safety of subsequent ERCP and sphincterotomy.</summary>
