      <outcome>Change From Baseline Between Tadalafil Once a Day (OaD) and Sildenafil as Needed (PRN) in Sexual Self-Confidence Domain of Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS) - The PAIRS is a self-administed scale that assesses the broader psychological and interpersonal outcomes associated with erectile dysfunction and its treatment. Sexual Self-Confidence score is the average of responses on 6 PAIRS item scores. Sexual Self-Confidence scores range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher scores are indicative of greater sexual self-confidence.</outcome>

    <summary>The primary purpose of the study is to help answer whether tadalafil taken once a day can
      help improve the psychological outcomes (such as sexual self confidence, spontaneity and time
      concerns) compared to sildenafil taken as needed in patients with erectile dysfunction (ED).</summary>
