  <interventions>
    <interventions>Constraint Induced movement therapy involves use of tailor made glove like splint worn on the unimpaired (dominant writting hand) and intensive activity based practice activities encouraging active use and manipulation with the other impaired (hemiplegic hand). Participants in the CIMT group will wear a tailor made glove on their unimpaired limb while attending the day camp, which will only be removed for toileting. The training occurs for 6 hours per day over 10 days for a total dose of 60 hours, with one trainer per two participants, in a comunity recreation facility.</interventions>
    <comparator>Bimanual Training involves atcivity based practice with tasks that focus on equal use of both hands (both the unimpaired and the hemiplegic hand) in the task. The training occurs for 6 hours per day over 10 days for a total dose of 60 hours, with one trainer per two participants, in a comunity recreation facility.</comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Inclusion criteria
The study will include children and youth:
1.	With a confirmed diagnosis of congenital hemiplegia. 
2.	Aged 5 to 16 years.
3.	With predominant spasticity rather than dystonia interfering with upper limb function according to the classification of motor type by Sanger et al[31] with Modified Ashworth Scale grade &gt;1 but &lt;3.[32] 
4.	Ability to achieve minimal active grasp with the impaired hand.
5.	Sufficient co-operation and cognitive understanding to participate in the group activities.
For a subset of children performing the Advanced Brain Imaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) studies further inclusion criteria are:-
1.	Sufficient co-operation to perform Advanced Brain Imaging studies for 45 minutes.
2.	No exclusions for 3 tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T MRI) including no metal implants, no shunts, no uncontrolled epilepsy as the later would be a confound.
3.	For TMS there must be no current or previous history of epilepsy.</inclusivecriteria>

    <healthyvolunteer>No</healthyvolunteer>
    <exclusivecriteria>1.	Severe muscle spasticity and/or contracture on the Modified Ashworth Scale(MAS &gt; grade 3, i.e. muscle contracture or rigidity) which would require spasticity management or serial casting.
2.	Previous orthopaedic surgery in the upper limb. 
3.	Serial casting or Botulinum Toxin A (BoNT-A) injections in the upper limb within 6 months prior to study entry.</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Children will be matched in pairs according to age (12 month age bands), gender, side of hemiplegia, and level of functional ability based on Melbourne Unilateral Upper limb Assessment (MUUL) scores at screening. Once matching has been achieved and baseline assessments completed, children will be randomised within pairs from concealed envelopes opened by non-study personnel. Treatment allocation will be recorded on a piece of folded paper inside each envelope in random order (computer generated).  The randomisation process will involve allocating a number “1” or “2’ to each member of the pair which will be written on the paper inside the envelope.  As each pair is entered, they will be allocated the next consecutive envelope, which will be opened by the non-study personnel who will read and record the treatment allocation from the paper inside the envelope.  Study personnel will be informed of group allocation.</concealment>

    <summary>This randomsied comparison trial will test the efficiacy of a novel rehabilitation (constraint induced movement therapy) whcih involves placing a glove on the unimpaired hand and intensively training the Hemiplegic hand and comparing this approach to more conventional bimanaul training in children with congenital hemiplegia.</summary>
