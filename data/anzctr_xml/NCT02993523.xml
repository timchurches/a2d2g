  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is an aggressive and rare cancer of myeloid cells (a white
      blood cell responsible for fighting infections). Successful treatment of AML is dependent on
      what subtype of AML the patient has, and the age of the patient when diagnosed.

      Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a
      cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding
      venetoclax to azacitidine works better than azacitidine on its own.

      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment is unknown to patients and doctors),
      placebo controlled study in patients with AML who are &gt;= 18 or more years old and have not
      been treated before. Patients who take part in this study should not be suitable for standard
      induction therapy (usual starting treatment). AbbVie is funding this study which will take
      place at approximately 150 hospitals globally and enrol approximately 400 patients.

      In this study, 2/3 of patients will receive venetoclax every day with azacitidine and the
      remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with azacitidine.

      Patients will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are
      having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking
      blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires.
      Blood and bone marrow tests will be completed to see why some people respond better than
      others. Additional blood tests will be completed for genetic factors and to see how long the
      drug remains in the body.</summary>
