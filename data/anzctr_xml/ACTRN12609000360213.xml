  <interventions>
    <interventions>Botulinum toxin A injections to clinically selected muscles, occupational therapy, physiotherapy. 
Dose: Total dose not to exceed 12 units per kg or 400 units total. Dosage per muscle group:
Upper limb
Intrinsic muscles hand: 1/2 unit per kg or maximum 20 units per muscle. 
Finger flexors: 1/2 - 1 unit per kg or maximum 30 units.
Wrist flexors:1/2 - 1 unit per kg or maximum 30 units.
Pronators: 1/2 - 1 unit per kg or maximum 30 units.
Elbow flexors: 1-2 units per kg or maximum 60 units.
Pectoral muscles, lattisimus dorsi, teres major: 1/2 - 2 units per kg or maximum 60 units per muscle group.
Deltoid: 	1 unit per kg or maximum 50 units.
Lower limb
Adductors: 	2-4 units per kg maximum dose 80 units.
Hamstrings: 2-4 units per kg with maximum dose 80 units.
Quadriceps:2-4 units per kg maximum dose 80 units.
Gastrocnemius: 2-4 units per kg maximum dose 100 units.
Maximum dose 50 units per site. Any injection &gt; 50 units requires more than one injection site. All injections are intramuscular with ultrasound and/or nerve stimulator guidance.
Injections (or placebo) occur at baseline. Injections are repeated at 6 months.
children will all receive physical therapy and occupational therapy following injections/ sham procedure for up to 6 weeks on a weekly basis. Therapy will include serial casting for maximum 2 weeks as required. Occupational therapy and or physiotherapy requirements are determined on patient goals by blinded therapist.
Injections will be repeated at a 6 month interval.
Analgesia for injections will be provided with intranasal fentanyl and topical anaesthetic.</interventions>
    <comparator>Children in the control group will have sham treatment with simulated analgesia (intranasal administration of saline rather than fentanyl) and injections. Sham injections will occur once only. Sham injections will be performed by nurse, child and parent being screened from view of injection sites. Ultrasound localisation of muscles will be performed. Blunt needle tip will then be placed against skin to simulate needle injections. No substance will be injected. All children will receive occupational therapy and physiotherapy following the intervention for a period of 6 weeks. Therapy will occur weekly for 6 weeks.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with the more severe forms of cerebral palsy often have difficulties with pain or discomfort associated with spasticity. Spasticity can also impact upon the burden of care parents experience. Botulinum toxin A has been used for over a decade in the treatment of spasticity for children with cerebral palsy however most research to date has focussed on functional gains for children with the less severe forms of cerebral palsy. this study hypothesises that botulinum toxin A injections when combined with a therapy program improves outcomes of burden of care and comfort for children with severe cerebral palsy when compared to a therapy program alone.</summary>
