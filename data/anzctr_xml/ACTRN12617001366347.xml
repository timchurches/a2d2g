  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients undergoing elective or semi-urgent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery at Flinders Medical Centre will be identified through the ANZ Cardiac Surgery Registry. The association of stress hyperglycaemia with adverse outcomes will be determined using absolute glucose levels, and the relative change in glucose as determined by the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio. 
The Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio is defined by the time-weighted glucose during ICU stay divided by the estimated average glucose level of the prior 3 months ( as calculated from the HbA1c using the formula developed by Nathan et al. Diab Care 2008;31:147314788). The study is retrospective - patients will have undergone routine post-op intensive care. Pathology results used in the analysis will be those already available through routine care.

    <comparator>Patients at Flinders Medical Centre undergoing elective or semi-urgent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery over the period 8/2/2010 to 20/12/2016 will be identified through the ANZ Cardiac Surgery Registry. The association of adverse post-op outcomes will be compared using time-weighted mean glucose levels post-operatively during critical care, and the time-weighted mean Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio. The association of outcomes with time-weighted mean glucose levels will act as the conventional control group.

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical power: Assuming a Type I error rate of 5%, an outcome event rate of 30%, and the proportion of variance explained by the other covariates in the model is no more than 55%,  a sample size of 2500 subjects provides 80% power to detect an independent association between SHR and outcome with an estimated odds ratio of 1.20 per 0.1 SHR increment at the two-tailed 0.05 significance level. 
Variables of interest (glucose, SHR, APACHE IIIj, type of surgery, lactate), will be subject to multivariable regression analysis to determine the association with adverse outcomes. 
Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing will be used to explore the relationship between patients with (HbA1c&gt;=6.5%) or without  (HbA1c&lt;6.5%) pre-existing chronic background hyperglycaemia. 
Subgroup analysis of patients with mean glucose &lt;10mmol/L will be made to determine existence of clinically significant stress hyperglycaemia at glucose levels conventionally considered clinically insignificant.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients is independently associated with increased morbidity and mortality in a wide range of patient groups, including post-operative outcomes. The association between hyperglycaemia and poor  post-operative outcomes is strong in patients without diabetes, but a weaker predictor in patients with diabetes.
This discrepancy is in part driven by the difficulty in distinguishing genuine stress hyperglycaemia from chronic high levels seen in diabetic patients. A high plasma glucose concentration in a hospitalised patient can occur because of chronic poor diabetes control and be normal for that patient, represent a transient physiologic response to an inter¬current illness (stress hyperglycaemia), or be a combination of the above. 
A metric for stress hyperglycaemia has been developed at FMC - the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio is defined as glucose concentration divided by the Estimated Average Glucose concentration, which is calculated from HbA1c. This enables quantification of the relative change in hyperglycaemia eg a patient with a SHR of 1.4 has an glucose concentration 40% higher than their average glucose over the prior 3 months. 
Our previous work indicated that the relative change in glucose was a better indicator of stress hyperglycaemia and more strongly associated with adverse patient outcomes than glucose. 
This initial work was in a broad general hospital population. This study aims to determine the clinical applicability of the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio to post-op outcomes for patients undergoing CABG surgery. This group requires mandatory post-op observation in the ICU setting, and commonly require intervention for glucose management.  We aim to determine if the Stress Hyperglycaemia Ratio is more strongly associated with adverse post-op outcomes in this group than glucose alone. </summary>
