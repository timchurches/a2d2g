  <interventions>
    <interventions>Other interventions - Standard RRT initiation
Other interventions - Accelerated RRT initiation

Active Comparator: Standard RRT initiation - RRT initiation will be guided by the presence of one or more clinical indications. Even in the absence of one of these indications, RRT may be commenced at the discretion of the treating physician.

Experimental: Accelerated RRT initiation - A dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT initiated as soon as possible and within 12 hours of the patient meeting the eligibility criteria.


Other interventions: Standard RRT initiation
In the absence of kidney function recovery, the initiation of RRT will be permitted if one of the following develops:
serum potassium = 6.0 mmol/L; pH = 7.20 or serum bicarbonate = 12 mmol/L; evidence of severe respiratory failure, based on a PaO2/FiO2 = 200 and clinical perception of volume overload; and/or persistent AKI &gt; 72 hours following the time of randomization.

Other interventions: Accelerated RRT initiation
A dialysis catheter will be placed and RRT initiated as soon as possible and within 12 hours of eligibility. This 12 hour window includes the time needed to obtain consent.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The objectives of this trial are to determine whether, in critically ill patients with severe
      acute kidney injury (AKI), randomization to accelerated initiation of renal replacement
      therapy (RRT), compared to standard initiation, leads to:

        1. Improved survival (primary outcome); and

        2. Recovery of kidney function (principal secondary outcome), defined as independence from
           RRT at 90 days</summary>
