  <interventions>
    <interventions>A one year (48 weeks), progressive, self-managed, home-based walking programme delivered by mail and supported by telephone calls (both occcurring at baseline, weeks 4, 12 and 24). The intervention comprises of four stages each with a specific focus. The first two stages will be delivered by post at baseline. Stage one will run for 4 weeks and will focus on getting intervention participants to increase the amount of time they walk (duration). Telephone support will occur at the midpoint between each stage - for stage one this will be at 2 weeks. Stage two will run for 8 weeks and will have an additional focus on increasing the frequency of walks that intervention participants take. Telephone support will occur at week 8. The third stage will be delivered by post at 12-weeks into the study. Stage three will run for 12 weeks and will have an additional focus on increasing the pace of walking (intensity). Telephone support will occur at week 18. The fourth and final stage will be delivered by post at 24-weeks into the study. Stage four will run for 24 weeks and will have focus on sustaining the walking routine developed over the previous three stages. Telephone support will occur at weekn 36. The content of each mail-out will include a walking manual relating to the participants stage within the intervention. In addition the initial mail-out will also include a pedometer which will help maintain participants motivation to walk, and a falls calendar on which participants will be asked to record any falls they have. The walking manual will include detailed instructions on how to plan a walking schedule related to the focus for the stage of the intervention. Information will also include advice on walking in a safe way and on how to make walking a part of daily activities. At the start of each new stage intervention participants will receive telephone support that will assist participants with developing their personal walking plan and to help motivate participants to stick to their plan. Follow-up telephone support will occur at the mid-point of each stage and will review participants progress through the walking plan, help develop strategies to overcome any barriers or difficulties in progressing through the walking plan and to help keep motivation levels high.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will receive health education information that is unrelated to reducing the risk of falling. The Health information will be delivered by post according to the same time-frame as for the intervention group participants, i.e. at baseline, 12-weeks and 24 weeks. Control participants will receive information on mental health wellbeing, good sleeping habits and healthy eating. Control group participants will also receive the walking program at the end of the study, i.e. after 48 weeks of enrollment in the study</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A majority of the falls prevention interventions shown to effectively reduce the risk of falling in community dwelling older people, such as Tai Chi, or programs such as Stepping On and the Otago exercise program, involve specialised training or instruction. This specialised activity places limits on the accessibility of such interventions: due to a lack of qualified instructors, the costs involved in joining programs, or the barriers inherent in attending physical activity classes. Only a small proportion of older people benefit from these interventions. 

In contrast, walking is a simple activity that can be done by virtually anyone, any time and anywhere without the need for specialised training or equipment. However to date only  two studies have examined the effect of walking on falls; one study as a secondary outcome measure the other study combined walking with a home-based exercise program. No studies have explicitly looked at the impact of walking of falls in older people. 

The Easy Steps to Health study is a randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of a self-managed one year (48-week) walking program in reducing the number of falls in sedentary, community-dwelling people aged 65 years and over. People will be excluded if: they are already physically active (i.e. engage in physical activity for more than 120 minutes per week or on more than three occasions per week); they cannot communicate in English, and; they have any conditions that limit their ability to participate in a physical activity program. 

A total of 484 participants will be randomised into either the intervention or control group. Participants randomised into the intervention group will receive instruction in the walking program via mail and telephone coaching at week 0, 12, and 24 with additional telephone support at weeks 2, 8, 18 and 36. The control group will receive the self-managed walking program at the end of the study period. During the study period the control group will receive healthy lifestyle information. 

Falls during the study will be recorded prospectively using a daily calendar. Baseline and end-of-study telephone interviews will be conducted using structured questionnaires assessing Quality of Life, levels of Physical Activity, confidence in avoiding a fall, confidence in ability to walk, and the walkability of their neighbourhood. Baseline interviews will also gather basic demographic information, falls history, and a brief description of current medical conditions and medications being used. 

In addition, a sub-sample of 194 participants will receive physical performance assessments. These assessments will gather data on lower limb functionality (using the Short Physical Performance Battery), quadriceps strength and lower limb reaction time (using choice step reaction time). Accelerometers will also be used as a more objective measure of participants levels of physical activity. These measures on a sub-sample of participants will occur at weeks 0 (baseline), 12, 24, and 48.</summary>
