  <interventions>
    <interventions>A single Cocoa drink (12g cocoa powder + 16g sugar + 400mL hot water) alone, or on a separate occasion in combination with a high fat meal (50g dehydrated potato + 250mL hot water + 100g butter). Each intervention and control meal (all four - 1=cocoa alone, 2=fatty meal alone, 3=water alone, 4= cocoa drink + fatty meal) was consumed once by each participant (within 15min of baseline blood collection), in a random order, with a minimum of a week washout between meals. This meant each participant was their own control.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Fatty meals can cause damage to the body, known as oxidative damage. They do this by decreasing protective antioxidant levels/activity, through using them up. When this oxidative damage occurs, an inflammatory response can occur, with the release of inflammatory signalling molecules (cytokines). Over time oxidative damage and inflammation can lead to detrimental health effects such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. This current study aims to determine if consumption of an antioxidant containing cocoa drink at the same time as a high fat meal can improve the body's own antioxidant defenses, as well as reduce oxidative damage markers and inflammatory cytokine levels. We anticipated that cocoa consumed at the same time should help to stop the unhealthy effects (eg. lower antioxidants, increased oxidative stress, and higher inflammatory response) caused by a high fat meal.</summary>
