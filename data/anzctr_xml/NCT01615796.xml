             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to

             unacceptable risk as a participant in this trial or may interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  A positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol (or alcohol breath test) at
             screening.

             average daily intake greater than 2 units) for females. One unit is equivalent to 270
             mL of full strength beer, 470 mL of light beer, 30 mL of spirits and 100 mL of wine.

             dose of study medication. However, the Investigator and GSK study team can review
             medication on a case by case basis to determine if its use would compromise subject
             safety or interfere with the study procedures or data interpretation.

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
