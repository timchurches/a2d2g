  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>While patients with advanced cancer have high levels of unmet needs, a recent systematic review indicated that very few trials of psychosocial interventions have been conducted with palliative patients, and none have been conducted with lung cancer patients. The present research aims to evaluate a supportive care program for patients with inoperable lung cancer who have a potentially limited life expectancy, using a randomised controlled design.
210 patients will be recruited and asked to fill out baseline measures of anxiety/depression, unmet needs and quality of life. Participants will then be randomised to receive either the intervention or usual care. Permission will be sought from participants to obtain information about medical variables from their medical record. Oncologists will provide information about each participants treatment plan, performance status, and awareness of prognosis, and will refer intervention participants to two supportive care sessions.
Participants will be encouraged to bring a significant other(s) with them to the supportive care sessions. The content of each session will be tailored to respond to needs identified in the baseline data. The first group session will be timed to correspond with the beginning of treatment, and the second will occur at the end of treatment. In addition, baseline data summaries for each intervention patient will be made available to the treating team to assist them in meeting the patients needs. Where particular needs are identified, appropriate referrals will be made (e.g. to social work, psychology etc) by the Lung clinical nurse coordinator.
Follow-up measures (anxiety/depression, unmet needs, quality of life and needs related to treatment preparation) will be administered at 8 and 12 weeks post baseline when patients attend the clinic at these approximate time points.</summary>
