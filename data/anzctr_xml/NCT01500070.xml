  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a single-arm, prospective, multi-center monitored trial recruiting patients with
      critical limb ischemia and with one or more lesions in the arteries below the knee. The
      immediate and long-term (up to 12 months) outcome of the PROMUS ELEMENT Everolimus-Eluting
      Stent System (Boston Scientific) and the PROMUS ELEMENT PLUS Everolimus-Eluting Stent System
      (Boston Scientific) will be evaluated.

      In 2 Belgian centers, 3 German centers and 1 New Zealand center a total of 70 patients will
      be recruited. Primary endpoint is primary patency at 12 months, defined as absence of
      restenosis (=50% stenosis) or occlusion within the originally treated lesion based on
      angiography.</summary>
