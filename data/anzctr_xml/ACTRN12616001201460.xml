  <interventions>
    <interventions>On one session only, a physiotherapist with 5 years experience will use real time ultrasound, limited manual facilitation and standardised verbal instruction (using a script) to teach activation of the serratus anterior, Participants will be able to view the real time ultrasound image during the intervention phase. Ten repetitions will be used. Each contraction will last approximately 3 seconds long, with a rest period between contractions of approximately 2 seconds. Manual facilitation will be limited in this group, as the treating physiotherapist will only use one hand at the elbow to guide the participant to complete the correct movement. The other hand will be used to maintain real time ultrasound transducer contact with the skin over serratus anterior. 
This will be conducted in supine, with the glenohumeral joint at approximately 90 degrees of flexion.
This will take place at an ultrasonography laboratory of the medical imaging department of an Australian University. The entire session will take approximately 45 minutes (including assessment).
This is a crossover trial with a washout period of at least 7 days between interventions.</interventions>

    <concealment>Computerised randomisation of which intervention will occur first for the subject will occur prior to the commencement of the study.

The person who conducts the computerised randomisation and envelopes will not be involved in screening potential participants, collect data or provide intervention to the participants.  </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculation was derived using G*Power software  with an alpha significance set at 0.05. To determine a 5% difference between interventions, and assuming a standard deviation of 20% , a minimum of 26 participants will be required to achieve 80% statistical power.
EMG signals will be demeaned, full wave rectified and filtered using a low pass Butterworth filter using Delsys EMG works Analysis software. 
Demographic data will be reported using means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous data, reflecting variables such as weight and age. For dichotomous demographic variables including gender, occupation status, and overhead activity level as perceived by participant, counts and percentages will be reported. 
Data will be collated and analysed using SPSS for Windows with a significance level set at 0.05.  Pre, post  and delta task specific Normalised EMG  means and standard deviations will be reported. All primary and secondary EMG outcomes will be compared using a repeated measure analysis of variance (rANOVA).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The serratus anterior is an important muscle that assists in the control of the shoulder blade and movement of the arm.
We know that serratus anterior muscle activity is affected in painful shoulders, and is often targeted by physiotherapists for the treatment of shoulder pain. 
We are conducting this study to compare if Real-time ultrasound (RTUS) is more effective than manual facilitation in the rehabilitation of serratus anterior muscle.
We expect that both interventions will improve activation of the serratus anterior, but that there will be better activation of the muscle with RTUS</summary>
