      <outcome>Safety - Safety will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure through the 52-week evaluation of bilateral treatment. Included in this assessment will be the proportion of subjects with any of the following outcomes: (1) death, or (2) medical morbidity, including but not limited to renal artery aneurysm, stenosis, significant deterioration of renal function, fistulae or urethral stenosis.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a prospective, single-institution trial wherein twenty subjects with refractory
      hypertension will receive the experimental focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy.
      Safety will be assessed by incidence and evaluation of serious adverse effects associated
      with the investigational procedure through 52-week evaluation of bilateral treatment.
      Clinical utility will also be evaluated by comparison pre and post therapy systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure and norepinephrine spillover.</summary>
