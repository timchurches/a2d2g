  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers will consume a 2g dose, twice daily of a patented, commerically available blend of plant polysaccharides daily for 12 weeks ( total consumption of 4g per day). This dietary supplement will be delivered orally in powdered form, to be taken with juice or water. Participants will have two separate assessments of cognitive performance (of 3.5 hours each) through 2 visits at the research centre. The visits will be 12 weeks apart. Following the baseline visit participants will be randomised to consume a placebo or a 4g dose of saccharides for 12 weeks. At each baseline and post-intervention visit, participants will complete tasks of cognition and mood, assessing attention, concentration, memory and learning, as well as general mood (mood states including: mental fatigue, anxiety, relaxed, tense, outlook and overall mood).
At each visit, participants will provide a finger capillary measure of blood glucose in response to same day administration of intervention (day 1 and day 84).</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine the effects of daily consumption of saccharides for 12 weeks on the ability to perform cognitive tasks, including memory and on psychological wellbeing (mood) in healthy middle-aged adults. Proposed beneficial effects include: enhanced memory, increased ability to deal with demanding mental activities, improved mood and ability to deal with stress (reduced tension, anxiety and perceived mental fatigue).</summary>
