  <interventions>
    <interventions>Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF is a sterile, preservative-free solution containing human plasma proteins and 22.5 mg/mL glycine. The solution has a pH of 6.6. At least 98% of the protein is immunoglobulin (mainly IgG), with an anti-D (Rho) antibody content of 625 IU per vial/ =30 mg/mL human plasma proteins or 250 IU per vial/ =10 mg/mL human plasma proteins.Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF (Anti-D) is a human immunoglobulin preparation for intramuscular administration.  Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF is prepared from blood obtained from voluntary and non-remunerated (unpaid) donors. Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF contains proteins called antibodies which help to suppress the unwanted immune response in an Rh(D) negative woman following her exposure to Rh(D) positive red cells. For example, if a pregnant woman has an Rh(D) negative blood group and her baby is Rh(D) positive, the baby's blood is incompatible with the mothers. This could lead to reduced red blood cells, brain damage and other serious complications in the baby. This condition is known as Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF can be given to Rh(D) negative women during pregnancy and following birth of an Rh(D) positive baby to help prevent Haemolytic Disease of the Newborn. Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF is sometimes given on other occasions when a woman of child-bearing age may become exposed to Rh(D) positive blood: for example, after blood transfusion, amniocentesis (taking a sample of the fluid surrounding the unborn baby), miscarriage or stillbirth. Rh(D) Immunoglobulin-VF is available only with a doctors prescription.

    <statisticalmethods>A summary table of relevant baseline information will be produced. This table will include descriptive statistics e.g. mean, range and standard deviation and enable the comparison of control and single-dose groups.

Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed. The proportion of women without sufficient levels of anti-D antibody in single-dose and control groups will be compared with the Chi-squared test. The proportion of women not receiving their doses at the correct gestation will be compared with Fishers exact test.

Logistic regression will be performed to:
-determine the impact of the single-dose regime compared to control regime 
-examine the effect of possible risk factors for lack of detectable antibody at delivery, such as BMI, babys blood group and gestation at delivery
-adjust for baseline differences between participants of both groups

A second analysis based on dosed participants will also be performed.

No interim analyses are planned due to the short duration and low risk of the study.

Basis of Sample Size Selection

Estimates for power calculation were derived from data published by MacKenzie et. al (2011) that evaluated compliance rates comparing a two dose regime (500IU Anti-D at 28 and 34 weeks) and a one dose regime (1500IU at 28 weeks).

With two doses of 500IU anti-D at 28-34 weeks, in women with 100% compliance, 61% of women had circulating anti-D at the time of delivery.  Based on data published by MacKenzie et al (2011), compliance rates with the two- dose regime is 67%.  Taking these two observations together, we estimate that 40% of women will have circulating anti-D at the time of delivery with a two-dose regime using 500IU of Anti-D.  Therefore, using the Australian regime of two doses of 625IU, we estimate that in this study at least 40% of women will have circulating Anti-D at the time of delivery.

A single dose regime of 1500IU of Anti-D at 28 weeks has a reported compliance rate of 78% in the United Kingdom with 22% of the compliant women having detectable antibody at the time of delivery. Taking these data together, we estimate that 17% of women using the one dose regime in this study will have circulating anti-D at delivery.


Power calculation for primary aim  circulating anti-D at delivery

To provide an alpha value of 0.05 with a 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the number of women with circulating anti-D at the time of delivery, a sample size of 218 (109 single dose and 109 two doses) will be required to compare the two-dose regime with a single dose regime.

Power calculation for secondary aim  compliance rate

To provide an alpha value of 0.05 with a 90% power to detect a 50% reduction in the number of women who were non-compliant with their anti-D prophylaxis regime, a sample size of 284 (142 single dose, 142 two doses) will be required to compare the two-dose regime with a single dose regime.

Assuming a 10% drop out rate after randomization of the 300 women in this study, 270 women would complete the study providing us with 95% power for the primary aim and 91% power for the secondary aim.
Assuming a 15% drop out rate after randomization of the 300 women in this study, 255 women would complete the study providing us with 94% power for the primary aim and 89% power for the secondary aim.
Based on estimates from previous studies, we predict that women who have one or two dose regimes will have circulating antibody at 17% and 40% respectively; hence our sample size should be adequate to detect this difference. The haematologists involved with this study have advised that detecting a difference of this magnitude has clinically and scientifically utility.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background, aims &amp; objectives: 
In some pregnancies, the blood types of mother and baby are not the same  this may cause problems for the baby. The mothers immune system may see the babys blood type as a threat, a process called sensitisation. This is called Rhesus disease and can cause anaemia, jaundice, and possibly serious consequences. Ways of preventing Rhesus disease are both safe and well-established, and used as part of regular antenatal care at KEMH. This involves an injection of anti-D antibody to maintain a protective level of this antibody in the blood. This dampens the bodys immune response to the babys blood, and greatly reduces the risk of Rhesus disease. With current prevention methods, the risk of Rhesus disease is less than 1%. There are two main approved dosing regimes, 1) the single-dose regime and 2) the double-dose regime. Both have advantages and disadvantages.  Currently, Australia uses a double-dose regime, but is considering moving to a single-dose regime. Although widely used in the UK, Europe and USA, the single dose has not been studied locally in Australia. At present, women at KEMH receive two doses of anti-D during their pregnancy. This study will investigate both regimes to identify any difference in protection that lasts up to the time of delivery. A smaller study will review all women with evidence of sensitisation in the last 3 years to identify the possible causes. The results of the studies will help doctors optimise the preventive treatment, and help reduce the impact of Rhesus disease. 
Study population: 
Anti-D Dosage Study: We will recruit 300 Rhesus-negative pregnant women who have a negative antibody screen, and have no history of adverse reactions to anti-D injections.
Anti-D Sensitization Review: We will recruit women with evidence of sensitisation to the Rhesus-D antigen in the last 3 years. Based on population estimates, there will be up to 30 eligible women for this study in WA.
Study design &amp; methods:
Anti-D Dosage Study: Three hundred women will be recruited from antenatal clinics in KEMH at &lt;28 weeks of pregnancy. Women will be allocated to one of two groups. The control group will receive standard antenatal care, which includes two injections of anti-D antibody, six weeks apart (at 28 and 34 weeks of gestation). The single-dose group will receive one, larger dose injection of anti-D at 28 weeks. At delivery, all participants will have a blood test which checks for anti-D antibody. All participants will otherwise receive standard care for the prevention of sensitisation, including a) receiving additional anti-D injections after any potential sensitizing events during pregnancy and b) receiving an injection of anti-D antibody after delivery if their baby is Rhesus-positive. Relevant medical information will be extracted from medical records.
Anti-D Sensitization Review: All women with evidence of sensitisation to the Rhesus-D antigen in the last 3 years will be interviewed and their medical records reviewed to identify, if possible, the timing and potential contributing factors for sensitisation. 
Outcomes:
This study will provide unique data for the National Blood Authority and Australian clinicians.  It will provide information about the proportion of women that still have circulating anti-D at the time of delivery using the Australian two-dose (625IU) regime.  This will enable a direct comparison to that achieved by the one-dose (1500IU) regime that is currently being proposed for Australian pregnant women. The sensitization review will also provide information to further advance Rhesus disease prevention in Australia by identifying potential targets for education campaigns. 
Potential ethical issues:
There is minimal risk to participants as the intervention (a single dose of anti-D antibody) is an approved regime used in routine clinical practice in Europe and the USA.
