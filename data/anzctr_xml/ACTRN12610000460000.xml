    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Potentially eligible stroke survivors will be approached via the Stroke Clinics of the Waitemata District Health Boards (DHB). Additional participants may be sourced from the Stroke Foundation, and directly from the community via newspaper advertisement. A research assistant will liaise with clinical staff  and screen hospital databases, where available, to identify potential participants. The study research assistant will send an information sheet to all potential participants explaining the study and asking them if they would like to participate in the study. About one week later all potential participants will be contacted by telephone (or letter, where telephone is unavailable) to answer any questions and ascertain the persons willingness to participate.
Once the project team are notified of potential participants, informed written consent will be sought. Only people who meet the eligibility criteria and provide written informed consent will be included. Once initial assessment is completed by a blinded assesor, participants will be randomly assigned to either the Strength for Task Training (STT), Progressive Resisted Strength Training (PRST), Motor Skill Training (MST), or Usual Care Control (UCC) group. Randomisation will be concealed using an on-line randomisation service based at the School of Rehabilitation and Occupation Studies, AUT University.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomised participants will receive the intervention once a group of 5 participants has accrued. Randomisation will be concealed using an on-line randomisation service based at the School of Rehabilitation and Occupation Studies, AUT University.</sequence>

    <designfeatures>This mixed method study will involve a randomised controlled pilot trial design with four intervention groups to investigate the effect of STT on participation, locomotor function and neural plasticity in twenty people aged over 18 years with a single stroke and to consider the feasibility of the research protocol for a larger randomised controlled trial. 
Outcome measures of participation, locomotor function and neural plasticity, and semi-structured interviews to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, will be conducted prior to and post intervention. In addition the success of the sampling and recruitment strategy and the integrity of the trial protocol will be monitored using specific markers of success.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is the most common cause of walking disability for New Zealanders. We know that improvements in walking are important for community participation and improved quality of life for people with stroke and this makes walking a very important focus of rehabilitation.
When strength training is used to rehabilitate walking in people with stroke there are no improvements in walking ability. Whilst motor skill training studies show a modest improvement in walking, gains are still very limited. There is evidence that strength training followed immediately by practice of a specific motor skill may give better results. We expect our combination of strength training immediately followed by motor skill training (Strength for Task Training) will lead to improved walking. We will use a pilot study to determine if Strength for Task Training (STT) has potential as an effective rehabilitation strategy to improve walking ability in people following stroke and to establish the feasibility of the research methods planned to conduct a larger Randomised Clinical Trial.</summary>
