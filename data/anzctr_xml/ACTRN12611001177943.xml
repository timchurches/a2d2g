  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants received oral vitamin D3 supplementation.  Depending on their 25 hydroxivitamin D (25(OH)D) levels  at presentation doses were as follows:
1. 25(OH)D &lt; 27.5 nmol/L: either vitamin D3 200,000 IU depot once (as a one-off dose) or 5000 IU daily for 6-8 weeks
2. 25(OH)D 27.5-78 nmol/: either vitamin D3 100,000 IU depot as a on-off dose or 2500 IU daily for 6-8 weeks. 
25(OH)D measurement was repeated 6-8, 14-16, 20-22 and 26-34 weeks later and treatment continued according to the above mentioned schedule if levels were &lt;78 nmol/L. Time points were determined from the starting date of therapy. Variations occured due to participant-availability.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>After arrival in Western Australia resettled refugees undergo an initial health assessment that includes testing for 25(OH) vitamin D. An internal audit in 2007/8 revealed that of the 2400 patients assessed, 45% were vitamin D deficient (25(OH)D:&lt;27.5 nmol/L) and 54% insufficient (25(OH)D:27.5-78 nmol/L). The use of high-dose depot vitamin D therapy is increasing, but there are few data on its use in children. 
OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficiency and safety of daily versus depot oral vitamin D supplementation in refugee children 
METHODS: Refugee children aged 0-16 years with 25(OH)D levels &lt;78 nmol/L were recruited through a refugee tertiary clinic and randomized as follows: those with vitamin D deficiency received either vitamin D3 200,000 IU depot or 5000 IU daily and those with vitamin D insufficiency 100,000 IU depot or 2500 IU daily. 25(OH)D measurement was repeated 6-8 and 14-16 an 22-24 weeks later and treatment continued if levels were &lt;78 nmol/L. Other biochemical parameters included calcium and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Data on sun exposure, season , diet, country of origin and skin pigmentation were collected.   
RESULTS: A first analysis looking at 84 subjects with complete data sets revealed significant improvements in 25(OH)D between visits (p&lt;0.05) without difference between depot and daily treatment groups. Sun exposure and oral calcium intake were very low. The study is ongoing. 
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with both daily and depot vitamin D3 resulted in similar improvements and could normalize vitamin D levels during the initial treatment phase. Depot vitamin D3 therapy was a safe and well accepted therapeutic option. It was difficult to achieve long term improvement even under controlled conditions. Support by public health initiatives is required.</summary>
