  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Asthma imposes a huge social and economic burden on our community, accounting for approximately 1.4% of the total expenditure on health in Australia. Major risk factors for exacerbations include previous exacerbations, young age, poorly controlled asthma, and, in particular, viral respiratory infections. Viral induced exacerbations account for between 80 to 85% of all asthma exacerbations, with the most common viruses including rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and the influenza virus.

The primary aim of this study is to prevent lower respiratory tract infections over the treatment period using a novel bacterial-derived immunostimulant OM85.

OM85 has bacterial lysates of strains frequently encountered in respiratory infections. OM85 BV reduces the susceptibility to suffer from recurrent respiratory infections by priming the immune system. This will help in preventing and reducing the respiratory symptoms to better control asthma in children and reduce severe exacerbations of asthma in children. Lower respiratory events are defined as a wheezy lower respiratory infection lasting three or more days requiring additional asthma medication.</summary>
