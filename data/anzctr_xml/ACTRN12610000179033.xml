  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Male or female primary school-aged children.
Presence of live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp.  The presence of live lice will be determined from a visual inspection of the hair and scalp, and dry-combing of the hair.  Combing will stop immediately once live lice are detected.  The presence of lice eggs alone is not a sufficient condition for inclusion in the trial.  
Available for the duration of the trial.

    <exclusivecriteria>History of allergies or adverse reactions to head lice products or the components of the specific products being tested.
Treatment with any head lice product in the 4 weeks prior to participation in this trial.
Treatment with any head lice product during the trial.
Treatment with a head lice comb during the trial if the subject is found to be louse free on the final examination day.
Presence of scalp disease(s). 
If the subject has a sibling in Grade 1-7, who lived at the same residence during the treatment period the sibling must be examined for lice and if infested, enrolled in this study or wet combed out on multiple days.  
Subjects must have one fixed place of residence during the trial.</exclusivecriteria>

    <summary>NeutraLice Lotion, NeutraLice Advance and Banlice Mousse will be applied at weekly intervals.  
The louse free rate one day after the last treatment will be determined by wet combing for the Intention to Treat population (primary outcome measure) and the Per Protocol population (secondary outcome measure). The louse free rate at Day 1 will be determined by dry combing (secondary outcome measure).</summary>
