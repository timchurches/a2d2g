  <interventions>
    <interventions>Standard cataract surgery was performed through a 2.75mm temporal section with 2 limbal based parancentsis at ninety degrees to the main section. The cataract was removed utilising an intact continuous curvilinear capsulorexhsis and phacemulusification of the lens and a divide and conquer technique. The toric intraocular lens implant (TIOL) (eithe Zeiss or Rayner) was inserted to correct the defocus from the cataractous lens extraction and dialed into the correct orientation to neutralise the corneal based astigmatsm. The procedure takes about 40 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>The alternate toric intraocular lens implant (TIOL) (Rayner or Zeiss) was used in the second eye of the study. Standard cataract surgery was performed through a 2.75mm temporal section with 2 limbal based parancentsis at ninety degrees to the main section. The cataract was removed utilising an intact continuous curvilinear capsulorexhsis and phacemulusification of the lens and a divide and conquer technique. The TIOL was inserted to correct the defocus from the cataractous lens extraction and dialed into the correct orientation to neutralise the corneal based astigmatsm. The procedure takes about 40 minutes. 

The second eye eye is operated on bewteen 1 and 6 months after the first operation.</comparator>

    <concealment>The research assistant will provide the randomisation but will not know the patient. The operating surgeon will implant the first eye of the patient as per the research assistants instruction.  The first eye will be randomised to one of two toric IOLs. The other eye will have the alternate IOL inserted in due course. The patient will be aware thay have one of two toric IOLs but they will not be told which is which. Lens stickers typically placed in the notes will be replaced with a study number. Only on completeion of follow up will the patient be informed and IOL info inserted.</concealment>
    <sequence>Stratified randomisation based on corneal astigmatism &lt;1.5D, &lt;2.5D, &lt;3.5 D and &gt;3.5D. Randomisation occuring as per randomisation tables from the Mater Research support center website http://www.materresearch.org/mrsc/Resources/StatTools/RanBlock.php</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study seeks to compare the stability and visual outcomes of patients recieiving 2 commonly used brands of toric intraocular lens implant (TIOL) used to correct corneal based astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery. Accuracy of implantation as well as post operative stability and effectivity of astigmatic correction will be assessed.</summary>
