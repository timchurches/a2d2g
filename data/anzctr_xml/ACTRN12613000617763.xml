  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a single-arm open label study to monitor the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine, the first-line antimalarial in Zimbabwe. Eligible patients will be treated with fixed combination tablet containing 1.5 mg base artemether and 12 mg base lumefantrine. The number of tablets per dose will be determined according to body weight as per standard of care. Patients will be administered the dose by study staff twice a day for three consecutive days.  Patients will be seen daily for the first 3 days and then will return to the health center for clinical and parasitological evaluation on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 or any other day if symptoms re-occurred.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a surveillance study to monitor the safety and efficacy of the fixed combination of artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in children and adults.  Patients will be recruited from 8 sentinel sites located in 8 malarious provinces of Zimbabwe. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response accroding to WHO protocol (2009).</summary>
