  <interventions>
    <interventions>Children with Benign Focal Epilepsy of Childhood (BFEC), children with the BFEC trait (those with abnormal EEGs characteristic of BFEC but no history of seizures), unaffected siblings and parents of children with BFEC. Transcranial magnetic stimulation will be used to assess cortical excitability.
All participants will have TMS studies undertaken at enrolment. Children with BFEC or the EEG trait will have additional TMS studies undertaken at 6 months and 12 months after enrolment. Single or paired TMS pulses will be delivered to the right and left hemisphere and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be recorded in 2 of the following muscles of each hand: 1st dorsal interosseus, abductor pollicis brevis and abductor digiti minimi muscles. Surface emg electrodes (stick ons) will be used to record MEPs. The following measures of cortical excitation and inhibition will be recorded:
1. Resting motor threshold (RMT)
2. Stimulus amplitude to evoke an average MEP of 1mV
3. Recruitment curve (MEPs at varying stimulus intensity)
4. Intracortical excitation or facilitation (ICF) using paired pulse stimuli
5. Intracortical inhibition, short and long latency (SICI, LICI), using paired pulse stimulation
6. Late intracortical dysinhibition (LICD) using paired pulse stimulation
7. Ipsilateral silent period 
The duration of the TMS study will be about 1 hour

All participants will have an Electro-encephalogram (EEG) recorded at enrolment as per standard PMH clinical protocol. Children with BFEC or EEG trait will have additional EEGs recorded at 6 months and 12 months after recruitment.

    <statisticalmethods>Independent sample t tests, ANOVA and repeated measures ANOVA will be utilised to investigate the difference in the cortical excitability parameters (continuous variables) between groups.   Chi-square tests will also be performed for categorical outcomes.  We will further employ regression methods to investigate the associations of cortical excitability parameters with seizure frequency and treatment (On and Off AEDs).

Badawy et al. (2013a, Patterns of cortical hyperexcitability in adolescent/adult-onset generalized epilepsies. Epilepsia, 54(5):871878) compared adult patients with different kinds of epilepsy; they were able to show significant differences between groups using a sample size of approx. 20 subjects in each group.  We have a minimum sample size of 20 in each group.   With the sample size we can detect an effect size (difference) of one standard deviation of a given continuous outcome variable between groups with a statistical power&gt;80% and at the significance of 0.05.  The one standard deviation is a large effect size that is commonly used for study design (Cohen J. A Power Primer. Physiol Bull 1992 112:155).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Benign Focal Epilepsy of Childhood (BFEC) is the most common type of partial motor epilepsy in the school aged child. BFEC is diagnosed based on clinical features and characteristic abnormalities on their Electroencephalogram (EEG). The frequency of seizures in BFEC is quite low and long term prognosis is generally good. Most children may not require anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) to treat seizures. However the course may be complicated by language and cognitive impairment, by frequent or severe seizures, Todd's paresis and even status epilepticus. Inspite of being one of the most frequent epilepsies, the underlying brain abnormalities remain poorly understood. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) evaluates brain excitability in a safe, non-invasive manner. TMS may help predict the clinical severity, requirement and response to AEDs, and identify those likely to have language and cognitive impairment. 
BFEC is postulated to be a genetic epilepsy with possible multifactorial influence. Identical epileptiform features on EEG may be found in siblings and first degree relatives of affected children. It is not clear why some children in the family have seizures and others do not - study of brain excitability may help answer these questions. Epileptiform abnormalities similar to that in BFEC are also sometimes noted incidentally in EEGs of normal children.
In this project we plan to use TMS to study children with BFEC, their unaffected  siblings and parents using TMS and EEG. Abnormalities in brain excitability will be correlated with clinical features (including frequency and severity of seizures), requirement and response to AEDs, and abnormality in neurological development. This may allow us to use TMS to prognosticate whether asymptomatic children will develop seizures, which children will require treatment, which AEDs to use, and those likely to need monitoring of brain function (e.g. language).
