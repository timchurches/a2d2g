  <interventions>
    <interventions>Experimental group is provided with: 1) a Gymstick (Trademark) (a lightweight graphite shaft, with elastic tubing and foot straps that provide resistance and can be used to exercise all of the major muscle groups) ; 2) a 12 week (3 sessions/wk for 30-40min each session) home-based resistance training program incorporating the Gymstick (Trademark), and; 3) A single 60-90min face-to-face consultation with an exercise specialist (at the commencement of the training program) who will demonstrate the exercises to the men and assist them with selection of their starting resistance levels for each exercise.</interventions>
    <comparator>No treatment wait-list control group. At the completion of the 12 week experimental phase, this group will have access to the same exercise program and equipment supplied to the experimental group should they desire.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Participation in physical activity (PA) helps relieve side effects of prostate cancer treatment, reduces depression and  anxiety, enhances quality of life and  importantly, improves prostate cancer (PCa)-specific survival. There are few existing exercise programs to promote and support behaviour change designed specifically for this cohort and the few available are generally not home-based or widely available. The intervention proposed here addresses these challenges in a cost-effective manner.</summary>
