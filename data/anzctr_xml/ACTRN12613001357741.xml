    <statisticalmethods>We based our sample size calculation on data of Murphy and colleagues [ref: Murphy GS, Anesthesiology 2008] who observed a 30% incidence of PORC, and Butterly et al.[ ref: Butterly A,BJA2010] who found 22% incidence of PORC that was associated with prolonged PACU discharge times. Assuming an approximate 25% incidence of PORC, it was calculated that 50 patients with and 200 patients without PORC would provide a &gt;80% power to detect a 10% difference in PACU length of stay with a standard deviation of 20%.
Data will be tested for normal distribution by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally distributed data will be reported as a mean (standard deviation) and other continuous data reported as median (inter-quartile range). IBM SPSS version 19 will be used for statistical analysis. For comparison of means/medians, Students T test or Mann Whitney U test will be used as appropriate. Proportional data will be compared using the Chi-squared test or Fishers Exact test (eg. presence of complications such as nausea, vomiting and oyxgen desaturation).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We aimed to characterize and define the incidence and prevalence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) in the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) of our tertiary referral womens centre in 250 patients after major gynaecological, breast and aesthetic surgery. Our primary outcome variable is the incidence of PORC in awake extubated patients 10 min post-PACU arrival, where a TOF ratio &lt;0.9 is used as criteria for defining postoperative residual weakness. Secondary outcome measures studied are the presence of side effects (nausea and vomiting), adverse respiratory events, time to PACU discharge readiness and actual length of PACU stay.</summary>
