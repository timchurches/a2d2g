    <summary>Primary objective:

      To demonstrate the non-inferiority of insulin glargine in comparison to insulin detemir in
      term of percentage of patients who reach the target of HbA1c &lt; 7% at the end of the treatment
      period and do not experience symptomatic hypoglycemia, confirmed by plasma glucose (PG) = 56
      mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L)

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare between the 2 treatment groups, the percentage of patients who reach the
           target of HbA1c &lt; 7% and &lt; 6.5% at the end of the treatment period

        -  To compare the changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG)

        -  To compare the evolution of blood glucose profiles

        -  To compare the day to day FPG variability, the insulin doses

        -  To determine in each treatment group the biochemical and patient-related determinants of
           failure to reach HbA1c targets

        -  To compare the overall incidence and rate of symptomatic hypoglycemia and nocturnal
           symptomatic hypoglycemia confirmed by PG = 56 mg/dL (3.1 mmol/L)

        -  To compare over the treatment period, the overall incidence and rate of symptomatic
           hypoglycemia and symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia (with PG = 70 mg/dL [3.9 mmol/L]),
           of symptomatic day-time hypoglycemia (with PG = 70 mg/dL and with PG = 56 mg/dL), of
           severe hypoglycemia, of asymptomatic hypoglycemia with PG = 56 mg/dL

        -  To compare the overall safety: incidence of adverse events (including serious
           hypoglycemia and local tolerance at injection site), change in body weight, in waist
           circumference and in waist / hip ratio

        -  To assess the quality of life and treatment satisfaction</summary>
