  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention will include the following evidence based components over a 9-month period (three school terms):
1. Executive support The Principal will be encouraged to communicate their support for the healthy canteen intervention to Canteen Managers and P&amp;C group by encouraging their participation in a professional development workshop and consent to receiving ongoing support. 
2. Consensus processesConsensus processes with the Canteen Manager and canteen staff will be conducted to reach agreement regarding the implementation of the healthy canteen strategy.  Support staff will assist Canteen Managers to develop a local Canteen Action Plan (CAP) to co-ordinate implementation tasks. . 
3. Staff training  A one day (5 hour) training workshop will be provided to Canteen Managers and parent representatives will provide education and skill development in nutrition, canteen stock and financial management, pricing and promotion, and change management. Training will combine didactic and interactive components including opportunities for self-assessment, role play and facilitator provided feedback. The training will be facilitated by Dietitians experienced in delivering this training to canteen managers. 
4. Tools and resources - Printed instructional materials, sample policies/menus, planning templates, pricing guides, product lists of policy compliant menu items, supplier contacts and menu assessment feedback will be provided to all school Canteen Managers. Such resources will be sourced from the Department of Education and Communities, Nutrition Australia, and the Healthy Kids Association.
5. On-going support Following training, canteen managers will receive two support contacts per school term (via email, telephone, text message or in person) for 9 months to continue to help them with assessing and categorising menu item and pricing and promotion strategies. These contacts will also be used to encourage canteen managers to review progress, discuss deficits identified from self-monitoring; and facilitate problem solving to policy implementation.  
6. Recognition- Schools assessed during intervention period as compliant with the canteen policy will be sent a congratulatory letter and telephoned from the Project Co-ordinator. Menu compliant schools will also be promoted to other intervention schools using marketing strategies (see below). 
7. Performance monitoring and feedback two menu reviews will be used to compile written feedback report to the Canteen Manager, P&amp;C and School Principal. The reports will include graphs comparing progress toward implementation of the healthy canteens policy Verbal feedback and discussion of feedback reports will also occur during telephone support calls.  
8. Marketing strategies Principals and parent groups will receive a letter overviewing the support available and encouraging their participation in the program. Project newsletters will be used to communicate key messages and case study successful implementation approaches.  Schools will be encouraged to communicate the need for implementation to staff, parents and students via usual communication strategies.

    <comparator>All comparison schools will receive usual support which includes; access to standard teacher development opportunities regarding healthy eating and physical activity programs which could include staff training or resources through the Healthy Childrens Initiative.

Information required to classify menu items that is not provided on the canteen menu will be collected from: nutrition information panels on products during canteen visits, by observation, or via interviews with Canteen Managers (for prepared products such as muffins, cakes or sandwiches).

    <exclusivecriteria>Schools from the Australian Independent Schools Association will be ineligible as implementation of the Fresh Tastes @ School canteen policy is not mandated for such schools. Schools with secondary students (central schools), catering exclusively for children requiring specialist care, and schools without a canteen will also be ineligible. Lastly, schools currently implementing obesity prevention policies and practices to a high standard, as defined by local health service school environment monitoring data at baseline will be excluded.</exclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Lists of Department of Education and Communities and Catholic Schools Office primary schools in the Hunter New England region will serve as the sampling frame. Schools who are ineligible for the study (as per Exclusion Criteria above) will be removed from the list, which will then be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either an intervention or control group by an independent Statistician using a computerised random number function. 
Schools who are allocated to the intervention group will be mailed out a study information letter addressed to the school Principals, parent representatives and Canteen Managers outlining along with an invitation to attend Canteen Manager Training. Phone call recruitment will follow one week later to answer any questions regarding participation and to request consent.

    <statisticalmethods>Trial outcomes will be assessed by comparing between group differences at follow-up regarding: i) the proportion of schools with a canteen menu containing foods or beverages prohibited from regular sale (red or banned items); and ii) the proportion of schools where healthy canteen items represent the majority (&gt;50%) of products listed on the menu, under an intention to treat approach. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed using logistic regression models adjusting for baseline values and with all available data. Imputation will be used as part of sensitivity analysis including imputation of baseline values for schools not providing follow-up data. Based on previous recruitment experiences of the research team in this setting 80% of participating schools will be retained at follow-up. Assuming a prevalence of 15% at follow-up in the comparison group for both primary trial outcomes, the sample will be sufficient to detect an absolute difference of 32% with 80% power and an alpha of 0.05.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The adoption of healthy school canteen policies has been recommended as a strategy to prevent excessive weight gain. A number of jurisdictions in Australia and internationally have policies requiring school adoption of healthy canteen strategies. Despite this, internationally, schools have failed to adopt healthy canteen practices consistent with such policies. If the benefits of obesity prevention initiatives are to be realised, policies recommended to prevent overweight must be implemented. However, research measuring the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate widespread implementation of health promoting policies and practices in schools is limited. The aim of the research is to assess the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention intervention in increasing canteen practices consistent with the mandatory NSW government healthy canteen policy (Fresh Tastes @ School). The study will employ a randomised trial design. Sixty-three primary schools will be randomised to receive a 9 month intervention, or a no intervention comparison group. The intervention will facilitate implementation of the policy through encouraging executive support and endorsement, training, resources, monitoring and feedback, communication strategies and ongoing telephone support.  The effectiveness of the intervention will be determined by comparing post intervention differences between canteen menus audited by Dietitians in: i) the proportion of schools with a canteen menu containing foods or beverages restricted (red items) under the policy and; ii) the proportion of schools where healthy canteen items (green) represent the majority (&gt;50%) of products listed on the menu as recommended by the policy. </summary>
