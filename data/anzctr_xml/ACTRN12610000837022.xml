  <interventions>
    <interventions>For CAMPATH Group, the intervention is administration of 2 doses of alemtuzumab 20 mg intravenously, 1st dose within 6 hours post anastomosis and 2nd dose 24 hours after 1st dose, followed by treatment with low-dose Tacrolimus (oral tablets twice daily for 3 years) adjusted to Trough levels of 5-7 ng/mL for duration of trial. Patients will be followed up for 3 years after transplantation surgery.</interventions>
    <comparator>Administration of Tacrolimus in both groups is twice daily. For Campath Group, tacrolimus treatment will be initiated at 0.15 mg/kg twice a day per oral, will be administered a window of 48 hours after the second dose of alemtuzumab 20 mg intravenously. Subsequently, the tacrolimus dose will be lower to 0.1 mg/kg twice a day per oral. Thereafter, tacrolimus doses will be adjusted to maintain tacrolimus trough level of 5-7 ng/mL, and the patients will be maintained on low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy for duration of trial unless considered a treatment failure, and will be followed up for 3 years after transplantation surgery. For STANDARD Group, tacrolimus 0.15 mg/kg twice a day per oral with doses adjusted to whole blood trough level of 10-15 ng/mL for the first 6 months. Subsequently, doses will be adjusted to achieve trough tacrolimus level of 8-10 ng/mL. The first dose of tacrolimus must be administered within 12 hours after anastomosis.
 Administration of oral Azathioprine in STANDARD group is once daily. 
 Administration of steroids in STANDARD  group is either daily or alternate days. Total amount of steroid given to patients on Day 0 should not exceed methylprednisolone 1 gm or it equivalent. Minimum steroid dose for STANDARD group in maintenence phase is prednisolone 30 mg/week or its equivalent. 
Patients in CAMPATH group will not receive Azathioprine or maintenance steroids. Total amount of steroid given to patients on Day 0 should not exceed methylprednisolone 1 gm or its equivalent.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of chronic lesions of Interstitial Fibrosis /Tubular Atrophy and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity on protocol biopsy</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, unitl 36 months post transplant surgery.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients recruited into the study will be followed up for 3 years post transplant surgery or until patient death. Patient survival will be based on physical examination of patient at the institution.    
Analyses will be by intention to treat. 
Patient survival will be estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and comparison between the CAMPATH and STANDARD groups will be performed using the Log Rank test.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, and subsequently on Day 2, weekly from week 2 to 8, monthly from months 3 to 12 and at months 18, 24, 30 and 36.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>All patients recruited into the study will be followed up for 3 years post transplant surgery or until patient death. Graft survival is defined by the presence of renal function adequate to prevent the patient from resuming maintenance dialysis. 
Serum creatinine and urea, creatinine clearance and 24-hour urinary protein will also be measured at these time points.
Method: Blood and urine analysis</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, and subsequently on Day 2, weekly from week 2 to 8, monthly from months 3 to 12 and at months 18, 24, 30 and 36.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of acute rejection (biopsy proven)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Acute rejection is defined by a &gt;25% rise in serum creatinine from baseline, or other graft dysfunction that is confirmed by histological findings of rejection on allograft biopsy. For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, and subsequently on Day 2, weekly from week 2 to 8, monthly from months 3 to 12 and at months 18, 24, 30 and 36. Protocol biopsy will also be performed at 12 and 36 months after transplant.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Serum creatinine levels, method: blood analysis</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, and subsequently on Day 2, weekly from week 2 to 8, monthly from months 3 to 12 and at months 18, 24, 30 and 36.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Creatinine clearance, calculated Nankivell and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease clearance</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, creatinine clearance will be ,easured at Week 4 and months 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 after transplant surgery. Nankivell and Medical of Diet In Renal Disease (MDRD) clearance will be determined at baseline, subsequently on Day 2, weekly from week 2 to 8, monthly from months 3 to 12 and at months 18, 24, 30 and 36.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Steroid resistant rejection, is defined as serum creatinine that continues to increase, or fails to return to within 25% of baseline within 1 week after treatment for rejection is started. A second episode of acute rejection occurring within 1 month after the index episode with apparent initial steroid responsiveness, is also defined as steroid resistant rejection. 
Method: Blood analysis will be used to determine serum creatinine values.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, unitl 36 months post transplant surgery. Steroid resistant rejection occurring at any time point within the study period will be included in the analysis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence of chronic rejection. Chronic rejection will be diagnosed from histological examination of renal biopsy tissue; diagnosis and interpretation of renal biopsy will be based on Banff criteria. 
Renal biopsy specimens will be obtained from protocol biopsies or may be obtained following biopsy for cause. Protocol renal biopsy will be performed for all patients at 12 and 36 month after transplant surgery. Biopsy for cause will be performed to evaluate renal dysfunction, proteinuria etc.</outcome>
      <timepoint>For both groups, followup will be from time of transplant surgery, until 36 months post transplant surgery. Chronic rejection occurring at any time point within the study period will be included in the analysis.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
