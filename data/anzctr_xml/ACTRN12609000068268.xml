  <interventions>
    <interventions>Adult subjects with myopia will wear orthokeratology lenses (BE design; Boston XO2 material) in both eyes on an overnight basis, only worn while asleep, for a 6 week period.  Baseline measurements will be obtained from the first two weeks of lens wear.  All subjects will then be asked to cease lens wear for the following 2 weeks.  All subjects will then be asked to wear different orthokeratology lenses for the subsequent 2 weeks on an overnight basis only while asleep.  The lens design worn during the second period of wear will also be of BE design and made from Boston XO2 material, however the lens parameters will be altered.  In one eye, the lens edge lift angle will be reduced  to create a tighter peripheral lens fit while the other eye will have the lens optic zone diameter decreased from 6mm to 5mm.  The measurements from this second lens wear period will be compared with those obtained from baseline lens wear.</interventions>

    <summary>This study aims to determine the lens parameters in orthokeratology lenses that allow manipulation of peripheral refraction in adult myopes.  Additionally, relationships between corneal topography and peripheral refraction changes induced by orthokeratology lenses will be investigated.</summary>
