  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study has two main aims. The first is to assess whether Dexamethasone can increase the
      number of patients with who respond to Velcade.

      The second aim of this study is to see whether treating patients with relapsed multiple
      myeloma with Velcade and Dexamethasone for a longer period of time extends the time that the
      myeloma is under control.</summary>
