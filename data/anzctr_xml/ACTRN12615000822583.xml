  <interventions>
    <interventions>This project is a pilot study of an intervention program called Body Brain Life-Fit (BBL-Fit). BBL-Fit includes education about dementia, online modules focussing on modifiable risk and protective factors that incorporate behaviour change components, a validated physical activity intervention and where indicated a diet intervention. 

BBL-Fit is an intervention package that builds on two published interventions developed by our team: the BBL intervention (Trial ID:ACTRN12612000147886) and the Fitness for the Ageing Brain (FABs; Trial ID: ACTRN 12609000755235). We have revised our interventions to include newly available health self-monitoring technology, adapted our modules after extensive consumer evaluation, and included a more intensive physical activity program designed for a younger age-group. The sample will be middle-aged adults who have multiple risk factors for developing dementia but without a diagnosis of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 

Participants in the BBL-FIT group will required to complete 8 modules (dementia literacy, risk factors, physical activity, nutrition, health, cognitive activity, social activity and mood) delivered online, and receive an individually tailored one hour face to face physical activity session and where indicated an individually tailored one hour face to face dietary session. They will complete one module per week, each taking approximately 30-40 minutes. Participants will receive an email reminding them of the next module (during the first 8 weeks of the trial). Participants who are late competing modules will receive up to 3 reminder emails. 

Duration and frequency of physical activity (PA) program will vary between participants. An exercise physiologist will deliver individual sessions, writing and supervise physical activity programs. For those not doing any regular PA at baseline, the target will be 150 minutes/week moderate intensity PA, for those doing less than 100 minutes/week, an additional 100 minutes/week will be prescribed and for those meeting the target, an additional 50 minutes/week will be prescribed. A diary in the format of a calendar will be used to record PA and rating of perceived exertion.

The dietary intervention will be provided to those individuals who have low (&lt;20) or high (30+) BMI, have experience significant weight gain or loss in the last 6 months to 3 years or indicate an unhealthy dietary pattern at the baseline assessment. A one hour face to face intervention will involve individually tailored dietary advice, formal dietary prescription, and a dietician tailored plan. A diary similar to that for physical activity program will be used to record dietary pattern. 

A pilot study will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the BBL-Fit with 40 participants aged 45-60 for a duration of 10 weeks.
</interventions>
    <comparator>Usual Care (UC): Participants allocated to the UC group proceed with their normal activities and access health services as required over the trial period. They will also receive a face to face risk reduction workshop approximately 12 weeks after the initial assessment, i.e. after all study time points have been completed. This workshop will provide the information contained in the BBL-Fit intervention as a mean of debriefing at the end of the intervention. This will provide extensive information on how to reduce risk of developing dementia. </comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Primary Outcome measure is cognitive ability. Cognitive ability will be assessed by a composite of a subset of the Iowa Healthy and Active Minds Study (IHAMS) battery (Useful Field of View, Trail making A and B, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Stroop Word) and a memory measure (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test). </outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological tests will be assessed at baseline and at 13 weeks (upon completion of the intervention).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dementia risk will be assessed with the ANU-ADRI, a measure of Alzheimers Disease Risk that has been validated to predict AD and dementia incidence. The ANU-ADRI is comprised of validated scales assessing 15 individual risk and protective factors including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire to assess Physical Activity level. The factors assessed include age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, pesticide exposure, depression, social networks, cognitive activity, education level, physical activity and fish consumption.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Moderate-vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) is a continuous measure of activity that registers 3 or more Metabolic Equivalents of Task (METs) for 10 minutes or longer on a Sensewear, which is worn for 7 days at baseline and 11 weeks. MVPA will be recorded in both Control and BBL-Fit groups. </outcome>

      <outcome>Depressive symptoms score will be assessed with the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale which is a continuous subscale of the ANU-ADRI.

All participants will be required to have internet access at home, be Australian permanent resident or citizen and agree to attend the Centre for Research on Ageing, Health, and wellbeing for two face to face assessments (baseline and 11 weeks) and a face to face workshop for those in UC group. </inclusivecriteria>

Randomisation will be stratified by gender. 
Group allocation will then be concealed using sealed envelopes. </concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project is a pilot study of an intervention program called Body Brain Life-Fit (BBL-Fit). BBL-Fit aims to determine the effect of a multi-domain dementia risk reduction intervention on cognitive function in community dwelling middle-aged adults with multiple risk factors for dementia. The sample will be healthy but have several risk factors for dementia. The intervention is tailored to individuals based on their level of risk in particular domains. There will be two groups; a control group who receives a pre and post assessment without interventions, and an intervention group who receive online intervention as well as physical activity and dietary (where indicated) interventions. </summary>
