  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - RO5212054

Experimental: RO5212054: Continuous Dosing Cohort - Participants will receive RO5212054 in escalating dose levels.

Experimental: RO5212054: New Formulation (F05) Bridging Cohort - Participants will receive RO5212054 as a single dose of new formulation (F05-150 mg film-coated tablet with different ratios of ingredients than F03 to increase bioavailability) and a single dose of current clinical Formulation (F03-150 mg film-coated tablet) in a cross-over manner. Participants will be alternately assigned to receive either F05 or F03 as their first dose, followed by the opposite Formulation as their second dose. Dose of RO5212054 will be decided based on the results of continuous dosing cohort.


Treatment: drugs: RO5212054
Participants will receive RO5212054 at a starting dose of 200 milligrams (mg) orally once daily in each 21 day cycle. Dose levels for escalation will be decided based on the safety assessment of previous cohort. Dose escalations in increments of 50-100 percent are planned.
