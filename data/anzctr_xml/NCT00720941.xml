  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free Survival (PFS) - PFS is defined as the interval between the date of randomization and the earliest date of progressive disease (PD), as defined by the Independent Review Committee (IRC), or death due to any cause. The IRC defined PD per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1. Per RECIST, PD is defined as a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of &gt;=1 new lesion. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for PFS estimates.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) Scale Scores at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively) - The FACIT-F scale measures the severity and impact of fatigue on functioning and health related quality of life (HRQoL) experienced in the past seven days. The level of fatigue is measured by 13 questions assessed on a four-point scale (0=not at all fatigued; 1=a little bit fatigued; 2=somewhat fatigued; 3=quite a bit fatigued; 4=very much fatigued; possible total score of 0 to 52).

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Supplementary Quality of Life Questions (SQLQ) Scale Worst Soreness Scores at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively) - The SQLQ scale consists of 5 items that assess the worst mouth and throat, hand, and foot soreness, as well as limitations due to mouth/throat and foot soreness. Participants were asked to assess their worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness by answering the question of " In the past 4 weeks, what was your worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness?" by using the following 4-point scale: 0, I never had any soreness; 1, I had a little bit of soreness; 2, I had quite a lot of soreness; 3, I had severe soreness. A positive mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Supplementary Quality of Life Questions (SQLQ) Limitations Due to Mouth and Throat Soreness Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively) - The SQLQ consists of 5 items assessing the worst mouth/throat, hand, and foot soreness, and limitations due to mouth/throat and foot soreness. Participants (par.) assessed the limitations caused by their mouth/throat soreness by answering the question of "In the past 4 weeks, how much did your worst mouth/throat soreness limit you in the following activities: swallowing/eating/drinking/talking/sleeping" by using the following 4-point scale: 0, not limited; 1, limited a little; 2, limited a lot; 3, unable to do. The overall limitation score (15=best; 0=worst), based on the individual scores for the 5 activities, is derived as follows: the actual scores were rescored by subtracting the actual score from "3" for each of the 5 categories. A high score indicates less limitation. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value. A negative mean change from Baseline represents a worsening of condition.</outcome>

The overall limitation score (15=best; 0=worst), based on the individual scores for the 5 activities, is derived as follows: the actual scores were rescored by subtracting the actual score from "3" for each of the 5 categories. A high score indicates less limitation. Change from Baseline was calculated as the assessment week value minus the Baseline value.

      <outcome>Summary of Analysis for the Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ) Score at Day 28 of Cycles 1-4 (Average of Weeks 4, 10, 16, and 22, Respectively) - The CTSQ assesses 3 domains related to the participant's satisfaction with cancer therapy: Expectations of Therapy (ET), Feelings about Side Effects (FSE), and Satisfaction with Therapy (SWT). Participants shared their thoughts on their cancer therapy (9 questions), their satisfaction with their most recently administered cancer therapy (6 questions), and if they would take the same cancer therapy if given the choice to do so again. All questions were assessed on a 5-point scale; 1, never; 5, always. Scores were averaged and transformed to a 0-100 scale; higher scores represent better health.</outcome>

      <outcome>Medical Resource Utilization (MRU): Assessed as the Mean Number of Non-study Medical Visits, Telephone Consultations, Hospital Days, and Emergency Room (ER) Visits Per 30 Days Through Week 24 - Non-study medical visits were defined as the sum of primary care physician visits, nurse practitioner/physician's assistant/nurse visits, and medical or surgical specialist visits. Days hospitalized were defined as the sum of days in the general ward and days in intensive care. The number of telephone consultations and ER visits was assessed via individual questions on the electronic Case Report Form. The endpoint was totaled through Week 24, divided by the number of days on treatment for each participant, then multiplied by 30 days to get the number of visits per 30 days.</outcome>
