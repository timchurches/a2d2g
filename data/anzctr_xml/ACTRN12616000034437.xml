  <interventions>
    <interventions>Volunteers were assigned to 3 treatment groups of Nifekalant: A/B/C, 
For every volunteer, the clinical procedure could be divied into three periods.
Period 1, Day 1, volunteers received Nifekalant D1 mg/Kg through intravenous administration in 5 minutes..
Period 2, Day 2 and Day 3, no interventions
Period 3, Day 4, volunteers received Nifekalant D1 mg/Kg through intravenous administration in 5 minutes, then immediately followed by Nifekalant D2 mg/Kg/h through intravenous infusion by a infusion pump working for 6 hours. 
For simplicity, we described the whole dose plan as (D1+ D1 mg/Kg + D2 mg/Kg/h) .
Group A : 8 volunteers received (0.3+0.3mg/Kg+0.4mg/Kg/h), 4 volunteers received (0.3+0.3mg/Kg/+0.8 mg/Kg/h) 
Group B : 8 volunteers received (0.4+0.4mg/Kg+0.6mg/Kg/h), 4 volunteers received (0.4+0.4mg/Kg+0.8 mg/Kg/h) 
Group C : 8 volunteers received (0.5+0.5mg/Kg+0.8mg/Kg/h), 4 volunteers received (0.5+0.5mg/Kg+0.6 mg/Kg/h)

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>composite primary outcome : pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic modeling. Pharmacokinetic model is simulated by nifekalant concentrations in plasma. QT interval is recorded by electrocardiogram monitoring and used as the pharmacodynamic index </outcome>
      <timepoint>For D1 dose on day 1, venous blood sample(5ml) will be taken and QT interval will be recorded at baseline, the end of infusion,  3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600 and 720 min after infusion.  
For dose plan (D1 mg/Kg+D2mg/Kg/h) on day 4, venous blood sample(5ml) will be taken and QT interval will be recorded prior to and at the end of D1 dose (D1 dose will be finish in 5minutes and immediatly followed by D2 dose, D2 dose will be holding for 6 hours ), at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min after the start of D2 dose, and at 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600 and 720 min after the whole D2 dose period.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety evaluation: safety was evaluated by
1, General physical examination, subjective symptom, weight; 
2, monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, body temperature, pulse, breathing; 
3, Laboratory examination, including routine blood tests, routine urine tests and blood biochemical blood biochemical;
4. Adverse events, based on spontaneous reports by volunteers, questioning by investigators, physical examinations; The AE information was recorded throughout the study in terms of intensity (mild, moderate, or severe), duration, outcome, and relationship to the study drug. 
5,ECG results, </outcome>
      <timepoint>ECG will be measured at baseline, and at 2h, 4h and 24h after infusion for single dose period. As for dose plan (D1+D2 mg/Kg),ECG will be measured prior to D1 dose, 2h, 4h, 6h after the start of D1 dose, and at  2h, 4h and 24h after D2 dose period.
Blood pressure will be measured at baseline, and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 1440 min after D1 dose on day 1 (D1 dose will be finished in 5 minutes). 
On day 4 ( D1 mg/Kg+D2 mg/Kg/h),blood pressure will be measured prior to D1 dose (D1 dose will be finish in 5minutes and immediatly followed by D2 dose ), at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 min after the start of D2 dose (D2 dose will be holding for 6 hours), and at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 1080 min after the whole D2 dose period.
Laboratory examination and physical examination will be measured before administration and 24h after administration.
