  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Clinical incident osteoporotic fractures

The diagnosis and classification of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were confirmed by radiographic reports.</outcome>
      <timepoint> Incident fractures to 5 years</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Vertebral deformity

Vertebral deformities were assessed using morphometric x-ray absorptiometry software on a densitometer (software version 9.1, Hologic 4500A; Hologic Corp) at years 1 and 5. Incident vertebral deformities were defined as vertebral deformities not present at year 1, with a reduction in posterior, middle, or anterior heights of 20% or more.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Years 1 and 5</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adverse events

Adverse events resulting in attendance to a health care professional were recorded in a diary at 4-month intervals and coded using the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system database of disease coding (Family Medicine Research Unit, Department of General Practice, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia). Adverse events were grouped according to 17 categories identified by the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system.22 Atraumatic incident clinical fractures and atraumatic symptomatic vertebral fractures were reported in the diary. </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) measurements of the left foot were obtained using an ultrasound densitometer (Lunar Achilles; GE Lunar Corp, Madison, Wis) at baseline and 5 years.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone density was measured at the hip and whole body on a fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Acclaim 4500A; Hologic Corp, Waltham, Mass) at 1 and 5 years. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Year 1 and year 5</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Peripheral quantitative computed tomography bone structure and density were measured in the radius at a site 4% of the length of the radius distal to the wrist joint, using a peripheral quantitative computed tomography device (XCT-2000; StraTec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany).

    <concealment>We recruited 1460 women during 1 year using a population-based approach in which a random selection of women (n = 24 800) older than 70 years on the electoral roll in Western Australia received a letter inviting them to join the study. Of these, 4312 individuals responded and were contacted by telephone. More than 98% of women of this age are on the electoral roll (n = 33 366).

Participants received calcium carbonate tablets, 600 mg twice per day (with morning and evening meals), or identical placebo tablets (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, Baulkham Hills, Australia). The randomization was stratified by allocating patients to blocks according to whether a prevalent nontraumatic fracture had occurred after age 50 years, ensuring that an equal number of patients with and without a prevalent fracture received placebo or calcium. </concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization list was produced using a random number generator. An identification number was assigned in order by the Pharmacy Department of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Australia. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical procedures were performed with SPSSPC for Windows version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). The time to first clinical event was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model with and without adjustment for covariates. Differences between normally distributed characteristics of the treatment groups were determined by univariate analysis of variance with adjustments for covariates. The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine the differences between the groups for nonnormally distributed variables. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and P&lt;.05 was considered significant.

Power calculations were conducted before study commencement, assuming a fracture rate of 3.5% per year in the placebo group and assuming that calcium would reduce the event rate by 35%. At a power of at least 80%, at an a of .05, and allowing for a 30% noncompliance rate during the 5-year study, recruitment of 737 patients per group was required.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Increased dietary calcium intake has been proposed as a population-based public health intervention to prevent osteoporotic fractures. We have examined whether calcium supplementation decreases clinical fracture risk in elderly women and its mechanism of action.

This was a five-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1460 women recruited from the population and older than 70 years (mean age, 75 years) who were randomized to receive calcium carbonate, 600 mg twice per day, or identical placebo. The primary end points included clinical incident osteoporotic fractures, vertebral deformity, and adverse events ascertained in 5 years. Bone structure was also measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry of the hip and whole body, quantitative ultrasonography of the heel, and peripheral quantitative computed tomography of the distal radius.</summary>
