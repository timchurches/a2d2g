    <interventions>This proposed research will be an experimental study trialling an autonomous paramedic model for field activation of the cardiac catheterisation lab (CCL) within St John Ambulance Service, New Zealands largest ambulance provider, without physician oversight and authorisation. We hypothesise that adopting such an approach will lead to improved patient outcomes, with reduced hospital admission times compared to the existing physician authorised systems. Economic benefits are also likely.

The criteria for autonomous paramedic CCL activation include:

1. DEFINITE STEMI ONLY: Paramedic and heart monitor interpretation of STEMI (&gt;&gt;&gt; Acute MI &lt;&lt;&lt;)

2. ST elevation equal to or greater than 1mm in two or more limbs leads (I, II, III, aVL or aVF) or 

3. ST elevation equal to or greater than 2mm in two or more contiguous chest leads (V1-V6) AND

4. Symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia of less than 12hrs duration AND

5. Transport time to hospital less than 60 minutes from time of diagnosis

The exclusion criteria include:

*Severe Dementia

*Severe dependent living

*On-going cardiac arrest requiring repeated or continual CPR/ACLS (go to ED).  Can proceed on STEMI Bypass if a single shock is required to obtain ROSC.

CCL Activation Procedure:

*Provide an early radio call to the receiving Coronary Care Unit from the scene prior to transport. 

*Ensure to provide your approximate ETA and the patients NHI number if known.

*Minimise scene time (GOAL Scene Time &lt;15 minutes)

*Continue to manage patient as per the Clinical Practice Guidelines

The overall duration of the intervention period is 20 months.

    <comparator>We will compare two groups of STEMI patients both of which have received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but following two different models of patient identification and admission to the CCL. The first group, a historic retrospective cohort, will have already received PCI under the existing model where identification of patient eligibility was first made in the Emergency Department, and admission to the CCL was activated by Emergency Department physicians. In contrast, the second group, a prospective cohort, will receive PCI following direct admission from the field to the CCL by paramedics who make an autonomous clinical decision as to patient eligibility and then activate the CCL independently. The difference between these two groups is the intervention  the new autonomous paramedic CCL activation protocol that permits this new model of pre-hospital intervention for STEMI patients eligible for PCI. 

Data for the historic cohort will be collected from patient medical records within the Ambulance Service and the receiving hospital. This will be from within a 36 month period from October 2008 to October 2011.</comparator>

      <outcome>Secondary outcome 1: Accuracy of Paramedic Application of the new Protocol.

The sensitivity and specificity along with PPV and NPV of the paramedics clinical diagnoses will be determined from their identification of patients suitable for PCI or not, and their activation or non-activation of the CCL. This will occur in the prospective cohort. Three independent cardiologists (experts) will review all cases to determine actual field diagnosis. Accuracy of paramedic application of the protocol will be measured against this gold standard. 
In the prospective cohort, the rate of True Positive and True Negative cases, along with Inappropriate Activations, False Positive and False Negative cases will be determined. To clarify further, Inappropriate Activation is defined as patient clinical presentation and/or ECG used to activate CCL does not meet activation criteria or ECG misinterpreted. False Positive is defined as patient clinical presentation and ECG used to activate CCL does meet activation criteria, but no culprit artery was found and negative biomarkers. Each of these five cases will be described as proportions of the total number of clinical decisions made. Causes of False Positives and False Negatives will be investigated.

    <designfeatures>This proposed study has a prospective analysis of differences design. Data from two separate groups of STEMI patients (an historic retrospective cohort and a prospective cohort) will be collected and analysed and a post-intervention comparison made. The Prospective data analysis enables standardisation of measures used in the study and provides stronger confidence in the design. A true experimental design with randomisation was considered neither ethical nor pragmatic due to the impossibility of blinding the protocol application, as well as the lengthy time frame required to reach statistically significant levels of patient numbers. Therefore, our selected design provides a reasonable alternative with efficient use of available patient data. Data will be collected from patient medical records within the Ambulance Service and the receiving hospital. Medical records provide an abundance of information that can be evaluated in context. However, inconsistencies may exist and information may be incomplete. For these reasons we intend to primarily draw on data in the records that are part of gold standard routine assessments conducted on all patients in context with the study. </designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on the paramedic CCL activation study involving 175 patients by Cheskes and colleagues and an a priori power analysis using their data, 143 patients are required, resulting in 72 patients within each of the two observed groups. This was assuming a statistical significance level of alpha = 0.05, denoting a 95% confidence interval, a power of 0.80 and an expected effect size of 0.30.

The current version of SPSS statistical software will be used for statistical analysis and the significance level will be set at 0.05. Initial analysis will be primarily descriptive, producing frequencies, mean and standard deviations, or medians and interquartile ranges where relevant and testing for normal distributions of continuous measures e.g. time between events. If normality is not achieved, transformations such as the log of measure will be examined. 

To test Hypothesis One, the rates of True Positive and True Negative cases, along with Inappropriate Activations and False Negative cases will be identified. The sensitivity, specificity, PPVs and NPVs of paramedic protocol application will then be calculated. This will be achieved by use of a frequency score and subsequent presentation of results utilising a frequency distribution table, with comparison of scores to the standard (a dummy variable) as determined by three independent cardiology consultants (experts). 

In order to test Hypothesis Two, both observed groups will initially be compared using Chi-squared tests and comparisons of medians will be made using Mann-Whitney U tests. Primary analyses will compare the two groups using logistic regression for dichotomous outcome measures such as mortality, and general linear models for continuous measures such as length of hospital stay. 

Confounders such as time to PCI, time to hospital, patient demographics, time of day and severity of condition will also be examined. Presentation characteristics of patients before and after initiation of the intervention will be compared (e.g. demographics, distance from hospital, presentation symptoms). If significant differences are present, those characteristics will be added as covariates to the model after examination for potential correlations.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in New Zealand, after cancer. At the acute end of the spectrum of this disease is ST-elevation myocardial Infarction (STEMI), a common type of heart attack and the most severe. However, specific treatments are available for STEMI patients, which have high rates of success, especially if they are performed early, within the first hours of symptom onset. Two such treatments are Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), a mechanical procedure, and thrombolysis, a drug therapy. Both treatments are time-dependent, with early provision conferring the greatest clinical benefits and results. Paramedics are able to play a key strategic role in achieving this objective, as they are often the first healthcare professionals to encounter the STEMI patient. 

Internationally, autonomous paramedic-delivered pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT) and field activation of the hospital Cardiac Catheterisation Lab (CCL) where PCI takes place, have both proven to be the most effective strategies in facilitating expedited delivery of these two treatment modalities. However, within New Zealand ambulance services have been slow to adopt and/or refine such paramedic-based approaches. Current New Zealand models rely on physician authorised telemetry-based systems which have proved problematic, particularly due to technological failings.

This proposed research will be an experimental study trialling an autonomous paramedic model for field activation of the CCL within St John Ambulance Service, New Zealands largest ambulance provider, without physician oversight and authorisation. We hypothesise that adopting such an approach will lead to improved patient outcomes, with reduced hospital admission times compared to the existing physician authorised systems. Economic benefits are also likely.
