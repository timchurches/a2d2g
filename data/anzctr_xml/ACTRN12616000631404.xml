    <interventions>A common intervention used to treat Chronic Pain in clinical practice is pacing. A key pain management strategy, pacing aims to enable individuals with Chronic Pain to reduce pain severity and to improve ability to participate in chosen occupations. Pacing involves preplanning, alternating between participating in an occupation, and taking a break, before pain escalates to a flare up (Sternbach, 1978). Pacing can be used over time to gradually build up tolerances in occupational participation (Nielson, Jensen, Karsdorp, &amp; Vlaeyen, 2013) within existing or reintroduced occupations. Pacing as a learned strategy significantly differs from how individuals naturally pace (Andrews, Strong, &amp; Meredith, 2012). For example, Murphy, Smith, and Alexander (2008) found that the way women with osteoarthritis naturally pace their occupations might be a reaction to exacerbating pain and fatigue severity. 

The intervention group will receive a Learned Pacing intervention which will be provided individually and face to face by associate researcher Lauren Guy, over three separate sessions lasting between 60- 90 minutes, which will be provided over three consecutive weeks. All intervention sessions will take place at the Community Based Rehabilitation Center at Sunshine Hospital. All resources provided within the intervention are based on the book Explain Pain by Butler and Moseley (2013). 

Objectives for intervention session 1:

-	To understand the background and rationale for pacing, see pg. 106 &amp; 107 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013), for information for which the education will be based on)
-	 To understand what pacing is, see pg. 116- 119 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013), for information for which the education will be based on)
-	To understand the proposed benefits of pacing, see pg. 116- 119 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013), for information for which the education will be based on)
-	 To understand how to implement pacing into daily occupations, including the identification of baseline times, see pg. 116- 119 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013), for information for which the education will be based on.
-	 To understand the concept of pacing up occupational tolerances over time, see pg. 116- 119 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013), for information for which the education will be based on.
-	To receive a homework task which will enable participants to log their pacing implementation into daily occupations and to identify pacing baseline times.
-	 To provide pages 106 &amp; 107, 116- 119 (Butler &amp; Moseley, 2013) for clients to take home to read
-	To identify a meaningful occupation/s to practically implement pacing into in the following session

Objectives for intervention session 2:

-	 To reflect on the implementation of pacing into daily occupations.
-	 To discuss identification of pacing baseline times.
-	 To troubleshoot barriers to the implementation of pacing into daily occupations.
-	 To practically implement pacing into an occupation (identified in the previous session).
-	To receive homework to continue to log implementation of pacing into daily occupations and to begin pacing up to improve occupational tolerances.

Objectives for intervention session 3: 

-	To reflect on the implementation of pacing into daily occupations.
-	 To reflect on the pacing up of occupational tolerances.
-	To troubleshoot barriers to the implementation of pacing into daily occupations and increasing occupational tolerances. 
-	To practically implement pacing into the occupation practiced in the previous session, with increased tolerances. 
-	 To be encouraged to continue implementation of pacing into daily occupations and increasing occupational tolerances.

Intervention adherence will be monitored through the use of a pacing log sheet (as mentioned above).

    <comparator>The Waitlist Control group will not receive the experimental intervention, however participants allocated to this group will receive usual care subsequently with a current wait list time of approximately 3 months. Usual care is the service the participants were originally referred for, which is a multidisciplinary pain management service. The multidisciplinary pain management service comprises allied health professionals (e.g. psychology, physiotherapy, occupational therapy) who work with clients to facilitate improvement in their ability to self manage their chronic pain. 

There is no direct incentive for participants to complete data collection, however participants will be made aware that their participation will support the research base for the Learned Pacing intervention. </comparator>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-	Participants with Chronic Pain as diagnosed by a medical practitioner. The study will include participants with Chronic Pain, which has originated from any source. Using a broad inclusion criterion will support the aim that the participants are representative of the population of interest (Pocock, 1983). 
-	Pain has persisted for greater than or equal to 3 months. Pain, which has persisted for greater than or equal to 3 months, is considered Chronic Pain, as opposed to Acute Pain.
-	Aged greater than or equal to 18 years old, secondary to the intervention being targeted to an adult level of health literacy.
-	Participants must be able to attend 5 visits to the Community Rehabilitation Center where the study is being conducted.
-	Participants are happy to be randomly assigned.

    <exclusivecriteria>-	Surgery within the last (less than or equal to) 3 months secondary to post surgical pain being treated as Acute Pain, which differs from the treatment of Chronic Pain.
-	Participants, who are unable to read, write or understand English secondary to the outcome measures and intervention being provided in English. The funding of interpreters is not feasible given insufficient funds.
-	Past or current treatment with a multidisciplinary Pain Management Service, given the possible affects of the Learned Pacing intervention may be diminished (Pocock, 1983). 
-	Participants who are unable to collaboratively complete the primary outcome measure with the researcher (e.g. develop goals, score goals).  This will only be able to be confirmed once the outcome measure is attempted with the client. 
-	Participants who are due to commence usual care within the following 5 weeks
-	Participants with any cognitive impairment. If a participants medical history includes cognitive impairment they will be excluded to ensure participants are able to provide informed consent to participate in the research project.

    <concealment>-	At first contact, following data collection and collation of demographic information, the associate researcher Lauren Guy will open the participants corresponding envelope to reveal their group allocation. All participants will be made aware of their group allocation at this time.</concealment>
    <sequence>-	As eligible participants are entered into the trial, they will be consecutively allocated a trial number, 1 to 20.
-	Principle researcher Chris Bruce, who is not involved in the data collection or provision of intervention, will use a random number generator to generate simple random allocation according to participant trial numbers, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. To prevent selection bias allocations will be concealed in a separate non-transparent envelope labelled with the participant trial number. Envelopes will then be sealed before being provided to the associate researcher Lauren Guy. The envelope will only be opened following data collection at week 1, to reveal which group the participant is allocated. 
-	Participants will be randomly assigned to either the Learned Pacing intervention or Waitlist Control group.

    <statisticalmethods>-	Data analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (IBM Corporation Software Group, Somers, NY). Data analysis will be conducted by principle researchers Dr Carol McKinstry, Mr Chris Bruce, and by associate researcher Lauren Guy.

-	A feasibility study design is being used because an effect size cannot be estimated from the literature. Therefore this research project will use a power-based approach that will yield an effect size of the treatment. This will enable a priori power analysis that will enable the calculation of an adequate sample size for future trials.  

-	Nonparametric analysis for dependent variable ordinal data will be used. 

-	The main analysis used will be summary statistics. Data will be presented as descriptive statistics and findings will be treated as being preliminary (Lancaster et al., 2004). The size of the intervention effect size will be analysed within subjects and between groups, and will be reported as the difference between the means in addition to the 95% confidence interval. 

-	In addition to the main analysis, inferential analysis will be used with the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test and Mann-Whitney U test.

-	Wilcoxon signed-ranks test will be used to determine if there is a difference between paired results in relation to the direction and magnitude of change (Portney &amp; Watkins, 2009). This data analysis approach will enable comparison of pre and post scores within the same participant in relation to the outcomes of interest.

-	Mann-Whitney U test will be used to determine the difference between two independent samples (Portney &amp; Watkins, 2009). This data analysis approach will enable comparison between the LP and WC groups, in relation to the outcomes of interest.

-	The primary analysis will be intention-to-treat, where participants' data will be analysed according to which group the participant was allocated to. 

-	The primary end point for the study is a mean improvement, of at least + 2 points, in both occupational performance and satisfaction in the intention to treat population in the Learned Pacing intervention group. 

-	Data analysis will confirm whether there has been a statistically significant change in outcome scored over two time points: pre intervention and post intervention.
