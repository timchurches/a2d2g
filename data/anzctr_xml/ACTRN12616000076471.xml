  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will include both interventions (habitual multimodal treatment plus kinesio tape) which will commence at the same time.
The whole treatment will be administered by a physiotherapist. It will be perfomed during 15 sessions: once a day, from Monday to Friday, for three weeks. The neuromuscular bandage must be changed every three days. 

A: Habitual multimodal treatment. 65 minutes each session, comprising thermotherapy, TENS and stretching as follows:
a) Thermotherapy:  continuous microwave at 80Hz, on the lumbar area for 15 minutes.
b) TENS for pulsed asymmetrical biphasic rectangular current, pulse rate 2Hz, pulse width 150 micros, intensity of the current between 40 and 100 mA according  to the patient´s  perception.  The current will be applied by means of two channels, putting four adhesive silicone quadrangular electrodes (two on each channel) of 5 cm2 on paravertebral lumbar muscles for 30 minutes.
c) Passive stretchings of paravertebral lumbar muscles, psoas-iliac, square lumbar and pyramidal muscles. Each exercise will be performed from 3 to 5 times per session keeping the stretching position from 10 to 20 seconds. The total time for stretchings will be of 20 minutes.  

B: Kinesio tape
     Use of neuromuscular bandage on the lumbar area using the muscular  technique: three strips of 5 cms  of width (two in vertical position on the paravertebral zone and one across on the point of maximum pain) will be placed in the following  way: 
a) With the patient seated in neutral position, the bases of the neuromuscular bandage in the sacrum are fixed.
b) The patient flexes and rotates the trunk to one side and the strip of the bandage on the paravertebral lumbar muscles to the contrary side of the rotation is also placed. 
c) The same operation is performed in the contralateral side. 
With the patient in neutral position
d) The upright moorings are finally fixed exceeding the lumbar curvature.
e) A strip of bandage in horizontal direction with a certain tension in the vertebra with maximum pain is placed.
f) Finally, the moorings of this last one are fixed but without any tension.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will include only habitual multimodal treatment.
The whole treatment will be administered by a physiotherapist. It will be perfomed during 15 sessions: once a day, from Monday to Friday, for three weeks. 
Each session will last 65 minutes, comprising thermotherapy, TENS and stretching as follows:
a) Thermotherapy:  continuous microwave at 80Hz, on the lumbar area for 15 minutes.
b) TENS for pulsed asymmetrical biphasic  rectangular current,  pulse rate 2Hz, pulse width 150 micros, intensity of the current between  40 and 100 mA according  to the patient´s  perception.  The current will be applied by means of two channels, putting four adhesive silicone quadrangular electrodes (two on each channel) of 5 cm2 on paravertebral lumbar muscles for 30 minutes.
c) Passive stretchings of paravertebral lumbar muscles, psoas-iliac, square lumbar and pyramidal muscles. Each exercise will be performed from 3 to 5 times per session keeping the stretching position from 10 to 20 seconds. The total time for stretchings will be of 20 minutes.  </comparator>

    <concealment>Patients diagnosed with chronic non-specific low back pain who arrive at The Physiotherapy Unit of “Hospital La Merced” in Osuna, will be received by a researcher assistant who will confirm his or her eligibility and will be invited to participate in the research. After the signature of the informed consent and the initial evaluation, a researcher not involved in assessment or treatment of patients, will perform the allocation of subjects to the groups of study at random with stratification by sex, asking to each participant  that according to his/her gender, takes out a ticket from an opaque container. Both containers for men and women will have 40 tickets or ballots with 20 with the text “Group A” for the experimental group and other 20 with the text “Group B” that will be the control group.</concealment>
    <sequence>The subjects will be assigned at random with the stratification of genders. The allocation is hidden by means of opaque containers, one for men and the other for women. The subjects will take out a ticket which indicates the group assigned.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>We have estimated the sample size using GPower 3.1.6 programme, considering as principal variable the pain assessed by the visual analogue scale, including the following information: effect size 0.64 (obtained from a preliminary study); hypothesis at one-tailed; an error probability of 0.05, a power (1-beta) of 0.80, and proportion between the groups 1. The initial sample size was 60 participants. Considering a loss of 20% it reaches 74 subjects (37 in each group). Finally, we decide to include 80 people in case the loss is higher. 
To check the normality of the variables we will use the Shapiro-Wilk test. To determine the differences within each group the test ANOVA of repeated measures completed with Helmert contrasts and simple type, and Friedman ANOVA completed with the Dunn test will be used, taking into account the normality of the variables.To determine differences between both groups we will use the Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test according to the normality of the variables. We will calculate the effect size applying the formula suggested by Grissom.

We will performed intention-to-treat analyses. For all statistical tests, a 95 % confidence intervals will be considerate (P value &lt; 0,05)</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The main objective of this study is to know whether in chronic non-specific low back pain, kinesio taping in addition to habitual multimodal treatment decreases the pain and disability, and increases the range of motion of the lumbar spine, in a greater way than the usual treatment alone.</summary>
