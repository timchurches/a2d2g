    <concealment>Low back pain patients attending the Physiotherapy Clinic, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Malaysia, who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be screened by a Physiotherapist and Orthopedic specialist and will be invited to participate into this study. For those who has one or more than one of the exclusion criteria will be excluded in this study.

Explanatory statement will be given to those eligible participants and written informed consent will be obtained before the commencement of the study. Consenting participants will then be randomly allocated using a simple random sampling method into the 2 groups:

(i)  traditional Malay massage (Group A) or
(ii) control groups (Group B)

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
The sample size is calculated using PS power and sample size calculation software. The standard deviation 46.15 and means 23.42 are taken from the result data of substance P level in saliva samples based on previous study conducted by Mackawan et al. Accordingly, we will need to study 53 subjects to be able to reject the null hypothesis that this response difference is zero with a power of 0.95. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. To account for 20 percent dropout, a total of 64 subjects is required.

Data analysis:
The recorded data will be analyzed using SPSS Version 20.0 and it will be explained further later. Data from participants will be entered into a computerized database and analyzed using the SPSS software version 20.0. Mean, standard deviation, and range will be calculated for each variable. Data will be checked for normal distribution in terms of skewness and kurtosis, normality test, univariate outliers and missing data. Paired t-test will be used to measure the differences of pre- and post-intervention within groups for every outcome measure.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Treatment of low back pain has been very challenging due to the recurrent nature of the problem. It is believed that traditional Malay massage helps in relieving back pain. There is,  however, a lack of scientific evidence to support the practice of traditional Malay massage and the mechanism as to how traditional Malay massage would reduce and exert its effect against back pain. The aim of this study is to investigate the immediate effect of traditional Malay massage on, pain scale, substance P, inflammatory mediators, and functional outcomes among low back pain patients. </summary>
