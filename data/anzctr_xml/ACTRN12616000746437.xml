  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients with treatment refractory C. difficle diarrhoea will be offered capsulised faecal matter transplantation as treatment. The faecal matter will be from an unrelated donor and once capsulised, frozen until required in the clinic. 
Donors are to be healthy volunteers, 18-50 years old, nil previous medical conditions, taking no medications, faeces and blood will be screened for known transmissible pathogens and pass the Australian Red Cross Blood Donor questionaire.
Patients will recieve 15 capsules on 2 consecutive days and be followed up for symptom resolution and adverse events for up to 6 months.
Each inoculum will be prepared from the faeces of a single donor and a full treatment of
30 capsules contain sieved, concentrated material derived from approximately 50g of faecal matter (ie approximately 1.66g per capsule).
Patients will be offered the capsules by the investigators in the clinic and instructed to take them orally. Adherence will be directly observed by the investigator at this time.</interventions>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Resolution of diarrhoea symptoms.
Assessed by:
Questionnaires recording stool frequency and consistency (composite outcome).
Questionnaires have been designed specifically for this study</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety of FMT in clinical practice.
Possible adverse events will be reviewed by use of a modification of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.23
Known or possible adverse effects are:
Common:
Post treatment 
mild abdominal bloating and cramping, diarrhoea, mild dehydration. In most cases this resolves completely within 72 hours.
Rare:
Fatigue, malaise, nausea, headache, foul breath,
Very Rare:
Vomiting and potential for aspiration,  Rash
The long term effect of manipulating the bowel bacteria of a person is not known. Antibiotics do also alter the bowel bacteria and also pose a similar level of unknown risk. Even with careful screening, transmission of infection is possible.</outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>Continuous variables will be tested for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Categorical variables will be compared between patients who achieved resolution of diarrhoea and those in whom the first treatment failed using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test and continuous variables using the Mann-Whitney test. In addition, a logistic regression model with mixed effects will be used to identify factors associated with diarrhoea resolution after 1 treatment while controlling for clustering within donors. Wilcoxon signed rank, Friedman, and McNemar tests will be used to compare variables before and after treatment. A linear mixed model will be used to assess for variables potentially related to the secondary outcomes (bowel movements per day, gastrointestinal health score, and overall health score) while controlling for clustering within donors. Bowel movements per day will be compared with normal using a 1-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. The Fisher exact test will be used to compare rates of successful treatment with our previous study and an exact binomial test to compare with historically reported rates of successful treatment.
The sample size was calculated using the prior published rate of diarrhoea resolution of 30% with standard antimicrobial treatment among patients with more than 3 relapses of CDI. Assuming a rate of clinical resolution of diarrhoea of 90% among study participants, we estimated the target sample size at 19 patients (2-tailed a = .05; 1 - beta = .90).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The majority of reported FMT procedures have been performed with fresh stool suspensions from related donors. This approach has practical barriers that hinder the development of scientifically sound treatment protocols. The use of fresh donations requires prior identification and screening of a suitable donor, thus precluding the use of FMT in acute situations. Furthermore, the limited viability of fresh samples, usually estimated at up to 6 hours, makes thorough screening of donors and donation aliquots impractical. To address these issues Yongster and colleagues have studied the use of a pre-prepared, frozen inoculum from unrelated donors delivered by both endoscopic and capsulized routes, however both of these studies have been pilot studies.
The capsulized form of FMT when compared to FMT delivered by endoscopic means this method may have positive effects on: The timing of the procedure due to reduced logistical issues,  the safety of the procedure (reduced risk of endoscopic/anaesthesia complications) and a reduction of overall cost to the health budget
Strengthening the evidence base and clinical experience behind frozen, oral FMT will be of benefit to patients, staff and health services.
Patients will be offered oral FMT using pre-made frozen capsules with the FM souced from unrelated donors</summary>
