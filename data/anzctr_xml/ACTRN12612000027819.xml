  <interventions>
    <interventions>Physical education delivered by specialist teachers, twice a week for 50 minutes each session, during a period of four primary school years, from grades 3 to 6. The physical education is based on an exploratory approach where children are challenged with movement tasks. The emphasis is on balance and gross motor skills as well as fine motor skills including eye hand coordination. There is also an emphaisis on engaging every child and enjoyment of the movement experience and de-emphasis on individual competition.  The physical educators are specialist teachers from the Bluearth Foundation (www.bluearth.com), all trained teachers, who participate in the activities with the children.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Concealed envelopes with schools names were randomly selected and one by one alternatedly allocated to intervention or school group. 
This occurred indepenently of any school, carried out by the LOOK research director and Data Bank manager.
The school was then notified of the decision. All schools accepted this procedure and their allocation.
The treatment was specialized physical education delivered twice weekly by specialist teachers (university qualified) provided by the Bluearth Foundation, a not for profit provider of physical activity programs in schools www.bluearth.org  Outcomes were assessed by groups of researchers in several disciplines from the Australian National University (Statistics, metabolic physiology, psychology)  and the Canberra Hospital (pathology, pediatrics, cardiology), University of Canberra (pedagogy) and Deakin University (skeletal development).</concealment>
    <sequence>1.Selection of fully government funded schools outside the inner suburbs all situated in separate suburbs
2. Documentation of approval from Ethics committee, Government authority, school principal, parent and child.
3. Acceptance by school principal of participation whether or not allocated to intervention or control
3. Schools were randomly allocated to intervention or control group using school names in sealed envelopes, shuffling thoroughly, opening the envelopes, and alternately allocating each school to intervention and control
4. 830 upils in grade 2 of each school were the participants. This constituted 27% of all grade 2 pupils in the ACT fully government funded school system.</sequence>
