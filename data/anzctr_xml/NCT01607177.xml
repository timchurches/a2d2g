  <interventions>
    <interventions>Behaviour - Daily text message reminders

Experimental: Text message group - Patients randomised to this group will receive daily text message reminders used to motivate them to exercise in the preoperative period. They will also receive an exercise information sheet to complement the text messages.

No Intervention: No text message group - Patients randomised to this group will receive standardised exercise advice but will not receive the text message reminders or the exercise information sheet.


Behaviour: Daily text message reminders
Daily text message reminders to motivate patients to exercise in conjunction with an exercise information sheet.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Preoperative exercise has been shown to improve physiological and functional capacity in
      patients undergoing abdominal surgery to prepare them for the stress of surgery. Patients
      undergoing bariatric surgery are advised to partake in regular preoperative exercise. In the
      setting of bariatric surgery, as well as preparing patients for the stress of surgery, it is
      also thought to increase the likelihood that they will exercise postoperatively. However,
      compliance to this advice is extremely low. Text-message interventions have been shown to
      improve compliance to other lifestyle interventions. The investigators will compare the rate
      of compliance to preoperative exercise prior to bariatric surgery in patients who receive a
      daily text message to those who do not. The investigators will also compare weight loss.</summary>
