  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a drug (tocilizumab) that blocks the interleukin-6 receptor for the treatment of allergen-induced asthma. Individuals with stable, mild to moderate allergic asthma, with a history of episodic wheeze and shortness of breath, will be eligible for enrolment. The study is divided into 2 parts. 
Part 1: Baseline (visit 1-4)
1.	Participants who meet all entry criteria and provide informed consent will then be screened with a history, physical examination, spirometry, and routine laboratory tests. 
2.	Their atopic status will be documented by skin testing against common airborne allergens. 
3.     Their rs4129267 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotype will be determined
4.	If they continue to meet entry criteria, an allergen challenge will be performed to confirm the presence of an early and late phase response. 
5.	Histamine challenge test and sputum differentials will be performed before and after allergen challenges.
6.	To enter into Part 2 of the study, participants must have:
-Documented early and late asthmatic response to inhaled incremental allergen challenge; 
- rs4129267 genotype TT or CT; and 
- Allergic sensitisation to house dust mite

Visit 1 : Baseline screening: Obtain informed consent. Subjects screened with a history, physical examination, spirometry and routine laboratory tests. 
Visits 2 to 4 : Baseline allergen challenge: Perform Histamine challenge, allergen inhalation test and sputum induction to assess eligibility for entry into Part 2

Part 2: Treatment and Follow-up (visit 5-10)
1.	Participants will be randomised to receive the drug tocilizumab 8mg/kg or placebo by a single dose intravenous infusion. 
2.	Spirometry, vital signs, asthma symptomatology, histamine challenge, sputum differentials will be evaluated 6 days after drug/placebo.
3.	24 hours later, an allergen inhalation challenge test is performed, with spirometry measured until 7 hours post-challenge. Sputum will also be induced at 7 hours following the allergen challenge. 
4.	Histamine challenge and sputum induction will be performed again 24 hours after allergen challenge. 
5.	Any AEs and asthma symptoms will be evaluated at each clinic visit.
6.	A physical examination, spirometry and laboratory tests will performed at the termination visit, 28 days after drug/placebo.

Visit 5 : Study drug infusion: Tocilizumab or placebo given as intravenous infusion.
Visits 6 to 8 : Post-treatment allergen challenge: Perform Histamine challenge, allergen inhalation test and sputum induction.
Visit 9 : Follow-Up Visit: Spirometry, vital signs, asthma symptomatology and laboratory tests.
Visit 10 : Termination: Physical examination, spirometry, vital signs and laboratory tests

Participants will be compensated to help retention rates and adherence to the protocol's requirements. </interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1.	The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of Tocilizumab (TCZ) on the Late Asthmatic Response (LAR) triggered by allergen inhalation in asthma patients, compared with placebo. </outcome>
      <timepoint>As such, the primary efficacy outcome measure is the LAR, taken to be the largest fall in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second FEV(1)  between 3 hours and 7 hours after allergen inhalation. An allergen inhalation challenge test will be performed at visits 3 (screening) and 7 (after treatment).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. A primary objective is to evaluate the safety of TCZ in patients with asthma.</outcome>
      <timepoint>As such the primary safety outcomes will be measured by the following safety laboratory tests that will be performed at visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 10 (unless otherwise noted):

-Hematology (all visits)

-Blood biochemistry

-Urinalysis

-Serology (visit 1 only)
</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following secondary outcomes will be measured and compared between drug and placebo:
1.	The Early Asthmatic Response (EAR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement of the largest fall in FEV(1) within 2 hours after allergen inhalation. This outcome will be measured at visits 3 (screening) and 7 (after treatment). </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following secondary outcomes will be measured and compared between drug and placebo:
2.	Allergen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness at 24h post allergen.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Airway hyperresponsiveness is measured  as the histamine dose required to cause a fall in FEV(1)  of 20 percent of the baseline value (PC20). A histamine inhalation challenge test will be performed at visits 2 and 4 (screening) and 6 and 8 (after treatment).</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The following secondary outcomes will be measured and compared between drug and placebo:
3.	Allergen-induced changes in blood and sputum inflammatory cells and mediators at 7 and 24 hours post allergen, between drug and placebo.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Immune/Inflammatory cells and mediators will be measured in blood and sputum samples collected at visits  2 to 4 (screening) and 6 to 8 (after treatment). Exhaled Nitric Oxide levels will also be measured at visits  2 to 4 (screening) and 6 to 8 (after treatment). </timepoint>

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will screen existing clinical records from participants of our Asthma Genetics study to identify potential eligible participants according to inclusion and exclusion criteria for Part 1 of this study. If required to meet sample size requirements, we will also advertise in the general community 

Potential eligible participants will be approached first by email or postal letter to provide information about this trial. Participants interested in taking part in the trial will then be contacted by phone to confirm interest in participating and assess potential eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria An appointment for clinical visit 1 is made for participants that remain potentially eligible to participate. 
Once consent is obtained participants will be screening to determine eligibility. 

If eligible the participant will be randomised to one of 2 blinded arms of the study which will receive active drug or placebo. 
When a participant enters part 2 of the study, the investigator calls the pharmacy to request the investigational drug kit for this participant.
</concealment>
    <sequence>We will use a block randomization method to ensure that equal numbers of subjects are allocated to tocilizumab and placebo. We will first randomise tocilizumab or placebo (50:50) to an investigational drug kit (numbered 1 to 16). Then each participant is randomly allocated a drug kit. This procedure is done independently in four blocks with four participants each. The resulting randomisation table will be held by the Sponsor throughout the duration of the study. Based on the randomisation table, two envelopes will be created for each participant and sent to the pharmacy. Both envelopes contain the same information, namely the participant number, the block number, the kit number and the kit content. Envelope 1 will be labelled with the project name, project number, participant number and with “Pharmacy Randomisation code” and “To be opened by trial pharmacist only to prepare the investigational drug”. Envelope 2 will be labelled with the project name, project number, participant number and with “Emergency unblinding envelope” and “To be opened by investigator only in an emergency situation”. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>We plan to enrol a sufficient number of participants to result in 16 participants  entering part 2 of the study (ie. being administered drug or placebo). With this sample size, and based on the mean (23.5 percent ) and Standard Deviation (3.3 percent) of the maximum percentage fall in FEV1 3 to 7 hours after allergen challenge (LAR) that is expected in the placebo group , this study provides  greater than 80percent power to detect a difference in LAR between placebo and drug of at least 5 percent (eg 23.5 percent vs 18.5 percent) for an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided test). This corresponds to a 21 percent (5percent / 23.5percent) change in the LAR.
Primary analysis

1.	Our primary efficacy outcome is the largest fall in FEV(1) recorded between 3 hours and 7 hours after allergen inhalation (visit 7), ie LAR. The LAR will be compared between the TCZ and placebo groups using a two-sided t-test. Only participants entering part 2 of the trial will be included in the analysis.

2.	Comparison of safety outcomes between TCZ and placebo groups.

Secondary analyses

1.	Comparison of EAR (measured at visit 7) between TCZ and placebo groups: analysis as per the primary outcome above.

2.	Comparison of baseline (visit 6) and allergen-induced (visit 8) airway hyperresponsiveness between TCZ and placebo groups: analyses as per the primary outcome above.

3.	Comparison of baseline (visit 6) and post allergen-challenge (visit 8) levels of immune/inflammatory cells and mediators between TCZ and placebo groups: analyses as per the primary outcome above.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In this study, we will address the following specific research question: can a single-dose of tocilizumab prevent allergen-induced airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction? Tocilizumab will be administered intravenously as a single dose of 8mg/kg seven days before allergen challenge. This combination of dose and route of administration is currently approved in Australia to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis monthly. Lung function will be assessed periodically in the 7h following allergen challenge. Airway inflammation will be measured at 7h and 24h following allergen challenge. Bronchoconstriction and airway inflammation will be compared between the TCZ and placebo groups to determine drug efficacy.</summary>
