  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain on injection as measured by observing the patient's response from the commencement of propofol administration to loss of consciousness by an independant observer unaware of the intervention. 0 response - no grimace or withdrawal; 1= minimal movement or slight grimace; 2= clear grimace and / or moderate movement; 3 = vocalising pain</outcome>
