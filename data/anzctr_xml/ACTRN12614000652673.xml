    <interventions>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides a non-invasive means of altering the excitability of cortical neurons, through the application of a weak electric current applied to the scalp. 

This study employs a randomised, crossover design where participants take part in three separate treatment sessions at least 72 hours apart. Each session involves administration of either active tDCS (either conventional or 'high-definition' tDCS [HD-tDCS]), or sham tDCS. Conventional tDCS involves the use of sponge electrodes placed in a bipolar array (anode over left prefrontal cortex, cathode over contralateral supraorbital area); HD-tDCS uses five smaller electrodes placed over the left prefrontal cortex in a 4x1 ring configuration in which a central anodal electrode is surrounded by four cathodes.      

Specifically, participants will receive:

a) Anodal conventional tDCS (2 mA, 20 minutes)
b) Anodal HD-tDCS (2 mA, 20 minutes)
c) Sham tDCS (20 minutes)</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator treatment is: Sham tDCS (20 minutes). In the sham treatment, tDCS stimulation is ramped-up to 2 mA, held at this intensity for several seconds, then ramped down to 0 mA. This technique generates a tingling sensation on the scalp akin to active tDCS, but does not produce any tangible changes in cortical excitability. </comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is growing scientific evidence of the clinical efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in treating a number of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Although the exact mechanism of action underlying tDCS remains to be fully elucidated, its ability to promote lasting neuroplastic changes within the brain appears central to its therapeutic effects. tDCS involves the application of a very weak electrical current to the scalp, which acts to modulate the excitability of underlying cortical neurons, thereby altering their function. Importantly, tDCS is both safe and painless, and can induce changes in brain function which are measurable up to an hour after the cessation of stimulation. In order for tDCS to be optimally utilised, however, research which directly compares the different stimulation methods available is greatly needed. 

This project specifically aims to compare two methods of administering tDCS to a region of the brain known as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an important area for cognitive processing. The first is a conventional method, which applies the stimulus to the head using two large sponge electrodes, while the second method, which has been more recently developed, is referred to as high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) and uses several smaller electrodes to deliver the stimulation to a more confined region of the brain. It is currently unclear which of these two methods of stimulation is the most efficacious. Therefore, the aim of this study is to directly compare, using both behavioural and neurophysiological outcome measures, the effect that each of these stimulation methods has on brain neuroplasticity.
