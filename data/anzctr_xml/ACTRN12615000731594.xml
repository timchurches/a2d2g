    <interventions>This study was a 6-week exercise intervention programme with assessments undertaken at three time-points: (1) baseline, (2) immediately pre-surgery and (3) 6-week post-surgery follow-up. The 6-week exercise programme commenced 6 weeks prior to the schedule surgery date. Patients undertook an exercise programme that consisted of two supervised clinic sessions per week. Each supervised exercise session took approximately 90 minutes to complete. Sessions commenced with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of moderate level of aerobic exercise (~60% heart rate maximum (HRmax)), as well as stretching exercises of the major muscle groups: chest, shoulder, biceps, triceps, quadriceps, hamstrings and calf muscles. This was followed by a resistance-training regime that included a series of six exercises targeting the major muscles of the upper- and lower-body. Upper-limb exercises included chest press, seated row and lat pull-down. Lower-limb exercises were leg extension, leg curl and leg press. All exercises were performed through the full range of motion adhering to correct techniques. To ensure the progressive nature of the training programme, patients were encouraged to work past the repetition maximum (RM) prescribed, with resistance increased by 5  10% for the subsequent set/training sessions if they were able to exceed the number specified. Specifically, training phases were: week 1  2 (two sets 12 RM), week 3 (three sets of 10 RM), week 4  5 (three sets of 8 RM), week 6 (four sets of 6 RM). Each supervised session also included 15 minutes of exercises focusing on the trunk stabilising muscles. Patients performed three sets of three different exercises with a rest of 30 to 60 seconds between each set. These exercises consisted of planks (anterior abdominals), reverse bridge on Swiss ball (back extensors) and side planks (oblique abdominals) (Lehman, Hoda, &amp; Oliver, 2005). The training load increased progressively by 5  10 seconds every week, starting with 10 seconds for the side planks and 30 seconds for the other trunk stabiliser exercises. Following the completion of the trunk stabiliser exercises, a further 20 minutes of aerobic exercise was undertaken. This included such specific activity as walking or jogging on a treadmill; cycling or rowing on a stationary ergometer; or exercising on a cross training machine depending on each patients preference. The target intensity was 60  80% of the estimated HRmax (220  age in years) measured using heart rate monitors. The design criteria for the exercise intervention programme were to optimise the stimulus to the cardiovascular and neuromuscular systems while maximising compliance and retention. All sessions were conducted with one-on-one supervision by a qualified and accredited exercise physiologist who ensured safety and adherence to correct lifting techniques. Each session concluded with a 5-minute cool-down with stretching activities similar to the warm-up. Patients were provided with a session log in which to record their attendance, exercise weights, repetitions and sets.</interventions>

      <outcome>The primary objective of this feasibility study was to determine the efficacy of a supervised, pre-surgical exercise programme consisting of targeted resistance and aerobic training for men with prostate cancer scheduled to receive prostatectomy. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the effects of a pre-surgical exercise intervention on neuromuscular strength using the one-repetition maximum chest press, leg press, seated row and leg extension exercise protocol. </outcome>

    <designfeatures>This quasi-experimental study was a 6-week exercise intervention programme with assessments undertaken at three time-points: (1) baseline, (2) immediately pre-surgery and (3) 6-week post-surgery follow-up. All assessments were conducted at Edith Cowan University Health and Wellness Institute. A timeline of six weeks was provided by the participating surgical team to conduct an exercise intervention programme as this was the approximate period between prostate cancer diagnosis and surgical intervention. The exercise sessions involved resistance and aerobic training undertaken twice weekly in an exercise setting at three different venues located in the Perth metropolitan area (Fremantle Leisure Centre, Murdoch University Sport and Recreation Centre and Southlake Leisure Centre). Edith Cowan University Human Research Ethics Committee approved the research protocol.</designfeatures>
    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Initially, a sample size calculation was proposed and performed for a randomised controlled study (2-tailed, alpha = 0.05 and power = 80%) based on expected effect size differences in muscle strength reported in previous studies (Galvão &amp; Taaffe, 2005; Galvão et al., 2010). As a result, one standard deviation difference for strength was determined to be clinically meaningful, resulting in the requirement for 16 participants per group (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009; Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007). Previous experience with exercise trials and cancer studies indicate an attrition rate of up to 20% (Fillion et al., 2008). Therefore, to ensure sufficient subject numbers, 20 subjects were proposed to be recruited per group. However, due to slow recruitment rate, a limited period and the time-consuming nature of such a large clinical study, the study was re-designed as a quasi-experimental study. Sixteen patients scheduled to receive prostatectomy volunteered to participate in this study. Thus the statistical power to detect change in the primary study outcomes during the 6-wk intervention ranged from 0.8 to 1.0. 

All statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software program (PASW v 19 for Windows, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL USA). Analyses included standard descriptive statistics, paired students t-tests, correlation (p = 0.01), and ANOVA. Repeated-measures ANOVA was used to compare changes in the variables for the three time-points. An intention-to-treat approach was used for all analyses. We employed a last-observation-carried-forward procedure for any missing data or patients lost to post-surgery follow-up (Jones et al., 2007). Where appropriate, the post-hoc testing with Bonferroni adjustment was employed to locate the source of significant difference. All results were recorded as mean + SD, and the size of change and precision were provided by reporting the change in mean values and the 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The effect size (ES) was calculated for all results: ES = (MeanPost - MeanPre/SDPre) (Cohen, 1988). All statistical tests were two-tailed with an alpha level of p = 0.05 set as the criterion for statistical significance.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective was to determine the benefits of a pre-surgical exercise programme for prostate cancer patients scheduled for prostatectomy. It was hypothesised that: i) between baseline and pre-surgery, patients would demonstrate  higher physical functional performance, maintain higher levels of muscle strength and endurance, ii) during the weeks following surgery, patients would demonstrate  reduced physical functional performance, reduced muscular strength and endurance iii) between baseline and post-surgery, patients would demonstrate  improved recovery with a higher physical functional performance, maintain higher muscular strength and endurance.</summary>
