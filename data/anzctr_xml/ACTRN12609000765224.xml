  <interventions>
    <interventions>AWBAT is a second generation temporary epidermal replacement. It is to be compared with Biobrane (a first generation product with the same indications). Both materials are applied to meticulously cleaned superficial partial thickness burns under general anaesthesia in theatre. The piorcine peptide component in the materials stimulates the conversion of fibrinogen in the burn exudate to fibrin, firmly adhering the material to the burn. Both materials then stay in-situ until the burn re-epithelialises beneath. Both materials then spontaneously separate. The length of material adherence depends on the burn depth - very superficial 4-5 days, mid-dermal up to 14 days. All participants will receive both Biobrane and AWBAT thus acting as their own controls since Biobrane is the material we currently use routinely according to our surgical protocols.</interventions>
    <comparator>Biobrane (like AWBAT) contains fragments of porcine type 1 collagen which convert burn exudate fibrinogen into fibrin. Both materials work identically except the peptide fragments in AWBAT are less sterically obstructed, therefore the conversion (and thus adhesion) are quicker.All participants will receive both Biobrane and AWBAT thus acting as their own controls since Biobrane is the material we currently use routinely according to our surgical protocols.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Biobrane is our gold standard for superficial partial thickness burns. AWBAT is very similar but adheres more rapidly to the wound. This is the rate limiting step in healing and allowing theses patients to be treated as outpatients. The study aims to compare the two in rate of epithelialisation and pain perception (the other issue which keeps burn patients in hospital).</summary>
