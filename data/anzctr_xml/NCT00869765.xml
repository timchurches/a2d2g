Treatment: drugs: D-Cycloserine
100 mg D-cycloserine once every weekday taken 2 hours before tDCS session.

Treatment: devices: tDCS (Eldith DC-Stimulator (CE certified))
tDCS session lasting continuously for 20 minutes at 2 mA. Conductive rubber electrodes (7 x 5 cm, 35 cm2) covered by sponges soaked in saline will be used, held in place by a head band. The current will be gradually increased to the level of 2 mA over 30 seconds (to avoid the sensation of a flash).

          3. Subject either did not reach remission at the end of trial (defined as MADRS score of
             = 10) or suffered an early relapse (within a month of finishing the trial).</inclusivecriteria>

             disorder (lifetime); post-traumatic stress disorder current or within the past year);
             mental retardation.

             to discontinue.

          5. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high suicide
             risk.

          6. Neurological disorder or insult, e.g., recent stroke (CVA), which places subject at
             risk of seizure or neuronal damage with tDCS.

          7. Subject has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp (cuts,
             abrasions, rash) at proposed electrode sites.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Among antidepressant treatments, Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) stands as the most effective
      in treating acute depression. However, patient concerns with the cognitive side effects of
      ECT have encouraged the development of new and more focal forms of brain stimulation such as
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). The investigators' current study of tDCS as a
      treatment for depression suggests that this technique has antidepressant effects and is safe,
      painless and well tolerated. However, not all patients may respond to this treatment and the
      concern of possible relapse in some patients who respond to tDCS has raised interest in
      finding treatments that may enhance and prolong the antidepressant effects of tDCS. This
      study will investigate whether D-Cycloserine, a medication shown to lengthen the effects of
      tDCS on brain activity, can also enhance/prolong the antidepressant effects of tDCS in people
      suffering from depression.</summary>
