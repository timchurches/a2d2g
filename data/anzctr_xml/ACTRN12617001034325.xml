  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be required to report to the Sansom Institute Clinical Trial Facility on two occasions with a one week wash out period between the two visits.
First Visit: Participants will be required to fast overnight and will have an intravenous cannula inserted. 10mL of blood will be collected once an hour for 4 hours by a clinician with previous experience with intravenous cannulas. Saliva samples using the passive drool method will also be collected once an hour for the 4 hours. Participants will remain fasted for the duration of the study. Anthropometric measurements including height, waist circumference, weight and body fat will be collected by a clinician using a stadiometer, tape measure and bioelectrical impedance scale. A diet history questionnaire will be undertaken to record one day of dietary history and participants will be asked to record a 3 day diet diary between the two visits to the trial facility. The dietary history will be collected by an experienced nutritionist. Self-answered questionnaires regarding physical activity, sleep and stress will also be completed. At the completion of the first visit, the participants will be provided with lunch.
Second Visit: Participants will arrive fasted again. They will complete the same blood and saliva testing protocol as the first visit with the intervention of a designated fast food meal (2 sausage and egg English muffins and 2 hash browns) consisting of 81g carbs, 51g fat and 32g protein directly after their first blood and saliva sample. The 3 day diet diary will be checked with researchers for completeness on the second visit. The other two questionnaires (sleep and physical activity) will not be reassessed. 

For both visits, participants will be supervised by a minimum of 2 researchers to adhere to fasting/consumption guidelines. Participants are required to fast from 10pm the night before, to ensure participants adhere to guidelines - reminder correspondence will be sent out to participants the day prior to the clinic.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a two arm crossover study investigating the effects of a high fat, high carbohydrate meal on endotoxin levels and its effect on reproductive hormones in overweight and obese males. 

The study involves male participants aged between 18-50 with a BMI over 25 engaging in two clinical sessions. The first session requires the participant to be completely fasted. Blood endotoxin, testosterone, inflammatory markers and gut permeability markers are tested over a 5 hour period. Saliva testosterone is also measured over the 5 hours. The second session the participant consumes a designated high fat, high carbohydrate meal immediately to determine whether the meal has an effect on endotoxin in circulation and whether this is reflected in changes in reproductive hormone levels and inflammation.</summary>
