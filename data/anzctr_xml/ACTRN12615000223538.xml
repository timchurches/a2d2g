    <interventions>Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows high doses of radiotherapy to be delivered using external beam radiotherapy to a similar dose that is achieved using brachytherapy. The study investigates if stereotactic radiotherapy can be as safe and as effective as brachytherapy without the need for an invasive surgical procedure involved with delivering brachytherapy. The main reason for this study is to try to replicate this technique in Australia using equipment available in all radiotherapy departments.
This study also includes a mechanism for SBRT dose escalation. A minimum of 20 men are to complete treatment without &gt;15% suffering a grade 3 acute toxicity or any episodes of grade 4 acute toxicity at a particular dose level. The individual centre must also accrue &gt;5 patients at the previous dose level prior to exploring dose escalation. Once this is satisfied the SBRT dose is to increase by 1Gy. The initial dose will be 19Gy, therefore the first dose escalation will be to 20Gy. This process can be followed a maximum of three times, to a maximum SBRT dose of 22Gy.
Radiotherapy can cause damage to the lower part of the bowel, known as the rectum, which is right next to the prostate. Two methods are available to try to reduce the risk of any damage to the rectum by moving the rectum a little further away from the prostate. Firstly, a device called Rectafix could be used in this study to do this. It involves inserting a probe the same size as a finger into the back passage and using it to angle the rectum away from the prostate inserted only for the duration of the radiotherapy planning, and only for the duration of the two stereotactic radiotherapy treatments. Secondly, a water based gel called SpaceOAR could also be used in this study to do this. It involves inserting this gel in the space between the prostate and rectum 1-2 weeks before radiotherapy planning. Either of these rectal displacement techniques (Rectafix or SpaceOAR) will be utilised at the doctor's discretion in consultation with the participating patients. The stereotactic radiotherapy dose (given over two treatments one week apart) and the external beam dose (46Gy) is the same irrespective of the rectal separation technique employed.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>This will fall into 5 general categories:
1. Feasibility: The protocol is deemed to be feasible if all of the following criteria are met:
- At least 3 different centres participate.
- Each centre accrues at least 5 patients.
- At least two centres attempt dose escalation.

2. Toxicity: 
- Acute: The incidences of CTCAE acute grade 2 and 3 GI and GU toxicity will be reported separately (ie GI and GU) as a fraction of all patients treated. An incidence of &gt;15% grade 3 GU or GI (excluding erectile dysfunction) toxicity attributable to radiotherapy at any individual dose level would require halting the protocol for further investigation of underlying causes. Similarly, any reports of grade 4 toxicity would require halting the protocol for further investigation of underlying causes. 
- Late: The actuarial rates of CTCAE late grade 2-3 GI and GU toxicity will be calculated and reported at the 3 year mark. Studies using HDRB boost as well as IG-IMRT suggest rates of 5-15% are achievable. The study will be powered to recruit sufficient numbers to be confident that &lt;15% of men will have either a grade 2-3 GI or grade 2-3 GU late GU event. The formula is:

n = (1.96/E)2 p(1-p)

where E is the margin of error. A conservative upper estimate of p here is 0.225 (the probability of an event). E might be 0.05 since that at worst gives a 95% CI as 0.15+/-0.05. With these figures n = 268.

3. Patient Tolerance: Summary figures will be produced from the questionnaire.

4. Cancer Control: Main endpoint is bNED calculated by the Phoenix definition of nadir+2. To be reported as survival curves both for the population overall at the 3 year mark, but also individually for intermediate and high risk patients.

5. Prostate motion: A software called SeedTracker is used to track prostate motion (only used if software is available at site). The incidence of couch shifts will be reported, as will the magnitude of all mismatches, and if imaging is performed during treatment, the magnitude and direction of intrafraction motion will be reported. If cine-MRI is performed, the movement in anterior-posterior and superior-inferior planes at the time of simulation can be compared with movements occurring during treatment.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of an advanced technique of external beam radiotherapy, termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), in men with prostate cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are a male aged 18 years or above who has a confirmed diagnosis of intermediate or high risk prostate cancer. Study details Studies have shown that escalated doses of radiotherapy increase cure rates for prostate cancer. Higher doses are achievable with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, and data suggests outcomes are superior. However, HDR brachytherapy is invasive, expensive and requires access to operating theatres and specialised equipment. In this study we aim to investigate whether an advanced technique of external beam radiotherapy, termed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), is able to emulate the doses and outcomes of HDR brachytherapy while being a noninvasive technique that employs commonly available radiotherapy equipment. All participants in this study will receive SBRT and be monitored for up to three years. in order to evaluate treatment toxicity, feasibility and efficacy.</summary>
