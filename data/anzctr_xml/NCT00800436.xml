  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This two-part study is designed to select the subcutaneous (SC) dose of Herceptin that
      results in comparable exposure to intravenous (IV) Herceptin in healthy male participants and
      in HER2-positive female participants. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability
      of the SC and IV formulations. In Part 1 of the study, four cohorts will be treated with a
      single dose of Herceptin as follows: Cohort 1 (6 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg] IV in
      healthy male participants); Cohort 2 (6 mg/kg IV in HER2-positive female participants);
      Cohort 3 (6 mg/kg SC in healthy male participants); Cohort 4 (10 mg/kg SC in healthy male
      participants). An additional cohort of healthy volunteers (Cohort 5) will be opened if both
      SC dose levels from Cohorts 3 and 4 result in Herceptin exposures different from the target
      concentration produced by a single IV dose, or if the variability in pharmacokinetic (PK)
      parameter values cannot be used to define the target SC dose level. In Part 2 of the study,
      HER2-positive female participants will receive a single dose of SC Herceptin at the dose
      level defined in Part 1. Participants from Part 1 are eligible to enter Part 2 provided they
      receive the second (Part 2) study dose of Herceptin a minimum of 22 days after their first
      (Part 1) dose.</summary>
