  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to the intervention group will be asked to work through a self-help booklet called Changing Perfectionism (Egan, Shafran, &amp; Wade, 2012) over a four week period. This booklet was developed using a cognitive behavior therapy framework and is designed to help participants understand what perfectionism is, how it is maintained and to teach strategies to overcome or manage their perfectionism. 
Participants will be asked to complete this booklet during their third trimester and will be provided to women after 28 weeks gestation. The booklet is estimated to take 4 hours to complete over the four week period. Women are expected to complete one hour per week and the researchers will telephone the participants weekly to monitor their progress. </interventions>

    <concealment>Participants will be recruited either through their private obstetrician practice or through their hospital antenatal class. In each case they will be given a brief explanation of the study and if they are interested in participating they will be given an information sheet and contact details of the researchers. Participants who contact the researchers expressing interest in taking part will be given a unique de-identified code and asked to complete a 20 minute online survey. The participants responses will be reviewed and those women whose responses indicate high levels of perfectionism will be invited to participate in the study. Allocation is not concealed from the researchers.</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>A total sample of 80 participants, 40 per group, is needed to demonstrate moderate to large interaction effects with 80% power and an alpha of 5% and large interaction effects with an Bonferroni adjusted alpha of 1% using Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) using an effect size of 0.8. Analysis will involve simple independent samples t-tests to compare demographics for each group and a mixed effects regression model using GLMM to compare the interaction effects between group and time.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the potential impact of a perfectionism self-help intervention on maternal mental health outcomes. In particular, the potential benefits of a brief self-help intervention for new mothers with high levels of perfectionism. The study is designed to investigate if mothers who make use of a perfectionism self-help booklet during their third trimester score differently than waitlist controls on measures of perfectionism, rumination and symptoms of anxiety and depression. It is hypothesized that perfectionism and rumination will be positively correlated with postnatal depression and anxiety, and that rumination will mediate the relationship between perfectionism and symptoms of postnatal depression and anxiety. It is also hypothesized that scores on measures of perfectionism, rumination, and symptoms of anxiety and postnatal depression will change significantly more from pre to post intervention for new mothers in the self-help group than for the waitlist control group, and this will be maintained at 3 month follow-up.</summary>
