  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a prospective study focussing on patients that are undergoing routine investigative cystoscopies for monitoring of recurrent urinary tract TCC. A routine urine sample taken for local cytology and / or urinalysis at the clinic immediately prior to an investigative cystoscopy for the monitoring of recurrent bladder cancer. An aliquot of this sample is taken for the purposes of this study. Sample is aliquotted and preserved in stabilisation liquids and sent to lab for analysis. Aliquots will be used for urine cytology, NMP22 ELISA, NMP22 BladderChek and uRNA-2. Patient medical information is obtained. No deviation from standard care is undertaken. Patients may be asked for additional samples if they present for further scheduled cystoscopies within the duration of the study. No additional visits to clinic will be required as a result of participation in the study. Study participation will be at a maximum of 6 months. Study completion will be after the recruitment of 100 patients at a minimum, data collection cleaning and analysis. It is anticipated that the data output will occur before September 2012.</interventions>
    <comparator>The single sample of urine is aliquotted into multiple tubes appropriate to the downstream test. Firstly a dipstick test is used to measure specific gravity, presence of white and red blood cells, and infection. 10 mls of urine is added to a NMP22 ELISA stabilization liquid. NMP22 ELISA is an FDA approved IVD which detects the tumour marker Nuclear Matrix Protein 22, present at high levels in the urine of tumor patients. NMP22 BladderChek detects the same marker but is a point of care test requiring 4 drops of urine. This test is performed at the clinical site but results are not used in clinical work up. Urine Cytology is performed as per established protocols; Briefly, ethanol fixed samples are centrifuged to trap cells present in the sample on a membrane. The membrane is transferred to a glass slide and cells are stained prior to examination under a microscope.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine the performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, area under the ROC curve, positive and negative predictive values) of the uRNA-2 test for the detection of recurrent TCC in patients with a recent history of  urinary tract TCC who have been treated according to standard practice and are undergoing routine investigative cystoscopy. 
The gold standard of comparison for recurrence detection is cystoscopy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Output of the study will be at the completion of patient recruitment and data cleaning and analysis. 100 patients are required for this study. Recruitment rates are variable but the recruitment window is estimated to terminate in March 2012.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to evaluate the performance of the uRNA-2 test and to compare uRNA-2 with urine cytology and the NMP22 ELISA kit in the investigation of patients with a history of urinary tract TCC who are undergoing monitoring for recurrence of the disease in New Zealand. Urine samples will be taken from patients as part of standard care prior to cystoscopy. An aliquot of this sample will be used for the tests under evaluation in this study. No deviation from patients care will be undertaken as a result of participation in this study. No study results will be communicated to clinicians or patients.
This is a pilot study to determine the utility of this test on a monitoring for recurrence population. Prevalence  and performance data from this study will be used to adjust the sample size and comparator evaluation of study ACTRN12612000042842.</summary>
