    <interventions>Daily exit site application of gamma-irradiated, commercially available, pooled antibacterial honeys including Leptospermum sp honey (Medihoney Antibacterial Wound Gel, Medihoney Pty Ltd, Australia; approximately 10 mg) following exit site cleaning and drying as per standard local practice for the duration of the study.  Trial participants will be treated and followed up for 12 months from the entry of the last patient in the study.  Recruitment is expected to take 2 years and median trial treatment and follow up is expected to be 18 months.</interventions>
    <comparator>All control group patients will undertake daily exit site cleaning as per standard local practice for the duration of the study.  Identified nasal carriers of Staphylococcus aureus will undergo intra-nasal application of 2% mupirocin ointment (GlaxoSmithKline, Australia) bd for 5 consecutive days each month for the duration of the trial (in accordance with the Caring for Australians with Renal Impairment (CARI) Guideline recommendations). Members of the control group who do not have nasal staphylococcal colonization will not receive mupirocin.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The largest problem faced by peritoneal dialysis patients is infection of their dialysis catheter, which can occur at the point of entry of the catheter into the belly (exit site infection), along the catheter tunnel (tunnel infection) or inside the belly (peritonitis). Such infections are the commonest cause of death or failure of treatment in peritoneal dialysis patients at Princess Alexandra Hospital. Recent studies have suggested that honey may be a promising agent for preventing catheter-associated infections. Honey has natural antibacterial and antifungal actions and has been shown to be very effective in preventing infection when applied to a variety of wounds, including burns, ulcers and surgical wounds. A previous controlled trial by our group in haemodialysis patients showed that honey was as effective as, and less likely to select resistant germs than, standard antibiotic ointment (mupirocin). The purpose of the present proposed study is to determine if exit site application of standardised antibacterial honey (Medihoney Wound Gel) is more effective at preventing infection of peritoneal dialysis catheters than the standard antibiotic ointment, mupirocin, which is currently recommended by national guidelines.</summary>
