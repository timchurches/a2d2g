    <studytitle>Teeth Tales: An exploratory trial implementing a community based child oral health promotion intervention for Australian families from refugee and migrant backgrounds</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>A longitudinal community-based exploratory trial implementing an intervention for migrant and refugee background families with children (aged 1-4years); to improve community oral health knowledge and practices and the cultural appropriateness and accessibility of services, compared to matched comparison groups. Measurements include child oral health outcomes, parental knowledge, attitudes and behaviours and staff reported organisational cultural competency, as well as trial costs and processes.</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>The community program will consist of informal group sessions led by the peer educator to discuss the key oral health themes of eat well, drink well, clean well, as well as access to and use of local oral health services. Additionally the program will act to promote and provide links to local community groups and services. The participants will be able to discuss the relationship between traditional and cultural practices with the key oral health themes. They will be given an opportunity to apply and practice the learnings. The sessions will run for approximately two hours a week for three weeks and will be held at culturally appropriate sites. All participants will be given a family oral health resource pack that will consist of information resources addressing the key oral health messages, details about local services, toothpaste and toothbrushes for the family, and topic relevant stickers and colouring sheets for the children. The final week will consist of a group visit to the local community health service to provide participants with an introduction to the dental and family support services available at the local community health service and through local government. Some changes to the duration and timing of sessions may be made to accommodate the availability and learning styles of the participants. The program will also include follow up reinforcement of key oral health messages. In addition, relevant local community health and government services will be supported through a review of organisational cultural competency and development and implementation of action plans to address any identified areas requiring improvement.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This exploratory trial of an intervention aims to develop a community based model for improving child oral health by increasing the cultural appropriateness and accessibility of existing oral health services and family programs. A peer-led oral health education program conducted in cultural settings and followed by a group dental clinic visit will be an essential component of the intervention. A cultural competence review of community dental and family programs, and maternal and child health services will also be conducted to enhance the accessibility of these services. This study will be of direct benefit to the community and will inform development and testing of a community based oral health promotion model for other culturally diverse areas of Australia</summary>
