  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CTX-4430 capsules taken
      orally once daily in normal healthy volunteers. CTX-4430 is being developed to treat lung
      inflammation that occurs in cystic fibrosis (CF). This study includes two-parts: Part 1
      assesses single dosing; and Part 2 assesses repeat dosing for 14 days. Each part will include
      several dosages. During the single-dose part of the study, following a 14-day washout period,
      two cohorts will be assessed for potential effects on tolerability when fed at the time of
      dosing. For both parts of the study, blood samples will be collected for PK assay validation.</summary>
