  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention group will be instructed to perform the 11+  as a warm up for 20 minutes before the training sessions and for 10 minutes warm down after the training sessions 3 times per week, during one season (6 months)
FIFA 11 + program manuals and videos: available to anyone through the 11+ website (http://f-marc.com/11plus/ ). 

The FIFA 11+ program, including a total of 15 exercises. It incorporates three main components of exercise regime that include an initial running and active stretching session, followed by a core and leg strength exercise session after which a high speed planting and cutting exercise session is performed.  These exercises mainly focus on strengthening the core and leg muscles to improve static, dynamic and reactive neuromuscular control, coordination, balance and agility.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background The effects of FIFA 11+ warm-up program for soccer injuries prevention have been evaluated in several studies. However, the importance of a warm down using the FIFA 11+ protocol additional to the warm up has not been investigated and yet may be important. Participating in the 11+ in the fatigued state may challenge the athlete and translate directly into real game-like conditions. 
Objective The main objective of the study is to test whether the intensive FIFA 11+ warm-up combined with warm down program has an additional effect on the incidence, severity of injuries and adherence, compared to the FIFA 11+ warm up alone, among amateur soccer players. . 
The 11+ before and after the training sessions is hypothesized to reduce the incidence of injury among male amateur soccer players. The prevention of such injuries will be beneficial to soccer players, clubs, football associations, health insurance companies and society.
Study design Cluster-randomized controlled trial 
Methods Male amateur soccer players, aged 1830 years, will be allocated to interventions or control group. Both groups will perform FIFA 11+ 15 exercises for 20 minutes as a warming up with regular soccer training. The intervention group will additionally perform FIFA 11+ 13 exercises for 10 minutes as a warm-down with every training session. Primary outcome measures are the incidence of initial and recurrent injury and injury severity. A secondary outcome measure is the rate of compliance.
