  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will attend a hospital gym for a structured and supervised high intensity interval exercise program over three sessions per week for 4 weeks pre-operatively. Each participant will have a prescibed exercise program by a physiotherapist. 

Each supervised session will comprise of at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise in the form of a walking program, and a cycling program on an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer. The walking program will be prescribed at a walking speed equal to 80% of the average speed achieved during the 6MWT. The cycling program will be prescribed at = 60% of peak power achieved during the CPET. Progression of the intensity and duration of the programs aerobic components, both supervised and unsupervised, will be titrated to a dyspnoea score of 4-6 (Borg scale) or a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 14-16 depending on the symptom of exercise limitation</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in mean anaerobic threshold as determined by;
- Proportion of participants achieving an increase of at least 1.8mL/kg/min as determined by serial cardiopulmonary exercise testing prior and following participation in exercise program.

CPET testing will be performed on a calibrated electronically-braked cycle ergometer. The rate at which power will increase each minute will be individualised, with the aim of achieving a test duration of between 8 and 12 minutes. Breath-by-breath expired gas analysis will be undertaken using a Medisoft Exp'air metabolic cart. Peak exercise capacity will be defined as the rate of oxygen consumption averaged over the final 20 second epoch of the CPET. Lactate threshold will be determined using the combined method</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The study aims to compare high intensity exercise to standard pre-operative preparation to improve cardiovascular fitness in major upper gastrointestinal cancer patients. 

Who is it for?
You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged 18 years or above and are scheduled to undergo major upper gastrointestinal cancer surgery at John Hunter Hospital or Newcastle Private Hospital. 

Study details
Participants in this study will be randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. Participants in one group will receive standard pre-operative care, which consists of advice to improve fitness but no supervised or structured program. Participants in the other group will undertake prescribed, structured and supervised high intensity interval exercise over three sessions per week whilst on the wait list for major cancer surgery (approximately 30 days). This exercise will be primarily on a stationary bicycle with some walking sessions and tests for grip strength and walking distance within 6 minutes.

All participants will undergo cardiovascular exercise testing upon enrolment and the week prior to surgery in order to assess any changes in fitness. A blood test will also be taken at the start and completion of the program, and a CT Scan used at the point of diagnosis and then 3 months following completion of the study. Participants will be followed for 90 days post-operatively in order to review any surgical complications, length of time in hospital, and other clinical outcomes. If the pre-operative fitness intervention is successful in this cancer population, and improved fitness relates to better outcomes, then borderline operative candidates may be able to undergo a similar program with a view to extending the option of curative surgery to a larger patient population.
