    <concealment>After recruitment, subjects will be assigned a unique identifying number. Randomisation with this identifying number will be performed by the Pharmacy Department at Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide.
Each subject will receive a single dose of folic acid (0.8mg, 2mg or 5mg) or placebo every month. Both folic acid and placebo will be prepared in identical liquid preparation and delivered from an amber coloured bottle.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be using a computerised sequence generator that creates random balanced permutations of treatments for subjects who are to receive all of the treatments in a random order.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Children with type 1 diabetes have detectable arterial endothelial dysfunction and arterial intima-media thickening as first markers of accelerated atherosclerosis. They can be reliably measured to test the effectiveness of early intervention strategies. Folic acid supplementation significantly reduces the risk of stroke in adults, with most benefit in primary prevention. We have demonstrated that folic acid supplementation 5 mg daily rapidly normalizes endothelial function in children with type 1 diabetes, independent of homocysteine lowering. However there are no dose response studies of the benefit of folic acid to determine the minimum effective dose. This is relevant as while high dose folic acid does not have short term adverse effects, recent epidemiological data questions its long term safety in individuals with established vascular or early neoplastic disease. Determining the minimum dose of folic acid that improves endothelial function and the effect of endothelial nitric oxide synthase polymorphisms on the response to folic acid, will also inform future intervention trials for accelerated atherosclerosis in this age group.</summary>
