    <interventions>Treatment: devices - INFUSE Bone Graft (BMP-2)
Treatment: surgery - Control Group

Active Comparator: INFUSE Bone Graft (BMP-2) - Children with NF1 and tibial pseudarthrosis who require surgery will have the INFUSE bone graft added to their surgical protocol. After a standard surgical approach of resection of abnormal pseudarthrotic tissue, placement of a rigid intramedullary rod (of the surgeon's choice) and placement of autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest; in addition, the INFUSE bone graft in the form of a collagen sponge will be wrapped around the tibia during the surgical process.

Placebo Comparator: Control Group - Children with NF1 and tibial pseudarthrosis who require surgery will receive the standard surgical protocol only. This includes resection of abnormal pseudarthrotic tissue, placement of a rigid intramedullary rod (of the surgeon's choice) and placement of autogenous bone graft from the iliac crest.


Treatment: devices: INFUSE Bone Graft (BMP-2)
The INFUSE bone graft, containing BMP-2 on a collagen sponge, will be wrapped around the tibia during the surgical process.

Treatment: surgery: Control Group
The control group will receive the standard surgical protocol, without addition of the INFUSE device.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The current study proposes adding BMP-2 (INFUSE), an anabolic agent, at the surgical site of
      TPA repair in children with NF1, compared to a control group of patients treated surgically
      without BMP-2. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: 1) to determine if use of an
      osteogenic agent (BMP-2) at the time of surgical repair of TPA in NF1 patients will result in
      improved bone healing; 2) to document safety of BMP-2 in a pediatric NF1 population; and 3)
      to collect, process, and preserve biologic specimens at the time of surgery for future
      studies.</summary>
