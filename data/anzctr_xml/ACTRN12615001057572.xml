  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a first human pilot study for the intervention of soluble dietary fibre from seaweed. Participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to a 4g, 2g or placebo control group for soluble extract from seaweed. This is to be ingested daily for 6 weeks and blood, urine and faeces samples will be tested before and after the intervention.
Participants are provided a magnetic fridge tick list to record daily adherence and will return supplement containers that had been stocked with recorded random numbers of capsules prior to intervention.</interventions>
    <comparator>The comparator is a lack of complex soluble dietary fibres in a normal western diet. The Placebo comparator used is milled white rice flour. White rice being very low in both soluble and insoluble dietary fibres (Prosky, L., N. G. Asp, T. F. Schweizer, J. W. DeVries and I. Furda (1988).

    <purpose>Prevention</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Subjects are recruited with a personal identifier following an invitation brochure and/or seminar about the study.
The three blinded treatments are allocated a code A, B or C in 3 boxes.
Numers 1-60 are randomised using a statistical randomisation software as advised by the University School of Mathematics.
The random numbers are allocated to treatments A, B and C and labelled on jars as 1-60, by an independent University Researcher.
The Excel spreadsheet with the treatment key is printed and locked in 3 independent files at the University of Wollongong.
The jars are sorted in numerical order and provided to the participants as they sign up to the project.
An additional 20 subjects taking seaweed food products will not be blinded bringing the total number of participants to 80.</concealment>
    <sequence>This project uses a simple randomisation to generate a sequence of numbers 1-60 which will be allocated to three treatments. The software used is http://www.randomization.com/
There are no blocks or strata in this Phase I trial.
An additional 20 participants will be recruited but not blinded and will consume whole seaweed food products as a comparison to the extract.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>We are undertaking one of the first seaweed dietary fibre and food ingredient studies on people with gut health concerns. The onset of chronic health disorders such as Type II Diabetes Mellitus are potentially related to reduced gut health. If seaweed dietary fibres can help improve the gut condition then it may be one option for preventing diabetic and other growing health concerns related to the gut.	
Previous research in other laboratory studies and in animal trials with seaweed dietary fibres, have shown significant reductions in inflammation, glucose &amp; insulin stress, as well as positive shifts in gut flora composition. Despite the well-established evidence for the safety of consumption of the identified seaweeds and their dietary fibre extracts, very few studies have investigated the health outcomes in human trials. We will test if an Australian species seaweed, dietary-fibre extract and food ingredient can help the gut health condition, as well as assess changes to blood health indices and quality of life.
