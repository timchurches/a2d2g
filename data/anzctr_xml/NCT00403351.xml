  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Estimating the risk of future cardiovascular events such as death, stroke and myocardial
      infarction using traditional risk factors (such as age, gender, smoking, diabetes,
      hyperlipidaemia and hypertension) is well accepted in patients with and without existing
      cardiovascular disease. These estimates are based on a number of robust observational
      studies, including the original Framingham study. While these methods apply reasonably well
      on a population level their application to the individual patients is not always
      straightforward. In addition, risk charts, such as those published by the Joint British
      Societies and American Heart Association, may underestimate risk in certain groups, notably
      diabetics and patients of Indo-Asian background, whilst overestimating risk in others (by as
      much as 50% in some studies).</summary>
