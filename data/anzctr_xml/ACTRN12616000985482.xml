  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in this study will have intra-arterial catheters (IAL) used in adult intensive care departments. Consenting patients will have their IAL dressed and secured with one of the following randomly assigned options:

Arm 1 (Control): Simple polyurethane dressing (SP).

Arm 2: Securement device; simple polyurethane dressing and a chlorhexidine impregnated (CHG) disc.

Arm 3: Integrated securement device. Integrated securement devices (ISDs) are simple polyurethane dressings which combine both dressing and securement properties into one product.

Arm 4: Integrated securement device and a chlorhexidine impregnated disc. 

Patients will be monitored daily to ensure protocol adherence. The randomly allocated dressing will be applied from device insertion and changed as clinically indicated until  removal of device. </interventions>
    <comparator>Control group patients will have their arterial catheter secured with a simple polyurethane dressing (as per standard care) at the time of catheter insertion until device removal. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary aim of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of a randomised trial that compares the effectiveness of new generation securement and dressing products for intra-arterial catheters. Feasibility measures will include: patient eligibility (more than 80% of those screened); consent (more than 80% agree to enrol); protocol adherence (more than 90% receive the allocated intervention); and retention (less than 5% of enrolled patients lost to follow up). </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of trial completion.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Securement Hypothesis: All cause IAL failure

A composite of infection (laboratory confirmed local or bloodstream infection), occlusion, dislodgement (complete or partial), phlebitis, or thrombosis. This composite measure incorporates the multifocal path to the same endpoint; IAL failure. These will be assessed by either the Research Nurse (during daily checks); recorded on a 1 page data collection sheet at the patient's bedside by the treating clinician; or identified in a review of the patient's medical record.</outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of IAL removal. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dressing Hypothesis: Catheter-associated bloodstream infection, as defined by CDC NHSN criteria. 

This will be confirmed by a blinded infectious diseases specialist using de-identified clinical and microbiological data. </outcome>
      <timepoint>At the time of IAL removal.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Infection (laboratory confirmed local or bloodstream infection): PVC skin and tip samples for culture may be collected by RNs upon PVC removal if clinical suspicion of local infection.

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Dislodgement (partial or complete)
Partial - Change in IAL length at insertion site (inner catheter visible). This will be assessed by either the Research Nurse (during daily checks), or (if identified by the treating clinician) recorded on a 1 page data collection sheet at the patient's bedside or in the patient's medical record.

      <timepoint>Daily from IAL insertion until the time of IAL removal. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Phlebitis: Defined as 2 or more of pain, redness, swelling and a palpable cord.

    <concealment>Research nurses (RNs) will screen patients daily and liaise heavily with the staff responsible for inserting the majority of IALs (anaesthetists, intensive care nurses). All eligible patients (or their representative) will be approached for written informed consent by the RN or inserter. If this is given, the staff member will log in to a centralised web-based randomisation service customised for the trial and be advised of group allocation. Computer generated allocation is provided by an independent randomisation service. Allocation is fully concealed until the patient is randomised.</concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>All randomised patients will be analysed on an Intention to Treat (ITT) basis. The patient is the unit of measurement with one IAL per patient being analysed. For this pilot trial, we will test the feasibility of the statistical analysis that will be used in the definitive trial. Comparability of groups at baseline will be assessed using clinical parameters. Relative incidence rates of device failure per 100 devices and per 1,000 device days with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will summarise the impact of each dressing regimen, and to test difference between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log rank test) will compare device failure over time. Secondary endpoints including dwell-time, dislodgement, infection and safety will be compared between groups using parametric or nonparametric techniques as appropriate. In addition to group, multivariate regression (Cox) models will test the effect of patient and device variables associated with device failure e.g. insertion site, dwell time, length of stay, diagnostic group, age, sex, mobility, co-morbidities and IV medications. Data will be exported into PASW 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Prior to analysis, data cleaning of outlying figures, missing, and implausible data will be undertaken, and a random 5% sample of source data re-entered and checked. All attempts will be made to collect the primary endpoint. Missing data will be modelled for best- and worst-case outcomes to assess for effect on overall results. A per-protocol analysis will assess the effect of protocol violations. P values of &lt;0.05 will be considered significant. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary aim of this study is to pilot test the feasibility of a randomised trial that compares the effectiveness of new generation securement and dressing products for intra-arterial catheters (IAL). The RCT aims to (i) identify clinical, cost-effective methods to prevent catheter failure due to infection, phlebitis, occlusion, and dislodgement; (ii) compare usual care dressings with a novel method; (iii) evaluate the acceptability of these devices to patients and health professionals; and (iv) study adverse effect profiles.

You may be eligible to participate in this trial if you are an intensive care patient over the age of 16 and are having an intra-arterial catheter inserted as part of your therapy (which is expected to remain in place for at least 24 hours).

All participants enrolled in this trial will be randomly allocated (by chance) to receive one of four IAL dressing/securement options. These will be either (i) the standard simple polyurethane dressing; (ii) the standard simple polyurethane dressing and a chlorhexidine impregnated disc; (iii) an integrated securement device and simple polyurethane dressing combined into a single device; (iv) or an integrated securement device and chlorhexidine impregnated disc.

The allocated dressing will be applied from device insertion until the time of device removal. Participants will be asked to rate the acceptability of the device and dressing, and the device will be observed closely to examine side effects, device failures and infections. It is hoped that the findings of this trial will provide information on which IAL securements and dressings are most effective in preventing IAL failure.</summary>
