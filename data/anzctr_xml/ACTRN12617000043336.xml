    <interventions>Aims
This study aims to build the evidence base for an effective public education campaign which raises community awareness of suicide and encourages help-seeking behaviour among vulnerable young people, without running the risk of causing distress or other forms of harm.

Research questions
This study aims to address two research questions
1)	Do certain media messages have positive effects (e.g., improving knowledge about risk factors and warning signs, encouraging help-seeking)

2)	Do certain media messages have negative effects (e.g., perpetuating myths about suicide, triggering suicidal thoughts
This study takes the form of a four-arm randomised controlled trial (three active suicide prevention intervention Community Service Announcements (CSAs) and one control group- an emergency contraception CSA) with three measurement occasions (pre-viewing, post-viewing, four -week follow-up).  We will recruit 240 young people (aged 18-24). Recruitment will occur via a range of approaches including advertisements on noticeboards and websites.  The young people who agree to participate will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions  viewing one of the three CSAs on suicide prevention or viewing the control emergency contraception CSA. 

Each CSA was 30 seconds long and featured the same young people but had a different message. CSA 1: featured young people doing things to improve their mood and suicidal thinking. The main message was find what works for you. CSA2: featured young people discussing the importance of talking and concludes "talk to someone".CSA3 fetures young people overcoming suicidal thoughts and concludes that life gets better". The control CSA is about emergency contraception and lets young people know that the can access it at a pharmacy.

All viewing of CSAs was conducted undersupervsion and participant had to mark that the they viewed the CSA before the Time 2 survey was made available to them to complete. 
CSA viewing

 Each participant will view his or her allocated CSA on an individual ipad or laptop with headphones in a quiet room at their own health service.

Data collection
Data collection will occur at three time points (T1 pre-viewing, T2 immediately post-viewing &amp;T3 1 month post viewing).

Randomisation
Upon consenting to participate in the study, participants are randomised at the individual level using computer generated randomisation. This gives each potential participant an equal chance of being assigned to watch each of the four CSAs.  At the time of randomization researcher are unaware of which CSA participants will be randomly assigned to watch.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in attitudes towards suicide as measured by	The Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Suicide (ATTS)(Renberg &amp; Jacobsson, 2003): The 34-item ATTS asks respondents to indicate their level agreement with 34 suicide-related statements on a 5-point Likert scale from agree completely to agree not at all. The ATTS will be used to gauge participants beliefs and attitudes about suicide. Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior 33(1), 52-57.

      <outcome> A change in intentions to seek help as measured by an adapted version of the General Help Seeking Questionnaire (GHSQ) (Wilson et al. 2005. Measuring help seeking intentions: Properties of the General Help Seeking Questionnaire. Canadian Journal of Counselling, Vol. 39(1), 15-28.).

This questionnaire asks: If you were having a personal or emotional problem, how likely is it that you would seek help from the following people or services? eleven responses are provided: intimate partner, friend, parent, other family member, mental health professional, phone helpline, doctor, minister or religious leader, I would not seek help from anyone, I would seek help from another not listed above. Respondents rate the likelihood on a seven-point scale. We modified this scale by providing an additional three responses: online health chat rooms, online searches for health information, and social media. We also repeated the questionnaire twice asking the same question regarding recommending help for a male or female friend. The primary outcome is the questionnaire related to intentions to seek help for self.

The ASIQ is a 25 item scale that is designed to evaluate the presence and frequency of suicidal thoughts in an individual during the past month. It was chosen both for its potential to be used as an outcome measure and as a screener for the study.

    <statisticalmethods>Data will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using standard techniques for longitudinal data analysis. To answer the research question about the positive and negative effects of certain media messages, we will analyse changes in each outcome measure by treatment group and time. 

Changes in attitudes towards suicide (as measured by the ATTS) will be used as the primary outcome measure. A linear regression analyses using scores on the ATTS as the primary outcome of interest with the key predictor being the treatment group participants were randomised to. The analysis will also include a range of socio-demographic, clinical and treatment variables as covariates.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to build the evidence base for an effective public education campaign for young people. It  involves the development and testing of content which will culminate in the production of four Community Service Announcements (CSAs) with different key messages, designed for television or cinema. 240  young people will be recruited from the general population and headspace, and randomly allocated to view one of the 3 suicide prevention intervention CSAs or a control CSA on accessing emergency contraception.
Participants will answer questions pre-viewing, post-viewing and four weeks later to permit an examination of several positive and negative outcomes. In addition to understanding the impact of three suicide CSAs this project provides a unique opportunity
to collect information about how well a CSA about emergency contraception may work at improving knowledge among young adults.</summary>
