  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 12 - The International Prostate Symptom Score is a disease-specific outcome measure based on the American Urological Association Symptom Index. The questionnaire consists of seven items. The patient evaluates their urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, hesitancy, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) during the previous 4 weeks. The total symptom score can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (most severe symptoms). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) at Week 72 - The International Prostate Symptom Score is a disease-specific outcome measure based on the American Urological Association Symptom Index. The questionnaire consists of seven items. The patient evaluates their urinary symptoms (incomplete emptying, frequency, hesitancy, urgency, weak stream, straining, and nocturia) during the previous 4 weeks. The total symptom score can range from 0 (no symptoms) to 35 (most severe symptoms). A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Peak Urine Flow Rate - Urinary flow was determined by uroflowmetry at baseline and various time-points during the study. An increase from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 12, Week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Total Prostate Volume - Measurement of the prostate volume was performed via transrectal ultrasound at baseline and various time-points during the study. The prostate gland was scanned and the volume was calculated using the formula: Volume (mL) = length × width × height × 0.523. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 12, Week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Transitional Zone Prostate Volume - Measurement of the transitional zone prostate volume was performed via transrectal ultrasound at baseline and various time-points during the study. The prostate gland was scanned and the volume was calculated using the formula: Volume (mL) = length × width × height × 0.523. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, Week 12, Week 72</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in Post-Void Residual - Post-void residual urine volume was assessed by bladder scan or ultrasound on all participants at baseline and various time-points during the study. After voiding, any residual urine volume in the bladder was measured. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</outcome>
