  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention involves the provision of a meal high in both protein and fat. The high protein/high fat meal contains 30grams of carbohydrate, 60g protein and 40g of fat. There is a minimum of 1 week between the intervention and control meal. From the commencement of meal consumption, IV insulin will be titrated in response to the glucose excursions to keep BGL at a target of 5.5mmol.</interventions>
    <comparator>The control is the provision of a meal low in protein and fat. The meal contains 30grams of carbohydrate, 5g protein and 5g of fat.</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>

  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Clinical experience and reports from families of children with type 1 diabetes has long suggested that meals high in protein and/or fat cause an increase in blood glucose levels after eating. Increased blood glucose levels, including after consumption of food, is well-known to add to long term health complications in type 1 diabetes. Current type 1 diabetes management guidelines recommend adjusting insulin doses for food
based on the amount of carbohydrate to be eaten at each meal. However, there has been an increase in evidence, including that from a lanmark study by our study group, to suggest that other nutrients such as fat and protein should be considered when calculating pre meal insulin. High levels of protein and/or fat in a meal cause a larger than expected rise in blood glucose levels after eating and these high blood glucose
levels persist, suggesting the need for extra insulin. 

This research project will compare the insulin required to maintain blood glucose levels within target range when consuming two meals, one high in protein and fat and the other low in protein and fat, both with the same carbohydrate content. This will be determined by looking at the difference in intra venous insulin requirements after both meals. IV insulin will be given to participants to maintain blood glucose levels at a constant level whilst they are eating the meal and in the 5 hours following. 

Thirteen participants will consume both test meals, one week apart. The different insulin amounts needed to maintain blood glucose levels after each test meal will provide accurate calculation of the expected increase in insulin requirements on consumption of a high protein/high fat meal. This study will provide important information in the management of type 1 diabetes in both adults and children. This information will be used immediately in our day to day management of patients and will guide the development of clinical guidelines to minimize the rise in blood glucose levels after eating.</summary>
