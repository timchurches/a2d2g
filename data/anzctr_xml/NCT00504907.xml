          3. Male subjects should use appropriate contraception (e.g. condoms) during the time
             interval between dosing until three months after dosing. Female subjects must be
             surgically sterile or post-menopausal (defined as at least two years post cessation of
             menses and/or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt;18 mIU/mL and serum oestradiol &lt;110
             pmol/L), or must agree to use two forms of the following contraception: oral
             contraceptives, or other forms of hormonal birth control including hormonal vaginal
             rings or transdermal patches, intra-uterine devices, condoms, and spermicide during
             the time interval between dosing until three months after dosing. Female subjects must
             also be non-lactating and have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and at
             baseline.

          4. Able to perform nasal wash procedure.

          5. Normotensive (systolic BP = 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP = 90 mm Hg).

          6. No abnormal finding of clinical relevance at the screening examination that the
             Investigator considers might interfere with the objectives of this clinical trial.

          7. No clinically relevant abnormality in the ECG; QTc &lt;430 ms (males) or &lt;450 ms
             (females).

          8. Healthy based on medical history, physical examination, 12-lead ECG and clinical
             laboratory tests, and with no disease that the Investigator regards as clinically
             relevant.

          9. Negative results in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) antibody, Hepatitis B surface
             antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis C antibody tests.

    <exclusivecriteria>1. Use of any prescription medication (other than allowable oral contraceptives and
             implanted hormonal contraceptives) during the 14 days prior to dosing.

             diet aids, hormone supplements, etc., within 14 days prior to dosing.

          3. Intake of any investigational drug within 3 months prior to dosing.

          4. History or clinical evidence of significant cardiovascular disease (including risk
             factors for cardiac arrhythmias) or a previous history of any cardiovascular condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the conduct of the
             trial.

          5. History or clinical evidence of significant cerebrovascular, cardiovascular,
             gastrointestinal, or haematological disease, or myocardial infarction, or a previous
             history of any other serious underlying disease (including immunocompromised subjects
             and/or neutropenic subjects) that, in the opinion of the investigator would interfere
             with the conduct of the clinical trial.

             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis and/or recurrent lower
             respiratory tract infection), or upper respiratory tract infection within the last

             laboratory abnormalities of renal function parameters. All subjects with serum
             creatinine or proteinuria outside the normal laboratory reference range at screening
             and baseline that are regarded by the Investigator as clinically significant.

             laboratory abnormalities of liver function parameters. All subjects with bilirubin,
             gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate
             transaminase (AST) outside the normal laboratory reference range at screening and
             baseline, that are regarded by the Investigator as clinically significant. Subjects
             known to have experienced elevated liver enzyme values in previous clinical studies
             will also be excluded.

          9. History or clinical evidence of adrenal disease (including Cushing's Syndrome or
             Addison's disease) or thyroid disease (including hyper or hypothyroidism), and/or
             previous clinically significant laboratory abnormalities of adrenal or thyroid
             function parameters. All subjects with thyroid function (TSH, FT4, FT3) outside the
             normal laboratory reference range at baseline and regarded by the Investigator as
             clinically significant.

         10. Psychiatric or emotional problems that would invalidate the giving of Informed Consent
             or limit the ability of the subject to comply with clinical trial requirements.

         11. Body Mass Index (BMI) =18.5 kg/m2 or &gt;=30.0 kg/m2.

         12. History of alcohol and/or drug abuse within 1 year prior to screening (verified by
             drug screening).

         13. Receipt of blood or blood products, or loss of 450 mL or more of blood, during the
             last three months prior to dosing.

         14. Unwillingness or inability to provide Informed Consent or to participate
             satisfactorily for the entire clinical trial period.

         15. Subjects who smoke or have been non-smokers for less than 3 months prior to dosing.

         16. Subjects who were previously enrolled in this clinical trial.
