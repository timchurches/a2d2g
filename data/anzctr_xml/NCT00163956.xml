  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a large vein that enters the bottom part of the heart. Venous
      blood from the lower portion of the body drains into the IVC. The IVC then returns blood back
      to the heart. An IVC filter is placed to help prevent the blood clots moving from the legs to
      the heart or lung. The idea behind using a filter in the IVC is to capture potential fatal
      pulmonary emboli at an anatomical location where they may pose less risk for the patient.
      Early filters, 1960's and 70's were, remained in the vein permanently. More recently,
      temporary or retrievable filters have been developed and are being widely used.

      Complications have been demonstrated with long-term placement of IVC filters. In a randomised
      study it was found that that patients with IVC filter placement had greater than three times
      the incidence of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared to their control population at
      two years. Blockage of the vein, recurrent pulmonary emboli, filter penetration and filter
      fragmentation have all been described.

      With the advent of retrievable filters (filters that can be place temporarily and then
      removed at a later date) there has been renewed popularity for placement of temporary
      filters. To our knowledge, no one has yet to follow the population of intended temporary IVC
      filters, who undergo failed retrieval, and consequently end up with a permanent IVC filter.

      We plan to prospectively enrol 40 Alfred patients who have undergone a temporary IVC filter
      placement and subsequently have had failed IVC filter retrieval.

      Our aim is to evaluate the long term outcomes for patients with failed IVC retrieval.

      Specifically we will determine the risk, due to failed filter retrieval, of:

        -  IVC stenosis

        -  IVC occlusion

        -  Development of DVT and

        -  analyse the clinical outcomes (symptoms), their prevalence and their distribution

      Patients will receive routine care and their data will be analysed annually as collected. The
      follow-up period is indefinite and will be at the discretion of the treating doctor.</summary>
