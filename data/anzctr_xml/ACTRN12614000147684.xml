  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants with acute lumbar pain will be observed. We will recruit participants within 2 weeks of the onset of pain and perform the initial MRI scan within 3 weeks of pain onset. We will use MRI scanning to observe any possible changes that occur over 12 weeks. We will aim to scan participants at Week 1, Week 2, Week 6 and Week 12 from initial baseline scan.  </interventions>
    <comparator>10 control participants will be included in this study. These participants will have no current lumbar pain and a maximum of two previous episodes of low back pain. These control participants will be scanned at Week 1, Week 2, Week 6 and Week 12 from initial baseline scan. </comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>This is a pilot study so the numbers of participants has been pre-determined to be small.
The following brief analysis plan is as follows:
1. Longitudinal analysis to investigate and allow comparison of changes in MRI findings between cases and controls
2. Analyse the ability of changes in MRI findings to predict changes in low back pain symptoms 
3. Cross-sectional analysis to assess the relationship between baseline MRI findings and clinical examination.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Back pain is very common, and the leading cause of disability in Australia. The relationship between MRI findings and symptoms in people with LBP remains unclear. There are very few high quality research papers investigating the relationship between MRI findings and low back pain. Very few studies have performed repeated MRIs and in these studies scans have been separated by long periods of time. Almost nothing is known about the changes in MRI findings in the first 6 weeks after an episode of low back pain despite this being the critical time period when most changes in clinical symptoms occur. To investigate the potential importance of MRI findings as a source of low back pain, it is essential to track these findings closely during an episode of low back pain and investigate the relationship between changes in MRI and changes in patients symptoms. </summary>
