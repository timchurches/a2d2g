  <interventions>
    <interventions>PICSI dish and Spermslow media are both designed for sperm selection prior to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). They are both based on the hyaluronan-sperm  binding assay but with different protocols. The former is coated with solid hyaluronan while the latter is the liquid status hyaluronan. Mature sperm tend to lose its progrssive motility when meet hyaluronan while immature ones don't. Sibling oocytes collected from each participating patient will be randomly allocated into the PICSI (control) and Spermslow (treatment) groups. Prepared sperm sample will be split and then undergo either selection methods (control or treatment group) prior to ICSI. Selected sperm from each group will be used for ICSI with sibling oocytes. After injection, comparisons will be made on ferilisation rate, time post ICSI insemination to reach syngamy, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8-cell stages (t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8)(hours), and implantation results after transfer of embryos. Only one-off intervention is involved at the sperm/egg level, none at the patient level. </interventions>

      <outcome>Fertilisation rate(%) 
Calculated as (number of oocyte normally fertilised)/(number of oocyte inseminated)x100%
Normal fertilisation is confirmed by appearance of 2 pronuclei observed on Embryoscope</outcome>

Embryoscope is a time-lapse photographing incubator providing accurate timings for biological events during embryo development. Timings for syngamy and t2,t3,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8 of embryos cultured in the Embryoscope will be automatically recorded .

Implantation is confirmed by detection of fetal heart beat under ultrasound 5 weeks after oocyte pick-up.

Fixed setting: Probability of Type I Error (a) = 0.05 &amp; 
Power (1 - B) = 0.8.
Regarding the (Difference to be detected) and (Within group SD), different values were used for different parameters. The final sample size (n=180 for each group) was determined by the biggest sample size required for any parameters to be assessed.
The average egg number collected per patient at Fertility North is 6, so the estimated number of participants is 60.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>PICSI dish and Spermslow (liquid hyaluronan) are both hyaluronan binding-based sperm selection methods. Publications have shown benefits of sperm selection by either method before intracytoplasmic sperm injection. However few study has compared the efficacy between these two methods. The proposed study will compare sibling embryos resulted from these two methods by using time-lapse analysis.</summary>
