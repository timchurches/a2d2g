    <summary>The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      several doses of BI 1356 BS (0.5, 2.5 and 5 mg daily) compared to placebo over 12 weeks of
      treatment in patients with Type 2 diabetes and insufficient glycemic control. In addition,
      there will be an open-label treatment arm with metformin for sensitivity measurement with
      this patient population. Population pharmacokinetics of BI 1356 BS will also be assessed in
      this study.</summary>
