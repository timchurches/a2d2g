  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: devices - Medtronic Advisa MRI Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG)
Treatment: devices - Medtronic CapSureFix MRI active fixation MRI lead

Experimental: MRI group - Subjects randomized to the MRI group will undergo a one-hour MRI scan, including 16 individual sequences in the chest and head region, at 9-12 weeks post-implant.

Active Comparator: Control group - Subjects randomized to the Control group will wait for one hour without having any MRI scan at 9-12 weeks post-implant.


Treatment: devices: Medtronic Advisa MRI Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG)
Advisa MRI IPG is a dual chamber, multi-programmable IPG indicated to restore heart rates, improve cardiac output, prevent symptoms, or protect against arrhythmias related to cardiac impulse formation or conduction disorders. The IPG is indicated for use in patients who may benefit from rate-responsive pacing to support cardiac output during varying levels of activity and has been modified for use during an MRI exam.

Treatment: devices: Medtronic CapSureFix MRI active fixation MRI lead
The Medtronic CapSureFix MRI active fixation MRI lead is a transvenous, bipolar, silicone, steroid eluting and active fixation pacing lead. It is based on the commercially available Medtronic Model 5076 lead and has been modified for use in the MRI environment. The MRI lead is used for both atrial and ventricular applications.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-Related Complications - For each subject in this objective, the endpoint was the occurrence of an MRI-related complication within 30 days post-MRI. An independent Adverse Event Advisory Committee (AEAC) determined whether each adverse event was a complication and whether it was MRI-related.</outcome>
      <timepoint>MRI scan to one-month post-MRI scan</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Atrial Pacing Capture Threshold Success - Subjects' atrial pacing capture threshold was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was when a subject experienced an increase less than or equal to 0.5V (volts) between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI/waiting period to one month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ventricular Pacing Capture Threshold Success - Subjects' ventricular pacing capture threshold was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was when a subject experienced an increase less than or equal to 0.5V (volts) between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI /waiting period to 1-month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Atrial Sensed Amplitude Success - Subjects' atrial sensed amplitude was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was defined as a 50% or less decrease in atrial sensed amplitude between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI /waiting period to 1-month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Ventricular Sensed Amplitude Success - Subjects' ventricular sensed amplitude was measured at the 9-12 week visit (pre-MRI/waiting period) and the 4-month visit (i.e. one month post-MRI/waiting period). A success was defined as a 50% or less decrease in ventricular sensed amplitude between the two visits.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pre-MRI /waiting period to 1-month post-MRI/waiting period</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence of Sustained Ventricular Arrhythmias and Asystole During MRI Scans. - The endpoint was the occurrence of sustained ventricular arrhythmias and asystole during MRI scans and attributable to the MR scan. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias or asystole episodes that occurred during the MRI scan was considered attributable to the MR scan if so adjudicated by the AEAC.</outcome>
      <timepoint>During MRI scans</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>System-related Complications - Subjects with a complication related to the implanted system, which consisted of the pacemaker, leads to the right chambers of the heart (atrium and ventricle), pacemaker software, and programmer. All adverse events in the time frame were recorded at the subject's center and assessed the AEAC. The AEAC determined whether each adverse event was a complication (requiring invasive intervention), and whether the event was related to the system.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Implant to four months post implant</timepoint>

    <summary>The purpose of the Advisa MRI System clinical study is to confirm safety and effectiveness in
      the clinical MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) environment when subjects receive MRI scans up
      to 2W/kg Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) without positioning restrictions (MRI scans may occur
      anywhere on the body including the chest).</summary>
