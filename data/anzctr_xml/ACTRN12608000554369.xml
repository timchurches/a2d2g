  <interventions>
    <interventions>All patients will receive Rituximab once per week for up to 8 weeks in Cycles 1-3. The first dose of Rituximab will be administered between 24 and 120 hours prior to the first dose of Apomab in Cycle 1.  In Cycles 2 &amp; 3 on Day 1, Rituximab will be administered directly prior to Apomab, without a rest period between the two treatments.  All patients will receive Apomab for a total of six cycles.  Each cycle lasts 21 days with a resting period built into each cycle.  The length of the resting period depends on the cycle.  The Apomab dose will be based on the patient's body weight at screening.  The rituximab dose will be based on the patient's body surface area at screening.  Both Rituximab and Apomab are administered intravenously (IV).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Objective response based on the results of radiographic studies and pertinent clinical data as determined using modified International Working Group (IWG) Criteria.  Tumors will be evaluated for response and disease progression based on the size and quantity of the lesions as compared to baseline exams.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 months</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival, as determined by independent review facility; Overall survival, defined as the time from first Apomab exposure until death from any cause.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Follow-up information will be collected via telephone calls and/or clinic visits every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, or study termination by Genentech.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Apomab is a monoclonal antibody, which is a type of protein that is normally made by the immune system to help defend the body from infection and cancer.   In preclinical studies Apomab selectively induced programmed cell death, or apoptosis, in cancer cells while sparing normal cells.  Apomab is being studied in this clinical trial in combination with Rituximab to evaluate whether it is safe for patients with follicular NHL and whether it can delay the further spread of follicular NHL.</summary>
