  <interventions>
    <interventions>1.  Pulmozyme was given once daily via nebuliser for 2 weeks @ 2.5mg/dose

2.  During days 1-14 the subjects were given one order of therapy (eg placebo saline, followed by physio then Pulmozyme) and then days 15-28 they were given the reverse order, in this case (Pulmozyme, followed by physio then placebo)

3.  the federal government allows doctors to trial Pulmozyme for one month (28-30 days) as part of the PBS S100 listing.  We designed the trial to keep within this requirement.

4. Physiotherapy was optimised by an experienced physiotherapist before the trial.  The patients performed the same physio techniques every day during the trial  by themselves, individually, at home, as per standard CF Physiotherapy used clinically 

Generally it takes about 30-40 minutes, but the patient does the same thing every day before during and after the trial, with the endpoint that they have no more sputum that requires clearance techniques. 


This trial will directly compare Pulmozyme given before versus after physiotherapy.  To maintain blinding, a matched saline nebulized therapy will be given at the other time point.  
The study comprises three components  baseline, first period (two weeks) followed immediately (no wash out) where two weeks of the reverse order.  This duration was chosen to maintain within the Pulmozyme one month trial.</interventions>
    <comparator>Intervention = Pulmozyme given after physiotherapy
 Pulmozyme given after physiotherapy is the test, compared with  the control of Pulmozyme given before physiotherapy.  
Given the requirement for a placebo, the two arms are 
1)	pre/post:-  Pulmozyme/physiotherapy/saline followed by saline/physiotherapy/Pulmozyme., which is tested in half the subjects. 
2)	Post/pre:- The other half of the subjects undertake the trial in the reverse order.

Group 1 = Post / Pre = .  During days 1-14 the subjects were given each day the following treatments : (saline, followed by physio then Pulmozyme) and then days 15-28 they were given (Pulmozyme, followed by physio then placebo).

Group 2 =  Pre / Post =.  During days 1-14 the subjects were given each day the following treatments : (Pulmozyme, followed by physio then placebo) and then days 15-28 they were given (saline, followed by physio then Pulmozyme).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>In Australia Pulmozyme is licensed for use in CF with mild/moderate lung function impairment.  
All CF patients are eligible for an initial one-month trial, but continued funding after one month dependent on a 10% improvement in FEV1.  
The purpose of this one month trial of Pulmozyme is to provide information for each individual patient as to whether they benefit more with Pulmozyme before or Pulmozyme after their physiotherapy technique.  
Following a period of optimization of their therapy, the patients undergo 2 two-week periods: Pulmozyme given before physiotherapy, and saline nebulized after physiotherapy with the second two weeks in the reverse direction.  
The other half of the subjects are randomly allocated to the reverse order of interventions.  Outcomes include lung function, quality of life, sputum, weight and exercise testing.</summary>
