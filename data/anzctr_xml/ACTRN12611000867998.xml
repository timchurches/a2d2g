  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Women with a healthy lifestyle during their pregnancy have healthier pregnancies and healthier babies. Their long term health is also improved, resulting in a better quality of life for them and their family, as well as lower health system costs with fewer doctor and hospital visits required. Currently, we do not know the best way to support women to make lifestyle changes to ensure they have the healthiest start to their pregnancy. This study is looking at how effective a workshop that is delivered early in pregnancy, that covers important diet, exercise, and smoking cessation advice, support and referrals, is to improve the health of pregnant women attending a large maternity hospital in South East Queensland.</summary>
