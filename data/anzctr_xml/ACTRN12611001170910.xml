  <interventions>
    <interventions>Weekly supermarket vouchers to the value of $5 (per adult female), received by the intervention group for four weeks. Vouchers allocated for the supermarket identified by each household as the most frequently used. Vouchers can be spent on any supermarket item.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Expenditure on fruit and vegetables during the intervention phase. This was assessed using analysis of food shopping receipts and food purchase forms collected and completed during four weeks of baseline and four weeks of intervention. A linear regression model was used to compare the voucher and the control group for phase 2 expenditure, with baseline expenditure entered as a covariate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Intervention phase expenditure on total food. This was assessed using analysis of food shopping receipts and food purchase forms collected and completed during four weeks of baseline and four weeks of intervention. A linear regression model was used to compare the voucher and the control group for phase 2 expenditure, with baseline expenditure entered as a covariate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Four weeks after intervention commencement</timepoint>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Households were allocated to the voucher or control group using block randomization.  Households were randomized into either the voucher or the control group after they had been determined eligible, given informed consent and had begun their baseline phase. The allocation sequence was concealed from research assistants enrolling households. The allocation sequence was kept on a central computer, excel spreadsheet, which was password protected and assessible only to an investigator not involved in enrolling households.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomization sequence was generated using Stata 10 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex, USA) and block sizes (range 2-10) were randomly varied.</sequence>
    <masking>Open (masking not used)</masking>
    <assignment>Parallel</assignment>
    <designfeatures>Households were not aware of the true study design. Households were told the study would have three parts (a, b &amp; c). Parts a and b involved the collection of food shopping receipts only and during part c the household would receive extra food vouchers in addition to collecting food shopping receipts. They were informed they would receive notice and a study pack one week before the beginning of each part, which could start at a random time within the next 6 months. They were also told that the three parts would not necessarily run in a sequential order. In effect households believed the study to run for a longer time period than it actually did and were not sure when they would be receiving the food vouchers.</designfeatures>

    <summary>The aim of the study is to examine food purchases and shopping habits of families with children. We are interested in what families buy if they are given some supplementary money and if they spend more money on "healthier foods" in particular, fruit and vegetables.</summary>
