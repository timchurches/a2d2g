  <interventions>
    <interventions>There will be two phases to our study. 
Phase 1 will be purely observational to elucidate a baseline costing. The patients will be treated with the conventional dry dressings regularly utilised by the surgeons. This phase will last 2 months. Unilateral and bilateral total knee Arthroplasty patients will be recruited into this phase. 
Phase 2 will be a randomised controlled trial comparing patient satisfaction and cost between negative wound pressure therapy and conventional dry dressings. Patients undergoing bilateral knee arthroplasty will be recruited and have each knee randomised to either receiving NPWT or CDD. We expect this phase to last 8-12 months to recruit the required number of patients. The negative pressure dressing will be left intact till wound review between 10-12 days in outpatient clinic.

Surgical wounds in these patients will be managed with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) has been used for many years for treatment of chronic wounds and more recently for post arthroplasty wound management. Orthopaedic surgeons are proactive in their consideration on surgical dressings in attempts to avoid costly post arthroplasty wound infections; at face value the closed, portable dressing system appears to provide an attractive option for wound care.  NPWT consists of a closed, sealed system that applies negative pressure (suction) to the wound surface.  The dressing is suggested to support primary intention to heal by improving local blood flow, facilitate oedema and exudate removal, reducing bacterial contamination, and promoting incision healing.The dressing will be applied by the surgeon at completion of surgery and left intact until the post-operative review appointment at 2 weeks post op. The patients will be discharged from hospital with a small canister attached to the dressing for collection of excess fluid.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The conventional dressings are changed as necessary on the ward and once discharged from inpatient stay, they will be left intact until clinic review between 10-12 days post-operatively. If there is excessive wound ooze, they will be changed on the ward or in clinic earlier than expected. There is significant variation between the type of dressings utilised by the three surgeons and this will affect the number of dressings each of their patients undergo. The other aspect that differs among the 3 surgeons is regular use of intra-articular drains post-op to decrease haemarthrosis. Removal of these drains will be taken into account as they will require separate dressing changes as well.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Cost of dressings changes- assessed by real time review of dressings and disposables used at time of change.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The cost of disposables and dressings will be accumulated at time of surgery and at each dressing change as an inpatient usually between Day one post-operative and Day four post-operatively as well as on review in outpatient clinic up to day 12. This outcome will be assessed in both Phase one and Phase two of the study,</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient satisfaction- assessed by a wound diary that requires patients to give us their opinion on different aspects pertaining to the dressings utilised for each of their knees. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The wound diary will be started from day of surgery till review in clinic between day 10-12. 
his outcome measures will only be assessed in phase two only</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient preference- assessed by a final evaluation form at their follow up at 10-12 days where they will pledge their favoured dressing type.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The final evaluation form will be provided at day 10-12 in clinic follow up. This outcome measures will only be assessed in phase two.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A Randomised control single centre trial for patients undergoing bilateral TKR for the treatment of osteoarthritis performed at the Mater Health Services North Queensland between December 2013 and June 2015.  The trial is comprised of 2 phases, phase 1 focuses on the economics of Conventional Dry Dressings (CDD) for patients undergoing TKR.  Phase 2 captures the cost of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) vs CDD as well as patient satisfaction in patients undergoing Bilateral TKR under three surgeons.  Each knee shall be randomised to receive either dry dressings or negative pressure wound dressings. Surgeons and patients will be blinded to which leg will receive the CDD and the NPWT until wound closure and the dressings are to be applied. Patient satisfaction will be  assessed in the form of a diary and questionnaire. Economy of dry dressing changes on the ward and in clinic is to be calculated with ward checklists. Data in regards to BMI, American Society of Anaesthesiologist Physical status classification, and Charlson Comorbidity Index will be collated as well. The follow up period is two weeks or untill the first  outpatient review as per surgeons standard of care.</summary>
