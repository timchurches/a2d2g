    <interventions>An automated text-messaging intervention to encourage and support exercise and activity after discharge from physiotherapy. The physiotherapist will select from one of a number of different packages of text messages. Each of the packages will contain a total of 44 texts of pre-written text messages. The text packages will take in to account patient preference of the type of encouragement they find most appropriate and will also look at the basic type of exercise or activity the patient has been prescribed, selected from general encouragement, general arm exercise nudges general leg exercise nudges and general fitness nudges. The TextNudge intervention will run for 12 weeks and messages will be sent daily for the first 4 weeks of the programme then 3 times per week for the remaining 8 weeks. Texts will be reminders to continue with pre-arranged exercises. A disclaimer will accompany the first text explaining that texts do not take the place of medical advice and to seek help if new problems occur. </interventions>

      <timepoint>At the end of the 12-week intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>A telephone interview will be undertaken to ask general questions about the patient experience  of receiving TextNudge.  The telephone interview will ascertain if they received texts or stopped them, if the number and content was appropriate and whether the texts affected their activities in any way. In addition patients will be asked to make comments and suggestions about possible improvements to the programme.

      <outcome>A telephone interview will be undertaken with the physiotherapist who instituted the programme at patient discharge. They will be asked whether setting up TextNudge was a burden and if they think it may be a useful adjunct to practice.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous research suggests that the use of small nudges or reminders can help people keep exercising or staying active. We know that people who stay active have better health than those who do not. TextNudge for Activity, is an automated text messaging service to help support and encourage people to stay active after they have finished the rehabilitation provided by the district health board. The researchers want to investigate if it is practical to give people discharged from physiotherapy an automated text message intervention. They want to find out how people feel about this service, whether they find it helpful and if they have suggestions to improve it. If receiving these brief reminders helps to encourage people to continue to exercise or keep active, then this may become a low-cost way to continue physiotherapy for longer.</summary>
