  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Treatment efficacy - rise in vitamin D level of 25nmol/L over 6 weeks. The 25(OH)D3 level will be measured on the DiaSorin Liaison. A rise of 25nmol/L over 6 weeks has been chosen as a marker of efficacy as previous studies suggests that adequate treatment with vitamin D supplements will lead to a minimum average rise of 25nmol/L. This increase also correlates with moving to a higher strata group in our predetermined strata of vitamin D levels (&lt;25nmol/L is deficient; 25-50nmol/L is moderate insufficiency; 50-78nmol/L is mildly insufficient)</outcome>

    <concealment>Once a potential participant has been identified the research team will approach the participant and their parent/carer and provide them with an information sheet outlining the study.  We will also be available to discuss any issues that they may have regarding the study.  If they agree to be part of the study then consent will be sought for the questionnaire, blood test and intervention concurrently before the blood test. Allocation will be concealed by contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is at Princess Margaret Hospital.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aims of the study are:
1. To examine if vitamin D deficiency is common problem in Aboriginal children in Western Australia (WA)
2. To determine if depot and daily vitamin D therapy have the same therapeutic outcomes. 
3.  To examine the relationship between vitamin D levels and childhood infections.
4. To determine the predictors of vitamin D deficiency in Aboriginal children 

We hyypothesize that:
1. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in Aboriginal children in WA 
2. Depot vitamin D therapy results in better therapeutic outcomes than traditional daily vitamin D therapy.
2. Children with lower vitamin D levels have a higher burden of childhood infections.
3. Age, sun exposure, skin pigmentation and nutrition will influence vitamin D levels in children</summary>
