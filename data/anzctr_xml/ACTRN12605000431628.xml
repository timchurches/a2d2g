  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Ischaemic discomfort plus one or more of ECG changes (ST segment depression or elevation of at least 0.5mm, T-wave inversion of at least 3mm in at least 3 leads, or left bundle branch block), elevated levels of cardiac markers, a history of coronary disease, or age of at least 65 years in patients with diabetes or vascular disease (i.e. the identical criteria as those used in the recent OPUS-TIMI 16 trial and reiterated in the recent New England Journal article by De Lemos et al on the prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide in patients with acute coronary syndromes [43a]).  The deliberate aim is to include a broad spectrum of age, both genders and significant sub-groups with the important antecedent risk factors and disease processes such as hypertension and diabetes. </inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Measurement of blood levels of hormones produced by the heart in response to stress or injury have been shown to predict the risk of death or deterioration in heart function in patients with heart disease. Recently validated techniques in echocardiography for grading heart function also stand as strong clinical indicators  We propose to apply both methods of assessment to a broad range of patients who have all survived a recent crisis from coronary artery disease and are at the point of discharge (or within 8 weeks after discharge) from hospital. Positive results should enable targeting of intensified follow-up and medical treatment aimed at improving outcomes in those demonstrated to be at high risk for later problems</summary>
