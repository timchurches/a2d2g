  <interventions>
    <interventions>Electromyography
Wireless surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes will be placed on three rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus), deltoid (anterior, middle and posterior heads), pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi muscles according to the Surface Electromyography for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) guidelines.. Prior to electrode placement, the skin area will be shaved and cleaned with an alcohol swab. EMG data will be sampled at 1000 Hz. Prior to performing the shoulder exercises, the maximal voluntary contraction will be tested for each of the analysed muscles, following the SENIAM guidelines.
Procedures
Data collection will last for 45 min. Shoulder muscle activity levels were monitored with the EMG while participants performed the exercises. 
Firstly, participants will be screened for shoulder disorders. Then, participants age, height and weight will be recorded. Next, participants will be asked to perform 10 repetitions for each the two shoulder exercises: (1) the relocation shoulder exercise; (2) shoulder external rotation.
The relocation exercise
The researcher gently pulls the arm longitudinally, while the patient is requested to counter-act this by pulling the arm back. The patient sustains an isometric contraction for 3 seconds. 
Shoulder external rotation
This exercise consists of rotating the shoulder laterally, while side-lying with a flexed elbow with the arm close to the trunk. This exercise has been shown to encourage recruitment of shoulder external rotator muscles, including Infraspinatus and Supraspinatus.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Shoulder disorders is a debilitating condition impacting daily living activities. Shoulder exercises are currently recommended at early stages of rehabilitation. Recent studies, however, suggest little evidence for shoulder exercise as an effective intervention for improving function and reducing pain. Before designing and testing new interventions for shoulder disorders, it is important to identify whether these exercises optimize shoulder muscle activity. This study aims to quantify shoulder muscle activity during selected shoulder exercises.</summary>
