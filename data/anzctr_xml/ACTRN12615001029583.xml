  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Aim to evaluate the effect of exenatide on postprandial glycaemia in patients with cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). CFRD has a detrimental impact on pulmonary function, mortality and prognosis after lung transplant, that is currently treated by intensive insulin regimen. GLP-1 is released in response to food ingestion and is known to stimulate insulin secretion, suppress glucagon secretion and slow gastric emptying. Exenatide is a GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) agonist that can be administered daily without significant risk of hypoglycaemia. It is anticipated that exenatide will normalise postprandial glycaemia.

This is a double blinded crossover trial where participants will have 2 study days. On the first day they will receive the intervention or placebo, receiving the opposite on the second day. Once the intervention or placebo has been given, the participant will consume a pancake followed by assessment of glycaemia, incretin response and gastric emptying.</summary>
