  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm One: Participants will be asked to take ONE capsule twice daily, for 3 months, of a commercially available seaweed extract (Maritech Synergy) equivalent to 500mg of fucoidan per capsule. This product is classified as a dietary supplement. Participants will attend one screening appointment to assess eligibility. If eligible, participants will be asked to attend another appointment (called study appointment one) to provide written and informed consent, be randomly allocated to arm 1 or arm 2 of the study and take baseline measurements: blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, HBA1c, insulin, lipid profile, liver, kidney and blood system function tests. At this point participants will also be asked to provide information on current medical conditions and medications. Participants will be provided with a 75g in 125mL sucrose (sugar) drink and measurements taken at set time points over two hours following the drink. Adherence will be encouraged through fortnightly phone calls (as far as practicable). A follow up appointment will be made at the end of the 3 month course of capsules, with the procedure identical to study appointment one, barring written and informed consent which will have already been obtained. Participants will be asked to inform researchers of any changes to medical conditions, medications, exercise habits, diet and alcohol intake over the previous three months, during this appointment. Adherence to treatment will be checked through capsule counting and patient self-report ("How many times have you missed a dose in the past week?") at the conclusion of the trial. </interventions>
    <comparator>Arm 2: Procedures are identical to arm 1 except that participants will be provided with placebo capsules.

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Participant will be pre-screened over the phone, attend a formal screening appointment followed by two study appointments; one at the beginning and another at the end of the trial. 

Allocation is concealed via central randomisation. 

Participants will not be aware of whether they have been allocated to arm 1 or arm 2 of the trial. The investigators will also be unaware of participants treatment allocation when the decision to enrol participants is made and will be blinded to allocation (arm 1 or arm 2) when participants are randomised. </concealment>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Sample size estimated based on literature data for insulin sensitivity (using HOMA score) that: the mean HOMA index for normal healthy individuals (without diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance) is 2.0 (standard deviation = 0.8), and that fucoidan reduces this figure by at least a mean of 20%. 

Based on these assumptions, 34 patients are needed (at a power of 80% and P = 0.05) to show statistical significance. Therefore 40 participants per arm will be recruited (N = 80 in total) to allow for a 15% drop-out rate during the trial. 

Data will be analysed using a statistical program such as SPSS and data will be input into a database during the trial to allow comparison between study appointment one and two and/or between participants in arm 1 and arm 2. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is looking to assess if a commercially available seawead extract (fucoidan) has an effect on blood sugar and insulin levels, as well as other markers of cardio (heart) and metabolic health, when taken over three months. To allow us to assess its impact, one half (approx 40) of the enrolled participants will take a placebo capsule which does not contain fucoidan or any other active ingredient. </summary>
