  <interventions>
    <interventions>Serial sampling of plasma Pre-pro Brain natriuretic peptide Signal Peptide (BNP-SP)patients recruited over 1 year with controlled induced cardiac ischemia in the form of either dobutamine stress testing or treadmill exercise tolerance testing is proposed.
The dobutamine stress echocardiograph test takes about 1 hour and involves an injection of 10-40mcg/kg/min of dobutamine to stimulate the heart in a similar way to exercise while measuring the effect using ultrasound.
The Treadmill exercise tolerance test takes about 30 minutes in total and involves an electrocardiogragh recording while walking on a treadmill.
Venous blood samples will be drawn at baseline (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 hours. Later sampling (=1wk) will not be carried out. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SNP, troponin and N-terminal Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Other signal peptides will be looked at namely ghrelin SP. Depending on results this biomarker has the potential to improve the sensitivity of stress testing. In addition, this study may provide insights into the mechanisms of release of this novel group of peptides.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether serial measurements of BNP-SP  measured via venous blood sampling will be able to detect inducible cardiac ischemia. The temporal pattern of release of BNP SP during  1) treadmill exercise tolerance testing and 2) dobutamine stress echocardiography will be determined in those with intermediate to high risk cardiac chest pain and compared to the pattern of release of patients with low risk of cardiac pathology</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The pattern of release will also be compared and contrasted to N-terminal Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-BNP) and high sensitivity troponin in venous blood sampling</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective observational pilot study of the diagnostic utility of a novel biomarker B-type natriuretic peptide signal peptide (BNP-SP)in the assessment of inducible cardiac ischemia. Previously performed studies have demonstrated a clear, consistent and early peak of BNP-SP in the setting of indisputable cardiac ischemia and necrosis in patients presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patterns of release in the setting of less extreme forms of cardiac ischemia have not been previously defined.
Serial sampling of BNP-SP in patients with controlled induced cardiac ischemia in the form of dobutamine stress testing and treadmill exercise tolerance testing is proposed.
Venous blood samples will be drawn at baseline (0), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4 hours. Later sampling (=1wk) will not be carried out. For each blood sample, we will measure plasma BNP-SNP, troponin and NT-proBNP. Other signal peptides will be looked at namely ghrelin SP. Depending on results this biomarker has the potential to improve the sensitivity of stress testing. In addition, this study may provide insights into the mechanisms of release of this novel group of peptides.</summary>
