  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the study is to prospectively evaluate pregnancy outcomes in women
      with multiple sclerosis who were exposed to a Registry-specified Biogen Multiple Sclerosis
      product during the eligibility window for that product. The Registry-specified Biogen MS
      products being studied are dimethyl fumarate, Pegylated human interferon beta-1a, and
      Dalclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP).</summary>
