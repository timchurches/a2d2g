    <interventions>Sedation of acute psychiatric patients requiring aeromedical retrieval with Propofol versus Ketamine.

Protocol for Administration

Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) will be utilised to measure sedation level.

Propofol:

The initial dose of Midazolam is determined by the RASS of the patient on arrival of the flight crew at the referral centre; a RASS of &gt;+1, in the absence of premedication with a benzodiazepine,would indicate the need for an initial dose of Midazolam at 0.03mg/kg

Propofol (Target RASS 0 to -3):

(If the patient has not had any benzodiazepine): If Richmond agitation Sedation scale (RASS) &gt;0 start with an initial dose of Midazolam 0.03mg/kg IV
Prepare a Propofol syringe (200mg/20mls)
Deliver ONE bolus of Propofol 0.25mg/kg to aim target RASS
If further sedation required commence Propofol infusion to 0.25mg/kg/hr (approx. 3.5mls/hr)
If RASS +1 increase Propofol infusion by 2mls every 5-10mins until target RASS of 0 to -3 is achieved
If RASS +2 or higher, repeat IV Propofol bolus 0.25mg/kg to acutely reduce agitation
If RASS -5 cease Propofol infusion until target RASS achieved, recommence infusion to maintain target RASS.
For a SBP &lt;90 administer a crystalloid bolus of 250mls
Record  the RASS, vital signs, and non-invasive end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) levels every 10 minutes until arrival at receiving centre
There is no maximum dose of Propofol to be administered as the timing of the retrieval cannot be strictly quantified.
Please complete the data collection sheet before filing the patient notes


The intervention period can last between 2-8 hrs.  There a number of factors that impact on the duration of intervention; the time of preparing the patient at the referral centre, delay in road ambulance transport to the aircraft, the flight time and delays on road ambulance transport from Darwin International Airport to Royal Darwin Hospital. These factors can only be estimates of time as they vary widely, particularly the ambulance waiting periods from referral centres to the aircraft and from the aircraft to the Royal Darwin hospital. </interventions>

Ketamine (Target RASS 0 to -3):

(If the patient has not had any benzodiazepine): If Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) &gt;0 start with an initial dose of Midazolam 0.03mg/kg IV
Prepare a Ketamine (200mg/2ml) syringe by adding 200mg/2ml vial with 20mls Normal Saline (10mg/1ml)
Deliver ONE bolus of Ketamine 1mg/kg as aim target RASS
If further sedation required commence ketamine infusion at 1mg/kg/hr
If RASS +2 or higher, repeat IV ketamine Bolus 0.5mg/kg to acutely reduce agitation rather than increasing infusion rate
If RASS -5 cease ketamine infusion until target RASS achieved, recommence infusion to maintain target RASS
Record the RASS, vital signs, and non-invasive end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) levels every 10 minutes until arrival at receiving centre
For a SBP &lt;90 bolus 250mls of crystalloid
There is no maximum dose of Ketamine stipulated as the timing of the retrieval cannot be strictly quantified

    <concealment>Patients will receive standard oral sedation before crew arrival, comprising 10mg Olanzapine and 10mg Diazepam. After tasking of an acute psychiatric patient retrieval, the crew logon to the study database and complete the randomisation eligibility. If it is determined that the patient is 18 years or older, a Flight Nurse and a Flight Doctor (crew) are required for the retrieval then the patient will be considered eligible to be randomised. 
will receive and open an envelope at the CareFlight Darwin base with a randomised decision of either Ketamine or Propofol sedation.  The need for in-flight sedation will be assessed by the crew on arrival at the referral centre.  Prior to sedation, sedation level will be assessed via the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS). If the patient is found to have a RASS of +1 to +4, they are deemed to require sedation and they are included in the study. The flight crew will open their envelope at this time which will be randomised to Ketamine or Propofol.

Sample size: Soomaroo, Mills, &amp; Ross (2014) had a sample size of 262 patients from one year of data from the same proposed patient population; of the 262 patients forty percent required inflight sedation.  All patients retrieved via CareFlight NT are entered into the medical retrieval database.  A retrospective analysis of the database identified greater than 720 acute psychiatric patients retrieved from February 2012  February 2015. Thus it is expected approximately 400 patients who will require inflight sedation will be enrolled in this project over a two year period.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The inherent dangers of the aviation environment combined with the potential and unpredictable behaviour of acute psychiatric patients presents a challenge to even the most experienced aeromedical retrieval clinician. An efficacious sedation drug is vital in this environment to ensure crew and patient safety and to minimise patient distress. 
The incidence of psychiatric patients requiring retrieval from remote areas is increasing. Over a period of two years and nine months, CareFlight Northern Territory Operations has retrieved 660 psychiatric patients (01/02/2012  20/11/2014).  There is no consensus on the optimal sedative to us in these patients. There has been no research undertaken that compares Ketamine and Propofol sedation in the aeromedical retrieval of acute psychiatric patients.   

Ketamine and Propofol are currently used within CareFlight Northern Territory Operations to sedate acute psychiatric patients who require aeromedical retrieval from their rural and remote areas. The primary purpose is to compare the safety and efficacy of sedating acute psychiatric patients with either Ketamine or Propofol whilst documenting and treating any potential complications that may arise. 
This study will also add to the paucity of literature on sedation methods for acute psychiatric patients requiring aeromedical retrieval.

Study Hypothesis: Ketamine and Propofol are both as safe and efficacious as each other in sedating acute psychiatric patients who require aeromedical retrieval </summary>
