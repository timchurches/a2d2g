  <interventions>
    <interventions>1. Brief cognitive behaviour therapy including strategies like self-monitoring of mood and anxiety, slow breathing, problem solving, pleasant life events and mindfulness. Five sessions of around 60 minutes, administered by a psychologist, will be emailed to participants every 2nd week over 10 weeks. Participants will be contacted by a psychologist via a telephone call, every week for the 10 weeks, for up to 30 minutes to discuss application of skills and to improve adherence.
2. Healthy lifestyle intervention including self-monitoring of behaviours like diet intake and exercise; goal setting, education on healthy sleep behaviour, education on healthy exercise behaviour and diet. Five sessions of around 60 minutes, administered by a psychologist, will be emailed to participants every 2nd week over 10 weeks. Participants will be contacted by a psychologist via a telephone call every week for the 10 weeks, for up to 30 minutes to discuss application of skills and to improve adherence.
The participants will be randomised to either one of the two interventions or the control condition, so that one-third will receive the brief CBT, one-third the healthy lifestyle and one-third the control condition. </interventions>
    <comparator>A psychologist will contact by telephone for up to 30 minutes every week for 10 weeks to discuss how they are going and how their claim is proceeding. There will be no psychological or healthy lifestyle advice given. New reading material on compensation and injury factors following a road accident will be sent by email every 2 weeks for 10 weeks.</comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be recruited after they have had a motor vehicle crash and they have rung Suncorp for CTP cover. Suncorp will advise the potential participant that a study is being conducted by the University of Sydney on preventing psychological distress associated with a motor vehicle crash. If the person is interested, a researcher will contact and discuss their willingness to participate. The Participant information and Consent forms will then be sent if the person agrees. Their name will then be given to the database manager who will randomise to one of three study arms. </concealment>
    <sequence>A random number generator (randomisation table) will be used to allocate participants to the study arms.</sequence>

    <endpoint>Efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Based on prior results of CBT and healthy lifestyle interventions, the two interventions are assumed to have a moderate mean effect size of around 0.5. Therefore, 180 participants (60 in each arm) should provide at least 80% statistical power to detect a true outcome. Statistics to determine efficacy of the interventions will include MANCOVA with protected t-tests with comparisons to the control arm</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Psychological injury is a common outcome following a motor vehicle crash (MVC) and the claims process can result in further deterioration of mental, social and physical health. The provision of brief psychological or healthy lifestyle interventions soon after people who have experienced an MVC and who engage in the compensation scheme should improve wellbeing by reducing risks of psychological and physical distress. Improved wellbeing should also result in reduced scheme costs, for instance, by preventing the development of severe psychological injury and enhancing return to normal daily functioning. This Project will investigate the efficacy, using a randomised control trial design, of two email-delivered interventions designed to improve and maintain physical health and strengthen mental health. It is hypothesised that participants receiving one of the two brief interventions will exhibit less psychological distress compared to control particpants 6 months after the road accident.</summary>
