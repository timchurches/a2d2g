  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be initially assessed then prescribed a personalised home exercise program. The participant will receive a DVD of the exercises performed by the patient themself, including the Physiotherapist corrections and advice. They will be asked to do their exercises 3 times per week for approximately 30 minutes. Initial consultation of approximately 1 hour followed by 30 minute appointments weekly for 6 weeks. At reappointments, review and motivational interviewing will occur. DVD will not be updated but repetitions and feedback will be reviewed again so that partiicpants increase intensity as judged able by the therapist. Lower limb strength and balance exercises tailored for each participant. participants watch DVD each time they complete exercises. Phone call and exercise diary as well as semi structured interview to measure adherence and response to program. At 6 weeks participants will be asked to continue with their final prescribed programme till the 6 month review.</interventions>

    <concealment>Swan Districts Hospital (SDH) physiotherapy and nursing staff will be given flyers notifying them of the study outline as well as participant inclusion and exclusion criteria. The SDH Geriatrician will be included in the participant recruitment process as well as participant screening. The majority of the participants are expected to come from recent falls/deconditioned patients via geriatrician referral. Participant flyers will also be placed in the SDH outpatient department for prospective participants to see, expression of interested are then referred to physiotherapist.



Eligible patients will be given the study information verbally by the researcher, and in writing via the information and consent forms. Patients will be encouraged to discuss their proposed participation with family or carers. Patients who subsequently provide informed written consent will be enrolled into the six month study</concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculated based on determining the feasiblity of being able to provide the intervention. This involves determining how much time the intervention will take to deliver including making the DVD. It has been determined that we will need to assess a minimum of 5 patients to become expert in making the DVD with a real patient. This is based on our trials with normal subjects. This trial is not testing a hypothesis but  if the intervention is feasible and older people respond positively we can then progress to a larger pilot study, which does test hypotheses. This trial will examine the feasibility and inform the design, in particular the novel DVD intervention to provide exercise prescription, as well as sample size calculations for future larger randomised controlled trials. We will collect data on aspects of the trial procedure, including number of subjects who consent to participate from the potential cohort of subjects, and the number of drop outs from the study, amount of time required to make the DVD, quality of the finished product and ability of the exercises to be filmed live in an outpatient department

Quantitative data will be analysed using descriptive statistics.  Qualitative data will be transcribed, coded and thematically analysed.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hip fracture is a major cause of death and loss of independence for older people. Exercise prescription after hip fracture is vital to return the patient to the highest possible level of function. Previous studies have shown that older people have difficulty in adhering to exercise programs. This pilot project aims to investigate whether providing the older person with a personalised DVD of their exercises will help them to adhere to the program</summary>
