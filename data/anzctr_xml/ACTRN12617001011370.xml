Eligible patients will be invited to participate in the trial and provided with the Patient Information Sheet and encouraged to ask questions. Once the patient has agreed to go ahead with the study they will be asked sign the consent form. Consenting patients will be randomized to either group A or group B.  The randomization sequence will be determined using a central computerized randomizing program. In both groups, the procedure will be performed at the Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Adelaide Hospital, under deep sedation (Propofol, as determined by patient weight), administered by qualified anaesthetists.  After the lesion is evaluated by EUS, the endoscopist will perform the tissue sampling using the most appropriate pathway deemed at the time.
Group A will undergo EUS fine needle aspiration (FNA) with the 22G EchoTip needle.  Each pass will undergo rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) by a trained cytopathologist or cytotechnician (ROSE slides prepared in the endoscopy suite with Papanicolaou stain and the remaining sample to be placed into Hanks solution in order to develop a paraffin embedded cell block).  The degree of suction will be determined by the endoscopist and the degree of bloodiness of the specimen.  The endoscopist will perform passes until the cytopathologist or cytotechnician satisfies the quality of specimen that allow determination of the diagnosis, to a maximum of 7 passes.
Group B will undergo EUS FNB with the 22G ProCore needle without the presence of ROSE.  A total of 4 passes will be done per lesion using suction via a 10ml syringe (with the fanning technique done when possible).  All aspirated material will be placed in formalin to undergo direct histological processing (filtered through a microcassette, immersed in Ponceau S tinted neutral buffered formalin and processed as standard histological blocks).
All patients will be observed in recovery for a minimum 2 hours following the procedure for any complications.
Trained cytologists and pathologists will assess the final processed samples from each group in order to determine the diagnosis.  The diagnostic reports will be stratified into the following categories: 
1. Positive for malignancy
2. Suspicious for malignancy
3. Atypia
4. Negative for malignancy

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background: Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS FNA) is a key component for the investigation and diagnosis of solid pancreatic masse.  It has a proven track record for being safe with complications and tumour seeding being a rare occurrence.  The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for pancreatic lesions in many studies is high and exceeds 85%. Studies aiming to optimize EUS FNA have compared several factors including needle size, the number of needles passes and suction versus slow-pull.  Initial studies showed that the use of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) had the biggest impact with increased diagnostic accuracy and reduced needle passes.  However more recent reports show conflicting results on whether ROSE actually does influence outcome in EUS FNA.  

ROSE has historically been performed using FNA needles with cytological assessment.  The act of smearing specimens (a necessary step for ROSE) to prepare cytology slides using cell aspirates obtained from FNA needles can be done without difficulty after necessary training and experience.  
The fine needle biopsy (FNB) needle (the ProCore needle) was introduced to further improve upon EUS guided tissue sampling.  It is designed to collect a larger amount of core sample tissue by having a reverse bevel near the tip.  Several studies favour the EUS FNB needle over the classic FNA needle for obtaining more adequate histological specimens with a high diagnostic yield.  
Data comparing the performance of EUS FNB without ROSE versus EUS FNA with ROSE is currently lacking. With this in mind, needles that provide histological specimens with an excellent (&gt;95%) diagnostic yield (thus negating the need for ROSE) are the ideal devices for obtaining EUS guided diagnostic tissue.   We therefore aim to compare the diagnostic yield of solid pancreatic masses using EUS FNA with ROSE versus EUS FNB without ROSE. 
Hypothesis: EUS FNB without ROSE will have equal diagnostic accuracy to EUS FNA with ROSE, hence negating the need for ROSE when EUS guided tissue acquisition is performed with FNB needle for solid pancreatic masses. 
Aim: To compare the outcomes of EUS FNA with ROSE versus EUS FNB without ROSE for solid pancreatic masses.
Design: This will be a prospective, multi-centre, randomized control trial involving 600 patients with pancreatic solid mass of more than 1cm.  There will be 10 centres participate in the trial, each recruiting 60 patients per hospital.  Patients at each site will be randomized to either: Group A, (n=30, total = 300) which will undergo EUS FNA with the standard 22G EchoTip needle with ROSE. Group B (n=30; total=300), which will undergo EUS FNB with the 22G ProCore needle without ROSE.
