Other: Combination therapy - Participants receive both active ACEI and active Statin


Treatment: drugs: Statin

Treatment: drugs: Ace Inhibitor
Starting dose of 5mg daily rising after 14 days to 10mg daily providing it is well tolerated for a minimum period of 2 years.

Treatment: drugs: Placebo
Participants receive statin placebo and ACEI placebo

Treatment: drugs: Combination therapy
Participants receive both active statin and active ACEI. Dose for Statins is 10mg daily. Dosing for ACEI starts at 5mg daily rising to 10mg after 14 days providing it is well tolerated. Both interventions last for a minimum of 2 years.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine whether use of blood pressure lowering drugs,
      Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and blood fat (lipid) lowering drugs
      (statins) may have a place in the treatment of adolescents with diabetes and can help reduce
      serious long-term health problems in this population.</summary>
