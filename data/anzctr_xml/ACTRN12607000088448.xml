  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention trialled in this study is trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT).  Participants in this group are offered this treatment 4-6 weeks post injury (early intervention condition).  This intervention is delivered on a session basis (one to two sessions per week) for a period of 6-10 sessions. Each session has a duration of 90 minutes.  The intervention in this study, TF-CBT, involves psychoeducation around psychological symptoms and trauma, anxiety management, exposure to feared thoughts and situations, cognitive therapy for identifying and challenging maladaptive thought processes around trauma, activity and positive event scheduling and relapse prevention.  The administration of these modules in the therapy are tailored for the particular presentation of symptoms.  For example, if the presentation is primarily comprised of depressive symptoms, an emphasis on activity and positive events is made.  Likewise if the presentation comprises primarliy of PTSD symptoms, an emphasis on prolongued exposure is made.</interventions>
    <comparator>The intervention trialled in this study is trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (TF-CBT). Participants in this group will be offered this treatment 16 weeks post injury (later intervention condition). This intervention is delivered on a session basis (one to two sessions per week) for a period of 6-10 sessions. Each session has a duration of 90 minutes. The late intervention comparison group will act as a waitlist control/treatment as usual condition and will be compared with the early intervention condition to inform of the effectiveness of early intervention.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Postrauma Adjustment Scale (PAS) and the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ) will be administered.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Time point 1 (1-2 weeks post injury).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Postramatic Stress Checklist (PCL) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) will be administered to participants screened as high at Timepoint 1 measures. </outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 2 (4-6 weeks post injury).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Clinican Administred PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Multi International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) will be administered. This timepoint also acts as the pre-test assessment prior to therapy (intervention) for those assessed as high on the CAPS and MINI. This assessment is completed, irrespective of whether participants undertake therapy. A range of self report measures are also administered at this timepoint as primary outcome measures. These include: Demographic Information, World Health Organistaion Quality of Life measure (WHOQOL), the World Health Organisation Disability Scale (WHODAS), the Alcohol Use Identification Test (AUDIT), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Survey of Pain Attitudes (SPA), the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory (WHYMPI), and the Family Relationship Scale.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 3 (6 weeks post injury).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The CAPS, MINI and self report measures described above are administered again. This assessment acts as a post test assesment for those in the early intervention group. Whilst serving as the comparison time point this assesment acts as both a 'posttest' comparison and pretest for those participants waiting to undertake the later intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 4 (18 weeks post therapy).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The CAPS, MINI and self report measures described above are administered again at this timepoint.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 5  (6 months post injury).
Timepoint 6 (12 months post injury).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The Refusal Questionaire (applicable for participants who decline/withdraw participation in study)</outcome>
      <timepoint>administered at Timepoint 1 (1-2 weeks post injury), Timepoint 2 (4-6 weeks post injury), Timepoint 3 (6 weeks post injury), Timepoint 4 (18 weeks post injury), Timepoint 5 (6 months post injury) and Timepoint 6 (12 months post injury).</timepoint>

This includes minor injury sustained by the following mechanisms of injury: Falling from a non-height (e.g., tripping, slipping, fainting) Domestic accidents (accidents that occur around the home) Sporting injuries b) Deathc) Age &gt;65 or &lt;16d) Satellite admission  in some cases patients are kept in wards for observation, usually because their injuries are relatively minor. Those in observation wards are not included in the study.e) Brain injury is greater than mild f) The injury is a result of deliberate self-harm g) The individual has a history of or current psychotic disorderh) A temporary Australian visitor (e.g., tourist)i) Non English speakerj) Admission &lt;24 hoursk) Actively suicidall) Cognitive impairmentm) Under police guardn) Missed patients</exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A sealed opaque envelope will be provided by an external researcher to the clinican before the Time 3 assesment is undertaken. At cessation of the Time 3 assessment, which determines eligibility to the treatment trial, the clinican will open the envelope that will inform which treatment allocation (early or late) the participant has been allocated. The clinican in the study will determine inclusion eligibility to the treatment trial. This clinician will be unaware to which group the participant has been allocated till it is revealled via the envelope after the determination for eligibility into the treatment has been made.</concealment>

    <designfeatures>While neither the clinican administering the treatment nor the participant recieving treatment is blind to the treatment condition to which the participant is allocated, researchers who conduct the post test (post therapy) and follow assessments are blind to the treatment allocation of the participant.</designfeatures>
