    <statisticalmethods>The assumptions for the power calculations were based on the following. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was 1.3% for norepinephrine, 2.3% for [3H]norepinephrine; interassay coefficients of variation were 3.8% and 4.5% respectively. The SD for whole body norepinephrine spillover was 10-13%. Esler and colleagues had previously shown that a sample size of 17 per group had 80% power with a 2 sided alpha of 0.05 to demonstrate group differences of greater than or equal to 10% in log norepinephrine spillover and greater than or equal to 25% in MSNA. The estimated dropout rate is 5% and estimated screen fail rate is 15%. For each arm, 18 people will need to be randomised to achieve 17 participants reaching the end of the treatment period. Therefore, up to 43 people will need to be screened.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will help to better understand the effect of empagliflozin on the sympathetic nervous system in people     who have pre­existing cardiovascular disease. The sympathetic nervous system regulates heart rate, controls blood pressure, regulates sweating and release of glucose from the   liver.
The primary aim is to answer this question:
*What effect does empagliflozin have overall on the sympathetic nervous system? The secondary aims are to answer these questions:
*What effects does empagliflozin have on the sympathetic nervous system activity in the heart, kidney, muscle and sweat gland?
*What effects does empagliflozin have on pressure in the heart and on heart muscle contraction and relaxation?
*What effects does empagliflozin have on glucose and metabolite levels? 
The study is a randomised trial with 18 people per arm:
*Group 1 ­ empagliflozin
*Group 2 ­ placebo
Total length of study participation will be approximately 19 weeks, i.e. a screening period and baseline assessment period that will last up to 3 weeks, a treatment period lasting 12 weeks, and a safety follow­up period lasting 4    weeks.   There will be up to 9 study visits.
During this study, there will be medical history and medication reviews, physical examination, assessment of blood pressure, heart rate and weight, collection of blood and urine. To answer the primary aim, there will be baseline and end of treatment kidney and heart noradrenaline spillover studies and arteriovenous metabolite gradient sampling.   This involves sampling from a vein in the back of the hand or arm, from a small tube in the artery in the arm, and    from a catheter placed via a vein in the arm, to sample the blood in the heart vein, kidney vein and liver vein. To assess accurately the rate of noradrenaline release from the heart and the kidneys into the bloodstream, a small amount of a radioactive substance will be infused continuously at a low rate through the tube in the arm vein. In the same tube, there will be infused a chemical called para aminohippuric acid (PAH) to measure the kidney blood flow.
To answer the secondary aims, there will be baseline and end of treatment tests of electrocardiogram, echocardiogram (heart ultrasound), questionnaires on general health, anxiety and depression, Sudoscan (nerve activity related to sweating), ankle brachial index (which assesses the blood pressure in all 4 limbs), nerve activity testing in the calf muscle, and a maximum exercise capacity test on a stationary bicycle.
