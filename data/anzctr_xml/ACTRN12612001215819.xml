    <concealment>To generate the growth chart to be used, the required parameters for the customisation process will be entered during the booking interview with the midwife.  Once the first doctor’s visit has occurred, and the model of care (i.e. to exclude women accessing GP shared care) and plurality (i.e. to exclude multiple pregnancies) have been entered, the chart will be produced and saved in the electronic obstetric clinical system.  The randomisation schedule will be saved into this same system and the chart (either standard or customised) will be generated based on the next allocation in the randomisation sequence.</concealment>
    <sequence>A computer generated randomisation schedule will be generated prior to study commencement that will be used to allocate patients to either the standard chart or customised chart.  Variable block randomisation will be used, as well as stratification by pregnancy risk (low risk and high risk).  Women who are allocated to the obstetric model of care at the first doctor’s visit will be classified as high risk; all others will be low risk.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Adverse fetal growth is strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcome for the fetus and newborn. Close monitoring of fetal growth is an essential component of antenatal care in order to try and reduce the resultant risks associated with adverse growth. It is standard practice to
assess fetal growth by measuring symphyseal fundal height (SFH) at each antenatal visit and assessing the growth in line with a standard non-individualised growth chart. We have
developed a customised growth chart that we hypothesise that when compared to a standard growth chart, reduces the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome through increased detection of adverse growth. Therefore, this study is a single centre, blinded, two-arm, randomised controlled trial to compare the detection rates of adverse growth (both slowed growth and accelerated growth) and adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes when using a customised fetal growth chart compared with a standard growth chart. The study will be run at the Mater Mothers Hospital Antenatal Clinic, with women randomly allocated to receive either the standard chart or customised chart. This chart will then be used throughout pregnancy to plot serial measurements of SFH to monitor fetal growth. We aim to reduce the rate of our
composite perinatal morbidity outcome measure from 10% to 7.5%, which will require randomising 4,010 women. If our study hypothesis is proven, the low cost nature of this tool
allows for the possibility of implementation into developing countries, as well as rural and remote Australian settings, that do not have sophisticated monitoring equipment. By
implementing such a low cost solution to the difficult task of monitoring growth, there are potentially very large human and economic benefits from this research.</summary>
