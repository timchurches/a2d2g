  <interventions>
    <interventions>Chronic disease self management manual and 7 sessions with a Health Coach over a period of 7 weeks (1 face-to-face, 6 weekly telephone calls). The duration of each session will be approximately 30 minutes and will involve supporting the participant to work through the manual, and by answering questions, and discussing the homework exercises.

The structured manual ensures that a comprehensive care plan is devised and the health professional is able to identify and address psychosocial issues. The manual provides key information about disease management and skills training and is designed to facilitate self management.  Using the Whole Person Model, the manual encourages the reader to consider how their body, their thoughts and feelings, and their health behaviours are all interdependent.  It helps people to look at their thinking and learn strategies to improve their mood and make lifestyle changes. </interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis will examine for change over time, with the hypothesis being that participants in the active intervention will improve significantly on the primary outcome measures over the time of the intervention in comparison with the control group, and that this change will be sustained for the follow-up period until 26 weeks.

The main statistical method to be used here will be an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). 

A power analysis has been conducted on the 3 key primary outcome measures; weight, HbA1c and the Depression, Anxiety &amp; Stress Scale (DASS). This analysis was based on the clinically significant changes being sought which include:

1. Mean 4.4.kg reduction (weight)
2. 0.7% reduction (HbA1c) and,
3. 25% reduction in total DASS score, e.g., from 20 to 15.

Power analysis was calculated using GPower. On the basis of this analysis, and assuming a drop out rate of 15% based on prior experience, we estimate that a recruited sample of 180 will be required and sufficient to give the requisite power.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project will evaluate an integrated 'chronic disease self-management' (CDSM) education program for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The program is constructed around a patient manual, the working through of which is facilitated by a trained health coach over a 7 week period. The manual provides key information about disease management and skills training.  Using the "Whole Person Model" the manual encourages the reader to consider how their body, their thoughts and feelings, and their health behaviours all affect each other.  It helps people look at their thinking and learn strategies to improve their mood and make lifestyle changes.

The aim of the proposed project is to evaluate, through a randomised controlled trial, the efficacy of the program.  It is hypothesised that people allocated to the intervention (completion of the program) will demonstrate greater improvements in self efficacy in their disease management, health outcomes, well-being and quality of life than the control group.
