  <interventions>
    <interventions>We will advise and support people with type 2 diabetes to adhere to two physical activity regimens in a crossover design, each regimen lasting two weeks with a one month washout between treatment periods. One regimen is to follow the established Diabetes New Zealand guideline of 30 minutes brisk walking most days.  The other regimen is to undertake three 10-minute walks per day, each walk commencing shortly after breakfast, lunch and dinner. Following the crossover period of the trial, participants will be invited to continue with the post-meal walking for a further three months with continuing support and motivation from the study investigators. The justification for post-meal walking is evidence of a reduction in peak glucose concentrations compared with being sedentary after eating in pre-diabetics, as measured by parameters captured with continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS). The 3-month follow-up will allow for changes in glycated haemoglobin, a longer-term measure of glycaemic control to be assessed, as well as a better understanding of supported environments in disease management. The studys quantitative framework is a valuable opportunity to concurrently assess qualitative impacts on diabetes management and treatment.</interventions>
    <comparator>This is a randomized crossover study in which glycaemic responses will be compared between two walking regimens. The novel intervention, 3 bouts of 10 minutes post-meal walking each day will be compared with the control, 30 minutes of continuous walking per day unattached to an eating period as currently recommended by Diabetes New Zealand.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Postprandial blood glucose area-under-the-curve assessed using a continuous glucose monitoring system providing an interstitial glucose reading every five minutes. The area between the mean overnight blood glucose concentration and the post-meal response curve over three hours will be quantified using the trapezoidal method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Interstitial glucose measurements taken every 5 minutes for a period of 7 days. Post meal 3-h area-under-the-curve will be recorded over the second week of the two 15 day interventions.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycated albumin concentration measured in a blood sample using a proprietary glycated albumin assay kit. There are a number of possible kits; the particular brand is yet to be determined. Precision and accuracy of the assay will be determined according to the manufacturers recommendation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Venous blood concentration of glycated albumin taken at the end of each activity arm</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Glycated haemoglobin concentration measured in a blood sample using a proprietary analyser kit. Precision and accuracy of the test will be measured in accordance with manufacturers recommendations</outcome>
      <timepoint>Venous blood concentration of glycated haemoglobin taken pre- and post- three month activity intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in attitude towards and perception of physical activity guidelines and disease management. The measurement tools will be those validated by the Stanford Patient Education Research Center, USA. Physical activity will be assessed using the short form New Zealand Physical Activity Questionnaire (NZPAQ).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Perception of physical activity guidelines and disease management will be assessed at baseline, after receiving personalised glycaemic data and after a supported 3-month period of post meal walking.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Measures of glycaemic variability assessed using a continuous glucose monitoring system providing an interstitial glucose reading every five minutes. The measures involved are Mean Amplitude of the Glycaemic Excursion (MAGE), Mean Absolute Glucose (MAG), time spent in hyperglycaemia and the mean blood glucose concentration.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Glycaemic variability assessed over the two periods of the different activity regimens. Glycaemic variability will be monitored over 6-days on each activity regimen. Comparisons will be made between the two activity regimens at the end of the crossover period. </timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Fasting insulin concentrations will be measured in a blood sample using a proprietary insulin kit. Precision and accuracy of the test will be measured in accordance with manufacturers recommendations.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Fasting insulin concentrations will be taken at the end of each activity regimen</timepoint>

Allocation to treatment order will be computer-generated so that neither the participant nor the investigator is aware of treatment order at enrolment. ie: the person who determined if a subject was eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware as to whether the person would start on the control or intervention physical activity regimen before swapping over to the alternative. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size was determined by a power calculation at an alpha of 0.05 and power of 0.80 to detect between-intervention differences in the primary outcome variables; a clinically relevant 20% difference in postprandial glycaemia and a 10% difference in glycated albumin. Data will assessed for normal distribution and transformed if necessary. ANOVA will be used to test for differences in glycaemia between treatments</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Practical initiatives that help people with type 2 diabetes achieve better blood sugar control are desperately needed. Persistently high blood sugar leads to oxidative stress and vascular disease. Although 30 minutes of daily physical activity is recommended, it is unclear how the timing of the activity affects blood sugar control. In people without diabetes, gentle walking after a meal substantially reduces the magnitude of blood sugar rises. Our aim is to test the effect of post-meal walking in people with type 2 diabetes using quantitative measures of blood sugar control (glycated haemoglobin, continuous glucose monitors) and compliance with activity advice (accelerometers). Quality of life and the ease with which the advice can be taken up will be assessed. Study findings will be used to inform population guidelines for type 2 diabetes with an emphasis on lessening the impact of disease progression and improving the long-term health of New Zealand adults.</summary>
