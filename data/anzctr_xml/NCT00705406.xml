  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (Kaplan-Meier Estimate) - The primary efficacy endpoint was the time to alleviation of symptoms calculated as the number of hours from initiation of study drug until the start of the time period in which all 7 symptoms of influenza were either absent or present at a level no greater than mild for at least 21.5 (24 hours - 10%) hours. Subjects with missing diary data were excluded and those who did not experience alleviation of symptoms were censored at the last observed symptom assessment.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Information collected twice daily beginning predose on Day 1 and through Day 9, then once daily through Day 14</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Influenza Virus Shedding - Changes from Baseline in log10 TCID50/mL through Days 3, 4, and 9 were presented by treatment group for subjects with positive viral titers at Baseline (log10 TCID50/mL &gt;0.5).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline and Days 3, 4, 9</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>-  Male and non-pregnant female subjects age =18 years.

          -  A positive Influenza A or B Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) performed with a commercially
             available test kit on an adequate anterior nasal specimen, in accordance with the
             manufacturer's instructions. A negative initial RAT should be repeated within one
             hour.

             feverishness within the 24 hours prior to screening will also qualify for enrollment
             in the absence of documented fever at the time of screening.

          -  Presence of at least one constitutional symptom (myalgia [aches and pains], headache,
             feverishness, or fatigue) of at least moderate severity.

          -  Onset of symptoms no more than 36 hours before presentation for screening.

          -  Clinical evidence of worsening of any chronic medical condition (temporally associated
             with the onset of symptoms of influenza) which, in the investigator's opinion,
