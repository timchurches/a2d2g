  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention arm: Surgisis (Registered Trademark) biologic mesh provided by Cook Biotech (Registered Trademark) will be inserted at the time of stoma formation.  

It is not routine to insert mesh around the stoma. Mesh is used to repair parastomal hernias when they occur. This trial is to test whether prophylactic mesh at the time of stoma formation reduces the incidence of parastomal hernia.  The intervention arm will undergo the insertion of biologic mesh placed intra-peritoneally around the stoma. The estimated extra time required to fixate the mesh around the stoma site would be approximately fifteen minutes.   Aside from the procedure of a biologic mesh insertion, all patients in both the control and experimental groups will undergo the same preparation, care, and follow-up post surgery.

    <concealment>The patients who come to Royal Prince Alfred (RPAH) hospital for bowel surgery, which includes the formation of a permanent stoma, ileostomy or colostomy and including ileal or colonic conduits, will be recruited for this study. The consultants involved in the trial are members of the colorectal team of RPAH.  During consultation appointments at surgeonsâ€™ office hours, patients will be informed of the study.  Allocation will be concealed using sealed opaque envelopes.  </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The sample size calculates the minimum number of participants in the control and experimental groups to be analyze whether the null hypothesis will be accepted or rejected.  The literature currently indicates that there is a difference of 30% in rates of parastomal hernia.  Given that this RCT is looking for statistical significance and not clinical significance, and that a more common two-sided test will be conducted, it was determined to use a test power of 80% (alpha equals .05).  The required sample size for the control and experimental groups was calculated to be 38 patients each, and a total of 76 patients to be recruited for this study. 
Patient age, sex, body mass index, details of previous abdominal surgery, and complications with mesh insertion will be recorded and analyzed to provide a overview of patient and operative characteristics related to the biologic mesh. 
For objective (a) all patients will be monitored to evaluate for the development of clinical or radiological parastomal hernia.  Using SPSS software, mean values and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for normally distributed variables, and medians for non-normal data. Other descriptive statistics will be calculated. The fisher exact test and the Mann-Whitney U test will be used to determine statistical significance using a P &lt; 0.05. 
For objective (b) the mesh complication rates, descriptive statistics and rates will be calculated.  These values will be compared with current values recorded in the current literature.  And perhaps a comparison with synthetic mesh rates in the literature will be compared.  
Finally, for objective (c) the cost effectiveness of the biologic mesh compared to no mesh will be calculated.  During the course of data collection, costs associated with the procedure, length of stay, and any subsequent care related to the procedure (including the cost of repairing a hernia post procedure) will be collected.  Subsequently, cost effectiveness will be calculated between control and experimental groups.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Parastomal hernias represent a significant morbidity for patients who require permanent stomas.  Furthermore, they occur in up to 50-80% of these patients, resulting in a significant societal burden.  The use of mesh is now standard surgical practice for the repair of all types of hernias, including parastomal hernias.  However, repairing parastomal hernias can be very complex, and often carry their own complications such as enterotomies, prolonged ileus, recurrence, mesh infections, and fistula formation.  As such, given the high rate of parastomal hernias, there has been increasing interest in using mesh at the time of stoma formation to prevent this complication.

Biologic mesh represents a promising solution to this problem.  Biologic mesh has been shown to be an effective tool in hernia repair, without the infection and erosion complications associated with synthetic permanent meshes.  A single initial study has been promising, demonstrating similarly low hernia rates as with synthetic meshes.  However, questions still remain about whether the added costs associated with expensive biologic meshes can be offset by these potential reductions in patient morbidity. 

This primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using biologic mesh at the time of formation of a permanent stoma in the prevention of parastomal hernias.  The hypothesis is that the Surgisis (Registered Trademark) biologic mesh will reduce rates of parastomal hernia in patients.  Secondary aims of this study include the assessment of any complications arising from this technique, as well as to assess the cost effectiveness of using biologic mesh over the study period.
