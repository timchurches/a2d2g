  <interventions>
    <interventions>The booth will be obvious and located within busy foot traffic venues (Jones, 2009), for example, pharmacies, Work and Income NZ waiting areas, court house waiting areas, health clinic waiting rooms, accident and emergency clinic waiting rooms, social service drop in centres, a midwifery clinic, a health centre waiting room and other areas as suggested by community feedback. The booth will be moved around between sites.  

The Quit Booth will contain a touch screen running a dedicated internet capable application assessing nicotine addiction and treatment need. Information about how to access other forms of cessation services or products will be provided if indicated by the assessment.

The app will be short and intuitive using a character to guide people through the programme. Information entered would be collected and stored on a central computer at the University of Auckland. Information collected will include: current smoking behaviour, recent quitting behaviour; awareness and preference for cessation products and services. A summary of the assessment and suggested treatment options will print out for the user to take away with them, or it can be emailed or sent by text to their mobile phone. Users will be encouraged to immediately connect and register with Quitline.

The booths will be at each location for 1 week. It will take each person approximately 10 minutes to complete the application 

The intervention will start on 01/03/2014 and run for 6 months. </interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tobacco smoking causes at least 15 types of cancer. In order to reduce the prevalence of cancer caused by tobacco smoking we need to increase quitting. We propose that Quit Booths placed in selected communities could reach smokers who are infrequent users of health care and smokers who are not attracted by the current cessation strategies. We aim to investigate if a Quit Booth with a do-it-yourself smoking assessment and referral is effective in increasing quit attempts. </summary>
