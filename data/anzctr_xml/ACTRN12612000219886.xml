  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a two arm, randomised, multi-dose study with an additional open label lead-in for two participants. 

The open label lead-in will involve two participants receiving two experimental drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions of approximately eight hours duration each, using the full dose of 125mg 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with an optional supplemental dose 2.5 hours later of 62.5mg MDMA (cumulative dose 187.5mg, administered as capsules). At the commencement of each experimental session the participant will undergo a urine drug screen and pregnancy test, a psychological assessment and then begin acclimatising to the environment. The MDMA will be administered soon afterwards, approximately 30-60 minutes after the session begins.    

The two drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions will be 3-5 weeks apart and form part of a 12 session treatment over six months, which includes 10 non-drug psychotherapy sessions of 90 minutes duration for preparatory, integrative and follow-up purposes. The session sequence will be as follows.
 
Sessions 1,2,3: Non-drug preparatory psychotherapy.
Session 4: Experimental drug-assisted psychotherapy.
Sessions 5,6,7: Non-drug integrative psychotherapy.
Session 8: Experimental drug-assisted psychotherapy.
Sessions 9,10,11: Non-drug integrative psychotherapy.
Session 12: Non-drug follow-up psychotherapy.

The aim of the open label lead-in is to verify therapist adherence to the psychotherapy manual prior to proceeding with Stage 1.

Stage 1 is double-blinded and will compare 125mg MDMA versus 30mg MDMA active placebo in the remaining 12 participants. The 30mg MDMA active placebo is not expected to provide therapeutic benefits and is aimed at ensuring an effective blind by producing some physiological effects. 

Those randomised to receive the full dose in Stage 1 will receive two drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions and 10 non-drug psychotherapy sessions of exactly the same duration and sequence as those in the lead-in.

Those randomised to receive the active placebo in Stage 1 will receive two drug-assisted (active placebo) psychotherapy sessions using 30mg MDMA with an optional supplemental dose of 15mg MDMA (cumulative dose 45mg) and 10 non-drug psychotherapy sessions. The session duration and the sequence of the 12 sessions will be exactly the same as those in the lead-in.

Stage 2 is an optional treatment for those participants (only) who received the active placebo in Stage 1. After unblinding at the end of Stage 1, eligible participants who choose to complete Stage 2 will undergo an open label full dose treatment involving two drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions and eight non-drug psychotherapy sessions. The session durations will be the same as for the lead-in. The session sequence for Stage 2 is as follows.

Session 1: Non-drug preparatory psychotherapy.
Session 2: Experimental drug-assisted psychotherapy.
Sessions 3,4,5: Non-drug integrative psychotherapy.
Session 6: Experimental drug-assisted psychotherapy.
Sessions 7,8,9: Non-drug integrative psychotherapy.
Session 10: Non-drug follow-up psychotherapy.

All study participants will attend an additional long term follow-up session 12 months after their final experimental drug-assisted session.</interventions>
    <comparator>Drug: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 30mg followed 2.5 hours later by 15mg as a low-level active placebo with no anticipated therapeutic value, administered as capsules in conjunction with manualised psychotherapy. The low-level active placebo is necessary to ensure effective blinding by inducing some physiological effects of the drug in participants. This is not a dose comparison study.

The active placebo will be administered during two drug-assisted psychotherapy sessions which occur as the fourth and eighth sessions in a 12 session treatment. The remaining 10 sessions involve non-drug psychotherapy only.</comparator>

    <concealment>The research staff will determine eligibility and enrol subjects to the study groups. The first two participants will be enrolled in the open-label lead-in and assigned to the full dose condition. The subsequent 12 participants will be enrolled in the randomised Stage 1. The randomised portion of the study will be double-blinded.  An unblinded randomisation monitor will generate the randomisation list. Participants will be assigned participant numbers consecutively, and participants will be randomised in a blinded fashion. Upon enroling a participant, the investigator will be provided with an Enrolment Code for that participant. Randomisation numbers will be pre-printed on the container labels corresponding to doses for individual sessions. The therapists will utilise a web-based randomisation program to obtain the container assignment for each experimental session. Blinded personnel will conduct all study evaluations in the randomised portion of the study until the blind is broken for each participant at the end of Stage 1.</concealment>
