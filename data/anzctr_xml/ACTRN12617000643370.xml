  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants allocated to either low-intensity exercise or high-intensity exercise will complete 6 months of either a low-intensity or high-intensity cycling program consisting of two sessions (~50 minutes per session) per week. All exercise sessions will be completed within a university setting under the guidance of an Exercise Physiologist and other trained staff. The sessions will be completed on a cycle ergometer to allow accurate measurement of workload (Wattage), and radiotelemetric heart rate monitors (Polar 810i, Polar, Finland) will be used to monitor physiological effort. 

The intensity of exercise will be determined using the Borg scale of perceived exertion. This method will alleviate the need to do multiple retests of fitness as individuals will increase effort to maintain perceived exertion with increasing fitness. Individuals in the high-intensity group will complete the six month intervention regimen, attending 2 sessions per week of ~50mins at Murdoch University exercise physiology laboratory. Each session will be comprised of 11 intervals of 1 minute of hard effort cycling (~80-90% aerobic capacity; 18.0 Borg scale) interspersed with 2 minutes of active recovery (30-40% aerobic capacity; 12 Borg scale) with an additional warm-up and cool-down period provided. Participants allocated to the low-intensity group will also complete a six month exercise regimen, attending 2 sessions per week of ~50 mins at Murdoch University exercise physiology laboratory. Each session will be comprised of constant intensity cycling (~50% aerobic capacity; 13.0 Borg scale) and, within their best ability, participants will be encouraged to complete the entire 50 minutes of cycling.

    <comparator>Individuals assigned to the control group will be provided with educational material (in the form of pamphlets designed for the purpose of this study) related to the benefits of diet and exercise with respect to Alzheimers disease; however, these individuals will not receive any exercise technique instruction.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is designed to assess the impact of a six month high- and low-intensity cycle-based exercise intervention on cognitive function, measures of brain volume and connectivity and Alzheimers disease (AD)-related blood biomarkers in a cohort of older adults aged 60 - 80 years. Furthermore, we will assess the impact of genetic predisposition on responses to exercise within this population. The effect of the exercise regimen will be assessed using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to assess cognitive function. To assess the impact of the intervention on AD risk, MRI scans and measurements of blood biomarkers will also be evaluated across the intervention groups.  </summary>
