  <interventions>
    <interventions>The GLAS program will run within the school for 10 weeks (i.e. 1 school term). The Yr6 student leaders will deliver 2 x 30min FMS sessions to students in K-Yr5 for the school term. In order for the Yr6 student leaders to be competent and confident to deliver the 10 week course they will receive the following evidence based components:
1.	1 x 3hr training for Yr6 student leaders. This workshop will be delivered during school sport by the research team. The  workshop will address the following:
a.	Qualities of good leaders: Yr6 student leaders will be provided an overview of transformational leadership and how to demonstrate these qualities to the K-Yr5 students for example being a good role model, being positive and enthusiastic.
b.	Introduction to Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS). This will be a practical session (approx. 1.5hrs) where Yr6 student leaders are taught in small groups by a trained physical education teacher the basic components of 6 movement skills so that they can then deliver this to K-Yr5 students. 
c.	Running simple games and activities. The Yr6 student leaders will be taught by the physical education teacher how to run a 30 minute FMS session with the K-Yr5 students by introducing a warm up, basic skills practice and modified game.
2.	Resources- schools will receive- equipment kits for the FMS sessions which will be taught, activity cards for leaders and handbooks for student leaders
3.	Feedback for peer leaders- 1 and 3 weeks following the training Yr6 student leaders will receive a follow-up visit by the trained physical education teacher, who will observe them deliver a 30min FMS session to the K-Yr5 students and will provide the Yr6 student leaders positive feedback regarding the leadership practice and to problem solve any issues
4.	Booster session (1 x 45 min session)- approx. week 5 of intervention all Yr6 student leaders will be provided another 45 min refresher session overviewing the important points of peer leadership and Fundamental Movement Skills (FMS).
Intervention fidelity and dose will be monitored through direct observation via research team attendance at GLAS sessions, physical education teachers attendance, student attendance sheets for both Yr6 student leaders and the K-Yr5 sessions.

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Schools- Two schools of convenience have been selected (one intervention, one comparison) for the efficacy trial. 

Students- All students in Kinder to Year 6 will be invited to receive the intervention (as it is a whole school program). However. only children in K,1,2 and Yr 6 will be invited to participate in the evaluation of the program.</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>The School Principal will be sent an Information and Consent Letter describing the study. If the School Principal declines the study invitation we will contact another school. Once we have recruited a school, participants will learn about the study through a range of mediums including:
- announcements at school assembly delivered by the research team and 
- classroom announcements delivered by teachers. 
All students in Kindergarten, Grade 1, 2 and 6 at the study schools will be invited into the study by receiving an information sheet and consent letter by the research team at these announcements.
Participants will enter the study voluntarily. This will be explained to students, teachers and parents at the school and classroom announcements. Consent will be sought from both parent and child if interested to participate.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Competency in a range of movement skills (e.g. kicking, running, throwing) provides the foundation for an active lifestyle and developing leadership skills is important for children of all ages. It may also serve as a protective factor against the decline in physical activity typically observed during adolescence. Our proposed project will evaluate the impact of the Peer Leadership Program for Grade 6 students and on the movement skill competency and physical activity levels of students in Kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2. 
Our aim is to recruit two primary schools with 40-60 Grade 6 students, approximately 180 Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2 students. 
Schools who agree to participate will be allocated to receive the Peer Leadership program in Term 1, week 10, 2015 or Term 3, week 1, 2015.
Members of the research team will deliver the 3-hour Peer Leadership Program during school sport time, which will provide Grade 6 students with the skills to run physical activity sessions during timetabled physical education, lunch and recess for kindergarten, Grade 1 and 2 students. 
The study will be evaluated over a 10-week period and students in BOTH groups will complete evaluation measures at baseline (before the program begins) and 10-weeks (post program).
