Treatment: drugs - SAN021 Placebo

Experimental: SAN021 Serum - SAN021 is a serum containing 10% East Indian Sandalwood Oil. It is packaged in an amber glass bottle with a dropper top. The dose is 5 drops per 1% BSA involvement twice daily.

Placebo Comparator: SAN021 Placebo - SAN021 Placebo is a serum that does not contain East Indian Sandalwood Oil however, does contain a synthetic sandalwood fragrance. It is packaged in an amber glass bottle with a dropper top. The dose is 5 drops per 1% BSA involvement twice daily.
