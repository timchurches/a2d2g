  <interventions>
    <interventions>After baseline testing (including fitness, strength and functional tests, fasting blood test, body composition and muscle biopsy) participants will be randomly allocated to 10 weeks of weight training.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The weight-training group will train 3 days a week. In the first two weeks of training the number of repetitions will be 15-20 (40-50% of one repetition maximum(1RM)) then for four weeks the number of repetitions will be 12-15 (65-75% 1RM) and finally in the last four weeks the number of repetitions will be 8-12 (80-85% 1RM).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a condition characterised by over-weight, poor blood sugar control and high blood pressure. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of weight training on muscle mass and strength, blood sugar and cholesterol levels, body composition, functional capacity (energy for daily living), some important measures of cardiovascular health, and quality of life in people who live with metabolic syndrome. To enhance the scientific validity of the study, we will also make the same measurements in healthy people (normal weight). The main predicted outcome is that strength training will improve muscle function (eg the muscle may dispose of sugar more efficiently), strength and the ability to carry out daily activities. All of this should reduce your risk from future cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and improve your health and sense of well-being. Volunteer will be separated into two groups. One group (called the training group) will perform a resistance-training program and the other group (the control group) will continue their normal daily activities. The control group is essential for the study in order to determine if changes - provided they occur- in the training group are due to the resistance training itself. The separation into groups will be done randomly after initial testing.</summary>
