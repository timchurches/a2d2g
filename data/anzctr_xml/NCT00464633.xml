    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - alvocidib

Experimental: Alvocidib - Cycles with 4-week treatment with alvocidib followed by 2-week rest period for up to a maximum of 6 cycles


Treatment: drugs: alvocidib
1st dose: 30 mg/m2 as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion followed by 30 mg/m2 as a 4-hour continuous infusion
Then, every treatment week, depending upon the patient's objective response to initial therapy:
30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes followed by 50 mg/m2 over 4 hours or
30 mg/m2 over 30 minutes followed by 30 mg/m2 over 4 hours.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Best overall objective response rate - Objective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with complete response or partial response (including nodular partial response) relative to the total number of participants.
Response assessment is based on evaluation of nodal disease by Computerized Tomography (CT) and National Cancer Institute Working Group 96 criteria (NCI-96) for assessment of liver, spleen, constitutional symptoms, peripheral blood (±) bone marrow.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to a maximum of 6 cycles</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Progression-free survival - Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the date of first administration of study drug to the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to a maximum of 6 cycles</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Duration of objective response - Duration of objective response is defined from the time of first occurrence of complete response or partial response (including nodular partial response) to the first documentation of progressive disease or death due to any cause in the absence of previous documentation of objective progression.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Up to a maximum of 6 cycles</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Overall survival - Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of first administration of study drug to death.</outcome>

    <summary>Multicenter, open-label, study of alvocidib in previously treated chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia patients.

      Primary objective is to determine overall response rate.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  to assess overall safety,

        -  to assess duration of response, progression free survival, and overall survival.

      Clinical benefit and pharmacokinetics parameters are also evaluated.</summary>
