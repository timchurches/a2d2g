  <interventions>
    <interventions>	Therapeutic exercise plus manual therapy with movement and tape and a home exercise programme
  Attendance for 4 treatment sessions each approximately 45 minutes once per week for 4 weeks. The manual therapy technique is a Mulligan's Mobilisation with Movement(MWM) to the glenohumeral joint 10 repetitions x  3 sets. 
Exercises are to be performed twice daily.They are individually prescribed including numbers of repetitions and resistance ( free weights or theraband) for each exercise They include progressive exercises for the scapular stabilisers - lower traps and serratus anterior and progressive strengthening for the rotator cuff muscles. Compliance is monitored by asking the patient to rate compliance on a percentage basis - total compliance, 90-75%, 74-50%, 49-25% and &lt; 25% between each of the 4 weekly treatment sessions. 
Two layers of tape are applied (Fixomull and rigid tape) immediately following the Mobilisation with Movement (MWM) application at each of the 4 treatment sessions to clean dry skin. This is applied by the same treating physiotherapist from the anterior humeral head over the GHJ diagonally across the scapula to the level of T7. The patient is asked to leave the tape on for 24 hours unless there is any adverse reaction to the tape such as burning or itching. In this case they are asked to remove the tape immediately and note the length of time the tape was in place.</interventions>
    <comparator>Therapeutic exercise plus a home exercise programme individually prescribed as per the intervention group Attendance is also for 30 -45 minutes for each of 4 weeks.

The same treating physiotherapist prescribes an individualized programme targeting the scapular stabilizers and rotator cuff muscles. Compliance is monitored as per the Mobilisation with Movement (MWM)and tape group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this research is to investigate the optimal conservative approach to the treatment of patients with shoulder pain. There is evidence to demonstrate that exercise alone is better than a wait and see approach and also that one treatment session of a specific manual therapy and tape improves movement in people with shoulder pain.
It is hoped that information gathered from this project will help to contribute to knowledge of an optimal conservative treatment approach to shoulder pain that limits a persons ability to carry out many activities of daily living and to participate in work and sport.
