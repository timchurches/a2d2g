  <interventions>
    <interventions>Muscle tissue of the vastus lateralis, synovial fluid from the knee joint, synovium and blood will be collected from people with severe knee osteoarthritis during their knee replacement surgery.
Knee replacement surgery is a surgical procedure in which the severely damaged knee joint is replaced with an artificial joint.

</interventions>
    <comparator>Asymptomatic age matched controls

For the control group only muscle tissue and blood will be sampled. 
The muscle from the 20 aged- and BMI-matched asymptomatic individuals (control group) will be collected by needle biopsy (under local anaesthetic).

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Inflammatory markers in the muscle
The muscle tissue will be separated into a fraction that will be mounted for IHC analysis (presence of inflammatory cells), protein analysis (analysis of inflammatory factors, including cytokines and chemokines; extracellular matrix proteins and intra-muscular stress pathways.
Specific markers of muscle atrophy and inflammation including mRNA abundance for pro-inflammatory and catabolic cytokines genes encoding proteins linked to atrogenesis will be assessed using standard real time RT-PCR and western blotting techniques</outcome>

      <outcome>Gait - 
Qualitative gait analysis will include the use of three dimenational (3D) motion analysis system (VICON, Oxford Metrics). </outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Muscle strength and function

Quadriceps stregnth. Strength will be measured using a portable purposely built non-extendable strain gauge (load cell).  The participant will exert maximal force against the strap assembly for 3 s. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cross sectional design - assessment at one point only: prior knee replacement surgery</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Pain and function.
The physical function, pain and stiffness will be assessed using, Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), a self administered questionnaire. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Cross sectional design- assessment will be done at one point time only prior knee replacement surgery</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Individual variables will be compared between groups with a one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with appropriate post hoc multiple comparison. Pearsons correlation coefficient will be used to investigate the relationship between pain, function and gait and muscle waste factors.

Power calculation - 
Power and Precision software have been used to calculate the estimated sample size based on our preliminary work *. We have reported a significantly higher level of the inflammatory marker JNK1 in the knee osteoarthritis group compared to the aged-matched control group. Using JNK1 in our power calculation,  20 participants in each group is sufficient for a power of 80% and alpha=0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>People with knee osteoarthritis (OA) often have leg muscle weakness and difficulty moving and walking. Impaired muscular performance is a major determinant of daily function and disability. However,  it is not known if loss of muscle mass and strength in knee OA occurs as an indirect result of reduced limb use, or if muscle itself is a direct target of the degenerative processes active in OA. Given that personal mobility is an essential factor for healthy independent living of those who suffer from this chronic degenerative condition, research into the preservation of muscle mass is essential for developing successful therapy to restore and maintain effective limb use.
In this study we aim to determine the effect of muscle inflammation on muscle function and impaired walking pattern relative to OA joint degeneration. </summary>
