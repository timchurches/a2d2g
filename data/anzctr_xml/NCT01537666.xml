  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety and Tolerability - Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs = Adverse Events That Started During or After the First Dose of Study Drug) - Each participant was monitored regularly for Adverse Events (AEs) throughout the study. The Investigator or designee enquired about AEs by asking participants non-leading questions such as: "How do you feel?" or "Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/assessment?" Additionally, several safety procedures (physical examinations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs, and spirometry) were conducted on participants at regular intervals. All AEs reported spontaneously by participants or in response to questioning or observation by the Investigator, including those related to safety procedures, were recorded. For each AE, the Investigator recorded the following assessments: seriousness, severity (Mild, Moderate, or Severe), and relationship to study drug (Not Related, Remote, Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable). AEs were considered drug-related if given a relationship of Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable.</outcome>
