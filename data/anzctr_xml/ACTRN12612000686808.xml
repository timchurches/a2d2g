  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is an observational study. Children attended one appointment where various data collection measures were made, including details of gross motor functional ability, motor type and distribution of cerebral palsy, anthropometric measures, total energy expenditure, body composition measures, dietary intake and a clinical feeding evaluation. This appointment lasted approximately 1.5 - 2 hours. Children and parents completed additional data collection at home for total energy expenditure and dietary intake outcomes for the 10 days following the appointment.
This is a subset of a larger project investigating the growth, nutrition and physical activity of preschool aged chidlren with cerebral palsy (ACTRN 12611000616976).</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome 1: Differences in total energy expenditure measurements and energy requirements between children with cerebral palsy and typically developing children. This was assessed via an isotope dilution technique, in particular the doubly labelled water method.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 1: cross-sectional, variables measured at appointment time and for the 10 days following the appointment.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Seconday outcome 1: Differences in body composition according to gross motor functional ability in the children with cerebral palsy and in comparison to typically developing children. Body composition was measured via isotope dilution techniques, either deuterim dilution or the doubly labelled water method. Gross motor functional ability was determined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Timepoint 1: cross-sectional, variables measured at appointment time and for the 10 days following the appointment.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcome 2: Relationships between energy intake, macronutrient intake and body composition according to gross motor functional ability in children with cerebral palsy and in comparison to typically developing children. Energy intake and macronutrient intake were determined from a three-day weighed food record kept by parents for their child. Body composition was measured via isotope dilution techniques, either deuterim dilution or the doubly labelled water method. Gross motor functional ability was determined using the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS).</outcome>
