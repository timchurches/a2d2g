    <statisticalmethods>One of the primary dependent variables of interest is cerebral blood flow regulation. The sample size estimate was based on published (Aamand et al 2013; 2014; Presley et al 2011) and unpublished pilot data, which has assessed the effects of dietary nitrate on cerebrovascular function. These were used to estimate a physiologically relevant improvement in cerebrovascular function of 16% between the two randomized groups. Assuming that dietary nitrate supplementation can improve cerebrovascular function by a similar extent, 17 TIA patients per group (34 TIA patients total) and 17 healthy controls would provide &gt; 80% power to detect a moderate effect size that corresponds to a ~100% difference between treatment and placebo interventions, assuming a standard deviation of 0.65%/mmHg at a two-tailed significance level of 0.05.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in many countries, causing both physical and cognitive problems.  Patients who have recently suffered a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) event are particularly at risk of stroke.  This study will investigate if a nitrate supplement can improve cerebrovascular health and enhance recovery from a TIA event, possibly lower risk factors which may lead to a later stroke.  In human studies, dietary nitrate supplementation has been shown to lower blood pressure.  Since high blood pressure is one of the main causes of stroke, dietary nitrate supplementation may reduce the risk of stroke in patients with TIA.  Improving our understanding of the impact of the dietary supplementation on the cerebrovascular health of TIA patients would be an important step towards finding better treatments for TIA patients in New Zealand and elsewhere.
We will test the hypothesis that dietary nitrate supplementation improves cerebrovascular health and blood pressure regulation in patients with TIA.</summary>
