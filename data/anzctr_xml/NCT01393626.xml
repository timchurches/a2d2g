    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants in Clinical Remission (as Defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] Score of Less Than [&lt;] 150 Points) at Week 8 - Clinical remission was a CDAI &lt; 150 points. CDAI is a composite index consisting of a weighted scoring of 8 disease variables: number of liquid or very soft stools, extent of abdominal pain, general well-being, occurrence of extra-intestinal symptoms, need for antidiarrheal drugs, presence of abdominal masses, hematocrit, and body weight. CDAI score was based partly on entries (7 days before evaluation) from participant's diary kept while on study. CDAI scores range from 0 to approximately 600, higher score indicates higher disease activity.
The 15 mg BID treatment group was closed to further enrolment early on in the study by Protocol Amendment 5 after only 16 participants were enrolled into this group. Therefore, the efficacy analysis was not performed for this group because the results may be difficult to interpret due to the small sample size.</outcome>

      <outcome>Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) Total Score and Domain Scores (Bowel Function, Emotional Status, Systemic Symptoms, and Social Function) at Baseline and Week 8/ET Visit - The IBDQ is a psychometrically validated patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument for measuring disease-specific quality of life (QOL) in participants with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBDQ consists of 32 items, each item score ranged from 1 (worst possible response) to 7 (best possible response). The 32 items are grouped into 4 domains: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms and social function. The 4 domains are scored as follows: bowel symptoms 10 to 70; systemic symptoms 5 to 35; emotional function 12 to 84; social function 5 to 35. For each domain, a higher score indicates better QOL. Total score is the sum of each item score, and ranged from 32 to 224 with a higher score indicating a better QOL. Positive change in total score indicated improvement in QOL.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline IBDQ Total Score and Domain Scores (Bowel Function, Emotional Status, Systemic Symptoms, and Social Function) at Week 8/ET Visit Using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) - IBDQ is a validated PRO instrument for measuring QOL in IBD consisting of 32 items scored from 1 (worst response) to 7 (best response). 32 items are grouped into 4 domains scored as follows: bowel symptoms 10 - 70; systemic symptoms 5 - 35; emotional function 12 - 84; social function 5 - 35. For each domain, higher score indicates better QOL. Total score is the sum of each item score, &amp; ranged from 32 to 224 with a higher score indicating better QOL. Positive change in total score indicated improvement in QOL.
Adjusted means were derived from an ANCOVA model with baseline value as covariate, treatment group &amp; prior use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (a) treatments as factors.
The 15 mg BID treatment group was closed to further enrolment early in the study by Protocol Amendment 5 after only 16 participants were enrolled in this group. Therefore, the efficacy analysis was not performed for this group as the results may be difficult to interpret due to the small sample size.</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants With a Response to the Patient-Reported Treatment Impact Assessment (PRTI) at Week 8/ET Visit by Category - The IBD Patient Reported Treatment Impact Modified (PRTI) questionnaire comprises 3 individual questions administered to the participant: participant satisfaction with study treatment; participant preference for study drug over prior treatment (this question on participant preference for study drug is prefaced by a simple question of previous treatment/s for IBD received in order to place the preference question into context) and participant willingness to re-use the study treatment again. Each of these questions (except the question on previous treatment, which is informational only) is scored on a 5 point Likert scale. PSA = Patient Satisfaction Assessment; PPTA = Patient Previous Treatment Assessment; PPA = Patient Preference Assessment; PWA = Patient Willingness Assessment.</outcome>

      <outcome>EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) Utility Scores at Baseline and Week 8/ET Visit - EQ-5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related QoL in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range from -0.594 to 1.000; a higher score indicates a better health state.</outcome>
