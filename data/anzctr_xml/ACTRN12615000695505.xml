  <interventions>
    <interventions>This research will use a single case experimental design with multiple baselines across behaviours and participants. Each child will participate in initial baseline data collection, 3 weeks of individualized and targeted one-on-one treatment using the Kaufman Speech to Language protocol (K-SLP), followed by post treatment maintenance follow up. Initial baselines will comprise of between 3-5 data points randomly assigned to participants to allow for stability in measurement and to determine any clear visual trends before commencement of treatment, and to ensure stable speech production. The data to be collected includes the participants production of a predetermined and individualised set of words: including treated words (words that are used during the treatment session), control words (words that are untreated and do not have the same features as treatment words) and foil words (have similar features as the treated words but are untreated).  This phase will be conducted in the clinic. 

Treatment phase: During the treatment phase, a trained clinician (speech pathologist/trained speech pathology student) will administer treatment as per the K-SLP protocol in the clinic for 60 minutes per day 4 times/week for 3 weeks. Treatment will consist of 20 preselected treatment words. The selection of these words will be based on the chosen sounds or word features that will be the target of the treatment for each client. This will be determined based on the initial pre-test diagnostic assessments. Additionally there will be untreated words- 20 foil words, 20 control words that will have similar features or sounds as the treatment words. Additional data points will be collected every 4th treatment session using the predetermined individualised word lists comprised of words that are part of the participants treatment set, and words that are not treated.  Final post-treatment assessments will be conducted at 1-week post treatment, 2 weeks and 3 months post treatment.

    <statisticalmethods>This research will use a single case experimental design with multiple baselines across behaviours and participants (Byiers, Reichle, &amp; Symons, 2012; Kratochwill &amp; Levin, 2010; ). This will enable a reduplication of the basic ABA phase single subject design to allow for greater internal and external validity (Byiers et al., 2012; McReynolds &amp; Thompson).  According to Tate et al., 2013, at least 3 replications of the single case experimental design is desirable for greater internal and external validity.  This research will be replicated across 8 participants.  </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Kaufman Speech to Language Protocol in improving the accuracy of words in children with CAS.  The hypothesis is that the implementation of the K-SLP approach for CAS will result in more accurate speech production in target words than no treatment.
