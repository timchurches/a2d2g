  <interventions>
    <interventions>Insertion of the ARIA Emphysema Treatment System (ETS) will occur during an approximate 60 minute thoracic surgery procedure. The ARIA ETS, which is a device that is secured in the lung and vents via a tube to the outside of the chest will remain implanted in the patient's chest for the duration of the trial (12months from implantation of device). The premise of the technology is that it reduces hyperinflation of the lung which leads to emphysematous symptoms.  Implantation of the device, ongoing assessment and follow up will be performed in an accredited hospital providing tertiary thoracic surgery and respiratory medicine services.  Tests required to participate in the study will include CT Scan, Respiratory Function Testing, Exercise Testing (Cycle and 6 Minute Walk Test), Blood tests and intermittent bronchoscopies via the ARIA ETS system.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be determined by the incidence of any serious adverse events reported either by the patient or observed by the investigator, relating to the procedure or to the device itself either perioperatively or in the follow-up period as determined by the Independent Medical Monitor. Adverse events that will be assessed may include (but not be limited to) exacerbations of COPD, device related events including pneumothorax and surgical emphysema (leakage of air into the chest cavity or under the skin) , bleeding from the chest wall or lung around the implant insertion site.  These events will be assessed by clinical examination and may also include tests such as X-rays, CT scans and routine blood tests.  All adverse events will be documented. </outcome>
