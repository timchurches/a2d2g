  <interventions>
    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Treatment: drugs - Everolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Treatment: drugs - Everolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Treatment: drugs - Tacrolimus (tacrolimus control)
Treatment: drugs - Corticosteroids

Experimental: Everolimus + reduced tacrolimus - Participants were maintained on whole blood trough levels of 3 - 8 ng/mL everolimus and 3 - 5 ng/mL tacrolimus.

Experimental: Tacrolimus elimination - Participants were maintained on a whole blood trough level of 6 - 10 ng/mL everolimus.

Active Comparator: Tacrolimus control - Participants were maintained on a whole blood trough level of 6 - 10 ng/mL tacrolimus.


Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
After everolimus whole blood trough levels were confirmed to be in the target range of 3-8 ng/mL, tacrolimus tapering began, achieving a target tacrolimus whole blood trough level of 3-5 ng/mL by 3 weeks after randomization, a level which was maintained for the duration of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Everolimus (reduced tacrolimus)
Everolimus was started within 24 hours of randomization at a dose of 1.0 mg twice a day (bid, 2 mg daily dose). The dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 3-8 ng/mL for the duration of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
After everolimus whole blood trough levels were confirmed to be in the target range of 3-8 ng/mL, tacrolimus tapering began, achieving a target tacrolimus whole blood trough level of 3-5 ng/mL by 3 weeks after randomization. Tacrolimus elimination was started beginning at Month 4. Tacrolimus was tapered after everolimus whole blood trough levels were within the target range of 6-10 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was completely eliminated by the end of Month 4.

Treatment: drugs: Everolimus (tacrolimus elimination)
Everolimus was started within 24 hours of randomization at a dose of 1.0 mg twice a day (bid, 2 mg daily dose). The dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 3-8 ng/mL until Month 4; beginning with Month 4, the dose was adjusted to maintain everolimus trough blood levels between 6-10 ng/mL.

Treatment: drugs: Tacrolimus (tacrolimus control)
Tacrolimus trough levels were targeted to be maintained at 8-12 ng/mL until Month 4. At Month 4, tacrolimus whole blood trough levels were decreased to a target trough level of 6-10 ng/mL for the remainder of the study.

Treatment: drugs: Corticosteroids
For patients in all groups, corticosteroids were initiated at or prior to the time of transplantation according to local practice. Corticosteroids could be used for the duration of the study but could not be eliminated before Month 6. The corticosteroids were not specified in the protocol because they were adminsitered to the participants according to local practice as part of standard of care.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Incidence Rate of Composite Efficacy Failure Defined as Treated Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (tBPAR ), Graft Loss or Death - The number of participants who experienced composite efficacy failure was analyzed. Composite efficacy failure was defined as treated biopsy proven acute rejection (tBPAR), graft loss, or death. A BPAR was defined as an acute rejection confirmed by biopsy with a Rejection Activity Index (RAI) score = 3. tBPAR was defined as a BPAR which was treated with anti-rejection therapy. The RAI is used to score liver biopsies with acute rejection and is composed of 3 categories (portal inflammation, bile duct inflammation damage, and venous endothelial inflammation) each scored on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) by a trained pathologist. The total RAI score = the sum of the scores of the 3 categories and ranges from 0 to 9, with a higher score indicating greater rejection. The graft was presumed to be lost on the day the patient was newly listed for a liver graft, received a graft re-transplant, or died.</outcome>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change in Renal Function - Change in renal function was assessed by the estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) using the abbreviated (4 variables) Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD-4) formula which was developed by the MDRD Study Group and has been validated in patients with chronic kidney disease. The MDRD-4 formula used for the eGFR calculation is: eGFR (mL/min/1.73m^2) = 186.3*(C^-1.154)*(A^-0.203)*G*R, where C is the serum concentration of creatinine (mg/dL), A is age (years), G=0.742 when gender is female, otherwise G=1, R=1.21 when race is black, otherwise R=1.</outcome>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The reason for this extension is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of two
      concentration-controlled everolimus regimen in de novo liver transplant recipients. The most
      important long-term safety assessments include evaluation of renal function, progression of
      HCV related allograft fibrosis, and other treatment related effects at Month 36
      post-transplantation compared to extension baseline (Months 24 post-transplantation).</summary>
