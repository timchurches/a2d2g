  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observational study on the frequency and severity of chemotherapy induced oral mucositis manifestations in a cohort of patients with colorectal cancer treated with a fluorouracil plus folinic acid chemotherapy, during the whole chemotherapy protocol, i.e. 7 months. Chemotherapy induced oral mucositis is characterized by a range of symptoms varying from mild burning sensation up to extensive ulcerations that preclude patients from feeding and drinking, demanding hospitalization. The patients to be included in this study will be seen at an ambulatory environment of a specialized oncology center, already submitted to surgical treatment of their colon adenocarcinoma and driven to chemotherapy intervention.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Occurrence and frequency of oral mucositis in all chemotherapy cycles applied to the patient's cohort followed in the trial, to be assessed through clinical examination carried out by a health professional and visual analogue scales to evaluate symptoms like xerostomia and pain.</outcome>
      <timepoint>One time a month, after the chemotherapy infusion period, i.e., all patients will be examined a week after the chemotherapy infusion which takes five consecutive days in a week. The chemotherapy protocol extends through six months with one infusion week per month. Patients will be followed through seven months and will be examined once a month.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Influence of medical condition over oral mucositis manifestation. This aspect will be evaluated according to data recovered at patients clinical evaluation and the frequency and severity of oral mucositis manifestations in each cycle.</outcome>
      <timepoint>one time a month, after the chemotherapy infusion period, assessed through a clinical evaluation performed by a health professional. Chemotherapy protocol applied in this study takes six months with one infusion week per month. Patients will be followed through seven months with at least one examination per month.</timepoint>
