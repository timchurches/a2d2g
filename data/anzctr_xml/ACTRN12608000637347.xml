  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the multi-modality group will receive a 6-week programme of 30 minutes of passive standing on a tilt table plus electrical stimulation to the ankle dorsiflexors while on the tilt table, and 12 hours of ankle splinting per day, 5 times per week. Electrical stimulation will be applied using the Neuro Trac Sports stimulation unit at a frequency of 50hz. The amplitude will be set at a level to produce maximum muscle contractions within the participants' tolerance. Electrical stimulation will not be used on participants who have contraindications (ie., rate controlled cardiac pacemaker and broken skin) or are unable to tolerate even the smallest amount of simulation. Commercially available splint (Formit) will be used to splint ankles. The ankles will be splinted in maximum tolerable dorsiflexion. The splints will generally be worn at night however this can be varied to minimise interference with hygiene and therapy. Different splints can be used if there are problems with the Formit and care sill be taken to ensure that they provide adequate stretch.</interventions>

    <concealment>Potential participants who fit the eligibility criteria or the persons repsonsible for them will be given the Participant Information Sheets. An investigator will explain the study protocol to them. No pressure to participate will be placed on them under any circumstances. They will be informed that participation in the study is entirely voluntary and they are free to withdraw from the study at any stage without any effect on their current and future treatment. Those who agree to participate will be given the Consent Forms to sign and participate in the study. 
Participants will be randomly allocated to one of two groups: splinting plus tilt table standing and electrical stimulation (experimental) and tilt table standing only (control). The allocation sequence is computer generated by a person not involved in recruitment and concealed using consecutively numbered, sealed and opaque envelopes. The envelopes will be kept off-site in a centralised registry and only opened by a person not involved in the study after the participants have completed all initial assessments.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The primary objective of the project is to determine the benefit of using multiple physical modalities for treating and preventing contracture in adults with traumatic brain injury. An assessor blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled study will be conducted. In this study, the ankle is selected as a model to asess if a multi-modality programme (tilt table standing combined with ankle splinting and electrical stimulation) is more effective than usual care (tilt table standing alone). The participants are people with traumatic brain injury admitted to the brain injury rehabilitation units of the Royal Rehabilitation Centre Sydney, Liverpool Hospital and Westmead Hospital.</summary>
