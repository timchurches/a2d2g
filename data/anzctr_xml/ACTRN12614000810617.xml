  <interventions>
    <interventions>Phase I
1. Dose level 1
Azacitidine 60 mg/m2 (SC) D1-5 and 8-9 and Ponatinib (Oral) 30mg daily on days 5-25 (6 patients)
Each cycle will be 28 days in length. Continue until DLT, treatment failure or death.
-If there is no Ponatinib dose interruption or reduction for toxicity during cycle 1, the Ponatinib dose should be increased to 45mg in subsequent cycles if Complete Remission (CR) has not been achieved.

If dose level 1 tolerable (as assessed by the trial management committee) the next cohort opened will be Dose level 2. If dose level 1 is not tolerable, the next cohort to be opened will be Dose level -1.

2. Dose level 2
Azacitidine 75 mg/m2 D1-5 and 8-9 and ponatinib 30mg daily on days 5-25 (6 patients)
Each cycle will be 28 days in length. Continue until DLT, treatment failure or death.
-If there is no Ponatinib dose interruption or reduction for toxicity during cycle 1, the Ponatinib dose should be increased to 45mg in subsequent cycles if Complete Remission (CR) has not been achieved.

3. Dose level -1
Azacitidine 50mg/m2 days 1-5 and Ponatinib 30mg daily on days 5-25 (6 patients)
Each cycle will be 28 days in length. Continue until DLT, treatment failure or death.
-If there is no Ponatinib dose interruption or reduction for toxicity during cycle 1, the Ponatinib dose should be increased to 45mg in subsequent cycles if Complete Remission (CR) has not been achieved.

Phase II (randomisation phase)
1.	Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either
-Ponatinib 30 mg daily (24 Patients)
-Recommended phase II dose of Azacitidine (obtained from phase I) and Ponatinib 30 mg D5-25 (24 Patients)
- Each cycle will be 28 days in length. Continue until DLT, treatment failure or death.
-If there is no Ponatinib dose interruption or reduction for toxicity during cycle 1, the Ponatinib dose should be increased to 45mg in subsequent cycles if Complete Remission (CR) has not been achieved.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is evaluating Ponatinib in combination with 5-Azacitidine in patients with FLT3- ITD positive acute myeloid leukaemia.

Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are aged over 18 years, have enrolled in the ALLG National Blood Cancer Registry, have FLT3-ITD AML (except Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia) failing prior chemotherapy or are considered unfit for frontline intensive chemotherapy. You must have adequate liver function (unless due to Gilberts syndrome), adequate pancreatic function, and adequate kidney function. The full details of this study's inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the relevant sections within this record.

Trial details: This study has two parts: 
Phase Ib involves finding the best dose of Azacitidine to combine with Ponatinib in terms of patient tolerability and safety. The first group of patients enrolled will be treated with 60 mg/m2 of Azacitidine on days 1 -5 &amp; 8  9 and 30 mg of Ponatinib on days 5  25 of a 28 day cycle. If complete remission of AML is not achieved in the first cycle and no dose reductions for Ponatinib toxicity has occurred Ponatinib should be increased to 45 mg in subsequent cycles. The response to the treatment and adverse events will be assessed by the Trial Management Committee after 6 patients have been evaluated, subsequent patients will be recruited to receive either a higher (75 mg/m2 on days 1  5 &amp; 8  9 on a 28 day cycle) or lower dose Azacitidine (50 mg/m2 on days 1  5 on a 28 day cycle) depending on the response. Both groups would also receive 30 mg of Ponatinib on days 5  25 of a 28 day cycle. If complete remission of AML is not achieved in the first cycle and no dose reductions for Ponatinib toxicity has occurred Ponatinib should be increased to 45 mg in subsequent cycles. The response to the treatment and adverse events of both groups will be assessed by the Trial Management Committee to determine a recommended phase II dose. All patients will then receive repeating 28 day cycles of daily oral Ponatinib and Azacitadine injections as long as the therapy continues to fight their leukaemia. Response to the treatment will be assessed at routine clinical visits with the usual clinical investigations that would monitor the status of your disease.

In Phase II of the study, patients will be randomly (by chance) assigned to 2 groups; one group will receive Ponatinib alone (30 mg per day), and the other group will receive the combination of Azacitidine and Ponatinib (dose determined from Phase Ib). This is to see which treatment works the best and whether combining the treatments gives any benefit for people with AML. All patients will then receive repeating 28 day cycles of daily oral Ponatinib and Azacitadine injections as long as the therapy continues to fight their leukaemia. Response to the treatment will be assessed at routine clinical visits with the usual clinical investigations that would monitor the status of your disease.</summary>
