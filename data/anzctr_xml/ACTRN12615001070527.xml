  <interventions>
    <interventions>Observation study of elderly patients (60 years and older) undergoing healthcare interventions requiring surgery and anaesthesia. Patients will undergo baseline and 3 month neuropsychological testing prior to and following surgery. The two neuropsychological tests take roughly one hour and are completed at the patient's home. During the hospital stay patients will have blood samples taken prior to anaesthetic induction, at 30 minutes post surgical incision and also at 6, 24 and 48 hours following surgery. Blood samples will be analysed for inflammatory markers.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Identify association between high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) at baseline and the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction as measured by a neuropsychological test battery at 3 months following surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Neuropsychological testing at baseline (prior to surgery) and 3 months postoperatively will be undertaken at the patient's home. Blood samples will be taken prior to anaesthetic induction as a baseline measurement and again at 30 minutes following surgical incision and at 6, 24 and 48 hours following surgery. </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To identify associations between fluctuating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to anaesthesia and surgery and postoperative delirium up to 5 days following surgery.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Blood samples will be taken prior to anaesthetic induction as a baseline measurement and again at 30 minutes following surgical incision and at 6, 24 and 48 hours following surgery. Postoperative delirium will be assessed twice daily up to 5 days follow surgery or until discharge. Delirium assessments will be conducted by trained research staff using the 3 minute Diagnostic Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM).</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>From pilot data (vide supra,), we based power calculations on a difference in mean (SD) of those patients with cognitive impairment at 3 months of 3.65 (4.25) pg/mL, and without cognitive impairment at 3 months of 1.71 (0.53) pg/mL. Assuming a power of 80% and alpha = 0.05, we would require 39 patients in each group to detect a significant difference in the level of IL-6 between those with cognitive impairment at 3 months and those without. Allowing for a loss to follow-up (all cause) of 15%, we plan to recruit 90 patients over 18 months.
A logistic regression model will be used to detect risk factors and predictors, particularly the levels of inflammatory markers including IL-6, TNF-a, for cognitive outcome to 3 months. Additionally, multivariable analyses will be performed to look at pertinent risk factors for postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction including inflammatory markers in blood, peri-operative morbidities and demographics.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate if, following anaesthesia related healthcare inteventions, individuals with higher levels of inflammation at baseline, have a higher rate of postoperative cognitive dysfunction at 3 months after surgery. Participants will be having surgery with an expected stay of 3 or more days and consent to neuropsychological testing and having bloods taken during their hospital stay. Cognitive and memory testing will take place prior to surgery and at 3 months after surgery. Tests for delirium will also be conducted during the participants time in hospital.</summary>
