    <interventions>One-off remediation of certain home fall hazards identified by a home hazard inspection protocol, the Healthy Housing Index. Hazards (such as steps without handrails) are remediated (e.g., by installing a handrail) at the start of the trial for the treatment group.</interventions>

After the treatment group has received the home hazard remediations and approximately three years has passed to allow an assessment of home injury rates, home fall hazards are remediated for the controls.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are 600,000 people injured at home annually, including over 5,000 serious falls resulting in hospitalisation. This research uses a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 1,000 households in Taranaki. Our pilot study indicated that fixing fall hazards will reduce injury rates. The stage is now set for a highly effective RCT. We have developed strong community relationships, leading to excellent cooperation rates and high quality baseline injury and health data. All 1,000 homes have been fully assessed for injury hazards using our standardised Healthy Housing Index. 
Consistent with our community focus, we will remediate home hazards for the control group once the study is completed and report back results to the community. We will also carry out a full cost-benefit appraisal of the intervention to assist translation of our research findings for decision makers.</summary>
