    <studytitle>Stationary cycling versus walking: a comparison of exercise modalities following coronary artery bypass graft surgery</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In patients undergoing first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgery, does a moderate-intensity, stationary cycling exercise program improve exercise capacity and/or health-related quality of life at hospital discharge, when compared to a moderate-intensity walking exercise program?</scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Twice daily, moderate-intensity, physiotherapy-supervised stationary cycling. Sessions are undertaken morning and afternoon on subjects, while hospital inpatients, from post-operative day 3 up to and including the day prior to hospital discharge. Session durations are 10 minutes each. Subjects cycle on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer at a perceived intensity of exertion of 'moderate' to 'somewhat strong' under physiotherapy supervision, resting within the 10-minute period if/as required.</interventions>
    <comparator>Twice daily, moderate-intensity, physiotherapy-supervised walking exercise. Sessions are undertaken morning and afternoon on subjects, while hospital inpatients, from post-operative day 3 up to and including the day prior to hospital discharge. Session durations are 10 minutes each. Subjects walk laps of an air-conditioned 43.5m corridor at a perceived intensity of exertion of 'moderate' to 'somewhat strong' under physiotherapy supervision, resting within the 10-minute period if/as required.</comparator>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Following individual pre-operative physiotherapy assessment and education (during which eligibility of patient to participate in study will be determined), potential participants will be provided with a Participant Information Sheet and Informed Consent to participate will be sought. Treatment group will be allocated through selection of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes (stratified by gender and history of recent myocardial infarction), the holder of the allocation schedule being 'off-site'.</concealment>
    <sequence>The randomised sequence within each stratified group is generated from a randomisation table in a statistics book. Stratification factors include gender and history of recent myocardial infarction.</sequence>
