  <interventions>
    <interventions>The aim of this study was to evaluate bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during synchronous low- and high-intensity whole-body vibration in three trials of varying duration (30s, 60s and 90s). Another aim was to assess pelvic floor muscle fatigue during 90s whole-body vibration. The study participants were young continent women. 

Intervention:
Group I and II subjects participated in synchronous whole-body vibrations which were carried out on a vibration platform (Fitvibe 600, Gymna Uniphy N.V.) producing vertical oscillations. The frequency and peak-to-peak displacement of vibration were set individually for each group, i.e. 2 mm/20 Hz for group I and 4 mm/40 Hz for group II. Test participants were in a static squat position during the exercises. Each subject was asked to stand on the platform, loading their feet uniformly, with the knee and hip joints bent at 35 degrees and the upper extremities stretched horizontally forwards, holding on to a railing. Control participants (group III) performed static squat exercises similar to those used in the study groups I and II but without the concurrent application of vibrations. Three static squat exercise trials of varying duration (30s, 60s and 90s) were performed in a randomized order. A 10-min rest period was used between trials in order to eliminate any potential fatigue.  

Measurements:
Pelvic floor surface electromyography (sEMG) activity was recorded using a vaginal probe during three experimental trials limited to 30s, 60s and 90s in accordance with SENIAM recommendations (Surface ElectroMyoGraphy for the Non- Invasive Assessment of Muscles). 
The experiment consisted of two phases: 1/ the maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) procedure to recruit pelvic floor muscles and 2/ three static exercise trials of varying duration (30s, 60s, 90s) performed in a randomized order to determine PFM activity during (groups I, II) or without (group III) WBV. During the first phase, each participant was instructed to perform MVC of the pelvic floor muscles as forcefully as possible for about 5 seconds. Three attempts were made with 60-second rests between each contraction to reduce the effect of muscle fatigue. The MVC procedure to recruit pelvic floor muscles was carried out in supine lying, the hip and knee were positioned at 30° and 90° of flexion, respectively. The positions were controlled with the goniometer. 
The mean amplitude and variability of the signal were normalized to the Maximal Voluntary Contraction. The mean amplitude as well as the mean and median frequency of the sEMG signal were additionally measured to determine the effect of fatigue during the 90-second sEMG recordings. sEMG probe was placed by gynecologist; testing procedure was supervised by physiotherapist.

    <statisticalmethods>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to check the data for normal distribution, while variance homogeneity was assessed using the Levene test. Since several parameters failed to meet the assumption regarding the normal distribution of variables and variance homogeneity, nonparametric tests were used. 
Friedman's two-way ANOVA for ranks was applied when the same parameter had been measured several times (k&gt;=2) under different conditions on the same subjects. The Bonferroni post-hoc test, which reveals which means are significantly different from each other, was also performed. Inter-trial changes in the amplitude of the sEMG signal from the pelvic floor muscles were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA  with the Tukey post hoc test.

Determination of sample size

Result distribution in a randomly selected sample was unimodal; skewness and flatness were lower than 2.5. Therefore center stratification and dispersion measure were best assessed with the arithmetic mean and standard deviation.  
We assumed the probability of a type I error a = 0.05, target power of 1-beta = 0.80 and a 25% minimum significant difference between the means of parameters studied. The resultant minimum sample size was 10 patients. The target sample size was 36; 6 additional participants were to be recruited to account for dropouts (due to artifact signals of EMG). The actual sample size was 33. The study participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups (Group I  12; Group II  10, and Group III  11). 
Data analysis was performed with Statistica, version 10.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>More and more frequently stress urinary incontinence affects young healthy women. Hence, early implementation of effective preventive strategies in nulliparous continent women is essential, including pelvic floor muscle training. An initial evaluation based on the bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) during whole-body vibration (WBV) would help to devise the best individualized training for prevention of stress urinary incontinence in woman. We hypothesized that synchronous WBV enhances bioelectrical activity of the PFM which depends on vibration frequency and peak-to-peak vibration displacement.
Friedman's two-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean normalized amplitudes (%MVC) of the sEMG signal from the PFM during 60s- and 90s-trials between the group exposed to high-intensity WBV and control participants (p&lt;0.05). Longer trial duration was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the variability of sEMG signal amplitude in the study and control groups (p&lt;0.05).
Synchronous high-intensity WBV (40Hz, 4mm) of long duration (60s, 90s) significantly enhances the activation of the PFM in young continent women. Prolonged maintenance of a static position significantly decreases the variability of EMG signal amplitude independent of whole-body vibrations. Single whole-body vibrations in nulliparous continent women does not cause pelvic floor muscle fatigue.
