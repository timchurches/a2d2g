Suitable NSTEMI patients will be consented after referral from the chest pain assessment team and treating medical staff.
After baseline microvascular reactivity assessment, participants are randomised to 10mg or 40mg Rosuvastatin using sealed opaque envelopes. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Differences between groups will be analysed using the Students T-test, Mann Whitney U-test or Fishers exact test as appropriate. Correlations will be assessed using Pearsons Product Moment Correlation. Differences in iontophoresis response curves between groups will be assessed using generalized equalizing equations (GEEs). A probability value of P&lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. 
A power calculation was not performed because this is a pilot study. The data generated from this study will provide an indication of sample size for future studies.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart, blood vessels and blood, and is responsible for the delivery of nutrients and removal of waste from the body.  Blood flow is primarily regulated by the very small blood vessels.  Examination of the skin blood vessels using laser Doppler flowmetry is an easy method that provides an index of global microvasculature function.

Statins are a class of drug that reduce cardiovascular events and mortality. In addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins demonstrate a number of other effects that protect the heart. After a heart attack, statins improve patient outcomes by improving the function of the large and small blood vessels. Rosuvastatin is more potent and effective than other statins. However, no studies have investigated the effect of Rosuvastatin on the very small skin blood vessels in patients who have had a minor heart attack.

This pilot study aims to evaluate the effect of 1-week low- vs. high-dose Rosuvastatin therapy on very small blood vessel function in patients who present with a minor heart attack compared to a healthy population. 
We hypothesise that 1-week high-dose Rosuvastatin in minor heart attack patients and healthy controls does not improve the function of the very small blood vessels when compared to 1-week low-dose Rosuvastatin. </summary>
