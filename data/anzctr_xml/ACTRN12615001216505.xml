  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will complete 2 x 36 h periods of activity (using ActivPal monitors) and glucose (using continous blood glucose monitors) monitoring. 
Participants will spend one day at the laboratory (between 7.30 am and 7 pm) during each of the 36 h periods.
Prior to the trial day, participants will receive a standardised meal to take home and consume for their last meal of the day, have finger prick blood samples taken, have a continuous blood glucose monitor (CGM) inserted subcutaneously on their lower back and have an ActivPal activity monitor adhered to their thigh. This appointment will take ~1 h prior to trial day. 
On a trial day, participants will get a taxi (costs covered by the study) to the laboratory. An indwelling cannula will be inserted into an anticubital vein of the forearm, and the study involves having serial blood measures and answering appetite questionnaires for the duration of a day (8 am to 5 pm) whilst remaining seated. Meals will be provided for breakfast (9am), lunch (1 pm) and dinner (6 pm) to consume at the laboratory. 
At the end of the trial day, participants will be taxied home, and they will wear the CGM and the Activpal until 8 am the next morning.
Trials will be separated by at least a 7 day period.

Condition A: Energy intake is distributed with 20% of energy at breakfast, 30% of energy at lunch and 50% of energy at dinner. 
Condition B: Energy intake is distributed with 50% of energy at breakfast, 30% of energy at lunch and 20% of energy at dinner. 

For both dietary interventions the macronutrient distribution will be the same (i.e. 50% energy from carbohydrate, 20% energy from protein and 30% energy from fat)..

Participants will complete food and activity diaries across the period encompassing the day prior to and the day after each trial day to ensure adherence. Whilst in the laboratory, participants will be monitored by the research staff.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Statistical analysis
Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with random intercepts will be used to evaluate the differential effects of the experimental conditions on the outcomes. All models will include a binary variable indicating the experimental condition (BF or D), adjusted for potential period effects and period-dependent confounders (baseline values for the outcome of interest, dietary intake and physical activity). Given that the study uses a balanced orthogonal design and substantial imbalances due to dropout are unlikely, it will not be necessary to adjust for subject-level covariates (e.g., age). GLMMs are appropriate for correlated data (repeated measures) with various distributional assumptions and can easily accommodate missing data. A probability level of 0.05 will be adopted.

Power Calculations
Power calculations have been made in relation to the primary outcome measures of postprandial glucose (daily CGM and venous collections). Based previous data, we have estimated that a sample size of 22 is needed to detect a between treatment difference of 0.9mmol/L with a minimum power of 80% and a probability of 0.05 (2-tailed test). This is based on the assumption that the within-patient standard deviation of the response variable is 1.04. As a safeguard and using our experience from previous behavioural interventions, we will over-sample to cover an estimated attrition rate of 15%. Thus, 25 participants will be recruited.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Given relationships between meal patterns and glucose metabolism, cardiometabolic biomarkers may be beneficially altered by a reduction in energy consumed at the evening meal and increasing that consumed at breakfast. The purpose of the present study is to examine how manipulations to the distribution of energy throughout the day influences blood glucose and insulin metabolism, and appetite control, during periods of prolonged sitting in overweight/obese men and women. This study aims to recruit individuals who are overweight/obese as they are typically those who exhibit tendencies of developing type 2 diabetes and they represent an important target group for evaluating strategies for disease prevention.. It is hypothesised that by increasing the energy intake at the beginning of the day (i.e. a large breakfast) will better distribute the glucose load throughout the day, when not participating in any physical activity (i.e. prolonged sitting).</summary>
