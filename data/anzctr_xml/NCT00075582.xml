Treatment: drugs - dactinomycin
Treatment: drugs - cyclophosphamide
Treatment: drugs - vincristine sulfate
Treatment: other - radiation therapy

Experimental: Regimen I (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) - Patients receive VAC chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 1-9 and dactinomycin IV over 1 minute and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10; VA chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13-21 and dactinomycin IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13, 16, 19, and 22 (dactinomycin is omitted during radiation therapy); and radiation therapy, 5 days a week, beginning on week 13 and continuing for 4-7 weeks, depending on prescribed dose. Some patients do not receive radiation therapy; some start it at week 24. (closed to accrual as of 08/13/2010)

Experimental: Regimen II (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) - Patients receive VAC chemotherapy and radiation therapy as in regimen I and VA chemotherapy comprising vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13-21, 25-33, and 37-45 and dactinomycin IV over 1 minute on day 1 of weeks 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 43, and 46 (dactinomycin is omitted during radiation therapy). Some patients do not receive radiation therapy; some start it at week 13 and some at week 24. Some patients have conventional surgery (second-look) at Week 13 (closed to accrual as of 9/23/2011).

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase III trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy work
      in treating patients with newly diagnosed low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide, work in different ways
      to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may
      kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective in
      treating low-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.</summary>
