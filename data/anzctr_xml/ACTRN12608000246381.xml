  <interventions>
    <interventions>Early functional therapy, consisting of early antiphlogistic measures according the RICE procedure (Rest  Ice  Compression  Elevation), elastic support bandage, early return to full weight bearing after only a short period of immobilization and instruction for motion exercises to be begun at home after the acute phase. follow-up treatment at the Emergency Dep. The Study started May 2004 and ended December 2004. The physical therapy exercises were developed in collaboration with the Swiss Sports Institute (Eidgen√∂ssische Turn- und Sportschule in Magglingen, ESSM) and are designed to strengthen the peroneal muscles and improve neuromuscular control through proprioceptive training. It has to be done once a day for 30 min.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The basis of our study was the question whether patients, who chose the emergency room of the University Hospital for initial diagnosis, are satisfied with our initial therapy, and whether there is a difference in the level of satisfaction between the patients who receive follow-up care at our clinic or at their general practitioners office. Since our clinic does not prescribe ankle braces (Malleoloc or Aircast), the additional question arose as to whether the patients acquired such stabilizing ortheses themselves or were prescribed ankle braces by their general practitioner during the follow-up visit.</summary>
