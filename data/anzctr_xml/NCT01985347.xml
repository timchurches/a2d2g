Active Comparator: Obstructive Sleep Apnoea - Patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnoea and who have anxiety and depression would be given continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.

No Intervention: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and western population - (For this group no intervention needed).Patients with COPD, who have anxiety and depression &amp; normal population in Western Adelaide who also have anxiety and depression their prevalence would be compare with patients of Obstructive sleep apnoea.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The prevalence of anxiety and depression in our OSA population is more than in COPD and the
      general population of North West Adelaide. (principal hypothesis).

      CPAP therapy in OSA population produces a positive effect on the anxiety and depression
      scale.

      The Investigators intend to study the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients with
      sleep disorders in comparison to patients with COPD and subsequently, to assess whether CPAP
      has a role in controlling anxiety and depression in depressed and anxious patients with sleep
      apnoea.

      This is a two phase study, in first phase; investigator will assess the prevalence of anxiety
      and depression, in a population with sleep disorders to check whether it is different to the
      prevalence in the COPD population. The prevalence of depression in Sleep Disorder population
      will also be compared with the Adelaide North Western general population, which was reported
      in The North West Adelaide Health Study. According to this epidemiological survey, which was
      conducted from 2008 to 2010, the prevalence of depression in Adelaide North Western general
      population was 20%.During the second phase of the study investigator will evaluate the effect
      of CPAP on anxiety and depression scores in the depressed and anxious patients with sleep
      apnoea by comparing the pre and post CPAP anxiety and depression status. The Hospital Anxiety
      and Depression (HAD) scale will be used to assess Anxiety and Depression, which is a
      well-documented tool for assessing symptoms of anxiety and depression in patients with
      somatic diseases.</summary>
