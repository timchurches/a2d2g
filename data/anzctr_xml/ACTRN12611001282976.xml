  <interventions>
    <interventions>After induction of anaesthesia an ultrasound-guided rectus sheath nerve-block will be performed by the surgeon or anaesthetist.
Nerve block technique:
Guided by an axially orientated ultrasound image incorporating the lateral edge of the rectus muscle the needle will be inserted in-plane to the ultrasound beam and its tip advanced under visualisation to the posterior extent of the rectus muscle. A hypo-echogenic lentiform swelling between posterior rectus sheath and rectus muscle on injection of a small amount of solution will help confirm correct needle tip position. Half of the solution will be injected at this point. The process will be repeated on the contralateral side.
Local anaesthetic dose:
The volume of solution available for the nerve block will be calculated according to the patients body weight up to a maximum of 20ml, to maintain a maximum dose of bupivacaine at or below 2.5mg/kg.
Volume (ml) = Weight (kg) -10
Half the volume will be used for each side. 
In addition to the nerve block, 10ml 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 adrenaline will be available for the surgeon for local infiltration of all port sites.
The nerve block is performed once intraoperatively and not repeated.</interventions>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Paediatric surgical registrars or consultants will invite children and their parents / whanau to participate in the trial.
Once recruited and consented, the allocation of each participant to the intervention or control group will be performed by an unblinded circulating theatre nurse just prior to the start of the procedure. This nurse will receive written instructions not to disclose the participantâ€™s group allocation to anybody and will have no involvement in the post-operative care of the patient or in data collection, analysis or reporting. 
Randomized study allocations will be placed into 200 totally opaque sequentially numbered envelopes by an independent research assistant who will have no subsequent involvement in this study. The envelopes will be securely sealed and kept in a central location. They will be opened strictly in sequence in the operating room just prior to the start of each procedure.</concealment>
    <sequence>The generation of random numbers will be facilitated by an independent research assistant. The allocation sequence will be generated using an open source computer-based on-line random number generator, http://www.random.org. All numbers from 1 to 156 (to give 20% redundancy) will be generated in random sequence arranged in 2 columns. Study allocation will be based on these numbers.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>When performing a laparoscopic appendicectomy the surgeon injects local anaesthetic to numb the sites where keyhole ports, used for the surgical instruments, are placed through the abdominal wall. For the first port, placed at the belly button (umbilicus) local anaesthetic is placed under the skin, but much of the pain after the operation may come from the deeper tissue layer at the level of abs muscles (rectus abdominis). The rectus sheath nerve block, in which local anaesthetic is injected just behind the rectus muscle to numb the nerves that supply the umbilicus, has been shown to be safe and effective in paediatric umbilical operations. Rectus sheath nerve blocks have not been previously studied in paediatric laparoscopic appendicectomy to our knowledge, although a similar block called the TAP (transversus abdominis plane) has been shown to be effective. The possible advantage of the rectus sheath block is that the anaesthetic is placed closer to the umbilicus, and it is easy to perform. Needle placement during a rectus sheath nerve block is more accurate, and possibly safer, when ultrasound is used to see where the needle is going. We propose to investigate how an ultrasound guided rectus sheath nerve block can reduce pain after laparoscopic appendicectomy for acute appendicitis.</summary>
