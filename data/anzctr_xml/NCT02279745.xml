    <inclusivecriteria>-  Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document

          -  Is willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory tests,
             and other study procedures and is deemed an appropriate candidate for participation in
             a long-term extension study and administration of APD811

               -  Fulfilled all eligibility criteria for APD811-003 and completed the study as
                  planned

               -  Patients who discontinued for clinical worsening in APD811-003 and were assigned
                  to placebo and completed all end of study procedures including right heart
                  catheterization (RHC) may participate after their data from the APD811-003 study

    <exclusivecriteria>-  Patients who enrolled in APD811-003 and were withdrawn from study drug treatment due
             to any AE, SAE, or clinical worsening if assigned to APD811, or patients who did not
             complete the APD811 003 study for other reasons.

          -  Female patients who wish to become pregnant

          -  Systolic BP &lt;90 mmHg at Baseline/Day 1

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or laboratory abnormality that may increase the
             risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or
             may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study</exclusivecriteria>
