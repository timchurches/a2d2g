  <interventions>
    <interventions>Randomised controlled cross over trial with 2 treatment arms; arm 1 (~60-80g Hi Oleic peanuts~15% of participants energy intake incorporated into the diet, consumed daily), arm 2 control (low nut diet). Participants will be randomised to consume either peanuts or low nut diet for 12 weeks and then swap over to alternate arm for the next 12 weeks. As the control arm is a low nut diet there is no washout phase, any changes from consuming peanuts are expected to be reversed in the 12 week control period. Peanuts will be provided in snack sized packets (25 g each) sufficient for 6 weeks intake, a second 6 week supply will be provided at the subsequent visit. The primary investigator (Jayne Barbour) is an Accredited Practicing  Dietitian who will advise on adherence to low nut diet and peanut diet and monitor compliance by checking 4 day food diaries at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks. Participants will also return empty peanut packets or uneaten peanuts as a measure of compliance. Red blood cell fatty acid content will also be taken at weeks 12 and 24 to check compliance with diets.</interventions>
    <comparator>low nut diet - participants will be advised by primary investigator (Dietitian) to avoid nuts wherever possible including all nuts as snacks and as main ingredients in a recipe (e.g. sate sauce, cakes with ground nuts)or packaged products with more than or equal to 5% nuts listed in the ingredients. Nuts in small/trace amounts will be allowed.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The proposed study aims to investigate the impact of consuming Hi-Oleic peanuts on vascular function and how this can alter cardiometabolic health as well as cognitive performance. Peanuts have the potential to improve the cardiometabolic risk factors; glucose control, blood lipids, blood pressure and body composition. Peanuts are a source of resveratrol, shown to target endothelial cells and may result in improved circulatory function. The mechanism proposed is through enhancing the availability of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator. The precursor to NO is the amino acid arginine, which is also found in rich supply in peanuts. In addition, the potential cardiometabolic benefits of peanut consumption may also help improve endothelial function. Thus, peanuts contain the precursor, key ingredient and potential cardiometabolic benefits needed to enhance vasodilatation. Impaired vasodilatation is recognised as a key contributor to the development of cardiovascular disease and reduced cognitive performance, due to poor peripheral and cerebral perfusion. This study will test whether cognitive performance and cardiometabolic health in adults is enhanced following daily consumption of peanuts. This may generate novel evidence of inter-relationship between cerebral blood vessel function and cognitive performance and provide a foundation for future studies to evaluate the effects of diet on both cardiovascular and cognitive performance.</summary>
