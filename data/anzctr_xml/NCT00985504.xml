  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Apathy Evaluation Scale - Clinician Rated Version (AES-C) Total Score at Week 8 - The AES-C is a validated 18-item instrument used to assess cognitive, behavioral, emotional and other symptoms of apathy. Clinicians rate each item based on verbal and nonverbal information provided by the participant. Item scores range from 1 (not at all characteristic) to 4 (a lot characteristic). Total scores range from 18 to 72 where higher derived scores indicate more severe apathy. The Least Squares (LS) Mean Value was calculated from a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, treatment*visit, baseline, and baseline*visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Apathy Evaluation Scale-Clinician Rated Version (AES-C) Subscale Scores at Week 8 - AES-C subscales separately assess participants' intensity of cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and other apathy symptoms with individual item scores of 1 (not at all characteristic) to 4 (a lot characteristic). Subtotal score ranges for the subscales are: 8-32 (cognitive), 5-20 (behavioral), 2-8 (emotional), and 3-12 for other (display of personal insight, initiative and motivation). Higher subscale scores indicate greater illness severity. The LS Mean Value was calculated from an MMRM model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, treatment*visit, baseline, and baseline*visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Rothschild Scale for Antidepressant Tachyphylaxis (RSAT) Total and Individual Item Scores at Week 8 - RSAT assesses symptoms of apathy or decreased motivation among depressed participants who have achieved symptomatic remission with antidepressant treatment and consists of 6 self-report items assessing energy level, motivation and interest, cognitive functioning, weight gain, sleep and sexual functioning, as well as affect. Each item score ranges from 0 to 4 with total scores ranging from 0 to 28. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean Value was calculated from an MMRM model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, treatment*visit, baseline, and baseline*visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patient's Global Impressions of Improvement Scale (PGI-I) Rating Scale Score at Week 8 - The PGI-I is a scale that measures the participant's perception of improvement at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. The score ranges from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). The LS Mean Value was calculated from an MMRM model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, and treatment*visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Rating Scale at Week 8 - The CGI-S measures severity of illness at the time of assessment compared with start of treatment. Scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients). The LS Mean Value was calculated from an MMRM model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, treatment*visit, baseline, and baseline*visit.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score and Item 8 (Inability to Feel) at Week 8 - MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms and has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Item 8 assesses the participant's inability to feel. Scores range from 0 (normal interest in surroundings and other people) to 6 (emotional paralysis, inability to feel anger/grief/pleasure). The LS Mean Value was calculated from an MMRM model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, visit, treatment*visit, baseline, and baseline*visit.</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (MGH-CPFQ) Total and Item Scores at Week 8 - The MGH-CPFQ is a 7-item participant-rated questionnaire evaluating the participant's cognitive and physical well-being during the past month. The MGH-CPFQ assesses motivation, wakefulness, energy, focus, recall, word-finding difficulty, and mental acuity. Each item is scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 ("greater than normal") to 2 ("normal") to 6 ("totally absent"). Total scores range from 7 to 42. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. The LS Mean Value was calculated from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, and baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Change From Baseline in the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total and Individual Scores at Week 8 - The SDS is a participant-rated assessment. Total scores range from 0-30 with higher values indicating greater disruption in the participant's work/social/family life. Items 1-3 assess the effect of the participant's symptoms on work/school schedule, social life/leisure activities, and family life/home responsibilities, respectively. Item scores are 0-10; higher values indicate greater disruption. Number of unproductive days and days lost in past week (symptom related) were reported. LS Mean Value was calculated from an ANCOVA model with terms of treatment, pooled investigator, and baseline.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 8 weeks</timepoint>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Percentage of Participants Who Relapsed During 8 Weeks - Relapse is defined as achieving a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score=16 at any time after baseline. The MADRS is a rating scale for severity of depressive mood symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline through 8 weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Number of Days From Baseline to Relapse as Defined by Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score =16 During 8 Weeks - The number of days from baseline to the first relapse is defined as reaching a MADRS Total Score=16. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms). Censored participants were included in the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the minimum and maximum time to relapse have been calculated and reported here. Median time to relapse and quartiles could not be computationally calculated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure due to low event rate and high completion rate (censored).</outcome>

    <summary>The purpose of this study is to provide a comparison of the apathy, depression, and
      functional outcomes associated with switching to duloxetine or escitalopram in patients who
      have previously responded to treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      for major depressive disorder and who have residual apathy in the absence of depressed mood.</summary>
