  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will receive a telephone-based behaviour change intervention, focusing on weight reduction and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle program (referral to the 'Get Healthy Information and Coaching Service' (GHS)). The GHS offers 10 individually tailored coaching sessions delivered by university qualified health coaches over a 6-month period. Each coaching sessions is designed to provide ongoing support in maintaining participant motivation, overcoming barriers, setting goals and making positive and sustainable lifestyle and behaviour changes, regarding diet, physical activity, and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. 

Coaching sessions are provided on a tapered schedule, with a higher intensity of calls occurring in the first 12 weeks of the program. However, the frequency of the telephone sessions are tailored to the participants individual needs. Printed support materials will be mailed to participants after the first telephone call, and will include an information booklet and a coaching journal. During the first telephone call, participants will complete a short health assessment and be asked about their current lifestyle habits and other information regarding their individual circumstances. The remaining 9 telephone calls provide information aimed to support participants to improve their dietary intake and physical activity and assist them in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. </interventions>
    <comparator>Active (usual care) controls will be used. Patients allocated to the control group will receive standard care and take part in data collection during the 6-month intervention. In addition, the control group will receive the same brief advice as the intervention group during baseline data collection telephone calls. The brief advice provides patients with an understanding of the importance in improving health related behaviours, including physical activity and dietary behaviours, and the relationship between these behaviours and weight management and improvements in knee pain. </comparator>

    <concealment>Potential participants have been previously contacted by Population Health as part of a cohort study. They are patients with musculoskeletal conditions, waiting for consultation with an orthopaedic specialist at the Royal Newcastle Centre at the John Hunter Hospital, NSW Australia.

Trained interviewers will contact patients with knee osteoarthritis and a BMI between 27 and 40 via telephone for eligibility screening and baseline data collection. Eligible patients who consent to participate will be randomised to either intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer generated randomisation schedule generated by an independent statistician. 

Following screening and Baseline assessment, the interviewer will open an opaque envelope containing the group allocation. The participant will then be advised on the specific program details (i.e. continue as part of the cohort (control) or be referred to the health coaching service (intervention)).</concealment>

Primary outcome analysis.
For pain intensity we will use linear mixed models with random intercepts for individuals to account for correlation of repeated measures (pain). The model will include terms for important prognostic factors measured using priori to randomisation and specified a priori. We will obtain estimates of the effect of the intervention and 95% confidence intervals by constructing linear contrasts to compare the adjusted mean change in outcome from baseline to each time point between the treatment and control groups. For weight we will compare the proportional reduction in weight between groups using t-tests. We will analyse the effect of treatment separately for each outcome. 
We will also conduct a sensitivity analysis of weight loss using self-report measure in a linear mixed model.

Secondary outcomes analysis.
We will analyse the effect of treatment separately for each outcome using linear mixed models with random intercepts for individuals to account for correlation of repeated measures. As per primary model we will include terms for important prognostic factors measured prior to randomisation and specified a priori. We will obtain estimates of the effect of the intervention and 95% confidence intervals by constructing linear contrasts to compare the adjusted mean change (continuous variables) or difference in proportions (dichotomous variables) in outcome from baseline to each time point between the treatment and control groups.

Sample Size
Sample size calculations allow for two primary outcomes. Using a standard deviation of 2.7, a two-sided alpha of 0.025 (to account for multiple primary analyses) and allowing for 15% lost to follow up, a sample of 60 participants per group will, will give 90% power to detect a clinically meaningful difference of 2 in pain intensity between intervention and control groups. This sample also provides 80% power to detect a 5kg difference between at follow up  this accounts for 6% reduction in weight and hypothesized to be lead to a clinically meaningful reduce in pain.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Excessive weight is the most significant behavioural risk factor leading to the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Weight loss is recommended for all patients with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese; however, this is rarely provided in clinical practice. This study will assess the effectiveness of a telephone-based weight management program in reducing weight and pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis who are overweight or obese. We hypotheses that patients receiving the telephone-based program will achieve an average weight loss of 5kg and an average decrease in pain score of 1.5 of 10 from baseline, compared to control patients receiving usual care.</summary>
