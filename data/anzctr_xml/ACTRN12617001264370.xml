  <interventions>
    <interventions> Two intervention arms corresponding to 30 mins and 45 mins of external counterpulsation  (ECP)treatment per session. Participants in both intervention arms will have 3 sessions/week for 7 weeks. 
Treatment involves the participant lying on a bed with cuffs around the legs and hips. The ECP treatment involves the cuffs inflating and deflating every few seconds to change the blood flow returning to the heart.
The sessions will take place at The University of Queensland, St Lucia and will be provided by a trained technician.
Intervention adherence will be assessed as the number of visits attended from the 21 possible.</interventions>
    <comparator>Sham treatment involves the participant lying on a bed with cuffs around the legs and hips. It is sham because the cuffs do not inflate and deflate.
The sessions will take place at The University of Queensland, St Lucia and will be provided by a trained technician.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>A three-group, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will be performed. Forty five participants with type 2 diabetes will be assigned to either 1) ECP30: ECP therapy for 30 mins/session or 2) ECP45: ECP therapy for 45 mins/session or 3) placebo (sham). Each participant will have 3 ECP/sham sessions/week for 7 weeks.  To assess the effectiveness of the ECP therapy before and after the 7-week intervention participants will undergo tests of cardiorespiratory fitness, exercise capacity, blood markers (HOMA values and basal disposition index using fasting glucose and insulin), HbA1c, nitrate, nitrite, F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls, C reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10, IL-ra and thrombospondin-2) and vascular structure and function. </summary>
