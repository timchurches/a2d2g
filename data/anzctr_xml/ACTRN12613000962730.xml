    <studytitle>Dietary Fats and Biomarkers of Human Health: Excess Saturated Fat or Lack of Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Chronic Study)</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>Would it be an excess of saturated fat in the diet or a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids the responsible for increased blood lipid levels? And what would be the effect of the background diet on omega-3 supplementation in healthy adults in a chronic study? </scientifictitle>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a randomised controlled, dietary intervention trial, in parallel design with healthy adults. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of dietary intervention with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) supplementation either in combination with saturated fat or omega-6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA). The saturated fat group will consume butter (24g, which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), white chocolate (40g) and 4 capsules of fish oil (4 x 0.5g), participants will also be advised on how to use more foods containing saturated fat for cooking.Participants will be asked to fill a medical and a physical activity questionnaire and will have their anthropometric measurements taken in each of their visits. Subjects will also complete a 3 day food record.</interventions>

    <statisticalmethods>Sample size calculation:
This study aims to demonstrate that total cholesterol in group A (dairy fat) is not higher than group B (n-6 PUFA) after 6 weeks of intervention and therefore it is a non-inferiority trial. Dietary fat manipulation (saturated versus n-6PUFA) increases plasma total cholesterol by 5% (0.3 mmol/L) within 6 weeks [1]. Therefore, assuming SD=0.5 mmol/L and non-inferiority margin of 0.25 mmol/L, 45 subjects per group will provide 80% power to demonstrate that group A doesnt have higher total cholesterol (i.e. non-inferior) than group B (a= 0.05). Allowing for 10% dropouts, we will recruit n=100.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Consumption of foods rich in saturated fats have been associated with elevated blood lipid levels and adverse health effects. However studies using animal models have demonstrated that dietary saturated fats raise blood lipid (cholesterol and triglyceride) levels only when the diet is deficient in n-3 PUFA. If the same is true for humans, this research will have important implications for the prevention of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Therefore we hypothesise that saturated fat consumption does not raise blood lipid levels if the diet is sufficient in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. We also hypothesise that the benefits of n-3 PUFA can be optimised when consumed in combination with saturated fats. This is a randomised controlled, dietary intervention trial, in parallel design with healthy adults. Blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 6 weeks of dietary intervention with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) supplementation either in combination with saturated fat or omega-6 Polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 PUFA). The saturated fat group will consume butter (24g, which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), white chocolate (40g) and 4 capsules of fish oil (4 x 0.5g), participants will also be advised on how to use more foods containing saturated fat for cooking. The n-6 PUFA group will consume margarine (20g, which can be spread on bread, muffins or crackers), sunflower seeds (42g) and 4 capsules of fish oil (4 x 0.5g), participants will also be advised on how to use more foods and oils containing n-6PUFA for cooking. Participants will be asked to fill a medical and a physical activity questionnaire and will have their anthropometric measurements taken in each of their visits. Subjects will also complete a 3 day food record.</summary>
