Active Comparator: Clinician exposed to Model result - 

Experimental: Clinician blinded to Model result - 


Other interventions: Treatment as per model probability
Patients randomized to the arm where the clinician is exposed to the model results should be treated as per the model probability (i.e. if the model probability suggests AHF the clinician should treat for AHF).

Other interventions: Treatment as per usual care
Patients randomized to the arm where the clinician is blinded to the model results will undergo diagnostic tests and receive treatment as per the clinician's judgment and usual care standards.
