  <interventions>
    <interventions>The clinical investigation will involve a randomized, controlled, split-mouth study of young children receiving local anesthesia for restorative treatment including vital pulp therapy (i.e., pulpotomy). The study will compare pain, behavior, and heart rate measurements from an exposure group (treatment completed with the aid of an iPad) and control group (treatment completed with the aid of AV eyeglasses). We will assigne each of these two treatments to either left or right halves of the primary dentition. 
The duration for the iPad session and the eyeglasses session will be the time required to complete pulpotomy (about 30 minutes). The interval between the iPad session and eyeglasses session will be 1 week. 
we will offer children the option to choose one game or movie from a pool of 6 games/movies (AV eyeglasses movies: Sponge Bob Square Pants (Viacom International Inc.), Tom and Jerry (Cartoon Network), and Shaun the Sheep (Asrdman Animations Ltd.);  iPad VGs: Air Hockey Gold (Acceleroto), Paper Toss (Backflip Studios, Inc.), and Ninja Jump (Ninja Jump, Inc.). </interventions>
    <comparator>Active control (audiovisual eyeglasses). It will be applied during the time required to complete pulpotomy (about 30 minutes).  
we will offer children the option to choose one movie from a pool of 3 movies (AV eyeglasses movies: Sponge Bob Square Pants (Viacom International Inc.), Tom and Jerry (Cartoon Network), and Shaun the Sheep (Asrdman Animations Ltd.). </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effectiveness of an iPad versus audiovisual glasses in controlling pain (pain perceived by a patient as measured by Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale) and reducing disruptive behavior (as measured by North Carolina Behavior Rating Scale) during dental treatments in children.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Pain and behavior will rated during treatment. The ratings will be made at 7 separate intervals: (1) 5 minutes before treatment (BT), (2) during administration of local anesthesia (LA), (3) after rubber dam clamp placement (RD), (4) during caries removal (CR), (5) during pulp amputation (PA), (6) during insertion of the restorative material (RM), and (7) 5 minutes postoperatively (PO). </timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Effect of an iPad versus audiovisual glasses on heart rates of children during dental treatment. Childs heart rates will be recorded during those intervals using a fingertip pulse oximetry</outcome>
      <timepoint>The heart rate recording will be made at 7 separate intervals: (1) 5 minutes before treatment (BT), (2) during administration of local anesthesia (LA), (3) after rubber dam clamp placement (RD), (4) during caries removal (CR), (5) during pulp amputation (PA), (6) during insertion of the restorative material (RM), and (7) 5 minutes postoperatively (PO). </timepoint>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>children should be 4 to 9 years old, with no medically or developmentally compromising conditions, and in need of vital pulp therapy treatment in the posterior region of the mouth. Each child patient should have at least two primary antimere molars with lesions of similar size requiring restorative treatment including pulpotomy. </inclusivecriteria>

    <exclusivecriteria>Children with mental or cognitive problems that could compromise their basic comprehension of the trial and its conduct, those who were or are undergoing medical or dental treatment that might affect their behavior during the study, and those with heartbeat disorders. We will exclude children from the final analysis if they or their parents abandoned the study by their choice or any other reasons.  </exclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>We will randomly assigne child patients to receive the treatment using an iPad (Group A) at one visit, while the AV eyeglasses will be used at the second visit. Each of those in Group B will receive the same two treatments, but in reverse order. For each child patient, random selection will determine which tooth would be treated by which method of distraction. Both types of distraction techniques will be given to all child participants along with local anesthesia.  
The person who determined if a subject will be eligible for inclusion in the trial was unaware, when this decision was made, to which group the subject would be allocated. Allocation will involve contacting the holder of the allocation schedule who is not part of the study's investigators. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The 2 distraction techniques will be compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test for pain and behavior scores and paired t-test for heart rate scores. 
A sample size calculation was performed based on Wilcoxon Paired Signed Rank test, assuming the standard deviation of 1.53 (based on a 4-point scale for pain from none to severe) and a paired difference of 1 (effect size ES 0.65). When alpha 0.05 and ES 0.65, the sample size required for a power of 0.84 would be 23 participants (pairs). The sample size was increased to 50 to increase the study's power and to compensate for participants' drop-out. </statisticalmethods>
