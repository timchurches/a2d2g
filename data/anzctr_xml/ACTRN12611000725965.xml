  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive between 25 and 40 outpatient, individual treatment sessions with a registered Psychologist, each lasting 50 minutes duration. The number of sessions will be determined by the participant's starting Body Mass Index. Sessions will be spaced over a 10 month period.

Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three psychological treatments: Maudsley Model Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA), Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-E), or Specific Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM). All are based on established treatment manuals and guidelines, and all psychologists have been trained in the treatments by the treatment developers.

MANTRA and CBT-E are hypothesised to result in greater improvements in symptomatology. MANTRA uses a motivation-focused approach and incorporates work on thinking styles, social and emotional functioning, pro-anorexic beliefs, and interpersonal relationships. CBT-E focuses on the thoughts and beliefs that maintain the eating disorder, and incorporates mood regulation work. </interventions>
    <comparator>Specific Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM) is included as a control treatment, but is nonetheless an active and evidence-supported treatment for anorexia nervosa.

As above, the treatment would involve 25 to 40 outpatient sessions with a Psychologist over a 10 month period. The treatment includes psychoeducational material and uses an established therapist treatment guide.

SSCM is a patient-focused treatment that has a central aim of assisting patients to re-learn to eat normally, whilst also attending to salient issues that patients bring to treatment.</comparator>
