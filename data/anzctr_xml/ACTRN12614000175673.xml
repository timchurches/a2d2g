  <interventions>
    <interventions>The YES intervention program consists of 3 eight week terms over a year.  Between each term is a 3 week washout period, when the intervention programs are not run.

This randomised, crossover, longitudinal study has two arms.  Each arm of the trial requires 4 hours per week or 32 hours of treatment over a 8 week period. The treatment period consists of 16 weeks with a 3 week washout period between treatment arms.

arm A: randomised as an "A"
This arm of the trial focuses on social interaction and well being.
There are two weekly interventions: anxious art(2.5 hrs) and Buddhist Mindfulness (1.5hrs)  Participants can attend one or both of the workshops within their stream.  Interventions are based on social exposure principals which encourage and support participants to practise self soothing and coping strategies and promote illness insight, reduction in disorder symptoms.

Adherence to the program is encouraged through weekly text and e-mail reminders about intervention times and venues.  Attendance, per intervention session is collected and included in the main data base. 

Study  measures are collected at baseline prior to randomisation, week 1 of the term and are repeated at week 8 of the term.  After the washout period, measures are again repeated at week one and week eight of the second intervention period.  Follow up is at 12 months

Arm "B": randomised as "B"
This arm of the trial focuses on physical health and well being. There are two weekly interventions:  Tennis (2.5hrs) and cardio-boxing (1.5 hrs).  Participants can attend one or both of the interventions within their stream.  Central to intervention B is physical activity.  Participants look to improve general fitness levels as well as understand how physical exercise impacts on their illness management skills.  Interventions also promote self-soothing and coping strategies, promote illness insight and a reduction in disorder symptoms.  

Adherence to the program is encouraged through weekly text and e-mail reminders about intervention times and venues.  Attendance, per intervention session is collected and included in the main data base.

After the washout period of three weeks between interventions, measures are again repeated at week one and week eight of the second intervention term.  Follow up is at 12 months</comparator>

    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary outcome: reduce the levels of social disability associated with the progression of mental illness.
primary outcome measure: Social Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale  (SOFAS).  Initial assessment using this scale is done by the Trial Researcher.  The following SOFAs at week one and week 8 of the intervention terms, and at 12 month follow up, are completed by the participants treating doctor/clinician.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The same self report measures (mood, metabolic, symptom, disability and social functioning) are used throughout the trial period.  The SOFAs is measured by the participant's treating doctor/clinician (not the trial researcher).  Measures are taken at base line and then repeated at week one of the intervention, week eight of the intervention.  After the three week washout period when participants crossover to the second intervention, measures are repeated at week one and week eight of the second term.  Follow up is at 12 months.

      <timepoint>participants will be asked to fill in a self report at baseline prior to randomisation and at week one and week 8 of each term.  Participants will be encouraged to attend for two terms which would result in 5 self reports, one follow up measure.</timepoint>

Once consent has been obtained, participants have been deemed eligible to enter the trial and baseline measures have been completed, they will be randomised into one of the treatment arms using the  computerised random number generator program, www.graphpad.com.  Staff responsible for establishing randomisation procedures will not be involved in the day to day running of the trial.  Research staff will not be aware of group membership during the baseline assessments as randomisation occurs after this stage.</concealment>
    <sequence>a simple method of randomisation is used to assign participants to the two arms of the study.  www.graphpad.com creates a randomised table of allocation</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>The YES treatment trial aims to recruit 120 participants over a two year data collection period.  Other similar studies on social functioning and youth have small sample sizes (N= less then 20).  In response to these studies, a sample size of 60 was determined to have the power to detect a moderate effect size.

All data will be entered into and analysed descriptively using SPSS, version 21 (SPSSS Inc, Chicago, Ill, USA).  Pearson correlations will be used for continuous data.  ANOVA or t-tests will be used for comparisons between the two arms of the study.  Logistic regression will be used to determine whether demographic and/or clinical variables predict any difference between the two arms of the study.  As this research takes place in a health service setting; with participants, clinicians and health care staff providing information, there will be variables of missing data.

Primary analyses will be undertaken on the standard and widely accepted intention to treat basis including all participants randomised regardless of treatment actually recieved or withdrawl from the study.  The primary outcome is the changes in the SOFAS score over time.  Further analyses will evaluate the maintenance of their difference over the subsequent 6 months and at 12 months. Mixed model repeated measures analyses will be used because of the ability of this approach to include participants with missing data without using discredited techniques such as last observation carried forward. As a sensitivity analysis multiple imputation using demographic and other background variables as predictors will be used to allow inclusion of data from all participants.  Additional analyses will explore participant characteristics which moderate outcome and, if appropriate, levels of presenting severity associated with significant improvement.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This randomised, within subject, longitudinal trial will determine the efficacy of Functional Remediation as an early intervention in young people with mood disorder/psychosis who have increased Cardio Metabolic Syndrome risk factors and cognitive difficulties, as determined by their referring clinician.  Specifically this trial aims to demonstrate that Functional Remediation will:
aim 1:  improve quality of life in young outpatients with a mood disorder/psychoses
aim 2:  improve mental health by delaying progression of illness and promote longer periods between lapse/relapse
aim 3:  modify sleep-wake behaviour, mood and general health (targeting cardio-metabolic outcomes) to improve social educational and functional skills, educational/employment/retention/return
aim 4:  to examine the role of change in cardio-metabolic characteristics with the cohort and following the intervention</summary>
