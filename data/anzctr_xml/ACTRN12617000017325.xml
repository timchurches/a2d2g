    <interventions>MORSim is team-training intervention designed to improve information sharing between team members, improve communication strategies and develop mutual respect and trust between Operating Room (OR) staff. 
The educational framework used is the Salas Model of effective teams. Whole operating room teams participate in immersive, simulated surgical cases where the challenges to teamwork and communication are amplified in order to demand optimal processes and expose deficiencies. Each simulation is followed by a structured debrief, led by trained and accredited simulation instructors, exploring reactions, clarifying scenario details to ensure a shared understanding of what happened, exploring what actually happened and why, and drawing lessons on communication and teamwork to apply to clinical practice. The debrief lasts approximately 45 minutes. Simulation based training is supported by communication skills training comprising four separate 30 minute workshops on the principles of teamwork and shared mental model; speaking up; closed loop communication; and structured recap. Workshops include videos, slide presentations and small group discussion. The communication skills training is delivered by trained and accredited MORSim instructors at the DHB. 
The simulator used is a 3G Laerdal Simman, set in a simulated or real operating room environment, and integrated with realistic custom-designed surgical models of trauma or pathology requiring a specific clinical response. All patient notes, laboratory investigations, equipment, drugs, fluids and consumables such as surgical drapes, gowns, gloves and masks will be provided as in a real theatre case. 
The simulated cases will be modelled on real life cases, and include up to 25 different surgical scenarios in the disciplines of general surgery, ENT/ORL, urology, plastics and orthopaedics. A full team training intervention comprises 1 full day of simulations, debriefs and discussion. In each day, there will be 4-5 simulations and debriefs. 
Simulations will be chosen from the 25 available scenarios based on the participants attending the session. As nursing, technician and anaesthesia staff work across all of the surgical disciplines portrayed in the scenarios. choice of scenario will be based on the discipline of the surgeon or surgeons attending any particular course, also ensuring that participants have not previously been exposed to that scenario. 
The intervention will be delivered at each District Health Board (DHB) in New Zealand and may be run either in existing operating theatres or in a purpose built simulation facility. The intervention will be progressively rolled out across all 20 DHBs over a 5 year time frame, in four cohorts with five DHBs in each. Cohorts are matched for DHB size. Cohort 1 training will commence on January 27th 2017, Cohort 2, 3 and 4 training will commence 9-12 month intervals between 2017 and 2021. 
Delivery of the intervention is by trained, accredited instructors. The Project team will deliver the initial courses at each DHB and train local staff as instructors through a structured training programme with ongoing monitoring and support. Course quality will be monitored and assured through a central accreditation process, instructor networks and instructor exchange. 
The MORSim team training days will be ongoing on a regular basis in each DHB, with an expectation that all OR staff will participate in a full course at least once every five years. We aim to train the majority of NZ OR staff during the course of this project and estimate that this will be over 6000 operating theatre staff. 
The intervention will run from Jan 27th 2017, beginning in Cohort 1, until December 21st 2021 at which stage the intervention will be running in all four Cohorts (i.e. all DHBs in New Zealand). 
Our primary outcome measure, days alive and out of hospital will be measure at 90 days post surgery for all patients undergoing surgery in New Zealand public hospitals. It will be measured continuously from one year prior to the start of training in Cohort 1, to one year after the end of faculty-assisted training in Cohort 4. This covers the period 1 February 2016 to 31 December 2021. 
</interventions>
    <comparator>We are using a stepped wedge cluster design with staged roll-out of the intervention across the 20 DHBs in New Zealand in four cohorts at 9-12 month intervals, over a period of 5 years. 
Using this design, the DHBs will act as their own controls as the intervention progressively rolls out across cohorts.

The remaining DHBs were randomly allocated to Cohorts 2, 3 and 4. using a stratified allocation to ensure each Cohort contained the same distribution of large to small DHBs. Due to the pragmatic nature of quality improvement interventions, DHBs unable to participate in the training at their allocated time are able to swap with a DHB of a similar size in a subsequent Cohort. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>The Primary Outcome measure (DAOH at 90 days), will be calculated from the National Minimum Data Set and the Mortality Data set. A score of zero is given for any death during the 90 day period. For all patients alive at 90 days, the DAOH score is 90 minus the number of days in hospital from the date of the surgical procedure. A second operation within the 90 day period will be treated as the same event. We will include only patients in the surgical disciplines receiving the intervention, patients requiring an overnight admission, and patients undergoing regional or general anaesthesia. 
Data will be collected continuously from one year prior to one year post implementation of the MORSim team training intervention across all DHBs. Utilising the stepped wedge cluster design, we will use general linear modelling to estimate the effect of the intervention on DAOH. 
Information on gender, age, surgical procedure, ASA status will also be collected and factored in to the analysis. 
Patients DAOH 90 scores will be collated into monthly units according to the procedure date. We will then calculate the mean scores for each cohort for each month, and the means will be classified into pre-intervention and post-intervention categories relative to whether or not any given cohort has started the MORSim training. We will subject these means to a range of general linear model tests. We identify the effect of variables such as patient demographics, morbidity, and procedures that may contribute to variations. 
We will conduct a similar comparative analysis for Days Out of Hospital (for survivors); for post-surgery mortality; a defined set of post-surgery complications (for example wound infection, renal impairment, thrombotic event). 
We will use a similar approach to the analysis of the ACC claims data base for treatment injury claims (number and costs).  

The SSCS and MORSim teamwork perceptions surveys will be analysed by cohort and DHB. The surveys will be provided to participants with identifiable numbers, which will enable us to conduct paired t-tests of pre- and post-intervention survey responses from the same individuals. We will also collect data on which staff have received the training, and this will enable us to establish the "dose effect" of intervention. 

We will analyse observational data collected via the WHOBARS tool by cohort and DHB, and conduct pre- and post-intervention t-tests on the WHOBARS scores. Because our observational and training records will enable us to identify the proportion of observed staff, and OR staff in each DHB, who have been trained, we will be able to investigate the relationship between these variables (i.e. the dose) and WHOBARS scores (the effect).

Quantitative measures will be compared between pre- and post-rollout phases for this stepped wedge design using generalised linear models. Qualitative data from the interviews will undergo generic thematic analysis to identify barriers and enablers to the implementation of MORSim training by DHBs, and improved communication by OR staff. These themes will be analysed separately by DHB.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This project evaluates the effectiveness of the MORSim (Multidisciplinary Operating Room Simulation) training intervention to operating room (OR) staff in all DHBs in New Zealand (NZ). The aim of the intervention is to improve outcomes for surgical patients, and improve teamwork in the OR. 
Our primary hypothesis is that MORSim will lead to improved scores for Days Alive and out of Hospital (DAOH) at 90 days. The MORSim training is for staff in general, orthopaedic, urological, plastics, and ENT/ORL surgery in all DHBs in New Zealand. Each training session will be provided by accredited instructors to multidisciplinary teams of about 10 staff. The training comprises realistic simulations of challenging surgical cases, debriefs of the cases, and discussions of specific teamwork and communication strategies. The training focusses on shared mental models, structured communication, and mutual respect and trust. 
The MORSim training will be rolled out through all NZ DHBs in four cohorts of five DHBs over a period of five years. We will conduct a concurrent evaluation throughout using a stepped wedge cluster research design. This design will allow us to compare pre- and post-intervention cohorts, and enhance our capacity to separate training effects from long term trends and changes in the DHBs.
Staff interviews will seek to identify factors that assist or inhibit the implementation of MORSim training in the different DHBs. 
Primary Outcome Measure:
Days Alive and Out of Hospital (at 90 days). This looks at patients who are alive AND the number of days they are out of hospital, in the 90 days following surgery. We will also analyse mortality, and days out of hospital separately. The data for this analysis will be drawn from the NMDS.
Secondary Outcome Measures: 
Post-surgical complications from the NMDS.Number and costs of post-surgical treatment injury claims, from ACC data base.
Safety Climate pre-post intervention survey using the Surgical Culture Safety Survey developed and validated by the Harvard School of Public Health.
Teamwork perceptions pre-post intervention survey, using a tool we have custom-designed to measure MORSim training processes.
The quality of implementation of the Safe Surgery Checklist pre-post intervention, measured by the WHOBARS observation instrument, which we have previously developed and validated.
The number and proportion of OR staff trained in the DHBs.
Staff retention and the use of sick leave from DHB records.
Survey feedback about surgical patients experiences recorded in a quarterly survey administered by the HQSC.
Interview data exploring the organisational implementation process in the DHBs and how staff apply the training in their OR work. (Thematic Analysis).
