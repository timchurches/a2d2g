  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Tablets were self administered by the participants for 14 days.  Blood samples were  drawn for laboratory analysis and safety measures (full blood count, liver function tests and serum urea, electrolytes and creatinine).  Baseline blood was drawn for laboratory measures of study parameters at day 1, day1+3hours, day 13 and day 14.  Blodd measured for Ex vivo blood tests  Ex vivo blood analysis includes the assessment of changes in the following lymphocyte subsets:
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Mature T cells
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	B cells
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Helper/Inducer T cells
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Suppressor/Cytotoxic T cells
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Natural killer cells

Assessment of changes in non-specific immune response includes:
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Phagocytosis of granulocytes
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Respiratory burst of granulocytes

Assessment of changes in specific immune response includes:
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Lymphocyte activation
Ã¿Â¿Ã¿Â·	Production of the following 6 cytokines:
o	IL-2, INFa and INFg for type 1 immune response
o	IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 for type 2 immune response</summary>
