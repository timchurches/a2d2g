  <interventions>
    <interventions>Orthokeratology lenses will be prescribed for overnight wear to a group of participants for a period of 9 months,.  At cross-over (after 9 months), the type of lens worn will be changed between the two groups of participants and the lenses will be worn for a further 9 months period.</interventions>
    <comparator>standard single vision frequent replacement soft contact lenses will be worn by another group of participants</comparator>
    <control>Active</control>
    <interventioncode>Treatment: Devices</interventioncode>
  </interventions>
  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>The primary outcome measure is the difference in myopia progression in the orthokeratology lens wearing eyes compared with the eyes wearing single vision soft contact lenses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome measure will be taken at 3, 6 and 9 months after the commencement of wear for each type of contact lens.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1) To compare the accommodation response (focusing accuracy) in participants during orthokeratology lens wear compared with that during soft lens wear over periods of 9 months for each lens modality.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement will be taken at 3, 6 and 9 months for each lens type.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2) To determine objectively the visual function in central and paracentral retinal areas with orthokeratology lenses compared with soft contact lenses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Measurement will be taken at 3, 6 and 9 months for each lens type.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>
  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>All participants are required to have myopic refractive error between -1.00D and -3.25D; to provide evidence of myopia progression in the past 6 months (approx. -0.5D); free of ocular disease or any contraindication to RGP lens or soft lens wear; have with the rule corneal toricity of &lt;1.50D; have no history of current RPG lens wear and both eyes correctable to at least 6/6</inclusivecriteria>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Newly published data suggests that children wearing Orthokeratology (OK) lenses demonstrate less myopia progression than an age-matched control group wearing spectacles. The findings lend some support to anecdotal claims by clinicians that Orthokeratology lenses appear to retard myopia progression. The aims of this work are to test the hypothesis that wearing Orthokeratology lenses reduces myopia progression compared with soft lenses in young adult myopes.</summary>
