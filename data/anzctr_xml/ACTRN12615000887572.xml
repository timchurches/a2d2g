  <interventions>
    <interventions>The internet Health Anxiety Program program comprises 6 lessons completed over 12 weeks. It includes all treatment components typically seen in face­-to­-face cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (the first­-line treatment for severe health anxiety). One lesson will be completed every 7 to 14 days (it will become available after the preceding lesson has been completed, with a minimum of 5 days between lessons and a maximum of 14 days). Each lesson will take approximately 20-30 minutes to complete. Participants will have access to summaries of each lesson, homework exercises, extra resources, email contact from the clinician (registered clinical psychologist) after completion of the first two lessons, then as required. The participant is also able to email or phone the clinician at any point during the trial as required. The participant completes a measure of psychological distress before each lesson and if their scores increase by one or more standard deviations the clinician is automatically alerted and initiates contact with the participant by phone or email.

Strategies used to improved adherence to intervention protocols and procedures for monitoring adherence include: automated email reminders, monitoring the downloading of homework, collection of data on how long participants spent reading lessons and practicing skills.</interventions>
    <comparator>Psychoeducation control group. These participants will complete 6 sets of brief questionnaires (once per fortnight for 12 weeks), and receive 6 fact sheets that explain key information about how to recognise and understand anxiety over the 12 week waiting period. 
Once the immediate treatment group has completed their online program and post-treatment questionnaires (at week 13), the control group will be offered the same internet treatment program for Health Anxiety.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The project aims to evaluate the acceptability and clinical efficacy of the online Health Anxiety Program; and to examine the moderators and mediators of change during the Health Anxiety Program. 


Up to 60 people with Health Anxiety will be randomly assigned to either the active treatment group or a 
control group which receives psychoeducation about anxiety in the form of 6 brief fact sheets. The treatment group will commence the Health Anxiety program immediately, whereas the control group will commence once the treatment group has completed.

The efficacy of the Health Anxiety program will be determined by comparing the health anxiety severity levels of the two groups at the time the treatment group completes treatment. Mediation analyses will be used to explore the role of variables that may influence positive change (such as changes in behaviours, catastrophic thinking, hypervigilance and intolerance of uncertainty)</summary>
