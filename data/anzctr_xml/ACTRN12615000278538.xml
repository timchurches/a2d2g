  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients will be randomised into control group ( Cocoon warming blanket group) and Easywarm blanket group. Control group will be warmed intraoperatively using Cocoon forced air warming blanket and Easywarm group will be warmed using Easywarm blankets. 
Easywarm self-heating blanket consists of pockets of iron with other elements which when exposed to air leads to an exothermic reaction resulting from oxidation of iron. This heats the blanket to 44 degree celcius which lasts upto 10 hours.
It can be separated into two parts and used for both the upper and the lower body.</interventions>
    <comparator>Using Cocoon forced air warming (FAW) blanket to warm patients intraoperatively which is the standard practice at Austin Hospital.
Cocoon FAW consists of an electrical heating unit with a fan which drives air into the blanket which is placed over upper and/or the lower body of the patient depending on the surgical location.
Temperature can be adjusted on the Cocoon blankets depending on the temperature of the patient.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Nasopharyngeal temperature at the end of the operation.
The nasopharyngeal temperature is measured using nasopharyngeal temperature probe.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Final temperature at completion of wound closure.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Average temperature throughout the case. 
All temperature recording will be via the Nasopharyngeal temperature probe. Average temperature will be calculated by adding the temperatures and dividing by the number of temperature points recorded.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline temperature (at completion of draping) then every hour and final temperature at wound closure.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Suitable patients will be selected by the research team. The anaesthetist involved will be approached and explained about the trial. The patients will then be randomised into one of the groups. Patients will be warmed using Cocoon forced air warming (FAW) blanket if selected into Control group or Easywarm blanket if selected into Easywarm group. </concealment>
    <sequence>40 patients will be randomised to either Cocoon FAW blanket (Control group) or Easywarm blanket group in 1:1 ratio.
Randomisation will be by random selection of shuffled opaque envelopes containing group allocation.</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Descriptive statistical terms will be used to describe the demographics of our study group. If data is normally distributed t-test will be used. If variables do not have a normal distribution then Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used. The p value, 95% confidence interval will be reported for normally distributed values. Median and interquartile range will be reported for non-parametric values.
Sample size calculation:
A significant difference between the two groups would be a temperature difference of 0.5 degree Celcius. With an alpha level (p value) of 0.05 and beta value of 0.8% an estimated standard deviation of 0.5 degrees and an estimated change in temperature of 0.5 degrees we would need a sample size of 31 patients.
To allow for data loss we aim to recruit 40 patients. Sample size is based on primary outcome only. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Multiple clinical trials have shown that perioperative hypothermia affects multiple organ systems and leads to adverse surgical outcomes. 
Cocoon Forced Air Warming (FAW) Blanket is one of the devices being used in Austin Hospital to minimise intraoperative hypothermia.
Our aim is to compare the efficacy of Easywarm self-heating blankets with Cocoon FAW blanket in preventing intraopearative hypothermia by conducting a small randomised control trial.
Patients undergoing relaxant general anaesthesia in supine position will be randomised into two groups. The control group will be warmed using Cocoon FAW and the other group will be warmed using Easywarm blanket.
Easywarm blanket has not yet been compared with the FAW devices. The information we obtain from the project will help us to choose the optimal warming device in clinical practice. </summary>
