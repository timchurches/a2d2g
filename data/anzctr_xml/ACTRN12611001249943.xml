or
First water-based lubricant then silicone-based lubricant.
Both lubricants are safe and available and widely used as over the counter preparations. Participants should apply a small amount of lubricant around the entrance of the vagina prior to sexual activity or intercourse. Each lubricant will be used as determined by the user for 1 month before changing to the alternative lubricant. There will be no washout period between lubricants.</interventions>
    <comparator>Non-hormonal lubricants. Active control. Crossover design.
The water based lubricant will be deemed the control in this study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To compare the efficacy and acceptablility of a silicone-based vaginal lubricant vs. a water-based lubricant in breast cancer patients with symptomatic vaginal dryness using a randomised AB/BA cross-over design. We will evaluate vaginal dryness using both subjective and objective measures. The vaginal Health Assessment will be assessed by the study doctor and Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) Discomfort subscale complete by the participant.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be completed before commencement of the preparation. Again at 1 month following completion of the first preparation and then again at 2 months after completion of the second preparation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will evaluate discomfort at intercourse using objective measures. The Sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) Discomfort subscale and Female Intervention Efficay Index (FIEI).</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be completed before commencement of the preparation. Again at 1 month following completion of the first preparation and then again at 2 months after completion of the second preparation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will evaluate sexual activity using a sexual activity diary and patient perceived efficacy will be measured using standardised and validated scales (sexual Activity Questionnaire (SAQ) Discomfort subscale , the Female Intervention Efficay Index (FIEI)</outcome>
      <timepoint>The diary will be completed by the participant daily during the duration of the study. Other measures will be completed before commencement of the preparation. Again at 1 month following completion of the first preparation and then again at 2 months after completion of the second preparation.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate sexual function and quality of life using the Sexual Activity Questionnaire, general quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Breast Cancer (FACT-B), endocrine symptoms using the Functional Assessment of cancer Therapy for Patients with Endocrine Symptoms (FACT-ES, and distress using the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised.</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be completed before commencement of the preparation. Again at 1 month following completion of the first preparation and then again at 2 months after completion of the second preparation.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>We will assess vaginal condition using a standardised visual method and patient acceptability of the products. Since anxiety and depression after breast cancer may also affect sexual function, we will measure these factors using the standardised Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</outcome>
      <timepoint>These measures will be completed before commencement of the preparation. Again at 1 month following completion of the first preparation and then again at 2 months after completion of the second preparation.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia (pain occurring during sexual intercourse) is a common consequence of treatment for breast cancer and has been identified as one of the most common and troublesome consequences for survivors. Vaginal dryness and pain during sexual intercourse significantly negatively impacts on quality of life. With improved survival from breast cancer the absolute number of breast cancer patients affected by symptomatic vaginal dryness and dyspareunia is likely to increase. 
 
Systemic or topical (vaginal) estrogens are an effective treatment for symptoms of vaginal dryness.  However, the safety of vaginal oestrogens after breast cancer is not established.
Water-based lubricants are widely used and silicone based lubricants are also available for vaginal lubrication. However, the relative effectiveness and acceptability of these products is not known. No previous studies have evaluated silicone-based vaginal lubricants for the treatment of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia after breast cancer or compared these with water-based lubricants.
Aims:  The primary aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and acceptability of a silicone-based vaginal lubricant vs. a water-based lubricant in breast cancer patients with symptomatic vaginal dryness using a randomised cross over design.  The Secondary Objective is to clinically assess the symptoms and signs of vaginal dryness, evaluate quality of life and sexual function using established questionnaires.
Study Population: 40 subjects with a history of breast cancer complaining of vaginal dryness will be recruited from the Menopause After Cancer Clinic (MSAC) at The Royal Womens Hospital Melbourne (RWH), the RWH Breast Clinic, oncologist practices in Victoria and community based breast cancer organisations such as the Breast Cancer Network Australia and by media advertising.
 
Methods: To participate in this study subjects must have a history of breast cancer, be sexually active and be complaining of vaginal dryness for at least 4 weeks. Subjects will be asked to attend 3 clinic visits.   
 
Ethical Issues: Subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires including details of sexual problems and function and to complete a sexual activity diary. Subjects will be fully informed of the requirements before enrolling in the study and able to withdraw at any time without compromising their care. These vaginal lubricants are not systemically absorbed and are extremely unlikely to impact on breast cancer management or prognosis.</summary>
