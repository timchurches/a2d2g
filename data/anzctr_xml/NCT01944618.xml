    <interventions>Treatment: drugs - Forxiga

T2DM patients newly prescribed Forxiga - A post-marketing evaluation of the safety of Forxiga (10 mg tablets, orally once daily for 6 months) through an observational prescription adverse event monitoring program (registry-based monitoring program) is warranted to assess real-world incidence of adverse events in routine clinical practice.


Treatment: drugs: Forxiga
FORXIGA is a prescription medicine used with diet, exercise and sometimes other medicines (which may include metformin; insulin; a sulfonylurea medicine such as gliclazide, glimepiride and glibenclamide; or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor [DPP 4 inhibitor] such as sitagliptin or saxagliptin) to control the levels of blood sugar (glucose) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
