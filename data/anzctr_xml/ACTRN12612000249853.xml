  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study aims to investigate the efficacy of naturally occurring edible compounds, that effect (block or activate) ion channels on nerves and some cells involved in inflammation, used topically to reduce the symptoms of chronic eczema. 
The eczema study will investigate patients with Dermatologist or Allergist diagnosed eczema who have significantly impaired quality of life and frequent need for moisturising creams and topical steroids.   
A randomized, controlled, crossover clinical trial will be undertaken with 2 sequential arms of treatment, 13 weeks duration each, and a 2 week washout period between each arm. One of the treatment arms will be active and one will be placebo. Patients will have a SCORAD completed at weeks 0 and 13 of each treatment arm with weekly PO-SCORAD measurements for self completion in between. Use of steroid cream, number of infected eczema episodes and quality of life measures will also be recorded. 
Patients will be recruited through specialist allergist and dermatology rooms.</summary>
