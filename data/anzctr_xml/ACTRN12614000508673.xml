  <interventions>
    <interventions>To compare Usual Care (UC) with an innovative interactive therapeutic robot (PARO) and with a look-alike Plush Toy (PT - without the artificial intelligent aspects of the robot) in terms of reducing emotional and behavioural (agitation) symptoms of dementia. PARO is a therapeutic pet-type robot, with the appearance of a baby harp seal and it is the size of a newborn baby. It has tactile sensors and moves its tail and flippers, and opens its eyes when petted. Artificial intelligence software changes the robots behaviours based on an array of sensors that monitor sound, light, temperature and touch. It responds to sounds, can learn its name and learns to respond to words its owner uses frequently. It can show emotions such as surprise, happiness and anger and will cry if it is not receiving sufficient attention. It produces sounds similar to a real baby seal and is active during the day and asleep at night. Participants allocated to the PARO condition will be introduced to and left to play with the robot delivered by the trained research assistants (RAs) at the start of each session and collected at the end of each session. Participants will receive three individual non-facilitated PARO sessions per week, for 15 minutes for 10 weeks.  
RAs will be kept constant for each individual throughout the intervention. Video observation will be done during intervention via a small unobtrusive video camera held by the RA, who will sit in a position where video footage can be captured without the RA being intrusive. </interventions>
    <comparator>Participants will receive three individual non-facilitated PT sessions per week, for 15 minutes for 10 weeks. The PT looks like PARO but has no robotic features. Participants allocated to the usual care condition will receive UC. A 10-week intervention will allow both short (5 week-same as pilot) and long-term follow-up (10 weeks). We will also conduct a follow-up 15-week period to examine long-term sustainability following withdrawal of the intervention, and this will assist with the cost comparison of the interventions.</comparator>

      <outcome>Changes in types and frequency of agitation and mood measured by Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory - Short Form (CMAI-SF; 14 short item).</outcome>
      <timepoint>CMAI-SF  - prior to randomisation and during intervention - 5 sessions, 15-mins before intervention and during the 15-mins intervention. The 5 observed sessions are scheduled at week 0 (baseline), 1, 5, 10, 15 (5 sessions observed in total; total of 2.5 hours per participant).</timepoint>

      <outcome>Engagement measured by video observations (Noldus Observer XT).</outcome>
      <timepoint>Noldus Observation - 5 sessions, 15-mins before intervention and during the 15-mins intervention. Also collected at 15-weeks post-intervention.  The 5 observed sessions are scheduled at week 0 (baseline), 1, 5, 10, 15 (5 sessions observed in total; total of 2.5 hours per participant).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Sleep patterns measured by SenseWear arm monitors placed on each participant's arm.</outcome>
      <timepoint>The SenseWear armband will be placed on each participant for a 24-hour period at week 0 (baseline), and 2 x 24 hour periods at weeks 5 and 10 on a day when the PARO or PT intervention is being delivered and during usual care. Also collected at 15-weeks post-intervention.</timepoint>

    <concealment>27 RACFs which agree to participate will be randomized within 2 strata, into one of the three groups, 1) PARO, 2) PT, 3) UC.
For each stratum, random permutations will be produced with the starting number taken independently for each stratum. Randomly variable block sizes will be used. Other potential cofounders such as building, design and/or staffing will be adjusted accordingly in the analysis. </concealment>

    <statisticalmethods>Cluster and Individual level analyses will be carried out to test all hypotheses. Complex analytic approaches that include the Generalised Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Estimation Equations (GEE) and Multi-Level Modeling (MLM), which allow adjustment for potential covariates at both cluster and individual levels, will be used. In line with outcomes observed in the pilot study and similar
outcomes in other research using an individualised intervention for agitation reduction sample size of 345 participants, 115 in each arm, will be required to detect a 25% reduction in agitation level (at a power of 0.90, a = .05). The sample size was computed using two steps. Sample size required for a simple randomised complete trial design (RCT) was 75 in each arm. This was then multiplied by the design effect to account for the nested structure in a C-RCT. Adjusted to account for clustering based on an Intra Class Correlation (ICC) of 0.0730 we determined that at least 115 patients would be required in each arm if we were to use 10 clusters per arm (n=345). Allowing for a potential drop out of 10% will increase the total targeted sample to a recruitment sample of 380 participants. To ensure this sample size we will involve 27 sites in the study with a target of 13 participants at each site. </statisticalmethods>
