    <interventions>The intervention is an educational training program that aims to reduce the needle stick injuries. The intervention will be based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model. The training program  will be a one day workshop that will include the face to face lectures, group discussion and role play. The work shop will be modeled based on the literature search such as the recommendation of WHO and CDC. A training of trainers will be done by the researcher who is a medical officer with Masters in Public Health to selected health care workers from the clinics. The selected health care workers to conduct the workshop at their clinics.The workshop will be conducted at the health clinics by healthcare workers who will be trained using a standardized training manual developed for this study.
The workshop will begin with the ice breaking activity and introduction to the objectives of the workshop as well as ground rules for the participants. This will be followed by lectures to provide information on epidemiology of needle stick injury, blood borne disease and the prevention of needle stick injuries. 
For the motivation construct, group discussions from case scenarios. This case scenarios will be of previous true cases.  
Finally for the behavioral skill construct, problem solving activities based on daily practice encounters that increase needle stick injuries will be used. This will include both role plays and group discussion. The workshop will end with review of lessons learnt, take home messages and t evaluation of the workshop. Certificate of participation will be provides to the participants of the workshop.
</interventions>
    <comparator>The control group will be the waiting list and undergo the usual care.  The usual care will consist of the current practice of needle stick injury prevention training used by the infection control units of the clinics. The intervention training will be provided to the control group upon completion of the study, if the educational training intervention program is found to be effective, The control group is expected to wait for a period of 6 months.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The data will be entered into SPSS version 22 worksheet. The data will be entered as soon as participants are recruited during baseline, until the end of this study. Prior to data analysis, data cleaning will be done and all assumptions will be tested for. The data analysis will be done on the Intention to Treat (ITT) basis in which all the participants will be analyzed according to the group allocated irrespective they completed or loss to the 6 months follow up.
The statistical analysis of this study will be performed by using the SPSS version 22. For categorical data, Chi-square or Fishers exact test will be used while for continuous data an independent t test will be used. Generalized Estimating Equation method will be used to analysis the primary and the secondary outcomes of this study to account for clustering effect. The data will be reported as adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and P-values.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This educational training program is a cluster randomized control trial that aims to reduce the needle stick injury. The participants will be health care workers in the health clinics. Participants in this study are randomly allocated (by chance) to one of two groups. 
Participants in the intervention group will attend one day workshop which will include face to face lectures, group discussion and roleplays by trained peer health care workers from their clinics. The content of the training program will include knowledge on needle stick injury and its prevention strategies, blood borne diseases transmitted by needle stick injury. Participants in the control group will be on the waiting list still the study is completed and will be exposed to the usual care of training on needle stick injury conducted by the infectious control unit of their clinics. If the training workshop is effective, the control group will receive the training upon completion of the study.
A self-administered questionnaire that will be validated and tested for reliability will be used to collect data from the participants. Participants from both groups will be asked to complete questionnaires before the training program begins (baseline), at 1 month, 3 month and again at 6 months, in order to determine the effect of the program on needle stick injury.
