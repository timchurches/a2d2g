  <interventions>
    <interventions>This study involves the administration of Chemotherapy regimes for duration of 2 years. Control group (standard risk and medium risk patients) receives standard chemotherapy regimen for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in children. Intervention group (high risk and very high risk patients) receives standard chemotherapy regimen similar to the control group plus 2 courses of three different chemotherapy regimes.

Standard chemotherapy regime (given in the following order):

Protocol 1 Days 1-33: 
Prednisolone 60mg/m2 intravenous(IV) or per os(PO) ie through the mouth Vincristine 1.5mg/m2 IV L'Asparaginase 5000IU/m2 intramuscular injection (IMI) Daunorubicin 30mg/m2 IV intrathecal (IT) Methotrexate(MTX) Age related dose 1-2years 8mg 2-3 years 10mg &gt;3years 12mg 

Protocol 1 Days 36-79: 
Cytarabine 75mg/m2 IV or subcutaneous (SC) Mercaptopurine 60mg/m2 PO Cyclophosphamide 1000mg/m2 IV IT MTX age related doses as above 

Protocol M Days 1-57: 
Mercaptopurine 25mg/m2 PO Methotrexate 5000mg/m2 IV 4500mg/m2 IV IT Methotrexate age related doses as above Folinic Acid 15mg/m2 IV 

Protocol II Days 1-36:
Dexamethasone 10mg/m2 PO Vincristine 1.5mg/m2 IV L-Asparaginase 10 000 Iu /m2 IMI Doxorubicin 30mg/m2 IV IT Methotrexate age related dose as above 

Protocol II Days 36-49: 
Cytarabine 75mg/m2 IV or SC Thioguanine 60mg/m2 PO IT Methotrexate age related dose as above Cyclophosphamide 1000mg/m2 IV 

Maintenance Therapy: 
Required until a total of 104 weeks of therapy has been completed Mercaptopurine 50mg/m2/day PO Methotrexate 20mg/m2/week PO 

Additional chemotherapy regimes (intervention): 
Interventional group will receive protocol 1 (as in the standard chemotherapy regime) and then either 1 or 2 courses of three different chemotherapy regimes (described below) depending on risk. Each High Risk block should be given at five week intervals and ideally no break between courses. The patients will then receive protocol II and Maintenance therapy (as in the standard chemotherapy regime). Patients classified as very high risk may or may not receive a stem cell transplant depending on if there is a suitable donor. If they do receive a stem cell transplant then these patients do not receive the second chemotherapy course.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Most children with leukaemia are cured, but those with the worst forms do less well.  This trial is testing new ways of combining the most effective drugs, and adding a tranplant for children with the worst forms of leukaemia and a suitable donor.  This tiral will determine if these new approaches could improve cure rates, and if they could be used more widely.</summary>
