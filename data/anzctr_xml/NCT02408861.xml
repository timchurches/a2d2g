               -  Inclusion and exclusion criteria for this cohort are the same as above, with the
                  following rule for CD4 count based on tolerability in Phase I; if, participants
                  with lymphocyte T CD4 count between 100-200/mm^3 (Stratum 2) are shown to
                  tolerate treatment in the Phase I dose de-escalation portion at the same dose
                  level as those with CD4 counts &gt; 200/mm^3 (Stratum 1), participants in the
                  expansion cohort with CD4 counts &gt;= 100/mm^3 are permitted; otherwise, the

               -  The lesion being considered for palliative radiation is not a target lesion

          -  Participants with known brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases must be excluded
             unless they qualify for enrollment as described below because of poor prognosis and
             concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events; participants with brain metastases
             are permitted if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks or more after treatment is
             complete and within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration

             with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other
             immunosuppressive medications within 2 weeks of study drug administration; these drugs
             may interfere with the activity of ipilimumab and nivolumab if administered at the
             time of the first ipilimumab dose; inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement
             doses =&lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active
             autoimmune disease; participants are permitted to use topical, ocular,
             intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic
             absorption); physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids are permitted,
             even if &gt;= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents; a brief course of corticosteroids for
             prophylaxis (e.g., contrast dye allergy) or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions
             (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is

             anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), anti-programmed cell death ligand 2
             (PD-L2), anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting
             T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways; prior immune modulating therapy
             including vaccines may be eligible; prior immune events must be evaluated and the risk
             for new events which may represent continued sub clinical disease or a new process at
             previously damaged site or immune potentiation (e.g. ipilimumab followed by IL2
             causing bowel perforation, ipilimumab followed by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO]
             inhibitor resulting in clinical hypophysitis); please keep in mind that inflammatory
             events may occur weeks to months following the last dose of ipilimumab and possibly
             nivolumab; assessment of potential effects of prior therapy should include:

             (AEs)

          -  The participant has a primary brain tumor

          -  Participant has &gt;= grade 2 diarrhea (participants with grade 1 diarrhea are eligible
             provided stool for ova/parasites and stool cryptosporidium studies are negative)

          -  Opportunistic infection within the last 3 months

          -  Participants with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that
             might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive
             treatment including systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded; these include but
             are not limited to patients with a history of immune related neurologic disease,
             multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome,

             psoriasis controlled with topical medication and participants with positive serology,
             such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-thyroid antibodies should be evaluated for
             the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but
             should otherwise be eligible; participants are permitted to enroll if they have
             vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune
             condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of nivolumab when given with
      ipilimumab in treating patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated classical
      Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement or does not respond to
      treatment, or solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed
      by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may block tumor growth
      in different ways by targeting certain cells. Ipilimumab is an antibody that acts against a
      molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). CTLA-4 controls a part of your
      immune system by shutting it down. Nivolumab is a type of antibody that is specific for human
      programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), a protein that is responsible for destruction of immune
      cells. Giving ipilimumab with nivolumab may work better in treating patients with HIV
      associated classical Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors.</summary>
