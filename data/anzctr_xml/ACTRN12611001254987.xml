  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>1. SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of repaglinide. After repaglinide administration, higher concentrations were seen in the SLCO1B1*15 carriers.
Two common SLCO1B1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) c.A388G and c.T521C form four functionally distinct SLCO1B1 haplotypes: *1a (c.388A/c.521T), *1b (c.388G/c.521T), *5 (c.388A/c.521C), and *15 (c.388G/c.521C).
2. Pitavastatin can increase plasma concentrations of repaglinide independent of SLCO1B1 genetic polymorphism, but has no effect on pharmacodynamics of repaglinide in healthy volunteers.</summary>
