  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Background:

      The new hollow fibre FX-class of dialysers (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany)
      features a number of technological improvements that may benefit the patient. This includes
      the use of the advanced high-flux polysulfone membrane, HelixoneÂ®, which has an extremely
      high endotoxin retaining capability. Theoretically leading to reduced systemic inflammation
      in the patient, which is an important factor for morbidity and mortality with dialysis.

      The dialysis membrane is the first to be manufactured using membrane-spinning procedures
      (nano-controlled spinning technology) that enables the membrane to be modulated at the
      nano-scale level. The resultant membrane is able to extremely efficiently remove middle
      molecules, along with minimal loss of albumin.

      These features may lead to improved patient outcomes, including reduced systemic inflammation
      and improved quality of life.

      Aims:

        1. To assess the short-term effects of the FX-class Dialyser on quality of life in stable
           haemodialysis patients

        2. To assess the short-term effects of the FX-class Dialyser on inflammatory markers in
           stable haemodialysis patients.</summary>
