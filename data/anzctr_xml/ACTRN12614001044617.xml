    <interventions>This study will look to assess the safety and response of knee osteoarthritis to different dosing and injection protocols of stromal vascular fraction (SVF), platelet rich plasma (PRP) and Hyaluronic acid (HA).  Sixty four participants will be enrolled in the study and randomly separated into 4 study groups.

Group 1: Placebo Day 0 (Intravenous (IV) + Intra-articular (IA)) and  placebo IA at Days 7, 14 and 21 
Group 2: SVF + PRP (IA) + placebo (IV) at Day 0, and placebo IA at Days (7, 14 and 21) 
Group 3: SVF (IV + IA) + PRP (IA) at Day 0, and placebo (IA Days 7, 14 and 21)
Group 4: SVF (IV +IA) + PRP/HA (IA) at Day 0, and PRP (IA) at Days 7, 14 and 21

Autologous non-expanded SVF from adipose (fat) will be used due to the ease of harvest (liposuction) and safety. On average 100 million cells are injected into the joint and 1.5 million/kg intravenously. Adipose tissue is removed by lipo-aspiration (about 60 minutes). The fat is processed on-site to isolate the cells (this process takes up to 40 mins). The suspension of stem cells is injected into the knee joint under ultrasound guidance, and intravenously (about 60 minutes). The PRP (3ml) process involves separating out platelets with plasma from a small amount of blood taken, and takes about 15 mins. Hyaluronic acid is approved for use in Australia and is routinely used in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, 1 mL will be injected into the joint. 

The harvesting of adipose and the PRP processing will be performed on the same day as the injection of SVF and PRP, respectively.

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Safety will be assessed by monitoring for Adverse Events (including abnormal laboratory test results) over the study interval. Adverse Events will be graded by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v 4.0 (CTCAE) and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology

Adverse events monitoring will consist of blood laboratory tests (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation and inflammat), and measurement of vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration).

    <concealment>Primarily participants will be recruited from the pool currently existing within the Investigator Practices and by posters in each clinic. Other recruitment for the clinical trial will be via referral from other medical practitioners or limited newspaper/website advertisement in the Sydney, Newcastle and Gold Coast regions.

After direct enquiry from a possible participant or after an initial phone based screen, participants will be invited to attend for a formal assessment to ascertain their suitability for the trial. If suitable they will be invited to enrol in the study and then complete a formal informed consent.

Formally enrolled participants will then be randomly allocated to a study group/arm by the study administrator using a randomisation computer program (www.randomizer.org)

    <endpoint>Safety/efficacy</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>This study is primarily to assess the safety profile of SVF. 
However, a sample size estimate was undertaken for the secondary exploratory efficacy endpoint of the WOMAC score.

The chosen sample size of 64 patients allows for 16 patients per treatment cohort which is sufficient to detect a difference between placebo and SVF groups in the mean percentage change over time in WOMAC scores of 20% with a standard deviation of 10% or difference of 10% with a much larger standard deviation of 20%.

All efficacy analyses will be performed using the ITT population. The WOMAC and the AQoL/Oxford questionnaires will be scored according to the authors instructions. For each post-baseline assessment the change in score from baseline will be calculated. In addition, each patient will be classified as achieving a clinically relevant change in score using the pre-defined cutoffs (30% for WOMAC, and a minimal important clinical difference (MICD) of 0.06 and 5 points for AQol utility score and the Oxford Knee Instrument, respectively). The actual scores and change in scores will be summarised by timepoint and treatment group (overall and by cohort) using descriptive statistical (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) whilst achievement of a clinically relevant change will be summarised by treatment group and timepoint (overall and by cohort) using frequencies and percentages.

For WOMAC an exploratory mixed model will be fitted with WOMAC score as the outcome variable and treatment group, cohort, timepoint and baseline score as covariates. Other relevant prognostic factors may be included in the model (to be fully defined in the SAP). The dependence in the data will be addressed through appropriate modelling of the subject covariance matrix (to be fully defined in the SAP). The adjusted mean change in score at each timepoint for each treatment, together with the adjusted mean difference in treatments will be estimated from the model and presented with 95% confidence limits. The comparisons are predefined at 12 months as cohort 2, 3 and 4 vs cohort 1 (SVF IA, SVF (IA + IV) and SVF + PRP + HA vs placebo) and cohorts 3 and 4 vs cohort 2 (SVF (IA + IV) and SVF + PRP + HA vs SVF IA). Due to the exploratory nature of the study no adjustment for multiplicity will be undertaken.

A similar approach will be followed for clinically meaningful change in AQoL/SF-36/Oxford Knee.

For achievement of a clinically meaningful change in WOMAC each patient will be classified as Yes or No, forming a binary outcome variable. A logistic regression model will be fitted with achievement of a clinically relevant change in score during the trial (Yes/No) as the outcome variable and treatment group, cohort, baseline WOMAC score and other relevant prognostic factors (to be defined in the SAP) as covariates. Adjusted odds ratios for SVF IA, SVF (IA + I V) and SVF + PRP + HA vs placebo and SVF (IA +IV) and SVF + PRP + HA vs SVF IA at 12 months will be extracted from the model and presented with 95% confidence limits. In addition the estimated proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant change in WOMAC will be extracted for each treatment group and presented with 95% confidence limits. As this is an exploratory analysis no adjustment for multiplicity will be undertaken.</statisticalmethods>

    <summary>The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of autologous stromal vascular
fraction (SVF) compared to placebo in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

Secondary objectives are intended to measure differences between placebo and SVF based therapies including improved pain control, improvement of WOMAC, weight bearing x-rays, improvement in the AQoL (Australian Quality of Life) instrument, reduction in rescue medication consumption and MRI to assess disease modifying activity.</summary>
