  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Influenza is a viral illness that causes much social disruption. It causes serious complications in young children including hospitalisation. Children in child care settings are more likely to be infected. Influenza vaccination can help prevent influenza in adults but data are lacking in young children. This study will determine both direct child benefits (protection, continuity of day care) and indirect benefits of influenza vaccination in reduced work absence (staff, parents), illness in the extended family. The study also measures the social and economic impact of influenza vaccination.</summary>
