Assessment is by questionnaires containing open questions on the participants experience of the intervention, time to complete questionnaire will be recorded, a log recording number of particpants approached,screened, eligible will be taken to assess recruitment strategy.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, 4-weeks intervention/control, final assessment at 6-weeks</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>f)	To evaluate the experience of the participants on the experience of playing active video games via qualitative interview.</outcome>
      <timepoint>After each exercise session during 4-weeks intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
  </outcomes>

    <concealment>Potential participants will be sourced from GP practices and media coverage in the Ipswich Area. GPs will refer patients to the study who may benefit from a structured moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity programme and who meet the eligibility criteria.  Allocation will be concealed by central randomisation by computer.</concealment>
    <sequence>Randomisation will be by Permuted block randomisation with the stratifying factors sex (M,F) and age (&lt;55, 55+). Randomisation will occur after the baseline assessment.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Type 2 diabetes can be prevented and managed through lifestyle modification programmes that include physical activity of a moderate intensity for at least 150 min per week in conjunction with dietary modification and caloric restriction. Yet, only 40% of people diagnosed with the disease are meeting these physical activity targets. This study will investigate if the active video game Nintendo WiiTM sports programme is a safe form of physical activity and has the potential of increasing the self-efficacy of sedentary people with diabetes to increase their overall physical activity levels.</summary>
