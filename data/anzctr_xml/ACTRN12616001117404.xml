  <interventions>
    <interventions>After randomization, the volunteer will take one sachet of hydrolyzed collagen or placebo daily at dinner, during a period of 12 months (from visit V1 to visit V3). 
The 10 mg sachet can be dissolved in a cold or warm drink or mixed into a food such as a yoghurt.

Product compliance will be evaluated at  V2 and V3 in order to check that all included subjects respect the study protocol with respect to the consumption of the study product. To evaluate the compliance, subjects will be asked to bring the non-consumed product sachets at V2 and V3.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to assess the effects of a hydrolyzed collagen on bone mineral density assessed by Dual-enegy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bone metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women with osteopenia.
This study is designed as a monocentric randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with 2 parallel groups.
There is a screening visit (V0) followed by a randomization visit (V1) which takes place four to ten weeks after V0. The experimental phase with placebo or verum product then lasts 12 months. One intermediate follow-up visit (V2) is planned after 6 months of consumption and the end of study visit is performed after 12 months of consumption (V3).
144 healthy postmenopausal women with osteopenia will be recruited for this study, according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.
