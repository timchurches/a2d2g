  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a pilot study to determine the safety and efficacy of a novel adjuvanted hepatitis B
      virus (HBV) vaccine formulated as a potential therapeutic vaccine against chronic HBV
      infection. An ongoing human clinical trial of this HBV vaccine in a prophylactic setting has
      confirmed this vaccine to be more effective at inducing seroconversion as measured by
      development of Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) in poor responder subjects than the
      standard alum-adjuvanted HBV vaccine, providing promise that this new vaccine may also be
      able to induce HBV viral control and/or seroconversion in chronically infected subjects</summary>
