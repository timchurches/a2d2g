  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the programme is to investigate whether parents improve their psychological and social functioning after completion of a Group Interpersonal Psychotherapy Program. 

It is thought that participation will improve  parents psychosocial functioning, social adjustment and general health and this will result in an increase in the amount/quality of positive parental behaviours they implement. Increased positive parenting behaviours will then produce a decrease in child behaviour problems.</summary>
