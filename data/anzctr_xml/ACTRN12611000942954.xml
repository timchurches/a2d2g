    <studytitle>Healthy Eating Learning Program (HELP) Study for Fussy Eaters with no major medical history</studytitle>
    <scientifictitle>In children who are fussy eaters but with no major medical history, is child-focused individual operant conditioning intervention more effective than child-focused group systematic desensitisation intervention at improving dietary variety and nutrition, and decreasing maladaptive mealtime behaviours and parental stress?</scientifictitle>

    <healthcondition>Healthy children who are fussy eaters, but have no major medical history (have never been hospitalized for a primary medical condition, OR have no medical diagnosis e.g. Down Syndrome)</healthcondition>

  <interventions>
    <interventions>Arm One: One-on-one operant conditioning therapy. Run in a 1 hour individual session for 10 sessions with a primary therapist (speech pathologist or occupational therapist). Involves providing a verbal prompt to encourage consumption of spoonfuls of new food/s with positive reinforcement (verbal and/or with toys) upon consumption of these foods. Parents initially observe from behind a one-way mirror and assist in collecting information about the behaviours they are observing in their child. As sessions continue, parents are transitioned into the room, and are trained to offer new foods and provide positive reinforcement by the end of the therapy block. Parents will also receive standardised education about nutrition, behaviour management and feeding development.  

Arm Two: Small group systematic desensitisation therapy. Run in a 1 hour small group session for 10 sessions with a primary therapist (speech pathologist or occupational therapist). Involves the child being exposed to gradually more challenging modelling and play with food (based on a sensory hierarchy of look&gt;smell&gt;touch&gt;taste). Parents initially observe the sessions from behind a one-way mirror with a second therapist and assist in observing transitions and reactions for their child. As the block continues, parents are rotated in and out of the room to assist in modelling play using the sensory hierarchy (i.e. 1 parent and primary therapist in room, 2 parents and secondary therapist outside of room). Parents will also receive standardised education about nutrition, behaviour management and feeding development.

Therapy will be offered in an intensive format (10 times over 1 week) or in a weekly format (10 times over 10 weeks). This will be based on parent choice.</interventions>
    <comparator>Natural control will be waiting for therapy. As recruitment for this study will occur in an ongoing fashion, and the data collection period will continue for a period of at least 18 months, there will be multiple opportunities to access therapy in subsequent blocks if it is not immediately available.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Adequacy of diet and overall increase in dietary variety

Assessed via 3-day weighed food diary, modified Children's Dietary Questionnaire (Magarey et al. 1999) (food frequency questionnaire) and New Food Lists, where parents indicate in an ongoing fashion how many times their child is offered new foods and the number of acceptances and rejections</outcome>

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime behaviours (%desirable vs undesirable behaviours; mealtime duration)

Measured via Behaviour Pediatrics Feeding Assessment (Adapted from Crist et al. 2001) and self-developed HELP Study: Eating Skills and Behaviours Questionnaire. Questionnaires involve parent-rated likert scales (parents rate level of concern).</outcome>

    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Improvement in mealtime interaction between parent and child

Measured via Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (Revised) (Eyberg, 1994). A video-tape is taken of the parent interacting with the child in a non-food related activity, the parent offering their child a preferred food and the parent offering their child a non-preferred food. All videos will be rated externally by the team psychologist who will not be working directly with the children involved.</outcome>

      <timepoint>Baseline 
3 months post-intervention</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>

  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>Children with a history of ongoing fussy eating (persisting for a period of 6 months or longer) but who have never been hospitalized for a primary medical condition (e.g gastroesophageal reflux), or who have never received a medical diagnosis with significant intellectual or developmental implications (e.g. Down Syndrome). 

"Fussy eating" includes:
* Limited dietary variety across the food groups
(diet currently includes less than 10 foods which are predominantly carbohydrates, 10 foods which are predominantly proteins, and 10 fruits/vegetables)
* Limited range of textures consumed (don't eat an age-appropriate range of textures; limit diet to 1 or 2 food textures; consume predominantly 'easy to eat' junk foods)
* Mealtimes are taking longer than 30 minutes
* There are problematic behaviours at mealtimes which are contributing to parental stress</inclusivecriteria>

    <concealment>Children will need to be grouped into above and below 3 years for groups. Sealed envelopes containing 3 stratified participant numbers (i.e. &gt;3 number 1) will be developed using a random number generator before the enrollment commences. This box will be kept under the control of a blinded colleague who will not have direct contact with any of the participants. An intake questionnaire is completed on contact with parents to determine eligibility. Parents provide written consent for their child to participate in the study if they are eligible. After initial assessment, the participants are allocated to &gt;3 years or &lt;3 years and allocated a participant number as per order of enrollment.</concealment>
    <sequence>As per above, sealed envelopes containing 3 (because one arm will be operating in small groups of 3) stratified participants will be developed before the study commences. A computer generated random number sequence will be used to allocate the numbers to sealed envelopes in groups of 3.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will be a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical benefits of two feeding intervention programs for children with a history of fussy eating, but no major medical history. Baseline assessment will include parent completed questionnaires and on-site feeding and growth assessments. There are two arms of intervention. Arm One is an individual operant conditioning arm. Arm Two involves small group systematic desensitisation therapy. Both arms will involve group parent education sessions regarding nutrition, behaviour management and feeding development. Intervention will be provided in either an intensive format (10 times over the course of a week) or in a weekly format (10 times over 10 weeks) at the discretion of the parent.</summary>
