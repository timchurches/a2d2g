    <interventions>Both patients with meniere's disease and a control group will undergo electrocochloegraphy with an added component of the test being introduction of a low frequency stimulus once the usual test is complete. Electocochleography is the placing of a small wire electrode through the ear drum then sending 8kHz, 2kHz, 1kHz and 500Hz sound through the wire and recording the potentials elicited from the ear in respose to these sounds. The test takes about 30min and the extra low frequency component would last about 10 minutes extra. The low frequency component would be a 50Hz sound played at the same time as the the 8kHz, 2kHz, 1kHz and 500Hz noises mentioned as the routine electrocochleographic process and the change in potentials elicited previously recorded. </interventions>
    <comparator>A control group will undergo electrocochloegraphy with an added component of the test being introduction of a low frequency stimulus once the usual test is complete.                                          The control group will be those who attend the clinic of Prof Gibson for investigation of vertigo symptoms who are diagnosed on the Meniere's Clinical Score as having no Meniere's Disease- the current accepted gold standard for the diagnosis of Meniere's disease in the living patient - post mortem examination is the only certain diagnosis currently.                                                                    Controls will be those who suffer from vertigo symptoms but who are would be unlikely to have endolymphatic hydrops (as found in Meniere's disease and diagnosed on electrocochleography) based on history. They may be suffering from such conditions as postural dizziness, benign positional vertigo, or labyrithitis, which do not cause endolymphatic hydrops so these patients would be expected to have a normal electrocochleogram.</comparator>

      <outcome>The change in Summation potential (SP) of the electrocochleograph result when the low frequency stimulus bias is introduced (from electrocochleography SP without stimulus biasing). </outcome>
      <timepoint>The summating potential is first measured in the response elicited to the 8kHz, 2kHz, 1kHz and 500Hz stimuli in the absence of the low frequency bias. Then the low frequency noise is made at the same time as the 8kHz, 2kHz, 1kHz and 500Hz stimuli and the SP generated is again measured for each of these frequencies. The change in the SP amplitude from before to after the introduction of the low frequency bias is then calculated.</timepoint>

      <outcome>Improvement in diagnosis of Meniere's disease when correlated with the current gold standard of clinical diagnosis. </outcome>
      <timepoint>The outcome is measured at the same time as the clinical interview and a direct correlation done comparing the electrocochleography results (with the added low frequency noise)with the clincial score and the basic electrocochleograph  results. This is a cross sectional analysis of diagnosis compared between diagnostic tests - which included the clinical interview, which is the current gold standard. There is no secondary time point.</timepoint>

The 2 investigators are both clinicians, who will be involved in assessment of outcomes and administration of the electrocochleography. There will be comparison of study groups based on demographics before analysis begins to ensure homogeneity of groups plus stratification analysis based on hearing level and stage of Meniere's disease.</designfeatures>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Introduction: The inner ear is a fluid-filled bony cavity divided into 2 parts: the cochlea, which is responsible for hearing, and the vestibular apparatus, which is involved in the maintenance of balance. Menieres disease is a clinical syndrome whereby the patient suffers from deafness, tinnitus, ear fullness and vertigo which characteristically fluctuate. It is thought to be due to attacks of increasing fluid in the inner ear (known as endolymphatic hydrops) and currently is diagnosed using clinical history, examination and hearing and balance tests in combination with an electrical test of the cochlea in response to sound known as electrocochleography (ECochG). The changes in the ECochG responses seen in Menieres disease are considered to reflect the mechano-electric changes in the inner ear caused by endolymphatic hydrops. There are three main ways that the ECochG can be performed based on the position where the electrode is placed: extratympanic (ET), with the electrode placed external to the ear drum, transtympanic (TT), where the electrode is placed through the ear drum, and round window (RW), which requires a window to be opened in the ear drum for the electrode to be placed, therefore may require general anaesthesia. The closer to the round window that the electrode is placed the more robust the ECochG result is. Transtympanic is the preference of Prof Gibson as it can be done under local anaesthetic but maintains a robust result. The ECochG generates a waveform of which the most useful parts for diagnosing Menieres disease are termed the summating potential (SP) and the action potential (AP). There is ongoing debate as how best to use these parts for accurate diagnosis. The SP is thought to reflect the overall change in the electrical gradient in the cochlea created by sound. The basilar membrane is a membrane within the cochlea that is moved by a sound wave and is an important part of sound detection. A theory is that displacement of the basilar membrane is a primary component of generating the SP. If a continuous low frequency sound is transmitted to the ear it causes a shift in the position of the basilar membrane. This is known as low frequency biasing. When the low frequency biasing is transmitted at the same time as a normal ECochG stimulus we would therefore expect to see a change in the SP results, demonstrating that the basilar membrane is mobile. Experiments in guinea pigs using a low frequency bias have confirmed a marked modulation in the SP amplitude. Low frequency biasing studies in humans with endolymphatic hydrops should show less change in the SP because the basilar membrane is already displaced by the disease process and therefore less mobile compared to normal ears.

Aim: To determine if the presence of endolymphatic hydrops affects the results of ECochG when low frequency stimulus biasing is introduced. 

Hypothesis: Low frequency biasing will not affect the basilar membrane as much in those individuals in which endolymphatic hydrops is present, compared to normal ears, because it is already displaced by the disease process present.

Potential Significance: This would give the use of ECochG greater diagnostic accuracy for endolymphatic hydrops and Menieres disease, making it more useful both as a clinical test and as a method of evaluating the inner ear structural changes occurring in Menie`res disease. This may be particularly beneficial for individuals who have unilateral symptoms of Menieres where a destructive surgical procedure is contemplated but hydrops in the other ear must be excluded.</summary>
