  <interventions>
    <interventions>We are evaluating the effectiveness of a tablet computer application (app) in encouraging on time immunisation. The app is designed to be used by immunisation service providers (ISP) staff. It provides parents or carers with automatic SMS reminders 2 weeks and 2 days before upcoming immunisation dates and personalised calendars with each child's photograph and routine childhood immunisation dates up until the age of 4 years. Parents of children less than 16 months will be recruited at participating ISPs and randomly allocated to one of 4 groups: 1) SMS reminder messages, 2) calendar, 3) SMS reminder messages and calendar, and 4) no intervention. Timeliness of vaccine receipt, as recorded in the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR), will be compared in the four groups. We will be recruiting from a range of immunisation service providers nationwide, including Aboriginal Medical Services and culturally and linguistically diverse group practices. This will have important implications for strategies to improve vaccination uptake, particularly in communities where vaccine coverage is low.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>On-time immunisation (within 1 month of immunisation scheduled date), assessed using data linkage to Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR)</outcome>
      <timepoint>See National Immunisation Program schedule for vaccination due dates; participants will be followed up from recruitment up to 19 months of age or until study completion. (Whilst the app provides reminders up until the age of 4, we will only be analysing data up until the age of 19 months due to study time constraints.)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Assess app useability and acceptability will be assessed using structured qualitative interviews with parents/carers and immunisation service providers.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Parents/carers will be eligible for interview 1 month post intervention; interviews of parents/carers and immunisation service providers will be staggered across the study period.</timepoint>

    <statisticalmethods>Comparison differences in proportion of children vaccinated on-time by intervention groups using the chi-squared test. Preliminary sample size calculations have been performed assuming that the baseline proportion of on-time immunisations is between 60-80% and the expected improvement is between 10-15%.From these calculations, the expected sample size we would need is around 300-400 per intervention/control group, therefore around 1200-1600 vaccine doses. We estimate that this amount of vaccine doses will be achieved with around 1000 children since many children will be receiving multiple doses.</statisticalmethods>
