(one-on-one training by occupational medicine resident will be done on the use and insertion of earplugs, once a time which will take for 5 minute)
 
and 

earplug with higher than necessary NRR

(in our study audiometry is not intervention, we will evaluate the effect of interventions by audiometry.) 

(audiometry is done at 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz, with interruption period of 0.5 s by an audiometer AC40 and  headphones TDH39. Noise attenuation will be determined by the REAT(Real ear at threshold) method in a noisy (98db) chamber,   once only which will take for 1 minute.)</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of face to face training of workers to promote the use of hearing protection devices and to be sure that they use earplug effectively. In this study we will measure the noise attenuation rate, gained with the proper use of earplugs to reduce the rate of overprotection.
we want to receive to the answer that if training is more important than using earplug with higher necessary noise reduction rate(NRR)?</summary>
