  <interventions>
    <interventions>General practice patients with chronic disease will be assigned randomly to receive routine care plus mailed letter containing general information plus printed information package providing information about community based health organisations relevant to the patient's chronic condition (Intervention group).                                                                                                                 At recruitment to the study, all patients will be advised (via a participant information sheet) that they will be mailed one of two information packages, both of which will contain useful information but differing in the amount of information provided: one will contain more detailed information than the other. Patients are advised they will have an equal chance of receiving either of the packages and that the one sent will be decided at random. The patients will retain and have access to the intervention package for the duration of the 12-month study and beyond.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Access to community based health organisations will be assessed by self-report using questions asking whether the patient has contacted/participated in an organisation and, if so, the frequency and nature of their contact/participation.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Collected by telephone interview at baseline and 3- and 10-12 months post-intervention.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Secondary outcomes are self-management and subjective health.
Self-management will be assessed using the 13-item version of the Patient Activation Measure (Hibbard, 2003) and a series of questions about health actions taken, including service use, adapted from the National Health Survey (2005). Subjective health will be assessed using the SF-12, version 2. </outcome>
      <timepoint>All data will be self-report by telephone interview at baseline, 3- and 10-12 months.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of the study is to evaluate a general-practice based referral strategy to  improve access to community-based health organisations among people with chronic illness. It is hypothesised that greater access to these organisations is associated with a range of benefits in terms of chronic illness self-management and health related quality of life.</summary>
