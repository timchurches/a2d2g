  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be invited to complete a seven level CCBT programme (SPARX: The Rainbow Version) over 4-8 weeks under minimal supervision.  

Participants can complete the programme at selected sites (e.g. the University of Auckland or Rainbow Youth) or at home.

The overall duration will be determined by the participant and the rate at which they complete all seven levels (although they will be encouraged to complete one to two levels per week).

The CCBT programme is steeped in a 3D fantasy game.  The seven levels consist of interactive exercises and mini-games and include topics such as problem-solving, recognising negative cognitions, cognitive reframing, relaxation, dealing with negative emotions and interpersonal communication.  Participants are encouraged to complete homework tasks after each level (called challenges) and are given a notebook which summarises the content of each level.  Minor adaptations to the main CCBT programme have been made to ensure acceptability to a same/both-sex attracted or questioning sexuality youth population.</interventions>
    <comparator>Same/both-sex attracted youth and young people questioning their sexuality will be compared to the opposite-sex attracted young people from the main Randomised Control Trial (RCT) [ACTRN12609000249257] with Dr Sally Merry as the Principal Investigator (PI).</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Despite increased rates of depression amongst same/both-sex-attracted youth few of these depressed young people receive the treatment that they require.  The difficulties same/both-sex-attracted young people face accessing help may be compounded by characteristics of this population, namely their small numbers, isolation and the double stigma of having a mental health issue and being same/both-sex-attracted.  The challenge then is finding ways of overcoming these barriers in order to deliver effective therapy to this vulnerable group of young people.  Computerised Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CCBT) offers one means of rising to this challenge.</summary>
