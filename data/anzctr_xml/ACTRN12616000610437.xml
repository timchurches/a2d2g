  <interventions>
    <interventions>Regional anaesthesia techniques provide far superior analgesia to opioid only analgesia following knee arthroplasty. Femoral nerve blocks have previously been considered the gold standard for analgesia however due to the effects on quadriceps strength these infusions have limited patients ability to mobilise and rehabilitate and have thus been of limited duration. Adductor canal block (ACB) infusions have provided equivalent analgesia to femoral nerve blocks while preserving motor strength and capacity to walk.  
Intervention group will receive ACB Initial bolus = 30mls x 0.2% ropivacaine then continuous Infusion = 0.2% @ 6mls/h) for 5 days by an anaesthetist and monitored by an Acute Pain Service.</interventions>
    <comparator>Control group will have standard care, which is only 3 days duration of ACB contuinuous low dose ropivacine infusion (Initial bolus = 30mls x 0.2% ropivacaine then continuous Infusion = 0.2% @ 6mls/h) for 3 days admisintered by an anaesthetist and monitored by an Acute Pain Service.</comparator>

    <statisticalmethods>The study  design to establish superiority of the 5 day duration, powered to detect a 15% difference in NRS. To achieve Power (1 - ÃŸ) = 0.80, a = .05 if there were a benefit of 1.5 to for the 5-day condition then data would be expected to liken to 3-day group ( M1 = 3, SD1 = 2) verses the 5-day group( M2 = 1.5, SD2 = 2) This would provide effect size (d) of .75 (where .80 is large).To detect this effect the recommended sample size is 29 per condition. This we aim to recruit 32 participants to each group, allowing for 10% attrition.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There is a wide range of local analgesic techniques available for analgesia following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In a recent review article, continuous femoral nerve block analgesia has been described as the gold standard.. A myriad of combinations of these techniques appear in the literature and all have some limitations.

Regional anaesthesia techniques provide far superior analgesia to opioid only analgesia following knee arthroplasty. Femoral nerve blocks have previously been considered the gold standard for analgesia however due to the effects on quadriceps strength these infusions have limited patients ability to mobilise and rehabilitate and have thus been of limited duration. Adductor canal block infusions have provided equivalent analgesia to femoral nerve blocks while preserving motor strength. Patients are able to walk independently while these infusions are running with limited pain. This is transforming post-operative care for these patients. 

We have audited 3 day infusions in this group of patients and found improvements in pain and mobility. We believe that prolonging the infusion duration may provide further benefits to patients.

The primary aim of this trial is to assess whether a 5 day ACB infusion is better than a 3 day infusion in terms of quality of analgesia and their walking activity level during the first week following their surgery. Our secondary aims are to evaluate safety of the technique and to ascertain if any benefits are carried over to the 3 month pain, walking level, hip function and satisfaction levels.
