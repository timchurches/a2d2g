    <interventions>Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).

TMS will be administered with a Medtronic Magpro30 magnetic stimulator using a 70mm figure-of-eight coil. Prior to the commencement of treatment TMS, single pulse TMS will be used to measure the resting motor threshold (RMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) in the right hand using standard methods.


Patients will be randomised into one of four treatment conditions:

1.  High dose Low Frequency rTMS applied to the right prefrontal cortex: Application of 2 continuous trains of 1 Hz rTMS of 30 minutes duration at 120% of the resting motor threshold (3600 pulses per session over 60 minutes).

2. High dose High Frequency rTMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex: Application of 125 trains of 10 Hz rTMS. 4.5 second trains will be applied at 120% of the resting motor threshold with a 15.5 second inter-train interval (5625 pulses per session over 41.6 minutes).

3.  Standard dose Low Frequency rTMS applied to the right prefrontal cortex: Application of 1 continuous train of 1 Hz rTMS of 20 minutes duration at 120% of the resting motor threshold (1200 pulses per session over 20 minutes).

4. Standard dose High Frequency rTMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex: This will involve the application of 50 trains of 10 Hz rTMS.  4.5 second trains will be applied at 120% of the resting motor threshold with a 20.5 second inter-train interval (2250 pulses per session over 20.8 minutes).


Each treatment will be administered for up to four weeks, five days per week (total of 20 treatment sessions). Patients will receive an assessment at baseline, 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks (briefer assessments at weeks 1 and 3), and the primary study analysis will be based on this data.  Patients may terminate treatment if they have responded at 2, 3 or 4 weeks.

Patients who do not respond to one of the low dose treatment arms will be offered crossover treatment to the high dose condition using the opposite form of stimulation. Patients who do not respond to one of the high dose conditions will be offered the high dose form of stimulation applied to the opposite hemisphere.

A subset of participants will also take part in a sub-study looking at potential predictors of response to rTMS treatment, involving participation in some computer-based tasks and MRI imaging.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard dose low frequency and high frequency repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, as described above. 


We will also recruit a group of up to 50 healthy controls, age and gender matched to the patient group, to participate in the brain imaging arm of the study.  This will allow analyses of the behavioural assessment of reward and MRI data in relation to treatment response to be compared between patients and control participants. In turn, it will allow additional questions to be addressed in regards to the degree to which decision-making on these tasks varies from normal levels of function, and allow us to analyse the degree to which the relevant imaging variables differ from normal.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1: change in severity of depressive symptoms, defined as:

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD; 17 item version) -  Clinical response defined as a reduction of at least 50% from baseline, clinical remission defined as a score &lt;= 7</outcome>
      <timepoint>Baseline, and after every 5 treatments (weeks 1, 2, 3, 4)</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Predictors of antidepressant response to TMS.

Specifically, we will explore the potential predictors of antidepressant response to rTMS using brain imaging analyses, and the use of tasks related to risk and reward decision making, in a subset of participants:

1.  We will conduct an assessment of decision making related to reward with several computer based experimental tasks (eg.  the Ultimatum Game, Signal Detection Task).

2.  We will use the MRI data to model the differences between patients and controls in subcortical activation patterns induced by the decision making task, and model the relationship between activation and response to treatment using response and other relevant clinical variables in regression analyses.</outcome>
      <timepoint>Analysis of a series of scans obtained in the one scanning session.  Analysis will occur at the end of the study once all data has been collected.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Major depressive disorder is a severe illness of high prevalence. A significant percentage of patients fail to respond to standard treatments and continue to experience marked disability and high morbidity. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which is a non-invasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial areas of the brain, is a promising therapy for those with treatment-resistant depression. Previous research conducted by our group clearly indicates that rTMS has antidepressant activity and that the response to rTMS is clinically meaningful in some patients. Whilst several forms of rTMS are clearly effective, no one type of rTMS has demonstrated markedly greater responses that other approaches.  In recent years interest has developed into whether the dose of rTMS, in particular the number of pulses applied, is related to response to treatment (the percentage of patients that respond to treatment, the response rate).  However, as there is a considerable time cost to higher dose protocols, their usefulness requires systematic evaluation.  

Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to examine whether response to rTMS is greater or more rapid when treatment is applied at a higher dose.  To do this we will compare standard and high dose strategies for both low frequency rTMS applied to the right prefrontal cortex, and high frequency rTMS applied to the left prefrontal cortex.  A secondary goal of the study is to explore potential predictors of antidepressant response to rTMS using brain imaging analysis.</summary>
