      <outcome>Change From Study Baseline in the Daily Average Number of Urinary Incontinence Episodes - Urinary incontinence is defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded in a patient bladder diary in the 3 consecutive days prior to each study visit for study 191622-094 (or 7 days prior to each visit in study 191622-515 or 191622-516). The number of incontinence episodes are averaged daily during this period. The initial study baseline is obtained from the patient bladder diary in the 7 consecutive days prior to the first treatment in either study 191622-515 or 191622-516. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in incontinence episodes (improvement).</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Study Baseline in the Incontinence Quality of Life Instrument (I-QOL) Total Summary Score - The I-QOL questionnaire is a validated, disease-specific quality of life (QOL) questionnaire containing 22 questions designed to measure the impact of urinary incontinence on patients' lives. Each question is answered on a 5-point scale (1 = worst QOL and 5 = best QOL). The scores are totaled over the 22 questions and normalized to a score of 0-100 (0 = worst QOL and 100= best QOL). The I-QOL total score is calculated by combining the 22-item subscores from the 3 I-QOL domains: Avoidance Limiting Behavior, Psychological Impact, and Social Embarrassment. The initial study baseline is obtained from data collected prior to the first treatment in Study 191622-515 or 191622-516. Positive number changes from baseline indicate improved QOL.</outcome>

      <outcome>Change From Study Baseline in Volume Per Void - The total volume voided (voluntary or by catheterization) is recorded by the patient over a 24-hour period preceding the study visit.
