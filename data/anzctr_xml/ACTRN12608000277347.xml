    <purpose>Treatment</purpose>
    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Informed consent will be obtained prior to intubation. Infants that may potentially require intubation during their admission will be recruited (and informed consent obtained) soon after admission. 
Treatment group allocation will be recorded in ordered, opaque envelopes with the sequence of allocation determined by randomisation. 
For the first intubation attempt (eligible for inclusion) the next envelope will be opened once the decision is made to intubate (using sedation) by the medical staff.
Once treatment group allocation has occurred, all subsequent intubations with sedation for that infant will be done using the assigned sedative. 
Blinding will not be possible, as the preparations look different, propofol is a milky-white substance that needs no diluting and morphine midazolam is clear.</concealment>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Ill newborns frequently need breathing tubes inserted into their trachea in order to help with their breathing. This can cause pain and adverse physiological responses, such as changes in blood pressure, which may be harmful to the infant. We routinely give these infants medications beforehand, to lessen the impact the procedure has on them. The best drug or drug combination in infants is not known. In our neonatal unit, we use a combination of Morphine and Midazolam, which may not be ideal, as it takes long to work. We aim to compare these 2 drugs with a single agent, Propofol, an anaesthetic agent, used in theatres to insert breathing tubes. We do not know which of these drugs are better, that is why we have started this study. The study is expected to run for 18 months.</summary>
