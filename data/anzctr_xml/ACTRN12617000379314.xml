  <interventions>
    <interventions>This is a 24 week randomized controlled study of onabotulinumtoxina compared to placebo.  Randomization is 1:1. An open-label extension starts at the 24 week visit with further follow-up to 48 weeks. 

Details of the therapeutic intervention is as follows: 
Botulinum toxin A (onabotulinumtoxina) affects neuromuscular transmission by blocking calcium-mediated exocytosis of acetylcholine. Transmission of acetylcholine is restored over 2 to 4 months in human motor endplates, although the clinical effects may persist for 6 months. 
The medication is administered as an intramuscular injection. A maximum dose of 150 IU will be administered at baseline and/or at 6 months with the actual dosed determined by the treating neurologist.  
Dosages are individualised to target muscles according to the type of tremor observed.  Data from our previous study (Van der Walt et al. Neurology, 2010) showed that the average dose per person is 83 IU per treatment with an average of 5 muscles injected.  There is no minimum dose.

Continuous variables will be assessed for skew, with normally distributed variables summarized using mean and SE and skewed variables summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences in score change between BoNT-A or placebo from baseline to, respectively, 6, 12 and 24 weeks will be assessed through a Wilcoxon signed- rank test. Muscle weakness between groups will be tested using the McNemar test. The significance level will be adjusted for multiple comparisons for the primary outcomes (p=0.05/3).  All analyses were performed using Stata (version 11.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Correlations between response to treatment and baseline covariates:
Correlation analyses between primary and secondary outcomes at 6,12 and 24 weeks and baseline variables will be performed using Pearson parametric correlation procedures. Where data are not normally distributed, Spearman rank correlations will be performed. Multiple tests will be corrected using the Bonferroni probability value correction procedure.

Study Power 
Using a basic test for difference in proportion of patients who demonstrated improvement in tremor in both groups from our previous study, and taking the midpoint of the improvement range (26-40%) or 33% improvement in Botox group and 10% in placebo group then: 80% power=49 per group. We therefore propose to recruit 50 patients per treatment group.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The treatment and pathophysiology of tremor in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) remains a significant challenge and unmet need, requiring further clinical research. We recently performed a phase II, randomized, controlled, crossover study demonstrating the efficacy of Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) for treatment of MS tremor. This peer-reviewed NHMRC funded project proposes a detailed study of phenomenological, electrophysiological characteristics of MS tremor patients before and after BoNT-A or placebo treatment. The results of this study will help generate class I evidence that is required to translate treatment of MS tremor with BoNT-A into clinical practice. We aim to define predictors of the response to treatment and to better understand the underlying pathophysiology of MS tremor.</summary>
