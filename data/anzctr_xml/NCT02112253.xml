Treatment: devices - Deep brain stimulator dorsal electrode up to 3 mA
Treatment: devices - Deep brain stimulator empirical programming

Experimental: Deep brain stimulator ventral electrode up to 2 mA - The ventral contact within the anterior globus pallidus interna near the ansa lenticularis is activated. Stimulator settings are 90 microseconds pulse width and stimulation frequency of 130 Hertz. Amplitude of stimulation is raised from zero until side effects occur or 2 mA amplitude is reached; whichever comes first.

Experimental: Deep brain stimulator ventral electrode up to 3 mA - The ventral contact within the anterior globus pallidus interna near the ansa lenticularis is activated. Stimulator settings are 90 microseconds pulse width and stimulation frequency of 130 Hertz. Amplitude of stimulation is raised from zero until side effects occur or 3 mA amplitude is reached; whichever comes first.

Experimental: Deep brain stimulator dorsal electrode up to 2 mA - The dorsal contact within the superior half of the anterior globus pallidus interna is activated. Stimulator settings are 90 microseconds pulse width and stimulation frequency of 130 Hertz. Amplitude of stimulation is raised from zero until side effects occur or 2 mA amplitude is reached; whichever comes first.

Experimental: Deep brain stimulator dorsal electrode up to 3 mA - The dorsal contact within the superior half of the anterior globus pallidus interna is activated. Stimulator settings are 90 microseconds pulse width and stimulation frequency of 130 Hertz. Amplitude of stimulation is raised from zero until side effects occur or 3 mA amplitude is reached; whichever comes first.

Active Comparator: Deep brain stimulator empirical programming - Any of the four electrode contacts on each of the two deep brain stimulation leads can be activated in any combination with any amplitude, frequency or pulse width settings to achieve optimized clinical control of motor tics whilst minimizing side effects. Both programmer and patient may be unblinded. The assessors are blinded to stimulation settings.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The motor tics associated with Tourette's syndrome may be reduced with deep brain stimulation
      of the anterior globus pallidus. The best area within this brain region and the best
      stimulation device settings are currently unknown. This is a study in which deep versus
      superficial electrode contact positions and two different amplitudes of stimulation are
      compared under scientific conditions. The hypothesis is that one contact position/stimulation
      amplitude combination will provide a better outcome than the others. Each study participant
      receives each of four different anatomical position/stimulation amplitude setting
      combinations over a 12 month period in randomized order followed by a 6-month period of
      trial-and-error device programming to optimize control of motor tics. Motor tics, potential
      side effects, daily functioning and quality of life are assessed at the end of each trial
      stimulation period. At the end of the study, the study participant continues to have
      long-term deep brain stimulation treatment with whatever settings provide the most relief.</summary>
