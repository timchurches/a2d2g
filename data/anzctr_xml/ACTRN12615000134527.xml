  <interventions>
    <interventions>During an initial 4-week run-in period, subjects continue their usual regular intake. They are then randomized into a 3 period cross-over study of Latin square design, during which they consume during sequential 4 week study periods:-

	(1)	140-210 g/week (2-3 standard drinks/day) of alcohol as red wine (a shiraz cabernet blend of known composition and alcohol content - alcohol 13% v/v, sourced from Orlando Wyndham, Rowland Flat, South Australia) (approx. 2-3 bottles per week with a minimum consumption of 20 g per day every day and maximum consumption of 30 g per day every day),
or	(2)	30-70 g/week of alcohol as the same red wine (approx. 0.5 to 1 bottle per week with a minimum consumption of 10 g per day on 3 of the 7 days and maximum consumption of 10 g per day every day),
or	(3)	as a control, an identical red wine but which was de-alcoholised (again sourced from Orlando Wyndham, Rowland Flat, South Australia) (approx. 2-3 bottles per week with equivalent volumes consumed daily matched to the high-alcohol period). During this 4-week period they otherwise remain abstinent from all alcohol.

There was no washout period between each 4-week study period.

The precise amount of red wine and de-alcoholised red wine within the above ranges is dictated by each subject's usual alcohol intake at entry to the study. Entry to each intervention phase of the study is scheduled so that measurement of blood pressure and lipid levels correspond as closely as possible to the early follicular phase of each subject's menstrual cycle. This is to minimize any confounding from differences in hormone levels within and between subjects resulting from phase of the menstrual cycle.

All measurements are performed at the end of the 4-week run-in period and each of the three 4-week study periods.

Compliance with the designated changes in alcohol intake are recorded by 7-day retrospective weekly diaries,  completed at weekly visits to the clinical trials unit. In addition serum is sampled at the end of the 4-week
run-in period and the end of each subsequent study period for both gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and carbohydrate deficient transferrin as biomarkers of alcohol intake. Twenty-four hour urinary 4-Omethylgallic acid is determined as a biomarker of red wine intake.

      <outcome>24hr, daytime and night time ambulatory blood pressure level

24-hour ambulatory BP measurement is performed using a SpaceLabs Monitor (Model 90217, SpaceLabs Medical Inc) while subjects continue their normal routine. The recorder is preset to take BP and heart rate (HR) recordings every 30 min and is fitted at the conclusion of the initial 4-week run-in period and at the conclusion of each 4-week study period. BP records are not visible to the subjects. Subjects are instructed to complete an activity diary which describes the posture and activity of the subject at the time of the BP reading. While the BP measurements are being made, subjects are instructed to keep their arm motionless by their side to avoid artefactual readings caused by vibration. In cases when the SpaceLabs Monitor detects an error in BP measurement subjects are instructed to rectify the error or return to the department to have the recorder corrected. Readings associated with a test code and those with a difference of &lt; 20 mmHg between SBP and DBP are excluded from analysis. Mean BP and HR are calculated for each of the 24 hours and then mean 24 hour, awake and asleep BP and HR are computed. Waking and sleeping times are determined from subjects activity diaries.

Blood was collected after an overnight fast. Serum samples were analysed on the day of venipuncture by Core Laboratory Services, Royal Perth Hospital, using the Hitashi 917 Biochemical Analyser (Hitachi Limited, Tokyo, Japan) and with HDL cholesterol measured with the Boehringer Mannheim kit (Cat No. 1930648) (Interassay CV 3.0%; normal reference range 0.9  2.0 mmol/L). </outcome>

    <statisticalmethods>The 24 hr ambulatory BP records were analysed utilising pooled time series regression with random effects models adjusted for serial correlation. It was estimated that with change in 24 hr ambulatory systolic BP as the major endpoint there would be at least 80% power to demonstrate a 2-3 mmHg change in systolic BP. We estimated that with 3 separate study periods and an adjusted alpha level of 0.05/3 (assuming the potential for 3 paired comparisons), that a minimum of 32 subjects would be required. </statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Alcohol consumption by Australian women, especially younger women, has been steadily increasing together with the prevalence of episodic or binge drinking by such subjects. The increase in alcohol intake has been occurring in the setting of an increased public health recognition that the regular consumption of 1-2 standard alcoholic drinks per day may confer protection against coronary artery disease. However, the balance of potential risks and benefits for alcohol consumption have, more often than not, been generated on the basis of data from studies in men. This is especially true with respect to the effects of alcohol on blood pressure and hypertension. There is continuing controversy with respect to the amount of alcohol which will influence blood pressure in women and uncertainty as to the direction of any effect. Population-based epidemiological studies suggest that low level alcohol consumption (4-7 drinks per week) may lower blood pressure in women while higher levels of consumption (2 or more drinks per day)  have been  associated with higher levels of blood pressure. The present proposal will directly test these assumptions by measuring BP over 24 hr on a carefully controlled basis in women who are drinking at these levels over 4-week periods. The results will be compared to levels of BP measured after 4 weeks of abstinence from all alcohol. </summary>
