  <interventions>
    <interventions>Patients recruited with premature heart disease are asked to identify their first degree relatives aged 18 years and over, and to provide information about the study to them personally or by mailing. The study information sheet provided to their relatives (the intervention group) explains the study and provides a brief explanation about family history of premature heart disease and cardiovascular risk factors, and the benefits of risk factor assessment. It includes a recommendation that the relative make an appointment to attend their general practitioner (GP) for a cardiovascular risk assessment (without cost to them), and instruction to contact the Heart Foundation for free telephone advice about heart disease. It also includes an option for the relative to receive further advice or have any questions answered about heart disease in the form of a telephone call with either a GP or a nurse depending on participant preference.</interventions>
    <comparator>Standard care relatives (of IHD patients) are provided with an information sheet that explains the study and provides a brief explanation about family history of premature heart disease and cardiovascular risk factors only. It does not include a recommendation to attend their GP for a cardiovascular risk assessment, nor to contact the Heart Foundation . It does not include an option for further advice about heart disease from a GP or nurse.</comparator>

    <inclusivecriteria>Patients: hospitalised with their first premature ischaemic heart disease (PIHD) event, with the event determined as occurring before age 55 in men, and before age 65 in women. An IHD event is defined as any one of the following: non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), unstable angina and coronary revascularisation (coronary artery bypass grafting, coronary angioplasty with or without coronary stenting).

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A consecutive series of 140 patients hospitalised with PIHD will be recruited prospectively from Flinders Medical Centre/Flinders Private Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Patients will then send an invitation on behalf of the researchers to their first degree relatives to participate. All participants will be aged over 18 years. A consecutive series of patients hospitalised with PIHD will be invited to participate. All participants are aged 18 years or over. Patients will be asked to send an invitation on behalf of the researchers to their first degree relatives (aged 18 years and over) to participate. With 140 patients recruited to this study, we anticipate a potential pool of 490 first degree relatives to invite to participate.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomisation schedule was created for both hospital sites using computerised sequence generation. Intervention was assigned 'A' and Standard Care was assigned 'B'. Individually sealed enveloples containing letters according to the randomisation shedule were provided to the research nurse at each site, who was instructed to open each envelope sequentially, after consent to particpate was obtained from the patient. The appropriate set of information packs were provided</sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>A total minimum sample size of 140 patients and 136 relatives will be recruited into the trial. The sample size makes the following assumptions:
- 30% of patients will agree to participate in the study (of these approximately 10% will die or otherwise not be able to participate in the first 6 months of the study)
- each patient has on average, three first-degree relatives (inclusive of sibling(s) and children)
- 20% of relatives will be ineligible due to an existing IHD diagnosis, while 50% of eligible relatives will agree to participate in the study, allowing for a design effect of 1.1 (family intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.05, 1+(3-1)*0.05=1.1)
- A maximum dropout rate for relatives in the order of 10% over the course of the study.

This minimum study sample size will be sufficient to detect an increase of 25% (absolute) in general practitioner attendance for risk-assessment, with 25% of standard care relatives attending in the 6 months after the event, compared with 50% of relatives in the intervention group, and allowing for a correlation of 0.25 with other covariates (e.g. age, gender etc), with at least 80% power (90% power for a one sided test) at the 5% significance level.

Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise the primary and secondary outcome measures. Kappa statistic will be used to measure the strength of agreement between self perceived and absolute cardiovascular risk values.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>There are no current Australian guidelines to promote screening for families experiencing premature ischaemic heart disease (PIHD), which would suggest that in Australia this is not being undertaken systematically.  Without recommendations for family screening, an opportunity for targeted IHD prevention in the community is being overlooked.  Targeting of primary prevention at families with a positive history could be a highly cost-effective strategy to tackle the burden of IHD in Australia.  Evidence for the potential benefits and feasibility of this strategy is required to inform the development of guidelines/recommendations appropriate to the Australian population and health system.  The objective of this project is to trial a primary prevention strategy targeted to families experiencing PIHD. 

Evidence that attendance to a general practitioner for cardiovascular risk factor assessment results in a reduction in absolute cardiovascular risk (ACR) in these first degree relatives is lacking. However we believe that advising high risk groups within the population about their risk factors is a necessary first step toward reduction of risk in these groups. 

Aim: This study will trial an intervention (including written and verbal advice) to prompt first degree relatives of patients with premature ischemic heart disease (PIHD) to attend their GP for a cardiovascular risk assessment, as the first step toward reduction of their absolute cardiovascular risk (ACR).

Research Question: Does the provision of written and verbal advice, promoting cardiovascular risk assessment, to first-degree relatives of patients with PIHD, increase the proportion of relatives undertaking cardiovascular risk assessment in general practice?

Hypothesis: Provision of written and verbal advice promoting cardiovascular risk assessment, to first-degree relatives of patients with PIHD, will result in an increase in the level of cardiovascular risk assessment undertaken from 25% to 50%.
