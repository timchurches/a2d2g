  <interventions>
    <interventions>The carrying angle is the angle made by the axes of the arm and the forearm, with the elbow in full extension. This angle was used to measure the upper limb alignment, whereas the tibiofemoral and quadriceps (Q) angles were used to assess the lower limb alignment. The tibiofemoral angle is the angle made by the tibial axis relative to the femoral axis. The Q angle is a clinical measure of the alignment of the quadriceps femoris musculature relative to the underlying skeletal structures of the pelvis, femur, and tibia.  The aforementioned angles were photographed, digitalized and quantified using the ALCimagem 2.1® software. 28 men and 31 women were recruited for this study.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study was to verify the correlation between the carrying angle and the Q and tibiofemoral angles and the bilateral symmetry for each angle. The upper and lower limbs alignment of the university students was assessed through the measurement of the carrying angles for upper extremity and the Q and tibiofemoral angles for the lower extremity to find out whether there is any correlation between the carrying angles and the Q and tibiofemoral angles and also if symmetry between right and left sides exists.</summary>
