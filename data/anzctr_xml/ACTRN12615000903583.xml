  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Primary Outcome 1:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple ascending dose regimen of DUR-928 administered intramuscularly (IM) in healthy volunteers. 
</outcome>
      <timepoint>Safety Timepoints, Part A: 
Routine vital sign measurements (temperature [T], blood pressure [BP], pulse and respiratory rate [RR]) will be measured at screening, check-in (Day -1), pre-dose, and 8 times post-dose over a 48 hour period. 
Physical examination will be performed at screening, check-in (Day -1), and at trial completion. The physical exam done on Day -1 will be abbreviated (including general appearance and evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neurological system).
Safety Laboratory tests (Chemistry, Hematology, and Urinalysis) will be drawn at screening, check-in (Day -1), 24 and 48 hours post-dose, and on Day 7 (study termination).
Injection sites will be evaluated and rated (mild, moderate, severe) for redness, tenderness, swelling, induration and other symptoms at injection site and measurements will be recorded for any redness noted at injections sites. Injection sites will be assessed at 1, 12 and 24 hours post-dose, and prior to discharge from unit.
Injection Site Pain Intensity Assessments: Subjects will be asked to rate the pain intensity at the injection sites using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS)(Turk DC, et al. 1993; Keller, et al. 2004). Injections site pain will be assessed pre-dose and 9 times post-dose over a 24 hour period.
Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained from subjects at screening, check-in (Day -1), and 5 times post-dose over a 48 hour period.  Additional ECGs may be obtained if clinically indicated.
AE collection starts from the time the subject checks in (Day -1) and continues through trial completion/early termination (Day 7).
Safety Timepoints, Part B: 
Routine vital sign measurements (temperature [T], blood pressure [BP], pulse and respiratory rate [RR]) will be measured at screening, check-in (Day -1), and at Dose 1: pre-dose, 2, 4, and 12 hours post-dose, Dose 2: pre-dose, 2 and 4 hours post-dose, Dose 3: pre-dose, 2 and 4 hours post-dose, Dose 4: pre-dose, 2 and 4 hours post-dose, Dose 5: pre-dose, 2, 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours post-dose.
Physical examination will be performed at screening, check-in (Day -1), 48 hours post Dose 5, and at trial completion. The physical exam done on check-in (Day -1) and 48 hours post Dose 5 will be abbreviated (including general appearance and evaluation of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat and neurological system).
Safety Laboratory tests (Chemistry, Hematology,  and Urinalysis) will be drawn at screening, check-in (Day -1), pre Dose 2, pre Dose 5, 24 hours and 48 hours post Dose 5, and at trial completion.
Injection sites will be evaluated and rated (mild, moderate, severe) for redness, tenderness, swelling, induration and other symptoms at injection site and measurements will be recorded for any redness noted at injections sites. injection site assessment will be done approximately 1, 12, and 24 hours after each dose for 5 days then all injection sites will be assessed prior to discharge from unit.
Injection Site Pain Intensity Assessments: Subjects will be asked to rate the pain intensity at the injection sites using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS)(Turk DC, et al. 1993; Keller, et al. 2004). Injections site pain will be assessed pre-dose and 9 times post each dose over a 24 hour period.
Twelve-lead ECGs will be obtained from subjects at screening, check-in (Day -1), and at 2 and 4 hours post Dose 1 and at 2, 4 and 48 hours post Dose 5. Additional ECGs may be obtained if clinically indicated.

To determine any dose limiting adverse drug effects following single and multiple ascending IM dosing of DUR-928 in healthy volunteers.
There are no known systemic, dose-related  adverse reactions to DUR-928 when given as an oral solution to healthy volunteers in doses up to 1000 mg.  
Possible adverse reactions to the intramuscular injection of DUR-928 may include pain, tenderness, swelling or induration, or erythema - at the injection site.  Pain will be assessed with a numerical rating scale (0 to 10, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst imaginable pain).  Injection pain will be assessed at frequent intervals, from 5 minutes after injection  until 48 hours after injection.  Physical adverse reactions at the injection site will be assessed from 1 hour after injection to 48 hours after injection, and will be graded by severity (none, mild, moderate, or severe).  Any other adverse events will be recorded on a standard case report form and will be followed until resolution.

    <designfeatures>Part A, single dose: 4 cohorts (6 subjects per cohort) will be given a single an intramuscular dose of DUR-928 or placebo. For each cohort, subjects will be randomized in 2:1 ratio - 4 subjects will receive active (DUR-928) and 2 subjects will receive placebo. Cohort 2 continues only after the safety assessment of Cohort 1. Similarly, Cohort 3 continues only after the safety assessment of Cohort 2, and Cohort 4 continues after safety review of Cohort 3. 24 subjects in total will be enrolled.
Following principle investigator and medical monitor review finding acceptable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data of the first 3 cohorts in Part A of the study, Part B of the study will be initiated. 
Part B, multiple dose: doses for Cohort 1 and 2 will be determined after review of safety and PK data from Part A of the study. Two cohorts (10 subjects per cohort) will be treated daily for 5 days with an intramuscular dose of DUR-928 or placebo. For each cohort, subjects will be randomized in 4:1 ratio - 8 subjects will receive active (DUR-928) and 2 subjects will receive placebo. The second cohort of 10 subjects continues only after the safety assessment of the first cohort. 20 subjects in total will be enrolled.

    <endpoint>Safety</endpoint>
    <statisticalmethods>Safety  Safety will be evaluated by assessment of clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations including vital signs, and ECGs, and by the documentation of all spontaneously reported adverse events. Safety will be summarised by dose level for Part A (single dose), and by dose level and dosing day for Part B (multiple dose). 
Pharmacokinetics  Plasma concentration data of DUR-928 and its metabolite at each dose level will be used to calculate relevant pharmacokinetic parameters.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will summarized by dose level, using descriptive statistics.
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, no power or sample size calculations have been performed.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This research project is being conducted to look at how safe and well tolerated a new drug called DUR-928 is when given as an intramuscular injection to healthy volunteers. The study will look at the study drugs effect when given as a single dose at 4 different dose levels, and then once daily for 5 days at 2 different dose levels. The pharmacokinetics of DUR-928 will also be studied; this is done by measuring the amount of DUR-928 in the blood at different times throughout the dosing periods, allowing us to evaluate how DUR-928 is handled by the body (for example how quickly it gets into the blood stream). </summary>
