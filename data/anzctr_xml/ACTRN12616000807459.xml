  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will be placed into the lateral position post induction of anaesthesia. A Standard foam axillary roll is placed under the patient's dependent thorax at the location of the inferior tip of the scapula. A head pillow is to be used in all cases. The axillary roll is to be present for the duration of the surgery and removed at the cessation of anaesthesia.  The approximate duration of surgery is 60 minutes.</interventions>
    <comparator>In the non-intervention arm, participants will be placed in the lateral position post induction of anaesthesia without the placement of an axillary roll. A head pillow is to be used in all cases. </comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine if there is a relationship between the use of an axillary roll during surgery in the lateral decubitus position and the presence or absence of post-operative shoulder and neck pain. In the immediate post-operative phase and on Day One after their operation, participants will be asked what their level of shoulder and neck pain is according to the visual analogue pain scale (VAS). </outcome>

    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Patients will be asked if they have any tingling or numbness in their hand on the opposite side to their operation (subjective). If the answer is in the affirmative, they will be referred back to their Anaesthetist for follow up, such as nerve studies (objective). </outcome>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>Patient selection is according to the operating list. Informed consent is gain from the patient. 
The random allocation sequence will be contained within concealed numbered envelopes. The envelopes will look identical, each will have trial identification number and sequential number on it. Inside the envelope will have the intervention allocation and a unique sequential number for the patient. The participants will not known which arm of the study they will be assigned to. </concealment>
    <sequence>Patients will be assigned a number through an online random number generator, which will then link them to either arm of the study. </sequence>

    <statisticalmethods>Patients will be assigned a number through an online random number generator, which will then link them to either arm of the study. The aim is for equal numbers of participants in each arm of the trial. Logistic regression analysis is the chosen method for analysis of data from this trial. The binary factor will be (shoulder and neck) pain or no pain. Participant variables include: sex, age, weight, height and previous shoulder pathology. Procedure variables include general or regional anaesthesia and duration of surgery.
Sample size selection according to Power Calculation:
1. Estimated mean VAS with the use of an axillary roll is greater than or equal to 2
2. Estimated mean VAS without the use of an axillary roll is greater than or equal to 3
3. Standard Deviation: 1.5
4. Sample Size Alpha = 0.05 and B = 0.2
Thus, target sample size = 40 per group (allowing for a 10% drop out rate). Total sample size = 80.</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The AXILLARY project aims to explore the relationship between the use of an axillary roll during surgery performed in the lateral decubitus position and the presence or absence of post-operative shoulder and neck pain.  The sample population of this trial will be those patients who meet the eligibility criteria and who are to have an elective total hip replacement at selected site.  This project is a randomised controlled single-blinded trial where participants will be assigned to the group who receive an axillary roll, or the group that does not.  Patients will then be asked to rate their shoulder and neck pain post-operatively on two separate occasions. The results of this project will provide scientific evidence to support or not support the use of an axillary roll during surgery in the lateral decubitus position.</summary>
