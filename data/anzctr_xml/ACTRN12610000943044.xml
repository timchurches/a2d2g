  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants in the intervention group will undergo 3 months of combined resistance and aerobic training for three days/week under the supervision of an exercise physiologist and/or post-graduate students enrolled in a clinical exercise science course. The sessions will begin with 5 minutes warm-up followed by 50 minutes of exercises (30 minutes aerobic and 20 minutes power), and 5 minutes of cool-down.
Aerobic exercise intensity will be at 70-75% of predetermined peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak). Resistance exercise: 3 different exercises using large muscle groups (chest, back, legs and shoulders), and each exercise will be performed for three sets, 8-12 repetitions. For each session, weights will be adjusted according to the current capacity of the individual. Participants will rest between sets for 120 seconds and between exercises for 120 to 150 seconds. Blood sugar levels (BSL) will be monitored by checking the levels before and after each session.</interventions>
