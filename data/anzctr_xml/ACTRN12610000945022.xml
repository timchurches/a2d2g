  <interventions>
    <interventions>minimally invasive stereotactic puncture and thrombolysis therapy (one intervention group): firstly, the target points was defined according to the computer tomography and mostly target points were chosen in the scan with the largest expansion of the haematoma. Puncture situs was measured and marked on head noticing to get out of the way of main blood vessel, then puncture needle of suitable length(Type YL-1) was fixed on the operative electric drill. The puncture needle was perforated into predetermined depth, then the probe core removed, hematoma drawn out gently by syringe (diluted by saline solution if blood thicken) until 1/3 of hematoma were removed, then hematoma was continuiosly liquefied by liquefacient(containing 20000U-40000U urokinase/2-3mL saline solution)for 2-4 days(3-5 times per day) until 90% hematoma drained.</interventions>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The purpose of this study is to judge the clinical value of minimally invasive stereotactic puncture and thrombolysis therapy (MISPTT) on acute intracerebral hemorrhage(ICH).
A randomized control clinical trial was undertaken by means of compare of Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS) score, postoperative complications(PC) and long-term outcome of 1 year postoperation with conventional craniotomy. We expect to verify whether MISPTT could displayed its  superiority in minute trauma, safety, and  improving long-term outcome.</summary>
