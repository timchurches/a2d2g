  <interventions>
    <interventions>Healthy volunteers not taking any regular medication, including herbal medicines, will be will be treated in a randomised order with a single dose of allopurinol (control; 600 mg), and with allopurinol combined with a single dose of aspirin (100 mg), with a single dose of HCT (25 mg) and with the combination, aspirin and HCT. 
All drugs will be administered orally. 
Urine (3 x 2 h sequential collections) and blood samples (3 mid-point blood samples) will be collected over 6 h. Blood and urine will be analysed for uric acid and plasma and urinary oxypurinol concentrations.
There will be a washout period of 1 week between each treatment.</interventions>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To determine whether taking aspirin and HCT concomitantly with allopurinol will affect the pharmacokinetics of allopurinol as determined by oxypurinol clearance and/or the pharmacodynamic endpoint, the plasma and urinary concentrations of urate.</outcome>
      <timepoint>4 study days, each with 3 timepoints for the collection of urine and blood for analysis. i.e. 12 blood and urines will be collected per subject over the entire trial.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Gout is an inflammatory condition caused by the deposition of urate crystals in tissues/joints. Allopurinol is a common and effective treatment to prevent gout. Gout predominantly affects the older population who are at risk for cardiovascular disease such as hypertension and heart attack. Low-dose aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide are used for the prevention of such cardiovascular events. Therefore, co-administration of allopurinol and aspirin and/or hydrochlorothiazide is common in older individuals. However, there has been no investigation of this combination of drugs with respect to control of urate concentrations in the body. This study will examine the interaction between allopurinol and aspirin and hydrochlorothiazide.</summary>
