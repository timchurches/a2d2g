  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This is a prospective, randomised study to ascertain if plaster slab immobilisation of the arm is equally acceptable to parents and patients as collar and cuff immobilisation for undisplaced supracondylar fractures (breaks) of the upper arm near the elbow. All children aged 18 months to less than 11 years, presenting to the Emergency Department who sustain this type of break of the upper arm, will be enrolled into the study and randomised to receive one of two methods of immobilisation.  Parents will be asked to keep a daily diary of analgesia use, child complaints or perceived problems with the mode of immobilisation. Followup will be 2 weeks post ED presentation, at which time the slab/collar will be removed and the supracondylar fracture xrayed and reassessed.  At this time a parent/patient satisfaction questionnaire will be completed. If significant tenderness and discomfort remain the arm will be immobilised again and reviewed again in 2 weeks in ED.</summary>
