  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is a pilot, multi-centered, randomized, clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of performing early Coronary Angiography (CAG) versus no early CAG in post-cardiac
      arrest patients without ST segment elevation. Safety will be assessed by evaluating the
      association of major adverse events (re-arrest, bleeding, pulmonary edema, hypotension, acute
      renal insufficiency, and pneumonia) with early coronary angiogram. Efficacy will be assessed
      by a composite endpoint of improved left ventricular regional and global function (both
      regional wall motion analysis and left ventricular ejection fraction) as measured by
      echocardiography prior to hospital discharge and favourable neurological function (Cerebral
      Performance Categories 1 or 2) at discharge.</summary>
