  <eligibility>
    <inclusivecriteria>1.)  All births in the study area that are between two hours and two days of age, whose caretakers confirm of intention to remain in the study areas for a minimum of six months thereafter, will be eligible for inclusion in this study.
2.)  Both singleton and multiple births are eligible for inclusion in this study and each infant will be provided with their own unique study identification number.
3.)  Infants will be included even if they were not identified during pregnancy surveillance.</inclusivecriteria>

    <allocation>Randomised controlled trial</allocation>
    <concealment>A master randomization sequence list will be prepared by off-site a priori.  The randomization lists will be used for individually packaging and labeling the vitamin A/placebo doses for each enrolled newborn. Two capsules will be packed in a blister pack, one for the dose and the second for the backup dose. The blister packing, shape, size and color of the vitamin A and placebo capsules will be similar. Labels will be printed with the site and subject ID. Each participant will be assigned to the next regimen number in sequence at enrollment.  

After becoming aware of a birth (when visiting the health facilities daily) or when notified of a birth by a key informant in the community, the Enrollment Research Assistant (ERA) will meet the newborn's parents between two hours and two days after birth. The ERA will do that either at the facility where birth as occurred or at the infant's home. The ERA will administer the enrollment consent form to mothers at this time if they were not identified to participate in the study through pregnancy surveillance.   If the  mother provides informed written consent to participate in the study, the newborn will be screened for the eligibility and exclusion criteria and enrolled in the study. Enrollment information such as date of birth, multiple births, birth weight, sex, and timing of initiation of breastfeeding will be collected.  If the infant is eligible for enrollment, an identification number or a subject ID will be allocated and the vitamin A or placebo capsule administered.</concealment>
    <sequence>A randomization list will be prepared off-site, under the responsibility of the World Health Organization (WHO).  The method of sequence generation to be used is permuted block randomization.</sequence>
