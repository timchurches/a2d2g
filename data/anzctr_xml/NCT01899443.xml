Total hip and knee replacement patients - This study will select up to 20 high volume (&gt;275 cases annually) public and private hospitals across Australia. A random sample of c.2200 patients with diagnosis of osteoarthritis undergoing primary total hip or knee replacement surgery will be recruited.


Other interventions: Observation

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Primary total knee or total hip replacement surgeries are costly high volume procedures &amp;
      outcomes may be affected by surgical &amp; care processes &amp; individual patient characteristics.
      The primary hypotheses is that non compliance with recommended practice impacts patient
      outcomes (e.g. the likelihood of complications following surgery). The primary aims of the
      study are to evaluate the links between processes &amp; outcomes &amp; if possible develop a model
      that will improve patient outcomes &amp; reduce unnecessary practice variation whilst considering
      costs.</summary>
