             induction/re-induction regimens or patients of age = 65 with adverse cytogenetics who
             have received 1-3 previous induction/re-induction regimens. One of the (re-)induction
             regimens could be stem cell transplantation (SCT) for achievement of remission.
             Maintenance and consolidation (including SCT) may have been given, but are not counted
             as previous regimens.

          -  Bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies must contain &gt; 5 % leukaemic blast cells or
             patient must have biopsy-proven extramedullary AML, or patient's peripheral blood
             shows occurrence of leukaemic blast cells

          -  Patients must

               -  have never attained CR or CRi (primary refractory), or

               -  have failed initial induction therapy, and have attained CR or CRi after salvage
                  therapy(ies), and then relapsed within &lt; 6 months, or

               -  have attained CR or CRi after initial induction therapy and relapsed within &lt;12
                  months, and failed to respond to salvage therapy(ies), or

               -  have relapsed after the latest CR or CRi within &lt; 6 months

          -  Patients younger than 65 years should have received previous treatment with cytarabine

          -  Patients must have recovered from previous bone marrow and/or stem cell
             transplantation to a stage that the patient can tolerate the study treatment. There is
             no restriction on number of regimens or type of treatment administered for maintenance
             or consolidation during previous stages of the disease

          -  ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 - 2

          -  Pregnant and nursing patients

             treatment: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) must be = 45 % as measured by
             MUGA scan or 2D ECHO within 14 days prior to start of therapy. Either method is
             acceptable for measuring LVEF

          -  Applicable only for patients for whom an anthracycline is part of the selected control
             treatment: The patient should tolerate minimum one course of combination therapy

          -  Any anti-leukaemic agents within the last 3 weeks. Hydroxyurea,however, is allowed for
