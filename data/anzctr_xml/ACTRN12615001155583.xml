  <interventions>
    <interventions>A mixture of milk powder containing 1.3 g cow's milk and wheat flour is baked in the oven for 30 min at 180 degrees Celsius. Each 60 g bread contains milk powder equal to 1.3 g cow's milk. Breads prepared for placebo include exactly the same ingredients except milk powder. 
The placebo and cow's milk containing breads are supplied by the same manufacturer. 
Patients' adherence is monitored by weekly phone calls and also by charts documenting daily consumpted bread amount, side effects and accidental dairy product consumption. 


1. Active group: Receiving bread that contains 1.3 g baked milk, at least 60 g a day, for 12 months
2. Placebo group: Receiving bread with no milk, at least 60 g a day, for 12 months

    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>To evaluate tolerance induction by comparing following parameters at baseline, at 6 and 12 months of the study;
-skin prick test reactivity with raw cow's milk including different dilutions as 1/1, 1/100, 1/1000
-regulatory T cell proliferation response to raw cow's milk
-basophil activation test (CD63 expression) reactivity to raw cow's milk 
-milk, casein, beta lactoglobulin specific IgA/IgG4/IgE levels
All those parameters will be assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months of the study for all patients</outcome>

    <concealment>Double blind placebo controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) with 1.3 g baked milk powder containing bread will be performed at the baseline for all participants.
Patients with no reactions will be included to the study, randomly as active or placebo group (central randomisation by computer). Daily consumption of baked milk will be provided during 12 months of period. The patients consuming bread with baked milk or with no milk will be assessed 6 and 12 months later with DBPCFC raw cowâ€™s milk.
Patients continuing milk free diet will be assessed 6 and 12 months later with bread containing 1.3 g baked milk.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Cows milk allergy is the important cause of food related anaphylaxis during childhood. It is classified under IgE related and non IgE food allergy. Although general aspect is strict avoidance of dairy product consumption, accidental reactions like anaphylaxis occur.  Besides, strict avoidance of cows milk products in this age group of 6 months to 4 years compromise the physical development of those children. Some of them may tolerate processed dairy products. Baking is one of the methods for processing cows milk to break the 3-D construction and decrease the allergenicity. Previous studies report that 65-80 % of cows milk allergic children may tolerate baked milk. 
Patients who admitted to our outpatient clinic with allergic symptoms developing after cows milk consumption with IgE related mechanisms verified by either positive specific milk IgE or skin prick test, aged between 6 to 36 months will be included. Double blind placebo controlled (DBPC) baked milk challenge will be performed then patients who tolerate baked milk will be randomized. Active group will consume baked milk while the placebo group will consume milk free bread for 12 months, then  DBPC milk challenge tests will be performed. Children unable to tolerate baked milk at the beginning remain free of cows milk during the study. Immunologic parameters will be noted in all stages and evaluated at the end of the study. Although partial tolerance (allergic reaction with higher allergen doses) develops during the process it will be our secondary income to decrease anaphylaxis risk.
