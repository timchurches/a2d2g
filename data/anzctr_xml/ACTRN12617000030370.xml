    <endpoint />
    <statisticalmethods>Analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) principal (patients analysed according to the treatment to which they were randomised). The primary outcome will be compared using the inverse-variance weighted hazard ratio of the individual trials. A sensitivity analysis using a stratified log-rank test and an unadjusted stratified proportional hazards model (stratified by trial) test will also be performed. The comparison will be one based on superiority. In the event that the 95% CI for the hazard ratio crosses the null, if the one-sided upper 95% CI for this hazard ratio does not breach the non-inferiority boundary of 1.10 then this will be interpreted as supporting evidence that the SIRT therapy is not appreciably worse than sorafenib. Analyses of secondary endpoints will be performed similar to the primary endpoint.

Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the following patients baseline characteristics:
*Age (&lt;65 years, &gt;=65 years),
*Gender (male, female)
*ECOG performance status  (0,1) 
*Tumour size (&lt;= 50% of liver, &gt; 50% of liver),

*BCLC stage (B1 and B2, B3 and B4 and C; using Bolondi Criteria),
*Prior HCC treatment (yes, no),
*Hepatitis status (B, C, both),
*Unilobal versus bilobal disease,
*Single focal versus multifocal disease,

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study is an individual patient prospective meta-analysis, from two randomised open label phase III efficacy trials examining survival benefits as their primary outcome, SARAH and SIRveNIB, both which have completed recruitment and are currently in follow-up . To date, no results regarding the survival by randomised group have reported. The aim of this meta-analysis is to improve the strength of the evidence on the benefit or potential non-inferiority of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), also known as radioembolisation, compared to Sorafenib with respect to overall survival. </summary>
