  <interventions>
    <interventions>The intervention is based on the work of Kirk Strosahl who developed the therapy known as Focussed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (FACT) which is modified Acceptance and Commitment therapy for primary care. 
Each patient will get a work/love/play assessment which checks on a 1 to 10 scale for  how  daily life (work, study etc.) is going, love as in friends, love as in intimates, love as in family and play (recreation hobbies etc.). There will also be open ended questions on exercise, smoking, sleep, recreational drugs,  alcohol, gambling issues in self or family, violence, citizenship/community involvement and if there is a spiritual component to their lives. Any deficit in these aspects of life will be used as a target for behavioural change using a task sheet for homework. The patients will be asked if they can describe the emotional pain that is behind their distress (these are usually in the domains of being unlovable or helpless. They will then be shown the mindful anchor based on Kirk Strosahls Inside this moment book. This is a five step mindfulness technique designed to enable the patient to be present with their emotional pain and to stop resisting it. They may find it distressing to be asked to make behavioural changes in their lives (their task sheet) and will be advised that when the pain arises they should use the mindful anchor. 

The persons who will do the FACT interview will either be GPs with a FRNZCGP or equivalent, a medical graduate with some training in FACT (either the Goodfellow Unit online course) or equivalent or a psychologist with similar training in FACT. The intervention will be delivered once on the day of enrolment  and face to face where possible. Where this is not possible it will be done either by phone or by a later face to face appointment. It will be done with individuals not groups. The outcomes will be measured one week after the intervention is given. The duration of the intervention will be about 20 to 30 minutes with an additional 10 minutes to complete the study documentation forms and questionnaires. The interviews will be done in a GP clinic in a separate room.

    <sequence>We will use caseweaver.co.nz  which is software that allows for blinded
and concealed randomisation once the baseline data has been entered. Patients are randomised to the control group or treatment arm(s) by
way of the standard built-in random number generator on the server.
This produces a random number between zero (assignment to the
control group) and the number of treatment arms (assignment to the
intervention arm). Each time the application launches, the random
number generator is initialized with a random value, which is obtained
from the system clock.

    <statisticalmethods>The analysis will be done by intention to treat analysis. Categorical outcomes will be
expressed using counts (percentages) and compared between treatment groups
using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables were expressed using mean
(standard deviation) and compared between groups using an analysis of variance.
The secondary outcome of GAD will be expressed in medians and compared
between groups using the MannWhitney U test. The multivariate models for
the dichotomous outcomes will be evaluated using logistic regression to calculate
odds ratios (which will be converted to risk ratios using the formula of Zhang)
with confidence intervals. The continuous outcomes will be analyzed using multiple
linear regression. All multivariate models controlled for age and gender
(and the baseline levels  for the primary outcome of PHQ 8). A two-tailed p
value&lt;0.05 will be  considered to be significant.
