  <interventions>
    <interventions>The program will offer a 12 month behavior intervention using a Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) framework. 
The intervention will be delivered by one or more of the following health professionals: neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, speech therapist and/or psychiatrist. As the intervention is individualised, therapists relevant to each individual's goals will be included.  Therapists will be a mix of clinicians with varied degrees of experience, All therapists will receive supervision from an international expert in PBS provision through group and individual supervision.

Positive Behaviour Support aims to decrease problem behaviour by increasing quality of life. The aim of this approach is to make meaningful changes in the environment working with natural supports and help individuals to learn new skills and competencies so that problem behaviours  become unnecessary. Essential to these strategies are i) the identification of valued outcomes by the individual and other stakeholders, ii) identification of the people in the individual's life who can assist them in attaining those outcomes, iii) identify the barriers to attaining those outcomes and iv) put in place strategies or environmental changes designed to improve the quality of life for the individual receiving support. 
Structured flexibility: This intervention is invidualised and context-sensitive. It utilises a hypothesis-testing approach, and requires ongoing input. This framework is used flexibly rather than prescriptively. Clinicians are welcome and encouraged to draw from other evidence-based paradigms to enrich their intervention approach. For example, motivational interviewing, CBT, acceptance and commitment therapy, and others.

Successful achievement of goals will be measured using Goal Attainment Scaling. Review of goal attainment will occur on completion of intervention.

The number and frequency of sessions will be individualised. It is anticipated that participants will receive a session frequency of between 1 and 8 sessions per month, and an intervention duration of between 3 and 12 months, depending on the level of support required and number of therapists involved. Sessions will be provided to participants in their own homes or at our consulting suits in Hawthorn (Melbourne, Victoria). For participants who reside more than one hour from Melbourne, telehealth options will also be made available (e.g. Skype, phone calls). 

Any materials provided to participants as part of the intervention will be individualised and developed as part of the intervention process. Therefore, there are no pre-specified materials to be reported. As part of the trial we are developing training materials based on the supervision sessions and drawing together existing PBS materials.
In regards to treatment fidelity, adherence to the framework will be monitored via a range of methods including: audio and video taping of 10-20% of sessions for review by a PBS expert. Regular supervision meetings with a PBS expert including feedback from the session reviews. After every clinical session, therapists will complete a treatment integrity checklist to identify which PBS approaches were used within each session, Therapists will self-rate the quality of their sessions. These checklists and ratings will be used to identify areas clinician's require additional supervision in.

    <comparator>Wait-list control group. 

Participants in the wait-list group will commence the intervention 12 months after the date they were randomized. 

During this 12 months, participants will receive whatever treatment they choose to seek  this may include no treatment or treatment from a GP (including medication), psychologist, psychiatrist, occupational therapist or speech pathologist.

Intention to treat analyses will be carried out, meaning that whether or not participants remain in the trial we would endeavour to follow them up.

Finally, to examine predictors of successful response to intervention, random effects regressions will be employed to model relationships between outcome measures (OBS and secondary measures) and variables of interest including the nature and severity of BoC on OBS, time since injury, psychiatric history and baseline family function on FAD).</statisticalmethods>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Behaviours of concern (BoC) following acquired brain injury (ABI) including aggression, agitation and sexual inappropriateness  present significant challenges for the person with ABI, their families, service providers and wider society. These behaviours often result in social isolation and dislocation from accommodation, and represent a significant source of stress to caregivers over many years following injury.  

Over the past 30 years, there has been a gradual shift towards a focus on modifying the antecedents as opposed to the consequences of behaviour in individuals with ABI. This shift has been led by Mark Ylvisaker and Tim Feeney, through their development of a Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) intervention for  people with brain injury and BoC (Feeney &amp; Ylvisaker, 1995, 2006; Ylvisaker, et al., 1998; Ylvisaker, et al., 2003; Feeney 2010). Although the principles underlying the PBS framework reflect current standard best practise, there has been no previous controlled evaluation of a PBS intervention in adults with BoC after ABI. This study will be the first controlled trial of a PBS intervention for BoC in adults with ABI. The creation of this evidence will underpin more efficient and effective interventions and better coordinated care for individuals with ABI and BoC.
This project aims to develop, implement and evaluate the efficacy of a Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) model of intervention for individuals exhibiting BoC following ABI which reduces or minimises BoC.
It is hypothesised that:
*participants receiving the 12-month PBS intervention will show a greater reduction in frequency and severity of BoC on the Overt Behaviour Scale  (OBS) (Primary outcome) than a treatment as usual waitlist control group monitored over the same period
*the reduction in BoC on the OBS will be maintained at 12-month follow-up.
* relative to treatment as usual waitlist controls, participants receiving the 12-month PBS intervention will show a greater increase in community participation, and in quality of life, a greater reduction in attendant care support costs, a greater reduction in score on the Care and Needs Scale, in medication use, in alcohol and drug use, in anxiety and depression symptoms and improvement in family functioning.
*The improvements on secondary outcomes will be maintained at 12-month post-intervention follow-up. </summary>
