  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The ENAR® therapy device is said to combine Western biofeedback with Eastern energy medicine. It is an emerging technology which uses a varying frequency waveform similar TENS, and it alters its resultant frequency spectra according to areas of greater skin resistance. This pilot study investigates the effects of ENAR, TENS and a Sham protocol on 24 non-complicated, chronic neck pain sufferers is conducted.</summary>
