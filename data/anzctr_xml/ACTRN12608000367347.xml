  <interventions>
    <interventions>The treatment aims to target the pathogenesis of keratoconus by stimulating collagen cross linking in the cornea using ultra violet light (UVA) and the photosensitiser riboflavin. The process involves stimulating covalent bonds between corneal collagen fibrils, aiming to improve the mechanical rigidity of the cornea and increase its resistance to the ectatic process.

The procedure will be conducted in a sterile procedure room in the Department of Ophthalmology, Greenlane clinical centre by a registered Ophthalmologist.

1.	Eye selection based on initial work up and randomisation strategies
2.	Insertion of a lid speculum
3.	Instillation of tetracaine 1% and/or oxybuprocaine 0.4% in the treatment eye. 
4.	The central 7 mm of the cornea will be mechanically removed using a blade.
5.	Instillation of riboflavin drops q. 5 mins , starting 5 mins prior to the treatment procedure (2-4 drops of 0.1% solution 10 mg riboflavin-5-phosphate in 10 mls dextran-T- 500 solution)
6.	Commencement of UVA light irradiation using a UVA double diode 370 nm, located 10-12 mm in front of the corneal apex to obtain radiant energy of 3 mW/cm² or 5.4 J/ cm² (monitored via a potentiometer/ UV power metre). A Irradiation time of 5 minutes will be repeated 5 times (For a total of 30 minutes), with the lamp being switched off and instillation of the riboflavin drops between each 5 minute irradiation occurring.
7.	During the procedure balanced salt solution will be instilled every 2 minutes to moisten the cornea.
8.	Upon completion of the procedure the eye will be flushed with balanced salt solution.
9.	Following the procedure slit lamp examination will be performed
10.	A bandage contact lens will be inserted (To improve comfort for the patient while healing occurs)
11.	Prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotic ointment (chloramphenicol 0.5% minims) will be instilled and dispensed to the patients.

Patients will be reviewed at day 1, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 and 6 months.</interventions>

    <concealment>1.	The subject will be invited into the Department of Ophthalmology’s University unit situated in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Ophthalmology, Greenlane Clinical Centre, and an explanation of the study and the procedures involved will be given using lay language. The participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the study. Each participant will be provided with an individual study number.

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>This study will investigate the changes that occur in the cornea following collagen cross linking. Recent studies have demonstrated that this procedure is effective in reducing the progression of keratoconus, however very little is known about the microstructural changes that occur during this procedure. This study aims to investigate both the clinical outcomes of this procedure (for example vision and corneal shape (topography)); as well as the cellular changes that occur in the cornea. This information will allow us to better understand the procedure and its outcomes, hence allowing us to identify the patients that are most likely to benefit.</summary>
