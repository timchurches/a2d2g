  <interventions>
    <interventions>Intervention:

'Rehacom' computer-based cognitive retraining software (Hasomed): 
This is designed to train attentional, memory and other cognitive functions through visually-based tasks which are graded in difficulty (rather like simple computer games). This involves 16 training sessions (45 minutes each, 2 training sessions per week) facilitated by the principal investigator and co-investigator (both registered Clinical Psychologists in New Zealand) over an 8 week period. The Rehacom software is designed to systematically record and save participanmts scores and progress through the different stages of each training procedure.</interventions>
    <comparator>This will be a pre-intervention assessment (Time A) - intervention - post-intervention assessment design (Time B), with each participant serving as his/her own control. Standardised neuriopsychological tests will be used so that participants performances can be compared to normative reference data (stratified for age). Prior to the intervention (the Rehacom computer-based training), an initial cognitive assessment will be carried out at the point of study entry and a repeat assessment of cognitive functioning will be carried out 3 weeks later to ascertain the stability of cognitive funcitoning for the TBI clients prior to carrying out the computer training intervention.
For the above reasons it has been determined that a control group will not be needed in this study.</comparator>

  <outcomes>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Difference between mean performance on standardised cognitive tests (as a group) from the pre-intervention stages to early post-intervention stages.

Cognitive tests will be administered, including standardised and well validated, reliable tests of attention and concentration, and psychomotor speed (Digit Symbol Coding Test, Digit Span Test, Symbol Search Test, Test of Everyday Attention), frontal 'executive' functions (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System), and memory (California Verbal Learning Test and Rey Complex Figure Test).</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. At the point of participants agreeing to enter the study, then again at 2-3 weeks later (i.e., one week prior to the intervention), and again at the final timepoint (one week after intervention completion).</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <primaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Stability of cognitive outcome post intervention as indicated by difference between mean performances on cognitive tests (as a group) immediately after the intervention and six months post-intervention.

      <timepoint>2. One week post-intervention and six months post-intervention</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>1. Differences between means (as a group) within each of the domains of the Quality of Life in Acquired Brain Injury (QOLABI) from pre-intervention to early post-intervention, and from early post-intervention to 6 months post-intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>1. One week prior to commencing the intervention, again one week post intervention (note, the intervention will take 8 weeks per client), and again six months post-intervention to determine any changes in quality of life.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>2. Differences between means (as a group) for anxiety and depression subscales of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) from pre-intervention to early post-intervention, and from early post-intervention to six months post-intervention.</outcome>
      <timepoint>2. One week prior to commencing the intervention, again one week post intervention (note, the intervention will take eight weeks per client), and again six months post-intervention to determine the stability of mood.</timepoint>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>The aim of the study is to detmine the effect of clinician-facilitated cognitive retraining (using 'Rehacom' computer software) of attention, concentration and speed of information processing on cognitive and emotional outcomes,  and quality of life, for clients with traumatic brain injuries (TBI) in the post-acute stage following their injury (i.e., more than 6 months post-injury). Training sessions will be spread over 8 weeks, with 2 sessions per week. Outcome will be determined by performance on standardised cognitive tests of attention, speed of processing, memory and frontal executive functions (ie initiation, flexibility of thinking, ability to inhibit impulsive responses), which will be given before (2 times) and after (2 times) the training programme. We will also be investigating the effects of the computer-based training on participant's mood and quality of life through the use of self-report inventories.</summary>
