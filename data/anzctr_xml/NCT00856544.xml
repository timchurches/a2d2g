      <outcome>Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale at Baseline, Month 1, 3, and 6 - FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire. Participant scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as 4 minus the participant's response. The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). A higher score reflected an improvement in the participant's health status.</outcome>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state ("confined to bed"). Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile.

    <summary>This Phase 3 study is intended to provide evidence that CP-690,550 dosed 5 mg BID and 10 mg
      BID is safe and effective when used in combination with a variety of traditional disease
      modifying antirheumatic drugs in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is intended to
      confirm the benefits of CP-690,550 in improving signs and symptoms and physical function that
      were observed in the Phase 2 rheumatoid arthritis studies.</summary>
