  <interventions>
    <interventions>Consumption of a high-fat (&gt;45%) and low-fat (&lt;20%) diet both over a 4 week period, with a compulsory 2 week wash-out period in between. Specific high-fat foods, including butter, baked goods, dressing, cheese, chocolate and full-fat diary were delivered to all subjects during the high-fat intervention. Fat intakes (in grams per day) were calculated from Energy Requirements based on age, height, weight, gender and Physical Activity Level (PAL) to constitute 45% total energy intake. For the low-fat diet, subjects were advised by a Nutritionist which foods they were not allowed to consumed including all discretionary fats (oils, lard, butter), full-fat dairy, baked goods, high-fat meats (duck, salami) and what foods they should eat when dining out, i.e., tomato based pasta dishes, or lean meats (chicken / fish). To ensure compliance, weekly diet records were collected from all subjects, whom were informed over how to correctly fill in a diet record by a Nutritionist. Foods were delivered to subjects on a weekly basis, and this is when diet records were also collected.</interventions>

      <outcome>Changes in taste sensitivity to oleic acid, a common fatty acid in the food supply, via the measurment of taste thresholds</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline before both intervention periods, and a week 4 of both intervention periods.</timepoint>
    </primaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in diet, i.e., a reduction in fat consumption on the low fat diet, and an increase in fat consumption on the high fat diet, in both absolute (g) and relative (% total energy) terms. All food records were entered into FOODWORKS and analysed using the AUSNUT 2007 database for foods, brands and supplements. Changes in dietary intake were measured as changes from baseline (that is before the intervention began).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline, before both intervention periods, and during each week of each dietary trial.</timepoint>
    </secondaryOutcome>
    <secondaryOutcome>
      <outcome>Changes in fat perception, that is the ability to detect differing concentrations of oil (0, 2, 6 and 10%) in a food matrix (custard).</outcome>
      <timepoint>At baseline and during week four of both dietary interventions.</timepoint>

    <concealment>Subjects were recruited into the study, and interviewed over the phone to see if they were eligible, i,e., non-smokers, free of diease. Subjects who passsed the phone screening were invited to the Sensory Laboratories at Deakin University, and asked to fill in the 3 factor eating questionnaire - to remove anyone with signs of an eating disorder. Subjects were then allocatted into one of 2 groups. GROUP 1: would receive the high- fat diet followed by the low-fat diet, and GROUP 2: would receive the low-fat diet followed by the high-fat diet. Subjects were allocated by drawing letters either A or B out of an envelope, A  would belong to GROUP 1 and B to GROUP 2.</concealment>
    <sequence>A predetermined number of letters were drawn up, 15 A and 15 B, and placed in a sealed envelope. Subjects were allocated itno one of the intervention groups dependent upin which letter was drawn.</sequence>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Previous studies from our laboratories, have reported variation in taste sensitivity to fatty acids (fats) in humans, and that these variations may be asociated with fat intake and the perception of fat in food, that is, the ability to detect fats in food. Based on this evidence, we were interested in looking at environmental influences (i.e., the intake of a high- or low-fat diet, and how it may influence taste sensitivity to fats, given that habituation of the taste system in response to exposure or deprivation of certain nutrients (sodium, monosodium glutamate), has been previously established. Determinants of fatty acid taste sensitivity are of particular interest, given that sensitivity appears to be associated with specific dietary behaviours (i.e., fat intake) which may be associated with obesity. We hypothesized that the taste system would habituate to environmental conditions, and that consumption of a high- or low fat diet would shift sensitivity, i.e., consumption of a high fat diet would decrease taste sensitivity to fatty acids, meaning that greater concentrations would be required for detection, and conversely, a low-fat diet would increase taste sensitivity</summary>
