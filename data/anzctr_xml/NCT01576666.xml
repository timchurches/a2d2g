    <summary>The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum dose of LDE225 and BKM120 that can be
      safely given together to patients and/or the dose that will be used in future studies. This
      study will also learn more about how the combination of these two investigational drugs may
      work for patients with certain cancers (specifically metastatic breast cancer, advanced
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, metastatic colorectal cancer and recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme).</summary>
