  <interventions>
    <interventions>Sixty patients presented with limb threatening diabetic foot infection were treated with a new local treatment (PEDYPHAR) based on natural product of honey bees (Royal Jelly)1% and panthenol 5%, in an adjusted alkaline ointment base, after good irrigation and cleansing with normal saline. The lesions were occluded with dressing.
Application of the ointment and the dressing was changed daily for the first week, then 3 times per week thereafter, 
Duration of intervention was 9 weeks, and all patients were followed up for a period of 6 months.</interventions>
