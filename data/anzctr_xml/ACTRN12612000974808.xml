  <interventions>
    <interventions>Participants will receive 12 weekly one hour one-to-one sessions of a support intervention for hearing voices (auditory verbal hallucinations) from a peer mental health worker who has had personal lived experience of hearing voices themselves. The intervention will involve buidling a shared understanding of the participant's experience of hearing voices and using this to inform how to respond to hearing voices and cope with this experience more effectively.  The intervention group will receive the intervention alongside treatment as usual (TAU) in the 3 month period immediately following randomisation, whilst the control group will receive the intervention after a 3 month TAU wait list period.</interventions>
    <comparator>Treatment as usual (wait list). The control group will receive the intervention after a 3 month treatment as usual wait list period. Treatment as usual will involve the person's usual mental health care which will oridinarily include prescription of antipsychotic medication, plus meetings with mental health workers and possible attendence at rehabilitative and recovery-oriented mental health service programmes. Participants in current receipt of formal psychological interventions will not be eligible to participate. Antipsychotic medication prescribing will be tracked in both conditions and chlorpromazine-equivalent dosages controlled for in analyses if needed.</comparator>

  <ethicsAndSummary>
    <summary>Hearing voices (auditory verbal hallucination) is a potentially distressing and disabling experience which often persists in spite of treatment with medication. This pilot study examines whether it is helpful for people who hear voices to receive assistance in coping with this experience from someone else who hears voices and has adapted to living with this experience.</summary>
